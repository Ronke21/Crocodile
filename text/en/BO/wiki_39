<text>North Sumatra () is a province of Indonesia located in the northern part of the island of Sumatra. Its capital and largest city is Medan on the east coast of the island. It borders Aceh to the northwest, Riau to the southeast, West Sumatra to the south, the Indian Ocean to the west, and the Strait of Malacca (with a maritime border with Malaysia) to the east. 

With a 2020 population around 14.8 million and mid-2023 estimate around 15.4 million, North Sumatra is Indonesia&#x27;s fourth most populous province and the most populous province outside of Java Island. At , North Sumatra is the third-largest province in area on the island of Sumatra behind South Sumatra and Riau. Major ethnic groups include the Malay, native to the east coast; several Batak groups, indigenous to the west coast and central highlands; the Nias people of Nias Island and its surrounding islets; and Chinese, Javanese, and Indian peoples, who first migrated to Sumatra during Dutch rule.

North Sumatra is home to the Toba supervolcano, located in what is now Lake Toba, which erupted 74,000–75,000 years ago, wiping out nearly all of humanity. The supereruption resulted in the creation of Lake Toba and was rated a VEI-8 eruption.

During Dutch rule, North Sumatra was administered under the &quot;Gouvernement van Sumatra,&quot; which governed the entire island of Sumatra out of Medan. In 1948, after Indonesian independence was proclaimed, Sumatra Province was divided into three sub-provinces, each of which had the right to regulate and manage its own affairs. April 15, 1948 was later designated as the anniversary of the Province of North Sumatra.

== History ==
=== Prehistoric era ===
Archaeological understanding of early North Sumatran peoples is limited compared to that of other nearby regions. Prehistoric relics in North Sumatra show that the oldest population may have been Austronesian or Melanesian. Archaeological evidence indicates that their dispersal took place in the Mesolithic era (Middle Stone Age). They spread to the eastern part of Indonesia, to the island of Papua, and to the west, to North Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. Early peoples in North Sumatra consumed mostly snails and clams, leaving large shell deposits sometimes referred to as (kitchen waste), some of which are still found as hills in Saentis, Hinai, Tanjung Beringin, along the Deli-Langkat shore, and on riverbanks.

In the second wave of migration from mainland Southeast Asia , the Young Malays or Deutero Malays settled on the coast. They mainly lived by fishing and by cultivating the marshy land for agriculture. Their villages were scattered along the big rivers that flow to the east coast of North Sumatra such as Besitang, Wampu, Asahan, and Barumun. Larger villages grew at the mouths of rivers and became centres of government. Relics of the Mesolithic era have been found in North Sumatra, including finely honed stone axes, bone tools, and painting materials.

Linguistic and archaeological evidence indicates that Austronesian speakers reached Sumatra from Taiwan and the Philippines through Borneo or Java about 2,500 years ago, and the Batak probably descended from these settlers. 

New genetic research has found that the Nias people also came from the Austronesian peoples, though their initial ancestors may have arrived earlier: ancestors of the Nias people are thought to have come from Taiwan through the Philippines 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. Ten years of research involving blood samples of 440 Nias people in 11 villages on Nias island show similarities between their Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA and that of Taiwanese and Filipino peoples.

=== Early historic era ===

The eastern coast of North Sumatra, bordering the Strait of Malacca, has been widely visited by Hindus and by Chinese traders for centuries since the founding of early &quot;Situs Kota Cina&quot; or Chinatown sites in Hamparan Perak . Barus, a trading port on the western coast of Tapanuli, attracted Middle Age era traders in search of camphor, which was popular in Ancient Egypt. In 1030, Rajendra Chola recorded the names of North Sumatran states he defeated in one expedition to conquer Srivijaya. States that he mentioned included Sriwijaya, Malayur, Kendara, and the Panai Kingdom. Furthermore, the Negarakertagama epic by Mpu Prapanca from the 14th century list countries found in North Sumatra, Pane, Haru, Mandailing, Tamiang, Lawas, and Barus, which were mainly defeated by the Majapahit.

The earliest kingdom that was present on the eastern coast of North Sumatra was the Aru Kingdom, which existed from the 13th to the 16th century CE. In its height, the kingdom was a maritime power and controlled the northern part of the Malacca strait. The kingdom was initially established as a Karo polity. The indigenous population practiced native animism and Hinduism. Starting in 13th century, some also practiced Islam. Aru&#x27;s capital was located close to present-day Medan and Deli Serdang. Its people are believed to have been descendants of the Karo people from the interior of North Sumatra.

An area near Lake Toba called Batakland (or the &quot;Batak Lands&quot;) housed kingdoms of Batak people. It was first mentioned in Zhao Rugua&#x27;s 13th-century &quot;Description of the Barbarous Peoples&quot;, which refers to a &#x27;Ba-ta&#x27; dependency of Srivijaya. The &quot;Suma Oriental&quot;, written in the 15th century, also refers to the &quot;Kingdom of Bata&quot; between Pasai and the Aru kingdom. The Batak mainly practiced animism and cannibalism and remained isolated from foreign culture and kingdoms like Srivijaya and Majapahit. The Toba people divided the Batak Lands into several independent kingdoms, which often entered into defensive alliances. Of the many kingdoms, Bakkara and their king or held the most sway due to customs and traditions which consider Bakkara the place of origin of the Batak people.

The Nias people on Nias Island remained isolated during its early era. Its people practiced agriculture and cultivation, made art carvings, and adhered to shamanist and pagan practices.

=== Kingdom, sultanate, and colonial era ===

By , there were several kingdoms on the east coast of Sumatra, namely the larger Nagur and Aru kingdoms and the smaller Panai and Batangiou kingdoms. To the west, in the hinterland of Tapanuli, another kingdom emerged: a Batak kingdom founded by descendants of Sisingamangaraja. This kingdom gradually expanded its influenced throughout Tapanuli to Angkola, Mandailing, and Dairi. The three largest kingdoms in North Sumatra in the sixteenth century were Nagur, the Batak kingdom under the rule of King Sisingamangaraja, and Aru. 

Wars between these three kingdoms made the region vulnerable to outside influences from Aceh, Melaka, Portugal, Siak, and Minangkabau. The Sultanate of Aceh worked to spread Islam across the eastern coast, and in the Padri War, succeeded in spreading Islam into the southern Tapanuli kingdom. As a result of this warfare and cultural shifts, the three big kingdoms split into several small kingdoms and sultanates, including Deli, Serdang, Asahan, Langkat Sultanate, Maropat, Lingga.

Malacca fell to the Dutch East India Company (the VOC) in 1641. Coastal areas of North Sumatra felt economic impacts as the VOC subsequently reduced the presence of trade in Malacca and shifted resources towards Batavia. Still, North Sumatra also saw an increase in Arab, Chinese and Indian traders. 

After Britain gained a position on the nearby island of Penang by establishing a trading post for the British East India Company (Britain&#x27;s first such post in the Far East) in 1786, the British traded heavily with the east coast of Sumatra. Prior to the nineteenth century, Dutch power was concentrated on the island of Java and parts of the Moluccas, the Dutch East India Company competed with the British East India Company for trade in the area, especially for pepper, with the two nations trying to obstruct the other&#x27;s trade efforts. In the nineteenth century, the Dutch began to focus more on to areas outside Java, including North Sumatra, driving out British influence. Dutch control was formalized with the handover of most of Indonesia in the 1814 Treaty of London, which was renewed in the 1824 Treaty of London. However, the UK maintained a presence in several places that were considered important for trade, including parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan.

During the Padri War, in the years prior to 1860, Dutch forces arrived in South Tapanuki at the request of a local leader to provide protection. The Siak sultan subsequently signed a treaty with the Dutch East Indies government recognizing Dutch authority over it and the sultanates of Asahan, Serdang, Deli and Langkat. The Dutch proceeded further into Batakland and North Sumatra, invading Toba, Karo Highland, Nias and Silindung with the help of Christian missionaries, such as Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen, who worked to Christianize the area. The Dutch invasion into Batakland met resistance by Sisingamangaraja XII, causing a guerilla war lasting 30 years until and Sisingmangaraja XII&#x27;s death in battle and a subsequent Dutch victory. Meanwhile, particularly after 1869, Dutch tobacco plantation activities expanded on the east coast, including the estab;ishment of Deli Maatschappij and &quot;London Sumatra&quot;, using land leased from the Malay sultans. As there was a worker shortage, the Dutch began importing labourers from Java, Southern China and Southern India. This first big wave of migration established substantial Javanese, Chinese, and Indian populations in North Sumatra that remain to this day. By 1874, the sultanates had been formally included within the Dutch East Indies, and in Deli, the sultan of Deli granted the Dutch sole rights over taxation and leases, in exchange for an annual pension. That year, the East Coast Residency was established.

On March 12, 1942, Japanese forces landed in Palubuhan Ruku on the east coast, and advanced on Medan. The advance force reported it had captured the town the next day. The main force followed on bicycles. There was some resistance from the Dutch forces, particularly around Pematangsiantar, but the last major town, Sibolga, fell on 15 March. During the Japanese occupation of North Sumatra, the leader of the Japanese Armed Forces was centred in Bukittinggi, moving the de facto capital out of the Dutch centre of Medan. The occupation lasted 3 years. In 1945 the Japanese occupation officially ended with Japan&#x27;s surrender in the Pacific and two days later Sukarno declared Indonesian Independence, beginning the four-year Indonesian War of Independence against the Dutch.

=== Independence and contemporary era ===


Beginning on 3 March 1946, there was a social revolution in East Sumatra. Across 25 &quot;native states&quot;, many sultanates were overthrown. Armed groups (Indonesian nationalists) conducted mass killings of the members of aristocratic families. To opportunistic militants (including Communist Party of Indonesia members Xarim MS and Luat Siregar), the revolutionary movement was seen as a means for East Sumatra to be freed from colonial rule and to join the larger Indonesian National Revolution. Participants of the revolution were believed to be provoked by leaders to kill aristocrats and create violence with three prime objectives: to eliminate the sultans and aristocrats (who were seen as Dutch allies), to seize their wealth (to fund the Indonesian independence campaign), and to eliminate the region&#x27;s feudal social structure. 

The Dutch authorities, working with the East Sumatra Union (&quot;Persatuan Sumatra Timur&quot;), which had been formed in 1938 by westernized Malay elites to reassert Malay and Simalungun ethnic interests, established the State of East Sumatra () as part of the planned United States of Indonesia. The state lasted from December 1947 to August 1950. In addition to the Dutch, the NST state was supported by Malay aristocrats, most of the Simalungun rajas, some Karo chieftains, and Chinese groups who felt that the revolution threatened their interests. Dr Tengku Mansu, a member of the Asahan royal family, was selected as head of state for the NST. While the Dutch wanted the NST to be seen as an orderly and progressive alternative to the republic, western-educated aristocrats saw it as a bastion for their own ethnic interests. Following the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in late 1949, the Dutch withdrew military support for the State of East Sumatra and its local authority began to collapse. The short-lived state was viewed with suspicion, and Dr Tengku Mansur entered into negotiations with Mohammad Hatta to reunify East Sumatra with the Republic of Indonesia in May 1950. Mansur surrendered authority to the republic and East Sumatra merged with Tapanuli to become the province of North Sumatra on August 15, 1950.

After Indonesian independence, at the first session of the National Committee of Regions (KND), Sumatra was divided into three sub-provinces: North Sumatra, Central Sumatra and South Sumatra. North Sumatra was an amalgamation of three administrative regions called Residencies: the Residency of Aceh, the East Sumatra Residency, and the Residency of Tapanuli. The publication of the &quot;Law of the Republic of Indonesia (R.I.) No. 10, Year 1948&quot; on April 15, 1948, formalized the division of these three provinces. The date of 15 April 1948 has been subsequently celebrated as the anniversary of North Sumatra Province.

Act R.I. No. 24 of 1956, promulgated on December 7, 1956, re-established an autonomous Aceh Province, independent of the Province of North Sumatra.

== Geography ==
The province of North Sumatra stretches across the island of Sumatra, between the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, with an area of 72,460.74 km2. It borders the province of Aceh to the northwest and Riau and West Sumatra to the southeast. The province contains a broad, low plain along the Strait of Malacca on which the provincial capital, Medan, is located. In the south and west, the land rises to the Bukit Barisan mountain range that runs the length of Sumatra; the mountains here surround Lake Toba, which was formed from the caldera of an ancient volcano. Several large islands in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Sumatra are currently part of North Sumatra, most notably Nias Island and the Batu Islands.

There are 419 islands in North Sumatra. The outer islands include the island of Simuk (the most westerly of the Batu Islands) and the island of Berhala in the Strait of Malacca. The Nias archipelago, located off the coast of western Sumatra in the Indian Ocean, consists of Nias Island and other much smaller islands in its vicinity. Its administrative centre is located at the city of Gunungsitoli on the northeast coast of Nias. The Batu Islands, just southeast of Nias, consist of 51 islands including three major islands: Pini, Tanahbala and Tanahmasa. Pulau Telo is their administrative centre on the small island of Situasi. Other islands in North Sumatra include Imanna, Pasu, Bawa, Hamutaia, Batu Makelele, Masa, Bau, Simaleh, Makole, Jake, and .

Half of the province is located on a high plateau that runs along the Bukit Barisan mountains, from central North Sumatra to the western coast. The tallest mountain in the province is Mount Sinabung in Karo Regency, at elevation around , the most active volcano in the region. Volcanic activities (cracks where steam, gas, and lava are emitted) were observed at the summit in 1912; recent documented events include an eruption in the early hours of 29 August 2010 and eruptions in September and November 2013, January, February and October 2014. Another volcano nearby is Mount Sibayak, also located in the Karo highland, sitting at an elevation of . Crystalline sulfur deposits on Mount Sibayak have historically been mined on a small scale, and seepage of sulfurous gases has caused acidic discolouration of its small crater lake.

Lake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred 69,000 to 77,000 years ago, estimated at VEI 8, that formed a climate-changing event. Recent advances in dating methods suggest more precise dating at 74,000 years ago. It is the largest-known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years. It has been accepted that the eruption of the Toba Caldera led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decrease in temperatures between , and up to in higher latitudes. Additional studies in Lake Malawi in East Africa show significant amounts of ash deposited by the Toba Caldera eruptions, despite a great distance from the area, but these studies offer little indication of a significant climatic effect in East Africa. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, the eruption killed most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central East Africa and India, affecting the human genome to the present day. More recent studies have cast doubt on this theory and found no evidence of substantial changes in population.

In North Sumatra, there are currently two national parks: the Gunung Leuser National Park and Batang Gadis National Park. According to the Ministerial Decree No. 44 of 2005, forest area in North Sumatra today covers , consisting of a 477,070-hectare (ha) Natural Reserve Area/Natural Conservation Area, 1,297,330 ha of protected forest, 879,270 ha of limited production forest, 1,035,690 ha of permanent production forest, and 52,7600 ha of production forest that can be converted to another status.

However, the figure above is only de jure. In reality, the forests are not as large as the figures suggest. A lot of the forests are damaged, due to encroachment and illegal logging. So far, over 206,000 ha of forests in Sumatra have experienced changes in function. As many as 163,000 ha were converted to plantations and 42,900 ha were transmigration areas.

== Governance ==

The administrative centre of North Sumatra is located in the city of Medan, governed by a governor. Earlier governments ruled all of Sumatra (1945-1950); and a North Sumatra Province that included Aceh (1950-1956). In 1956, Aceh split off to form a separate Aceh Province.

=== Administrative divisions ===
North Sumatra is currently subdivided into 25 regencies () and 8 autonomous cities (formerly municipalities). When originally created as a province with its current boundaries, it was composed of 10 regencies and 6 cities, but an 11th regency (Dairi Regency) was created on 23 September 1964. Fourteen more new regencies and two new cities were created between 1998 and 2008. All these are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with their official estimates for mid-2023. Regencies and cities are sub-divided into 455 districts, which in turn are further sub-divided into 6,110 villages (as of early 2024). Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People&#x27;s Representative Council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; or DPR) to create three new provinces from parts of the present North Sumatra: Nias Islands, Tapanuli, and East Sumatra; however since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities. The present regencies and cities are grouped for convenience below according to the projected new provinces within which they are situated:

====Nias Islands Region====

This region contains the substantial island of Nias and various small offshore islands, including the Batu Islands to the south. Originally it comprised a single Nias Regency (created on 7 November 1956), but on 25 February 2003 the southern part of the island (including the Batu Islands) was split off to form a separate South Nias Regency. On 29 October 2008 two new regencies - North Nias and West Nias - together with the city of Gunungsitoli, were split off from the remainder of Nias Regency.

Notes: (a) UU is an abbreviation from Undang-Undang (the Indonesia statute of law). &lt;br&gt;(b) South Nias Regency includes the Batu Islands.

The region include 124 smaller offshore islands - 87 in South Nias Regency (primarily the Batu Islands), 11 in West Nias Regency, 19 in North Nias Regency and 7 in Nias Regency.

====Tapanuli Region====

This region comprises the southwestern part of the province on the island of Sumatra, and equates to the former Tapanoeli Residency which existed at the time of independence (except for Nias Island). When the province was created, the region comprised three regencies (North Tapanuli, Central Tapanuli and South Tapanuli) and the city of Sibolga. A fourth regency - Dairi - was created on 23 September 1964 from part of North Tapanuli Regency. Two more new regencies were formed on 23 November 1998 - Mandailing Natal from part of South Tapanuli Regency, and Toba Samosir from another part of North Tapanuli Regency. The city of Padang Sidempuan was split off from South Tapanuli Regency on 21 June 2001. Two further regencies were formed on 25 February 2003 - Humbang Hasundutan from part of North Tapanuli Regency, and Pakpak Bharat from part of Dairi Regency. A new Samosir Regency was created from part of Toba Samosir Regency on 18 December 2003 (more recently, the remaining part of this regency was renamed Toba Regency). Another two regencies were created on 17 July 2007 - Padang Lawas and North Padang Lawas, both from parts of South Tapanuli Regency.
The region includes 60 small offshore islands - 24 in Mandailing Natal, 31 in Central Tapanuli (the largest being Mursala Island off Sibolga) and 5 in Sibolga City, plus 7 islands in the landlocked Lake Toba comprising 1 in North Tapanuli Regency (&quot;Pulau Sibandang&quot;), 5 in Samosir Regency and 1 in Humbang Hasundutan Regency.

====East Sumatra Region====

The region comprises the northeastern part of the province on the island of Sumatra, and equates to the former State of East Sumatra which existed at the time of independence. It now covers ten regencies and five cities, but originally there were just six regencies and the five cities. The new regency of Serdang Bedagai was formed on 18 December 2003 from part of Deli Serdang Regency, and the new regency of Batubara was formed on 2 January 2007 from part of Asahan Regency. Two further regencies were formed on 24 June 2008 - North Labuhanbatu and South Labuhanbatu - both from parts of Labuhanbatu Regency.

The region includes 38 offshore islands - 11 in Langkat Regency, 1 in Deli Serdang, 1 in Medan City, 2 in Serdang Bedagai, 1 in Simalungun, 2 in Batubara, 4 in Asahan, 8 (riverine islands) in Tanjungbalai City, 2 in North Labuhanbatu and 6 in Labuhanbatu Regency.

===National Electoral Districts===
The province comprises three of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. Each of the three districts elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council (for a total of 30 members from the province).
* The North Sumatra I Electoral District consists of 2 of the regencies in the province (Deli Serdang and Serdang Bedagai), together with the cities of Medan and Tebingtinggi.
* The North Sumatra II Electoral District consists of 16 regencies (Nias, South Nias, North Nias and West Nias; Samosir, Toba, North Tapanuli, Humbang Hasundutan, Central Tapanuli, South Tapanuli, North Padang Lawas, Padang Lawas and Mandailing Natal; Labuhan Batu, South Labuhan Batu and North Labuhan Batu), together with the cities of Sibolga, Padangsidempuan and Gunungsitoli.
* The North Sumatra III Electoral District consists of the remaining 7 regencies (Asahan, Simalungun, Dairi, Karo, Langkat, Pakpak Bharat and Batubara), together with the cities of Tanjungbalai, Pematangsiantar and Binjai. 

== Demographics ==
===Population===
North Sumatra recorded a population of 12,985,075 in the 2010 national census, making it the 4th most populous province in Indonesia, with a sex ratio of 99.59 men per 100 women. The 2015 Intermediate census gave a total of 13,923,262, while the 2020 census gave a total of 14,799,361, and the official estimate for mid-2023 was 15,386,640. The mid-2023 total comprised 7,721,314 males and 7,665,326 females, giving a sex ratio of 100.73 men per 100 women.

=== Migration ===
It was reported in January 2024 that a group of 140 Rohingya people, consisting mostly of women and children had landed in Indonesia and been directed by the military to the North Sumatra region. This has been one of several groups that have arrived in the area over the preceding months.

=== Ethnic groups ===

North Sumatra is a multi-ethnic province. The &quot;Malay&quot; people are regarded as the majority people of the east coast of the province, while the west coast of the province is mainly inhabited by the &quot;Batak&quot; (&quot;Pakpak&quot;, &quot;Angkola&quot; and &quot;Mandailing&quot; groups). The central region around &quot;Lake Toba&quot; to the northern &quot;Karo highland&quot; is predominantly inhabited by other &quot;Batak&quot; groups (&quot;Toba&quot;, &quot;Simalungun&quot; and &quot;Karo&quot;). The &quot;Nias&quot; people are indigenous to &quot;Nias Island&quot; and its surrounding islets. With the opening of tobacco plantations in East Sumatra during the colonial era, the colonial government employed many contract labourers for plantations, they were mainly &quot;Chinese, Javanese&quot; and &quot;Indian&quot; migrants, who were majority does not returned after end contract and decided to stay in North Sumatra. The rapid urbanisation in the province also attract neighbouring people from Aceh, Riau and West Sumatra, which is the &quot;Aceh&quot; and &quot;Minangkabau&quot; people presents.

Bataks make up 44.95% of the population, including the Batak Karo and Mandailing. The Javanese come second with 30.62%, the Malays add up to 5.92% and the ethnic Chinese comprise 5.75%. The Nias people make up around 4.10% and the rest are Minangkabau (2.66%), Acehnese (1.07%), ethnic Indian (1.00%) and other ethnic groups (1.15%)
The distribution of the tribes, clans, and ethnic groups in North Sumatra is as follows:
* Batak Toba : throughout North Sumatra, forming the majority in the Toba, Samosir, Humbang Hasundutan, and North Tapanuli Regencies.
* Batak Karo : mostly in the Karo Regency, Deli Serdang and Langkat Regencies, including Berastagi and Kabanjahe.
* Batak Mandailing: majority along the western coast: (South Tapanuli, Padang Lawas, Mandailing Natal, Central Tapanuli), and the rest in Medan, Padangsidempuan, Sibolga and Rantauprapat.
* Batak Pakpak : majority in Dairi Regency and Sidikalang.
* Batak Simalungun : majority in Simalungun and Pematangsiantar
* Batak Angkola : majority in North Tapanuli, Gunung Tua, North Padang Lawas, and South Tapanuli
* Malay : mostly in the east coast rurals, especially Langkat and Asahan.
* Nias : mostly in Nias Island (including Gunungsitoli), with a small population around the west coast.
* Javanese : mostly reside in east coast rural areas, and in west coast areas like Deli Serdang, Serdang Bedagai, Asahan and Labuhan Batu Regencies, and in urban communities like Medan and Tebingtinggi.
* Minangkabau people : mostly in Medan, Sibolga and Mandailing Natal.
* Indian : major east coast cities such as; Medan, Binjai, Tebing Tinggi, Pematangsiantar, Kisaran, Tanjungbalai and Deli Serdang.
* Acehnese people : Medan, Binjai up to northern parts such as Langkat.
* Chinese : major cities such as; Medan metropolitan area: (Medan, Binjai, Deli Serdang), Tanjungpura, Stabat, Tebing Tinggi, Tanjungbalai, Kisaran, Limapuluh, Rantauprapat, Pematangsiantar, Balige, Sibolga, Padangsidempuan, and Gunungsitoli.
=== Languages ===
As well as Indonesian, languages spoken in the province include various dialects of Batak languages (particularly around Lake Toba), Javanese (various regions in the east of the province, especially around Medan), Malay, Minangkabau and the Nias language (parts of Nias).

===Religion===
More than 95% of residents are either Muslim or Christian; the remainder are Buddhists, Hindus, or follow folk religions such as Confucianism, Parmalim, and Taoism. These are the recognized religions of North Sumatra:
* Islam: especially embraced by the Malays, Minangkabau, Javanese, Aceh, Mandailing, Angkola, partly Nias, and partly Batak Toba, Karo, Simalungun and Pakpak
* Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism): especially embraced by Batak Toba, Karo, Simalungun, Nias, Pakpak and partly Batak Angkola, partly Javanese, Chinese and Indian
* Buddhism: mainly embraced by Chinese in urban areas
* Confucianism, Taoism and Chinese folk religion: predominantly embraced by Chinese in urban areas
* Hinduism and Sikhism: especially embraced by Indian in urban areas, there are also small Batak Karo people that practising Hinduism in rural areas
* Traditional religion such as Parmalim/Pemena: embraced by most of the Batak tribe centred in Huta Tinggi, Laguboti district, Toba Samosir Regency

== Culture ==
North Sumatra hosts various ethnicities, religions and traditions, influenced by the Batak, Malay and Nias peoples, and other cultures such as Chinese, Indian and Javanese.

=== Music ===
The music that is usually played depends on the traditional ceremonies held, but is more dominant with the drums. As in the Coastal Ethnic (), there are musical instruments called &quot;Sikambang&quot;.
The Batak Toba, Pakpak and Simalungun tribes have a musical instrument called &quot;Gondang&quot; which is usually played during traditional ceremonies in marriage, death, and so on. Meanwhile, the Mandailing and Angkola Batak tribes have musical instruments similar to the gondang, namely &quot;Gordang Sambilan&quot;. The Malays in the East Coast have the same musical instruments as the Malays in general, such as the accordion, the Malay drum (kompang) and the violin. Meanwhile, in Tanah Karo, there are Kulcapi and &quot;Gendang&quot; musical instruments which are commonly used to accompany the &quot;Landek&quot; or &quot;Guro Guro Aron&quot; dance.

=== Architecture ===

In the field of fine arts that stands out is the traditional house architecture which is a combination of the results of sculpture and carving as well as the results of handicrafts. Traditional house architecture is found in various forms of ornament. In general, the shape of the traditional house building in the Batak traditional group symbolizes &quot;buffalo standing upright&quot; (). This is even clearer by decorating the top of the roof with buffalo heads.

The traditional house of the Batak Toba ethnic, Ruma Batak, stands strong and majestic and is still commonly found in Samosir and Lake Toba area. The Batak Karo traditional house looks big and taller than other traditional houses. The roof is made of palm fiber and is usually supplemented with smaller triangular roofs called &quot;ayo-ayo rumah&quot;, &quot;Jambur&quot; and &quot;tersek&quot;. With soaring multi-layered roofs, Karo&#x27;s house has a distinctive shape compared to other traditional houses that only have one roof in North Sumatra, there are still several villages in Karo highland that still reserve traditional house and buildings, like in &quot;Lingga&quot;. The shape of the traditional house in the Batak Simalungun area is quite attractive. The traditional house complex in &quot;Pematang Purba&quot; village consists of several buildings, namely the &quot;Rumah Bolon&quot;, &quot;Balai Bolon&quot;, drying rack, taboo hall of need, and mortar. The prominent Mandailing buildings are called &quot;Bagas Gadang&quot; (house of Namora Natoras) and &quot;Sopo Godang&quot; (customary consultation hall).

Malay traditional houses in North Sumatra are not much different from Malay houses in other provinces, only the green and yellow color is more dominant.

=== Dances ===
The traditional dance repertoire includes various types. Some are in the form of sacred dances and some are solely for entertainment. In addition to traditional dances which are part of traditional ceremonies, sacred dances are usually danced by dayu-datu. Included in this type of dance are teacher dances and stick dances. Datu danced while swinging a magic stick called Tunggal Panaluan.

Profane dance is usually a young social dance that is danced at a happy party. Tortor is danced at the wedding ceremony. Usually danced by the audience including the bride and young people.

<text>Critique is a of disciplined, systematic study of a written or oral discourse. Although critique is frequently understood as fault finding and negative judgment, it can also involve merit recognition, and in the philosophical tradition it also means a methodical practice of doubt. The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the Enlightenment critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.

The term &quot;critique&quot; derives, via French, from the Greek word (), meaning &quot;the faculty of judging&quot;, that is, discerning the value of persons or things. Critique is also known as major logic, as opposed to minor logic or dialectics.

== Critique in philosophy ==
Philosophy is the application of critical thought, and is the disciplined practice of processing the &quot;theory/praxis problem&quot;. In philosophical contexts, such as law or academics, critique is most influenced by Kant&#x27;s use of the term to mean a reflective examination of the validity and limits of a human capacity or of a set of philosophical claims. This has been extended in modern philosophy to mean a systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a concept, a theory, a discipline, or an approach and/or attempt to understand the limitations and validity of that. A &quot;critical perspective&quot;, in this sense, is the opposite of a dogmatic one. Kant wrote:

Later thinkers such as Hegel used the word &#x27;critique&#x27; in a broader way than Kant&#x27;s sense of the word, to mean the systematic inquiry into the limits of a doctrine or &quot;set&quot; of concepts. This referential expansion led, for instance, to the formulation of the idea of social critique, such as arose after Karl Marx&#x27;s theoretical work delineated in his &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1859), which was a critique of the then-current models of economic theory and thought of that time. Further critique can then be applied after the fact, by using thorough critique as a basis for new argument. The idea of &quot;critique&quot; is elemental to legal, aesthetic, and literary theory and such practices, such as in the analysis and evaluation of writings such as pictorial, musical, or expanded textual works.

== Critique vs criticism ==
In French, German, or Italian, no distinction is drawn between &#x27;critique&#x27; and &#x27;criticism&#x27;: the two words both translate as &quot;critique&quot;, &quot;Kritik&quot;, and &quot;critica&quot;, respectively. In the English language, according to philosopher Gianni Vattimo, &quot;criticism&quot; is used more frequently to denote literary criticism or art criticism, that is, the interpretation and evaluation of literature and art; while &quot;critique&quot; may refer to more general and profound writing as Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. Another proposed distinction is that &quot;critique&quot; is never personalized nor &quot;ad hominem&quot;, but is instead the analyses of the structure of the thought in the content of the item critiqued. This analysis then offers by way of the critique method either a rebuttal or a suggestion of further expansion upon the problems presented by the topic of that specific written or oral argumentation. Even authors that believe there might be a distinction suggest that there is some ambiguity that is still unresolved.

==Critical theory==

Marx&#x27;s work inspired the &#x27;Frankfurt School&#x27; of critical theory, now best exemplified in the work of Jürgen Habermas. This, in turn, helped inspire the cultural studies form of social critique, which uses cultural products and their reception to record and inspire change regarding wider social ills such as racism or gender bias. Social critique has been further extended in the work of Michel Foucault and of Catholic philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre. In their different and radically contrasting ways, MacIntyre and Foucault go well beyond the original Kantian meaning of the term &quot;critique&quot; in contesting legitimatory accounts of social power. Critique as critical theory has also led to the emergence of critical pedagogy, exemplified by Paulo Freire, bell hooks, and others.

<text>The snailfishes or sea snails (not to be confused with invertebrate sea snails), are a family of marine ray-finned fishes. These fishes make up the Liparidae, a family classified within the order Scorpaeniformes.

Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans, including the oceans in between, the snailfish family contains more than 30 genera and about 410 described species, but there are also many undescribed species. Snailfish are found at depths ranging from shallow coastal waters to more than , including in seven ocean trenches.

==Taxonomy==
The snailfish family, Liparidae, was first proposed by the American biologist Theodore Gill in 1861. The 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; classifies this family within superfamily Cyclopteroidea, part of the suborder Cottoidei of the order Scorpaeniformes. Other authorities do not recognise this superfamily and classify the two families within it, Cyclopteridae and Liparidae, within the infraorder Cottales alongside the sculpins, within the order Perciformes. An osteological analysis found that the genus &quot;Bathylutichthys&quot; was intermediate between the Psychrolutidae and the two families making up the Cyclopteroidea, meaning that those two families would not be supported as a superfamily within the Cottoidei.

== Molecular biology ==
Species of deep-sea snailfish have been studied and compared to other ray-finned fishes (also known as teleosts) to analyze their adaptions to deep-sea conditions. The genomes of both the Yap hadal snailfish and Mariana hadal snailfish have been found to contain an abundance of the &quot;fmo3&quot; gene, which produces the trimethylamine &quot;N&quot;-oxide (TMAO) protein stabilizer. Analysis of Yap hadal snailfish reveals a loss of olfactory receptors and gain of taste receptors, possibly due to the fairly restricted availability of food in the deep-sea. Additionally, perhaps due to lack of light in the deep sea, the Yap genome includes fewer copies of crystallin genes, which encode proteins that sense light and assist in focused vision, in comparison to other teleosts. Meanwhile, Mariana hadal snailfish have lost several photoreceptor genes, decreasing their vision capabilities (especially in terms of color), and have completely lost the &quot;mc1r&quot; pigmentation gene, rendering them colorless. Mariana hadal snailfish also have adjusted to pressure due to a mutation in &quot;bglap&quot; which prevents cartilage calcification, revealed in their skulls. Further, their genome includes increased amounts of genes encoding enzymes for beta oxidation and transport proteins, thereby increasing membrane fluidity.

== Description ==
Snailfish have an elongated, tadpole-like shape. Their heads are large in comparison to their body and they have small eyes. Their bodies are slender but deep and they taper to very small tails. The extensive dorsal and anal fins may merge or nearly merge with the tail fin. Snailfish are scaleless with a thin, loose gelatinous skin which surrounds the spine and can vary in terms of size and shape between species. The gelatinous layer has a high water and low protein, lipid and carbohydrate content, therefore it can provide growth with low metabolic cost. This may aid species in avoiding predation and conserving energy, especially for deep sea snailfish who live in low energy conditions. Some species, such as &quot;Acantholiparis opercularis&quot;, have prickly spines as well. Their teeth are small and simple with blunt cusps. The deep-sea species have prominent, well-developed sensory pores on the head, part of the animals&#x27; lateral line system.

The pectoral fins are large and provide the snailfish with its primary means of locomotion, although they are fragile. In some species such as the antarctic &quot;Paraliparis devries&quot;i, the pectoral fins have an expanded somatosensory system, including a taste bud. The snailfish are benthic fish with pelvic fins modified to form an adhesive disc; this nearly circular disc is absent in &quot;Paraliparis&quot; and &quot;Nectoliparis&quot; species. Research has revealed that maximum depth of living can be a significant predictor for loss of the pelvic disk in certain species of snailfish. Based on phylogenetic analysis, this ancestral feature has been lost three separate times in Snailfish.

Snailfish range in size from &quot;Paraliparis australis&quot; at to &quot;Polypera simushirae&quot; at some in length. The latter species may reach a weight of , but most species are smaller. Snailfish are of no interest to commercial fisheries.

The deepest snailfish do not explode when brought to the surface, because they do not have a swim bladder. However, they do not survive capture, possibly due to molecular effects of depressurization. Many intact specimens have been retrieved in recent years for biochemical and anatomical study. Buoyancy without a swimbladder is due to gelatinous tissue and low-calcium bones [ref. 10].

==Occurrence and habitat==

Snailfish habitats vary widely. They are found in oceans worldwide, ranging from shallow intertidal zones to depths of more than in the hadal zone. This is a wider depth range than any other family of fish. They are strictly found in cold waters, meaning that species of tropical and subtropical regions strictly are deepwater. They are common in most cold marine waters and are highly resilient, with some species, such as &quot;Liparis atlanticus&quot; and &quot;Liparus gibbus,&quot; having type-1 antifreeze proteins. It is the most species-rich family of fish in the Antarctic region, generally found in relatively deep waters (shallower Antarctic waters are dominated by Antarctic icefish).

The diminutive inquiline snailfish (&quot;Liparis inquilinus&quot;) of the northwestern Atlantic is known to live out its life inside the mantle cavity of the scallop &quot;Placopecten magellanicus&quot;. &quot;Liparis tunicatus&quot; lives amongst the kelp forests of the Bering Strait and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The single species in genus &quot;Rhodichthys&quot; is endemic to the Norwegian Sea. Other species are found on muddy or silty bottoms of continental slopes.

===Depth record===
Although most snailfish live no deeper than the bathyal zone (less than deep), some live at greater depths than any other fish. In 2008, a UK-Japan team discovered a shoal of &quot;Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis&quot; snailfish at a depth of in the Japan Trench. These were, at the time, the deepest living fish ever recorded on film. The record was surpassed by snailfish filmed in the Mariana Trench at depths of in 2014 and in 2017, and at in the Izu–Ogasawara Trench in 2023. The species in these deepest records are unknown and may be undescribed, but have been referred to as &quot;ethereal snailfish&quot;. The deepest-living described species is &quot;Pseudoliparis swirei&quot;, of the Mariana Trench, recorded at .

Snailfish (notably genera &quot;Notoliparis&quot; and &quot;Pseudoliparis&quot;) are the most common and dominant fish family in the hadal zone. &quot;Pseudoliparis swirei&quot; possesses multiple molecular adaptations to the intense pressures of a deep sea environment, including highest-known contents of TMAO [refs. 14, 24], pressure-tolerant cartilage, pressure-stable proteins, increased transport protein activity, higher cell membrane fluidity, and loss of eyesight and other visual characteristics such as color, as shown by genomic analysis. Because of biochemical restrictions, is likely the maximum depth possible for any vertebrate. The larvae of some hadal snailfish species may spend time in open water at relatively shallow depths, less than .

==Reproduction and life span==

Reproductive strategies vary extensively among snailfish species, though it is thought that many abyssal benthic snailfish spawn seasonally and for relatively long intervals. It appears that all species lay relatively large eggs (diameter up to ) and the number of eggs is species dependent. The larger size of eggs in hadal snailfish species indicates continuous spawning. Some species deposit their egg masses among cold-water corals, kelp, stones, or xenophyophores and males will sometimes guard the egg mass. At least one species, &quot;Careproctus ovigerus&quot; of the North Pacific, practices mouth brooding where the male snailfish carries the developing eggs around in his mouth. Some other species of the genus &quot;Careproctus,&quot; are parasitic, laying their eggs in the gill cavities of king crabs. The eggs put pressure on the crabs&#x27; gills which can cause the gill tissue to be damaged or die altogether. However, the survival of snailfish larvae has been shown to increase by the snailfish utilizing the crab host species as a way to care for and aerate their eggs. The eggs themselves are self-adhesive and tend to form masses that replicate the shape of the internal branchial chambers of crabs. Additionally, at least one species of snailfish that utilize the golden king crab as a host, &quot;Careproctus pallidus,&quot; has larvae with a lower energy content than normal for most marine fish. A possible explanation for starting life with less energy is due to the safety provided by the king crab, allowing the adult snailfish to not expend as much energy producing an energy-rich yolk sac. A different species, &quot;Careproctus rhodomelas&quot;, was found to be a batch spawner, laying multiple batches of large eggs multiple times throughout its lifetime.

After the eggs hatch, some species rapidly reach the adult size and only live for about one year, but others live for more than a decade. Otolith analysis (the investigation of snailfish ear bone) gives insight into longevity by seeing how it is broken into alternating translucent and opaque zones. This relays information about annual growth. By further examining the morphology of the deep-sea snailfish, it may be evident that these snailfish have adapted to their extreme environment by having a short life span compared to other organisms in the same hadal environment. Many species are located in hadal trenches, which are inherently high-disturbance areas, including lots of seismic activity which can trigger turbidity flows. Because of this, they live significantly shorter lifespans than shallower species.

Little is known about snailfish courtship behavior but males of &quot;Careproctus pallidus&quot; are believed to wiggle their bodies as attractive or aggressive display. It is thought that in an environment so dark, it is hard to find and win contests for a mate. Therefore, snailfish use hydrodynamic signals that are felt by the mechanosensory lateral line to communicate.

==Diet==
Larval snailfish feed on a mix of plankton, small and large copepods, and amphipods. The larval diet of three Beaufort Sea snailfish species contained 28 food categories, mainly copepods and amphipods.

Snailfish prey fall into six main categories: gammarid, krill, natantian decapods, other crustaceans, fish, and others. Size also affects snailfish diets; snailfish smaller than 50 mm primarily eat gammarids, while species larger than 100 mm primarily eat natantian decapods. Species larger than 150 mm have the highest proportion of fish in their diet. The largest snailfish species tend to be piscivorous.

With the Okhotsk snailfish (&quot;Liparis ochotensis&quot;), the ratio between food intake and body weight changes as the organism grows; it is also highly seasonally variable. When the local environment experiences an increase in shrimp and crangonidae numbers, there is also a subsequent decrease in decapods. There are also snailfish localized to the Terpeniya Bay that purely eat zooplankton, setting them apart from other snailfish.

The snailfish that live in the northern hemisphere also display a higher starvation tolerance, which may be due to the triglycerol and cholesterol levels in this species. The snailfish have different lipid concentrations depending on their habitat, making some of them better-suited for longer periods without feeding than others.

The ambush hunting methods employed by the Simushir snailfish (&quot;Polypera simushirae&quot;) are unique among snailfish. They have the ability to blend into the ground, waiting to surprise the next organism to wander into their path. The top prey for this species are fish, making up 97.7% of their overall food intake.

<text>The University of Parma (, UNIPR) is a public university in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. It is organised in nine departments. As of 2016 the University of Parma has about 26,000 students.

==History==
During the 13th-14th centuries there was an educational institution, &quot;studium&quot;, in Parma, but it was closed in 1387 by Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. The university was opened in 1412 by Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, and, although no papal bull was issued, the degrees were granted. In 1420 Filippo Maria Visconti closed it again.

Although there were several attempts to revive the university, it functioned only as a &quot;paper university&quot;, granting degrees without teaching. In 1601, the university was finally reopened by Ranuccio I Farnese, and the papal bill was given. It was a joint institution with a Society of Jesus, and a third of staff were teachers from a local Jesuit school, who taught in a separate building and by Jesuit curriculum. There were usually about 27-32 teachers and 300-400 students in the 17th century. Logic, natural history, mathematics and theology were taught by Jesuits and law and medicine by civil teachers. Among the most important Jesuits who taught in Parma should be mentioned Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Daniello Bartoli.

In 1768, Ferdinand I expelled Jesuits and the curriculum was modernized. Student protests resulted in closure of the university by Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, in 1831; only in 1854 did Louise Marie Thérèse of Artois re-open it. The university then comprised faculties of theology, law, medicine, physics and mathematics, philosophy, and literature, as well as schools of obstetrics, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine.

After the Risorgimento, the government of newly united Italy divided the universities of the country into two grades. In 1862, the University of Parma was declared grade B, its financing was reduced, and the quality of education degraded. It was equalized with grade A universities only in 1887.

<doc id="453605" wikidata="Q5211375" url="?curid=453605" title="Dallas Observer">
<text>Dallas Observer is a free digital and print publication based in Dallas, Texas. The &quot;Observer&quot; publishes daily online coverage of local news, restaurants, music, and arts, as well as longform narrative journalism. A weekly print issue circulates every Thursday. The &quot;Observer&quot; has been owned by Voice Media Group since January 2013.

The &quot;Observer&quot; is a member of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia. It has won dozens of national and regional awards for its journalism, including two first places for longtime columnist Jim Schutze in the 2017 AAN Awards. In 1995, the H.L. Mencken Writing Award went to columnist Laura Miller, who went on to become the mayor of Dallas after leaving the &quot;Observer&quot;. In 2007, two &quot;Observer&quot; reporters, Jesse Hyde and Megan Feldman, were named finalists in the Livingston Awards for Young Journalists.

== History ==
The&quot; Observer&quot; was started in October 1980 by partners Ken Kirk, Bob Walton, Jeff Wilmont, and Gregg Wurdeman as a weekly local arts and cinema review publication. In 1991, the &quot;Observer&quot; was bought by New Times Media. In 2005, New Times both acquired and adopted the corporate name of Village Voice Media. In September 2012, Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan, and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media&#x27;s papers and associated web properties from its founders and formed Voice Media Group.

<doc id="453608" wikidata="Q910576" url="?curid=453608" title="Sedoreoviridae">
<text>Sedoreoviridae (formerly Reoviridae) is a family of double-stranded RNA viruses. Member viruses have a wide host range, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, protists and fungi. They lack lipid envelopes and package their segmented genome within multi-layered capsids. Lack of a lipid envelope has allowed three-dimensional structures of these large complex viruses (diameter ~60–100 nm) to be obtained, revealing a structural and likely evolutionary relationship to the cystovirus family of bacteriophage. There are currently 97 species in this family, divided among 15 genera in two subfamilies. Reoviruses can affect the gastrointestinal system (such as rotaviruses) and respiratory tract. The name &quot;reo-&quot; is an acronym for &quot;&quot;r&quot;espiratory &quot;e&quot;nteric &quot;o&quot;rphan&quot; viruses&quot;.&quot; The term &quot;orphan virus&quot; refers to the fact that some of these viruses have been observed not associated with any known disease. Even though viruses in the family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; have more recently been identified with various diseases, the original name is still used.

Reovirus infections occur often in humans, but most cases are mild or subclinical. Rotaviruses, however, can cause severe diarrhea and intestinal distress in children, and lab studies in mice have implicated orthoreoviruses in the expression of coeliac disease in pre-disposed individuals. The virus can be readily detected in feces, and may also be recovered from pharyngeal or nasal secretions, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. Despite the ease of finding reoviruses in clinical specimens, their role in human disease or treatment is still uncertain.

Some viruses of this family, such as phytoreoviruses and oryzaviruses, infect plants. Most of the plant-infecting reoviruses are transmitted between plants by insect vectors. The viruses replicate in both the plant and the insect, generally causing disease in the plant, but little or no harm to the infected insect.

== Structure ==

Reoviruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral capsid composed of an outer (T=13) and inner (T=2) protein shell. Ultrastructure studies show that virion capsids are composed of two or three separate layers which depends on species type. The innermost layer (core) has T=1 icosahedral symmetry and is composed of 60 different types of structural proteins. The core contains the genome segments, each of them encode a variety enzyme structure which is required for transcription. The core is covered by capsid layer T=13 icosahedral symmetry. Reoviruses have a unique structure which contains a glycosylated spike protein on the surface.

== Genome ==
The genomes of viruses in family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; contain 9–12 segments which are grouped into three categories corresponding to their size: L (large), M (medium) and S (small). Segments range from about 0.2 to 3 kbp and each segment encodes 1–3 proteins (10–14 proteins in total). Proteins of viruses in the family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; are denoted by the Greek character corresponding to the segment it was translated from (the L segment encodes for λ proteins, the M segment encodes for μ proteins and the S segment encodes for σ proteins).

==Life cycle==

Viruses in the family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; have genomes consisting of segmented, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Because of this, replication occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, and the virus encodes several proteins which are needed for replication and conversion of the dsRNA genome into positive-sense RNAs.

The virus can enter the host cell via a receptor on the cell surface. The receptor is not known but is thought to include sialic acid and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs). The virus is partially uncoated by proteases in the endolysosome, where the capsid is partially digested to allow further cell entry. The core particle then enters the cytoplasm by a yet unknown process where the genome is transcribed conservatively causing an excess of positive-sense strands, which are used as messenger RNA templates to synthesize negative-sense strands.

The genome of the rotavirus is divided into 11 segments. These segments are associated with the VP1 molecule which is responsible for RNA synthesis. In early events, the selection process occurs so that the entry of the 11 different RNA segments go in the cell. This procedure is performed by newly synthesized RNAs. This event ensures that one each of the 11 different RNA segments is received. In late events, the transcription process occurs again but this time is not capped unlike the early events. For virus different amounts of RNAs are required therefore during the translation step there is a control machinery. There are the same quantities of RNA segments but different quantities of proteins. The reason for this is that the RNA segments are not translated at the same rate.

Viral particles begin to assemble in the cytoplasm 6–7 hours after infection. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, suppression of termination, and ribosomal skipping. The virus exits the host cell by monopartite non-tubule guided viral movement, cell to cell movement, and existing in occlusion bodies after cell death and remaining infectious until finding another host.
==Multiplicity reactivation==
Multiplicity reactivation (MR) is the process by which two or more virus genomes, each containing inactivating genome damage, can interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome. McClain and Spendlove demonstrated MR for three types of reovirus after exposure to ultraviolet irradiation. In their experiments, reovirus particles were exposed to doses of UV-light that would be lethal in single infections. However, when two or more inactivated viruses were allowed to infect individual host cells MR occurred and viable progeny were produced. As they stated, multiplicity reactivation by definition involves some type of repair. Michod et al. reviewed numerous examples of MR in different viruses, and suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction in viruses that provides the benefit of recombinational repair of genome damages.

==Taxonomy==
The family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; is divided into two subfamilies based on the presence of a &quot;turret&quot; protein on the inner capsid. From ICTV communications: &quot;The name &quot;Spinareovirinae&quot; will be used to identify the subfamily containing the spiked or turreted viruses and is derived from &#x27;reovirus&#x27; and the Latin word &#x27;spina&#x27; as a prefix, which means spike, denoting the presence of spikes or turrets on the surface of the core particles. The term &#x27;spiked&#x27; is an alternative to &#x27;turreted&#x27;, that was used in early research to describe the structure of the particle, particularly with the cypoviruses. The name &quot;Sedoreovirinae&quot; will be used to identify the subfamily containing the non-turreted virus genera and is derived from &#x27;reovirus&#x27; and the Latin word &#x27;sedo&#x27;, which means smooth, denoting the absence of spikes or turrets from the core particles of these viruses, which have a relatively smooth morphology.&quot;

The family &quot;Reoviridae&quot; is divided into the following subfamilies and genera:
* &quot;Sedoreovirinae&quot;
** &quot;Cardoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Mimoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Orbivirus&quot;
** &quot;Phytoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Rotavirus&quot;
** &quot;Seadornavirus&quot;
* &quot;Spinareovirinae&quot;
** &quot;Aquareovirus&quot;
** &quot;Coltivirus&quot;
** &quot;Cypovirus&quot;
** &quot;Dinovernavirus&quot;
** &quot;Fijivirus&quot;
** &quot;Idnoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Mycoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Orthoreovirus&quot;
** &quot;Oryzavirus&quot;
==Therapeutic applications==
Although reoviruses are mostly nonpathogenic in humans, these viruses have served as very productive experimental models for studies of viral pathogenesis. Newborn mice are extremely sensitive to reovirus infections and have been used as the preferred experimental system for studies of reovirus pathogenesis.

Reoviruses have been demonstrated to have oncolytic (cancer-killing) properties, encouraging the development of reovirus-based therapies for cancer treatment.

Reolysin is a formulation of reovirus (Mammalian orthoreovirus serotype 3-dearing strain) that is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers, including studies currently developed to investigate the role of Reolysin combined with other immunotherapies.

<doc id="453621" wikidata="Q537786" url="?curid=453621" title="Westsylvania">
<text>Westsylvania was a proposed state of the United States located in what is now West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and small parts of Kentucky, Maryland, and Virginia. First proposed early in the American Revolution, Westsylvania would have been the fourteenth state in the newly formed United States, had it been recognized.

==Background==

In the years before the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), jurisdiction of the region west of the Allegheny Mountains around Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River had been disputed between the British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. The Mason-Dixon line, which officially established the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland, would have also settled the Virginia-Pennsylvania boundary dispute, but the surveying of the final miles of the Mason-Dixon line was abandoned in 1767 and would not be completed until 1784. In the early 1770s it was therefore unclear whether Pittsburgh and environs were in Pennsylvania or Virginia. Both colonies proceeded as if they had the better claim to the area. Virginia administered the region as the District of West Augusta, while in Pennsylvania it was considered a part of Westmoreland County.

Complicating this border dispute were the vast land claims of the Ohio Company of Virginia and the Indiana Land Company along the Ohio River. The two companies combined forces in 1769 to create the Grand Ohio Company with the intention of creating a colony known as Vandalia, which would have had similar borders to Westsylvania had it been recognized. The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War effectively brought an end to the efforts to establish Vandalia.

==Efforts at recognition==
Many settlers in the region believed that the governments of Virginia and Pennsylvania were too far removed from the west and were apathetic to western concerns. Inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, in the summer of 1776 settlers in the region proclaimed their independence from Pennsylvania and Virginia by petitioning the Second Continental Congress to recognize Westsylvania as the fourteenth state. In &quot;The Memorial of the Inhabitants of the Country, West of the Allegheny Mountains,&quot; the petitioners reviewed the dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia, which they believed would &quot;in all Probability terminate in a Civil War&quot;. They also informed the Congress that &quot;Land Jobbers&quot; were facilitating unlawful encroachment on Indian land, which would produce &quot;a bloody, ruinous &amp; destructive War with the Indians...&quot; Hoping to create order out of this chaos, the petitioners therefore asked that:

the Said Country be constituted declared &amp; acknowledged a separate, distinct, and independent Province &amp; Government by the Title and under the name of — &#x27;the Province &amp; Government of &quot;Westsylvania&quot;,&#x27; be empowered and enabled to form such Laws &amp; Regulations &amp; such a System of Polity &amp; Government as is best adapted &amp; most agreeable to the peculiar Necessities, local Circumstances &amp; Situation thereof &amp; its inhabitants invested with every other power, Right, Privilege &amp; Immunity, vested, or to be vested in the other American Colonies, be considered as a Sister Colony &amp; the fourteenth Province of the American Confederacy...

States with western land claims were reluctant to recognize the independence of frontier regions, however, and so Congress chose to ignore the petition. In an apparent effort to strengthen its political control of the area, in November 1776 Virginia reorganized the District of West Augusta into three counties: Ohio County, Monongalia County, and Yohogania County. Pennsylvania and Virginia finally settled the boundary dispute in 1780.

Settlement of the boundary dispute sparked a renewal of the Westsylvania movement among Virginians who were outraged to find themselves now living in Pennsylvania. Contributing to this separatist sentiment were those frontiersmen who believed that the national government was not doing enough to protect them from Native American attacks on the western frontier in the final years of the Revolutionary War. In 1782, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh lawyer and strong supporter of the national government, convinced the Pennsylvania Assembly to declare that agitation for a separate state was treason. This made promotion of Westsylvania subject to the death penalty. Pennsylvania also sent secret agents, such as the Reverend James Finley, to work against the Westsylvania movement. According to historian Jack Sosin, &quot;Finley&#x27;s efforts, the threat that the settlers&#x27; land might be sold, and the cool reaction to the proposed new state by Congress finally quieted the Westerners.&quot;

<text>In particle physics, strangeness (symbol S) is a property of particles, expressed as a quantum number, for describing decay of particles in strong and electromagnetic interactions that occur in a short period of time. The strangeness of a particle is defined as:
formula_1
where &quot;n&quot; represents the number of strange quarks () and &quot;n&quot; represents the number of strange antiquarks (). Evaluation of strangeness production has become an important tool in search, discovery, observation and interpretation of quark–gluon plasma (QGP). Strangeness is an excited state of matter and its decay is governed by CKM mixing. 

The terms &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;strangeness&quot; predate the discovery of the quark, and were adopted after its discovery in order to preserve the continuity of the phrase: strangeness of particles as −1 and anti-particles as +1, per the original definition. For all the quark flavour quantum numbers (strangeness, charm, topness and bottomness) the convention is that the flavour charge and the electric charge of a quark have the same sign. With this, any flavour carried by a charged meson has the same sign as its charge.

==Conservation==

Strangeness was introduced by Murray Gell-Mann, Abraham Pais, Tadao Nakano and Kazuhiko Nishijima to explain the fact that certain particles, such as the kaons or the hyperons and , were created easily in particle collisions, yet decayed much more slowly than expected for their large masses and large production cross sections. Noting that collisions seemed to always produce pairs of these particles, it was postulated that a new conserved quantity, dubbed &quot;strangeness&quot;, was preserved during their creation, but &quot;not&quot; conserved in their decay.

In our modern understanding, strangeness is conserved during the strong and the electromagnetic interactions, but not during the weak interactions. Consequently, the lightest particles containing a strange quark cannot decay by the strong interaction, and must instead decay via the much slower weak interaction. In most cases these decays change the value of the strangeness by one unit. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold in second-order weak reactions, however, where there are mixes of and mesons. All in all, the amount of strangeness can change in a weak interaction reaction by +1, 0 or −1 (depending on the reaction).

For example, the interaction of a K− meson with a proton is represented as:
formula_2
formula_3

Here strangeness is conserved and the interaction proceeds via the strong nuclear force.

Nonetheless, in reactions like the decay of the positive kaon:
formula_4
formula_5

Since both pions have a strangeness of 0, this violates conservation of strangeness, meaning the reaction must go via the weak force.

<text>West Kalimantan () is a province of Indonesia. It is one of five Indonesian provinces comprising Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo. Its capital and largest city is Pontianak. It is bordered by East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan to the east, the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the north, and the Bangka Belitung Islands to the west and the Java Sea to the south. The province has an area of 147,037 km2, and had a population of 4,395,983 at the 2010 Census and 5,414,390 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 5,623,328 (comprising 2,887,209 males and 2,736,119 females), and was projected to rise to 5,695,500 at mid 2024. Ethnic groups include the Dayak, Malay, Chinese, Javanese, Bugis, and Madurese. The borders of West Kalimantan roughly trace the mountain ranges surrounding the vast watershed of the Kapuas River, which drains most of the province. The province shares land borders with Central Kalimantan to the southeast, East Kalimantan to the east, and the Malaysian territory of Sarawak to the north.

West Kalimantan is nicknamed &quot;The Province of a Thousand Rivers&quot;. The nickname references the geography of the province, which features hundreds of rivers of varying size, most of which are navigable. Several major rivers are still the main route for freight to the hinterland, despite road infrastructure now reaching most districts.

Although a small part of West Kalimantan region is seawater, West Kalimantan has dozens of large and small islands (mostly uninhabited) spread along the Karimata Strait and Natuna Sea that borders the province of Riau Islands. The total population in the province, according to the 2010 census totalled 4,395,983 inhabitants and at the 2020 Census it was 5,414,390, but by mid 2023 it was officially estimated to have reached 5,623,328.

== History ==
The history of West Kalimantan was dominated with Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms ruling over the region and Borneo as a whole after that this kingdoms converted into muslim sultanate. 

Its modern history in 17th century. The Malays are the native Muslims of West Kalimantan and established their Sultanates of Sambas since 1609 in Sambas territory, along with Mempawah Sultanate established since 1740 ruled in between Pontianak and Sambas territory. The Mempawah Sultanate brought in workers from China at the beginning of the kingdom. The same policy followed by the Sambas Sultanate around 1750, which brought in workers from China to work in the gold mines in the area.

The high Chinese population in this province was due to a republic founded by Chinese miners called the Lanfang Republic (蘭芳共和國: Republik Lanfang), an autonomous state allied with Pontianak and Sambas Sultanate, as a sub-state of the Qing. The government of Lanfang was ended in West Kalimantan after the Dutch Invasion in 1884. 

West Kalimantan was under Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, when Indonesia declared its Independence. During the Japanese occupation, more than 21,000 people in Pontianak (including sultans, men, women and children) were kidnapped, tortured and massacred by Japanese troops during the Pontianak incidents. All the Malay Sultans on Kalimantan were executed and the Malay elite was devastated by the Japanese. Most of the victims were buried in several giant wells in Mandor (88 km from Pontianak). After the end of the war, Japanese officers in Pontianak were arrested by allied troops and brought in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

A monument called Makam Juang Mandor was created to memorialize the event.
On 12 May 1947, the West Kalimantan Autonomous region was established. It was led by Syarif Hamid II of Pontianak, who supported the Dutch endeavour to establish a federal United States of Indonesia (RUSI), of which West Kalimantan would have been a component. Following the 5 April 1950 arrest of Sultan Hamid for complicity in the APRA coup attempt against the RUSI government led by Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) officer Raymond Westerling, there were demands from the public for a merger into the Republic of Indonesia, which took place on 22 April. On 15 August, The West Kalimantan autonomous region became part of Kalimantan Province, and two days later, the RUSI ceased to exist, and was replaced with a unitary Republic of Indonesia.

West Kalimantan was the site of substantial fighting during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation under the Sukarno government in the mid-1960s. After Suharto deposed Sukarno in 1965, the confrontation was quickly resolved. Domestic conflict continued, however, for another ten years between the new Suharto government and fighters organized during the confrontation and backed by the banned Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).

During the 1930s the Dutch East Indies government initiated a &quot;transmigration plan&quot; to move people from heavily populated islands such as Java, to the less populated islands of Irian Jaya and Kalimantan. In the 1960s the Indonesian government granted the Madurese rights to clear forests for palm oil cultivation. This conflicted with the local Dayak tribes&#x27; traditional way of life. The tensions between the two ethnic groups resulted in major eruptions of violence in 1996, the Sambas riots in 1999 and the Sampit conflict in 2001, resulting in thousands of deaths.

== Geography ==

=== Boundary ===
West Kalimantan Province is located in the western part of the island of Borneo, or in between the lines 2°08&#x27;N and 3°05&#x27;S and between 108°0&#x27;E and 114°10&#x27;E. The province is traversed by the Equator (latitude 0°), precisely through the city of Pontianak. West Kalimantan has a tropical climate, with often high temperatures accompanied by high humidity.

Other specific characteristics are that the West Kalimantan region is one of the provinces in Indonesia which has a land border with another country, namely the State of Sarawak, East Malaysia. Even with this position, West Kalimantan is currently the only province in Indonesia that have officially has an access road to get in and out of a neighbouring country. West Kalimantan and Sarawak have open roads approximately 400 km long, spanning Pontianak-Entikong-Kuching (Sarawak, Malaysia) and can be reached about six to eight hours of travel. In the northern part of the province, there are four regencies that directly borders Malaysia, namely Sambas, Sanggau, Sintang and Kapuas Hulu, which stretch along with the Kalingkang Mountains-Kapuas Hulu.

Most of West Kalimantan is low-lying land, with a total area of 147,037 km2, or 7.53 percent of the total Indonesian land area or 1.13 times the size of the island of Java. This region stretches straight from north to south along more than 600 km and about 850 km from west to east. Judging from the size of the territory, West Kalimantan is Indonesia&#x27;s third largest province by area, after Papua (421,891 km2) and Central Kalimantan (152,600 km2). The largest regency is Kapuas Hulu (31,318 km2 or 21.3 percent of the provincial area), followed by Ketapang (30,019 km2 or 20.4 percent) and Sintang (22,026 km2 or 15.0 percent), with the rest spread over the nine other regencies and two cities.

=== Topology ===
In general, West Kalimantan land is low-lying and has hundreds of rivers are safe when navigable, slightly hilly which extend from west to east along the valley Kapuas and Natuna Sea / Strait Karimata. Most of the land area is a swampy mix of peat and mangrove forests. The land area is flanked by two mountain ranges, namely, Kalingkang Mountains in the North and the Schwaner Mountains in the south along the border with the province of Central Kalimantan. Judging from the soil texture, the majority of West Kalimantan&#x27;s area consists of the soil type PMK (podsolic red-yellow), which covers an area of about 10.5 million hectares, or 17.28 per cent of the total area of 14.7 million hectares. Next, the ground OGH (organosol, gley and hummus) and the alluvial soil of about 2.0 million hectares, or 10.29 per cent sprawled across Dati II, but most likely in the coastal district.

Influenced by the vast lowlands, the heights of the mountains are relatively low as well as non-volcanically active. The highest mountain is Mount Baturaya in Serawai District of Sintang Regency which has an altitude of 2,278 metres above sea level, far lower than Mount Semeru (East Java, 3,676 metres) or Mount Kerinci (Jambi, 3,805 metres).

Mount Lawit is located in Kapuas Hulu District, Embaloh Hulu and more formerly known in West Kalimantan. It only is the third highest because it has a high 1,767 metres, while the second highest is Mount Batusambung (in Ambalau District) with a height of up to 1,770 metres.

=== Lakes and Rivers ===
West Kalimantan is an area that could be called &quot;The Thousand Rivers Province&quot;. The nickname is in line with the geographical conditions that have hundreds of large and small rivers, among others, which can be and often are navigable. Several major rivers are still the lifeblood and mainline to transport the countryside, although the road infrastructure has been able to reach most districts.

The longest river is the Kapuas River(or sungai Kapuas), which is the longest river in Indonesia (1,086 km), along which 942 km are navigable. Other great rivers are the Melawi, (navigable 471 km), Pawan (197 km), Kendawangan (128 km), Jelai (135 km), Sekadau (117 km), Sambas (233 km ), and Landak (178 km).

Although rivers are very numerous in West Kalimantan, there are only two significant lakes in the province. These are Lake Sentarum and Lake Luar I, which are in Kapuas Hulu. Lake Sentarum has an area of 117,500 hectares, which sometimes is almost dry in the dry season, and Lake Luar I, which has an area of approximately 5,400 hectares. Both of these lakes have potential as tourist attractions.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Until 1999 the province was composed of six regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and the independent City (&quot;kota&quot;) of Pontianak. A seventh regency, Bengkayang, was formed on 20 April 1999 from part of Sambas Regency, and an eighth, Landak, was formed on 4 October 1999 from part of Mempawah Regency. A second independent city, Singkawang, was formed on 21 June 2001 from part of Bengkayang Regency. On 18 December 2003 Sekadau Regency was cut out of Sanggau Regency, and Melawi Regency was cut out of Sintang Regency, while on 2 January 2007 North Kayong Regency was cut out of Ketapang Regency, and on 17 July 2007 Kubu Raya Regency was cut out of Mempawah Regency. West Kalimantan is thus now subdivided into two cities and twelve regencies.
About 29 per cent of the province&#x27;s population lives in the Greater Pontianak area. The capitals, areas and populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses (as well as the official estimates as at mid 2023 of the regencies and cities are:

Notes: (a) Mempawah Regency population total above excludes a Special Enclave (&quot;Daerah Kantong&quot;), with 5,469 population in 2010.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The West Kalimantan I Electoral District consists of the 7 regencies and 2 cities listed above as &quot;Western group&quot;, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The West Kalimantan II Electoral District consists of the 5 regencies listed above as &quot;Eastern group&quot;, and elects 4 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

=== Proposed new province of Kapuas Raya ===
On 25 October 2013, the Indonesian People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective regencies and 8 new provinces; one of the proposed new provinces is Kapuas Raya (Great Kapuas) in West Kalimantan. This proposed measure has been held in abyance since 2013, but if and when the bill is approved, this will make Kapuas Raya the seventh largest province in Indonesia after Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, South Papua, Riau, South Sumatra and the newly-reduced Papua (province), as the total area of Kapuas Raya, encompassing five regencies, will measure 81,897.81 square km, or 55.7 per cent of the current size of West Kalimantan. Ever since 2005, the five regencies in the eastern part of West Kalimantan (Sanggau, Sekadau, Sintang, Melawi and Kapuas Hulu) have floated a concept to establish Kapuas Raya due to the distance issues from the respective regencies to the province capital Pontianak. The distance between the farthest regency of Kapuas Hulu and Mempawah is 661 km, followed by Melawi (439 km), Sintang (395 km), Sekadau (315 km) and Sanggau (267 km).

== Ecology ==

There are three National Parks in the province: Danau Sentarum, Gunung Palung and Betung Kerihun. Currently, illegal logging for trees such as dipterocarp and plantations of palm oil and pulpwood threaten many rare species in the province due to the effects of habitat destruction. Peat bog fires and droughts or flooding during ENSO episodes also threaten the area and are worsened by ongoing deforestation.

Dr Hotlin Ompusunggu has received the 2011 Whitley Award for her conservation work in West Kalimantan. She has been fighting against illegal logging by the trade-off with low-cost quality dental and medical treatment to 60,000 villagers on condition they involve in reforestation and conservation work.

<text>South Kalimantan () is a province of Indonesia. It is the second most populous province on the island of Kalimantan, the Indonesian territory of the island of Borneo after West Kalimantan. The provincial capital was Banjarmasin until 15 February 2022 when it was legally moved 35 kms southeast to Banjarbaru. The population of South Kalimantan was recorded at just over 3.625 million people at the 2010 Census, and at 4.07 million at the 2020 Census. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 4,221,929 (comprising 2,133,224 males and 2,088,705 females). One of the five Indonesian provinces in Kalimantan, it is bordered by the Makassar Strait in the east, Central Kalimantan in the west and north, the Java Sea in the south, and East Kalimantan in the northeast. The province also includes the island of &quot;Pulau Laut&quot; (&quot;Sea Island&quot;), located off the eastern coast of Kalimantan, as well as other smaller offshore islands. The province is divided into 11 regencies and 2 cities. South Kalimantan is the traditional homeland of the Banjar people, although some parts of East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan are also included in this criterion. Nevertheless, South Kalimantan, especially the former capital city Banjarmasin has always been the cultural capital of Banjarese culture. Many Banjarese have migrated to other parts of Indonesia, as well as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia. In addition, other ethnic groups also inhabit the province, such as several groups of the Dayaks, who mostly live in the interior part of the province, as well as the Javanese, who mostly migrated from Java due to the Transmigration program which dated from the Dutch colonial era. It is one of the provinces in Indonesia that has a larger population than Mongolia.

The territory of what is now South Kalimantan, bounced between local Kingdoms, because of its strategic location for trade, before becoming tributes to the Sultanate of Mataram in the 17th century, with increasing Dutch encroachment, the territory was colonized as part of the Dutch East Indies and the Japanese Empire until Indonesian Independence in 1945.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
South Kalimantan is known as the Land of Lambung Mangkurat (Indonesian: &quot;Bumi Lambung Mangkurat&quot;). Lambung Mangkurat, which is the Banjarese pronunciation for Lambu (Lembu) Mangkurat, was the second king of the Kingdom of Dipa (the forerunner of the Banjar Sultanate). Lambung Mangkurat replaces his father Ampu Jatmaka or Mpu / Empu Jatmika ang Maharaja in Candi, a wealthy immigrant merchant from the land of Keling, Kediri who was the founder of the kingdom of Dipa around the beginning of the 14th century or around 1380 or 1387.

=== Pre-Sultanate era ===

According to the mythology of the Maanyan people (the oldest ethnic group in South Kalimantan), the first kingdom in southern Kalimantan was the Nan Sarunai Kingdom which was estimated to have territory ranging from Tabalong to Paser. The Maanyan mythology tells of the golden age of the Nan Sarunai Kingdom, uniting the Maanyan people and made connections with the island of Madagascar off the coast of Africa. One of the archaeological remains from this era is the Great Temple located in the town of Amuntai. In 1996, C-14 testing of charcoal samples from the Agung Temple dated the structure between 242 and 226 BC. Judging from the number of years referred, the Kingdom of Nan Saruna was 600 years older than the Kutai Martapura Kingdom in East Kalimantan. According to &quot;Hikayat Sang Bima&quot;, the people who brought descended into the kings of Banjar were the gods that also descended into the kings of Bima, Bali, Dompu and Gowa who is the five sons of Maharaja Pandu Dewata.

The Malagasy language in Madagascar is similar to the Banjar language. Francois-Xavier Ricaut has shown that the Malagasy people&#x27;s genetic makeup is 68 percent of Africans and 32 percent of Asians. Based on their evidence, Banjar is the Asian group that is most likely to have traveled to Madagascar. Genetic dating supports the hypothesis that Austronesian migration occurred about 1,000 years ago, while the last significant Bantu migration to Madagascar began 300 years later, after climatic change in Africa. Language shifts are thought to have occurred in Southeast Kalimantan after the Banjar migration to Madagascar. It is estimated that the Banjar people, who currently speak Malay, may speak a language closer to the language reconstructed for Proto-Malagasy. This linguistic change follow the main cultural and genetic mix with Malays, driven by the trade post of the Malay Empires in Southeast Kalimantan. The collapse of the Malay Empires during the 15th and 16th centuries coincide with the end of the mixture of Malay genes into the Banjar population. Genetically, ancient Banjar tribes has a mixture of ancient Malay Dayak and Maanyan ancestry. The Banjar tribes, which had dominant Malay genetics, migrated out of Borneo around 830 AD or 1,200 years ago to what is now known as Madagascar.

The Nan Sarunai kingdom was invaded by the Majapahit multiple times, with the third and last invasion under the reign of Hayam Wuruk in 1355. At the time Nan Sarunai was led by Raden Anyan or Datu Tatuyan Wulau Miharaja Papangkat Amas. This invasion was led by Ampu Jatmika with his entourage which according to &quot;Hikayat Banjar&quot; included his advisor Aria Megatsari, general Tumenggung Tatah Jiwa, minister Wiramartas, &quot;punokawan&quot; Patih Baras, Patih Basi, Patih Luhu, dan Patih Dulu, and bodyguards Sang Panimba Segara, Sang Pembelah Batung, Sang Jampang Sasak, and Sang Pengeruntung &#x27;Garuntung&#x27; Manau. Multiple battles happened with the first battle in April 1358; killed Majapahit soldiers were burned in Tambak Wasi. Nansarunai admiral Jamuhala was also killed in this battle. While prince Jarang and prince Idong hid in Man near the Tabalong-kiwa river. Nansarunai soldiers regrouped in Pulau Kadap before the second battle occurred in December 1362. Casualties from this second battle were buried in &quot;Tambak&quot; in Bayu Hinrang. In this battle Raden Anyan was killed, speared by Mpu Nala, and buried in Banua Lawas. In its place, Ampu Jatmika founded a Hindu kingdom, Negara Dipa under Majapahit tributary, predecessor of Negara Daha and Banjar Sultanate. Its remnants include Candi Agung complex of Amuntai constructed by Ampu Jatmika on an older Ma&#x27;anyan site. While surviving Javanese, Dayak, Madurese, and Bugis soldiers, sailors, metalsmiths of the war settled in Amuntai, Alabio, and Nagara. These invasions were recorded in Dayak Ma&#x27;anyan poetry as &quot;Nansarunai Usak Jawa&quot;.

Maharaja Sukarama, the King of Negara Daha, had the intention that his successor would be his grandson Raden Samudera, son of his daughter Puteri Galuh Intan Sari. The father of Raden Samudera was Raden Manteri Jaya, son of Raden Begawan, brother of Maharaja Sukarama. The will caused Raden Samudera to be threatened with safety because the sons of Maharaja Sukarama were ambitious as kings, namely Prince Bagalung, Prince Mangkubumi and Prince Tumenggung. Assisted by Arya Taranggana, Raden Samudra fled by boat to the lower Barito river. After Sukarama&#x27;s death, Prince Mangkubumi became King of the Negara Daha, then succeeded by Prince Tumenggung who was also a son of Sukarama. Raden Samudra.

Pangeran Tumenggung attacked the Bandarmasih. Prince Samudra was assisted by the Kingdom of Demak with the strength of 40,000 soldiers with a fleet of 1,000 boats each carrying 400 soldiers capable of withstanding the attack. Prince Tumenggung was willing to give up the power of the Negara Daha to Raden Samudra. Negara Daha was later merged into the Sultanate of Banjar which held a place in Bandarmasih, while Prince Tumenggung was given an area in Batang Alai.

In 1521, Raden Samudra became the first king of the Sultanate of Banjar with the title Sultan Suriansyah. He also became the first king to convert to Islam, guided by the Islamic cleric Khatib Dayan.

=== Sultanate era ===
The Banjar Sultanate began experiencing its golden age in the first decade of the 17th century with pepper as a commodity of trade, with the southwest, southeast and east of the island of Borneo paying tribute to the Sultanate. Previously, the Banjar Sultanate paid tribute to the Demak Sultanate, but after the fall of the Demak Sultanate and the rise of the Pajang Sultanate, the Banjar Sultanate no longer sent tribute to Java.

The supremacy of Java against Banjarmasin, was carried out again by Tuban in 1615 to conquer Banjarmasin with the help of Madura (Arosbaya) and Surabaya, but failed due to fierce resistance.

Sultan Agung of Mataram, developed his power over the island of Java by defeating the port city of the northern coast of Java such as Jepara and Gresik (1610), Tuban (1619), Madura (1624) and Surabaya (1625). In 1622, the Mataram Sultanate, again planned an occupation of the kingdoms south, southwest and southeast of the island of Borneo, and Sultan Agung consolidated his authority over the Kingdom of Sukadana in 1622.

In 1636, because he felt he had enough strength in the military and economy to deal with an invasion from other kingdoms, The Sultan of Banjar claimed Sambas, Lawai, Sukadana, Kotawaringin, Pembuang, Sampit, Mendawai, Kahayan Hilir and Kahayan Hulu, Kutai, Pasir, Pulau Laut, Satui, Asam Asam, Kintap and Swarangan as vassals of the Sultanate of Banjarmasin.

Since 1631, Banjarmasin was preparing to face an attack from the Mataram Sultanate, but due to lack of logistics, the planned attack from the Mataram Sultanate never materialised. After 1637 there was a massive migration from Java by the victims of Sultan Agung&#x27;s political aggression. The arrival of immigrants from Java had a huge influence with the ports on the island of Borneo becoming the center of diffusion of Javanese culture.

Besides facing an invasion plan from Mataram, the Sultanate of Banjarmasin also had to face the increasing Dutch presence in the region. In 1637 Banjarmasin and Mataram held peace conference after years of tense relations. The Makassar War (1660–1669) caused many traders to move from Somba Opu, then under the rule of the Gowa Sultanate to Banjarmasin. The currency circulating in the Sultanate of Banjar was called &quot;doit&quot;.

Before it was divided into several small kingdoms, the Banjar Sultanate included the modern-day provinces of South Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, to the west it bordered the Kingdom of Tanjungpura at Ketapang and to the east by the Paser Sultanate at Tanjung Aru. In the area, the local rules had the title Prince, only the Sultan of Banjar has the right to use the title Sultan. Other sultanates sent tribute to the Sultanate of Banjar, including the Paser Sultanate which was conquered in 1636 with the help of the Dutch.

Initially, the capital of the Banjar Sultanate was in Banjarmasin, but it was moved to Martapura. at its height, the area under the influence of the Banjar Sultanate encompassed the central point of the king&#x27;s palace in Martapura and ended at the outer point at present-day Sambas Regency in West Kalimantan in the northwest to the Karasikan region (present-day Sulu Archipelago) in the northeast. The Sambas and Karasikan Kingdoms sent tribute to the Sultan of Banjar. In the Hikayat Banjar also mentioned countries in Batang Lawai, Sukadana, Bunyut (Kutai Hulu) and Sewa Agung (Sawakung).

=== Colonial era ===

In the 18th century, Prince Tamjidullah I succeeded in gaining power to his dynasty and designated Prince Nata Dilaga as the first Sultan as Panembahan Kaharudin Khalilullah. Prince Nata Dilaga who became the first king of the Tamjidullah dynasty, declared himself as &quot;Susuhunan Nata Alam&quot; in 1772. The son of Sultan Muhammad Aliuddin Aminullah, Prince Amir, the grandson of Sultan Hamidullah fled to the Paser Kingdom, and requested assistance from his uncle, Arung Tarawe (and Queen Goddess). Prince Amir then returned and invaded the Banjar Sultanate with a large Buginese army in 1757, and tried to reclaim his throne from Susuhunan Nata Alam. Fearing the loss of the throne and the fall of the kingdom under the Bugis, Susuhunan Nata Alam requested assistance from the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

The VOC accepted the request and sent Captain Hoffman with his forces and succeeded in defeating the Buginese forces. Prince Amir was forced to flee back to the Paser Kingdom. Some time later Prince Amir tried to ask for assistance from the Banjar nobles in the Barito area who were not happy with the Dutch presence. In this second battle, Prince Amir was captured and was exiled to Ceylon in 1787. After that an agreement was made between the Sultanate of Banjar and the VOC, where the kings of the Banjar ruled the kingdom as borrowers of VOC land. In 1826 a re-agreement was held between the Dutch East Indies Government and Sultan Adam, based on the previous agreement. According to the new agreement, the Dutch were allowed to interfere with the appointment of the Crown Prince and the &quot;Mangkubumi&quot;, which resulted in the destruction of this royal custom, which was one of the causes of the Banjarmasin War.

The Banjarmasin War took place between 1859 and 1905 (1859–1863 according to Dutch sources). Sultan Hidayatullah II of Banjar and Prince Antasari used a strategy of guerrilla warfare by moving the government to the interior and building fortifications in the Borneon jungles. The resistance established unity between the Banjar and the Dayak people, tied to kinship through marriage ties. The association gave birth to the status of &quot;pegustian&quot; and &quot;temenggung&quot; which became a unifying tool for the Banjar-Dayak coalition facing the Dutch.

Pangeran Antasari also collaborated with the Kutai Kertanegara Sultanate through his relatives in Tenggarong. Pangeran Antasari wrote to other princes from Kutai such as Prince Nata Kusuma, Pangeran Anom, and Kerta. They all assisted the smuggling of firearms from Kutai to Hamlet (Banjar). However, when the Banjar War was continued by the descendants of Pangeran Antasari, The Sultan of Kutai Aji Muhammad Sulaiman did not respond positively to requests for help from Prince Perbatasari. In fact, Prince Perbatasari was handed over to the Dutch in 1885. The Dutch launched the &quot;Expedition to the Southern and Eastern region of Borneo&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Expeditie naar de Zuider- en Oosterafdeling van Borneo&quot;), resulting in the destruction of the Banjar Sultanate. Resistance towards the Dutch continued until 1905, when Dutch forces under the leadership of Lieutenant Christofel veteran of the Aceh War, with a large number of Korps Marechaussee te voet troops, attacked Manawing fortress in January 1905. The Korps Marechaussee te voet was a non-military corps established by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1890 to handle police duties help the military. Massively outnumbered, Sultan Muhammad Seman did not survive the battle. The Sultan was shot and killed on January 24, 1905.

The Dutch annexed and placed the former territory of the Banjar Sultanate under the jurisdiction of the Residency of South and Eastern Borneo (Dutch: &quot;Residentie Zuider en Oosterafdeeling van Borneo&quot;). In 1938, the Residency of Western Borneo (Dutch: &quot;Residentie Westerafdeeling van Borneo&quot;) and the Residency of South and Eastern Borneo were merged into the Government of Borneo (Dutch: &quot;Gouvernement of Borneo&quot;) with Bandjermasin as its capital (Dutch: &quot;stadsgemeente&quot;).

=== Japanese invasion and occupation ===
During the Dutch East Indies campaign of World War II, the Japanese invaded Borneo. Immediately after capturing Balikpapan on January 26, 1942, the 56th Mixed Infantry Group was ordered to complete the occupation of Dutch Borneo by invading Bandjermasin, its capital. During the Battle of Balikpapan and also after the occupation of the city, efforts were made to gather information from Japanese residents, natives and prisoners of war. Reconnaissance flights in the area were carried out by naval air units. It was necessary to capture Bandjermasin, as soon as possible, to secure its airfield for combat aircraft scheduled to participate in the Java Operation.

A Sea Drive Unit under command of Captain Yoshibumi Okamoto left Balikpapan on the evening of January 27, 1942, three days ahead of the main Land Drive Unit. The craft moved only at night and were carefully concealed in the river banks during daylight and camouflaged with mangrove branches, while the troops were resting in the forest, so that they were completely hidden from aerial reconnaissance planes. Radio silence was maintained all the time. One naval officer was attached to the unit as a pilot. The surprise night attack was successfully carried out on the town of Kotabaroe on Laoet Island, as planned. Very little resistance was encountered and a large quantity of military supplies and provisions was captured.

The local administrative governor was unhappy with his territorial commander and asked the main Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) HQ on Java for a replacement. The replacement commander was on his way by airplane, but returned as they saw Bandjarmasin was on fire and they thought, although wrongly, that it was already occupied by Japanese troops and perhaps it would be unwise to attempt a landing. The Okamoto&#x27;s unit landed at a point approximately 80 km southeast of Bandjarmasin on February 8, 1942, and advanced overland without opposition, to the airfield. As the Land Drive Unit had already dispersed the enemy, there was no fighting after the Sea Drive Unit reached the Martapoera airfield on February 10, 1942.

At 0900 on February 10, the Martapoera airfield was captured by the Advance Force together with the Engineer Company. By the evening of February 10, with the arrival of the main force and the Sea Land Unit, Bandjermasin was finally occupied. There was no fighting.

Lieutenant Colonel H. T. Halkema came by sea to the Barito River, with his staff, accompanied by elements of units under his command. By now many KNIL native soldiers had already deserted. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema received orders to proceed to Kotawarangin airfield. When he arrived there, with only 75 men left under his depleted command, he received an order to have part of his shrunken force, to staunchly defend the airfield, while those that were too weak and exhausted should to be sent to Java. Lieutenant Colonel Halkema was later court-marshalled by the military court (&quot;Hoog Militair Gerechtshof&quot;). In the meantime a brave group of civilians, and military escapees, 180 persons, managed to evade the Japanese aboard a small coaster to Madoera Island, among which also included 20 women.

The official Japanese casualties during the Bandjermasin operation numbered only 9 soldiers who were killed or died from various diseases, while at least 80% of the men infected with malaria. The casualties and the number of POWs on the Dutch side are unknown. The distance travelled by land routes was approximately 400 km and the distance through jungle approximately 100 km.

During the Japanese occupation, Borneo and eastern Indonesia were controlled by the 2nd South Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy. During the occupation, the Japanese committed brutal war crimes against the local population, resulting in thousands of casualties. All of people&#x27;s lives were closely monitored by the Kempetai. Towards the end of Japanese rule, many romusha in the form of skeletal clad in full leather, young girls from Java and South Kalimantan themselves were made &quot;jugun ianfu&quot; (comfort women).

In 1943, a scheme by Indonesian nationalists and Dutch in South Kalimantan against the Japanese was uncovered before the Pontianak incident occurred. According to some sources this happened in September 1943 at Amuntai in South Kalimantan and involved establishing up an Islamic State and expelling the Japanese but the plan was foiled.

=== Revolution and modern era ===

On September 17, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Australian Army who entered Banjarmasin. On July 1, 1946, the Australian handed control back to the Dutch colonial government. Governor-General Hubertus van Mook draw up a plan for a federal government through the Malino Conference (July 16–22, 1946) and the Denpasar Conference (December 7–24, 1946) which decided on the formation of four federal states, Java, Sumatra, Borneo (Netherlands Borneo) and the Great East (State of East Indonesia), the formation of the Borneo state was opposed by the people of Banjarmasin, led by several figure such as Hasan Basry.

The Dutch remained in South Kalimantan until 1949, when the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference resulted in the Dutch recognizing Indonesia&#x27;s sovereignty. The Dutch then withdraw from the region, ending the three-century long Dutch presence in the region. The region was initially incorporated into the Indonesian province of Kalimantan, but in 1956 the province was dissolved and separated into two province, West Kalimantan and South Kalimantan. In 1957 South Kalimantan was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the Muslim population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on May 23, 1957, under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared Central Kalimantan the seventeenth province of Indonesia.

== Geography ==
South Kalimantan is a province located on the island of Borneo, located between longitude 21 21 49 &quot;LS, 114 19&quot; 33 &quot;BT – 116 33 &#x27;28 BT, and 21&#x27; 49&quot; LS 110 &quot;14&quot; LS on the map. South Kalimantan has a total area of 38,320.66 km2 and is divided into eleven regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two independent cities (&quot;kota&quot;).

Geographically, South Kalimantan is in the southeastern part of the island of Borneo, has a low-lying area in the west and east coast, and a plateau formed by the Meratus Mountains in the middle. South Kalimantan consists of two main geographic features, namely the lowlands and the highlands. Lowland areas are mostly in the form of peatlands to swamps, which are rich in biodiversity sources of freshwater animals. Some highland areas are still natural tropical forests and protected by the government.

South Kalimantan has extensive forests namely Permanent Forests (139,315 ha), Production Forests (1,325,024 ha), Protected Forests (139,315 ha), Convention Forests (348,919 ha). Forestry consists of two types, namely wood and non-wood. The area of forest in South Kalimantan is 1,659,003 ha including; protected forests, natural forests, permanent production forests, limited production forests, conversion forests and mangrove forests. Some are tropical forests and protected by the government.

South Kalimantan is known as &quot;the land of a thousand rivers&quot;, it is due to the large number of rivers in South Kalimantan. From these rivers, one of the well-known rivers is the Barito River, whose name is based on the Barito region (formerly &quot;Onder Afdeeling Barito&quot;) which is upstream including Central Kalimantan, but is often used to name all of the watershed to its mouth at the Java Sea in South Kalimantan is called Muara Banjar/Kuala Banjar. Barito River is commonly used for buying and selling floating markets. In addition, there is also the Martapura River, a tributary of the Barito, which is located in the city of Banjarmasin and in the upper part is the city of Martapura, the capital of Banjar Regency.

=== Climate ===
This region has a tropical savanna climate, similar to most other Indonesian provinces. The season in West Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September wind flows from Australia and do not contain much water vapor, resulting in a dry season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Oceanduring the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half-year after passing the transition period in between April – May and October – November.As in most other province of Indonesia, South Kalimantan has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate and tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;) along the savanna grassland plains. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

== Government ==
The Province of South Kalimantan is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.

While the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.

=== Administrative Divisions ===
From the formation of the Province of South Kalimantan there were four regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) - Banjar, Barito, Kotabaru and Hulu Sungai - together with the independent city of Banjarmasin. However, one of these - Barito Regency - had previously been partly situated in what had become Central Kalimantan Province in 1958, and so was formed into a separate Barito Kuala Regency on 26 June 1959; on the same date, the existing Hulu Sungai Regency was split into separate regencies of South Hulu Sungai, Central Hulu Sungai and North Hulu Sungai. On 14 July 1965 three further regencies were created - Tanah Laut from part of Banjar Regency, Tapin from part of South Hulu Sungai Regency, and Tabalong from part of North Hulu Sungai Regency.

A second independent city - Banjarbaru - was created on 20 April 1999, and on 25 February 2003 two additional regencies were created - Tanah Bumbu from part of Kotabaru Regency, and Balangan from part of Hulu Sungai Utara Regency. There are now therefore eleven regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two cities (&quot;kota&quot;) in South Kalimantan as listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses together with the official estimates as at mid 2023 and their administrative capitals.
The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Kalimantan I Electoral District consists of 8 of the regencies in the province (Banjar, Barito Kuala, Tapin, South Hulu Sungai, Central Hulu Sungai, North Hulu Sungai, Tabalong and Balangan), and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Kalimantan II Electoral District consists of the remaining 3 regencies (Tanah Laut, Kota Baru and Tanah Bumbu), together with the cities of Banjarmasin and Banjarbaru, and elects 5 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. Aboe Bakar Al-Habsyi is a representative of South Kalimantan I since 2014 and legislator since 2004 from the PKS fraction.

== Demographics ==
=== Ethnicity ===

The majority of the population of South Kalimantan is the Banjar (74.34%) consisting of three groups, namely Banjar Kuala, Banjar Pahuluan and Banjar Batang Banyu. Based on the 2010 population census the Banjar people numbered 4.1 million. About 3 million Banjar people live in South Kalimantan, another million Banjar people live in the other Kalimantan provinces and 500,000 other Banjars live outside Kalimantan. The Banjar people originated from the Banjar area, which is a mix of communities in several river basins, namely those of the Bahan, Barito, Martapura and Tabanio rivers. From this central cultural area, the Banjar tribe has since moved extensively for centrifugal migration or jumping of frogs to various regions in the archipelago to Madagascar.

The second largest ethnic group is the Javanese (14.51%) who occupy the transmigration area. Other ethnic groups also exist in South Kalimantan. The Tionghoa Parit (Banjarese: &quot;Cina Parit&quot;) is a sub-group of the Chinese Indonesians. They inhabit the Parit river area in Pelaihari District of Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan. In the daily term, the Chinese are called &quot;Cina Parit&quot; by the Banjar people and it is quite difficult for the Banjar tongue to pronounce &quot;Tionghoa Parit&quot;, and in fact the Chinese people in Banjarmasin live in the Chinatown area which consists of the Pacinan Laut Village (near the river) and Pacinan Darat Village (from the river). The Chinese community call themselves as &quot;Tionghoa Parit&quot; instead of &quot;Cina Parit.&quot;

The Dayak are also original inhabitants of the province. They occupy the Meratus Mountains region, from which the Barito River flows to Central Kalimantan.

=== Language ===
The language used in everyday life by Banjarese as a mother tongue and as a lingua franca for the people of South Kalimantan generally is the Banjar language, which has two major dialects, namely the Banjar Kuala dialect and the Banjar Hulu dialect. Dayak tribes who inhabit the southern region of the Meratus Mountains speak the Dayak Meratus language.

The Dayak Dusmala (Dusun-Maanyan-Lawangan) who use the Eastern Barito languages inhabit the northern region of the Meratus Mountains; these include the Dayak Maanyan Warukin language, the Dayak Samihin language, the Dayak Dusun Deyah language, the Dayak Lawangan language, and the Dayak Abal language. The Dayak Biaju who use the Western Barito languages inhabit the basin of the Barito River; these include numerous languages, among others the Dayak Bakumpai language and the Dayak Barangas language. The Dayak Ngaju language, a language originating from Central Kalimantan is used as a liturgical language in the Borneo Evangelical Church headquartered in Banjarmasin.

Indonesian is widely used as a second language and also for inter-ethnic communication.

=== Religion ===

Islam is the majority religion adhered to around 97% of people in South Kalimantan. There was also Christian, Hindu and Buddhist communities as well as the Kaharingan belief embraced by the Dayak people who lived around the Meratus Mountains region.
== Culture ==
=== Traditional Music ===

One of the arts in the form of traditional music typical of the Banjar people is &quot;Panting&quot;. This music is called &quot;Panting&quot; because it is dominated by musical instruments called panting, a type of stringed instrument that uses strings (important) so it is called important music. Initially, the music came from the Tapin area, South Kalimantan. &quot;Panting&quot; is a musical instrument that is picked which is shaped like an Arab cork but is smaller in size. In the past, &quot;panting&quot; music was only played individually or solo. The name of the important music comes from the name of the musical instrument itself, because in important music that is famous for its musical instruments and which plays a very important role. Until now, &quot;panting&quot; is still famous as traditional music originating from South Kalimantan.

Besides that, there is a traditional Banjar music art, namely &quot;Kentung&quot;. This music comes from the Banjar Regency area, namely in the village of Sungai Alat, Astambul and the village of Bincau, Martapura. At present, this kentung music has begun to scarce. The past of this musical instrument was contested. In this match not only the sound, but also the things that are magical, such as if in the match this instrument can be broken or cannot be heard from the opponent&#x27;s competition.

=== Traditional Dance ===

Broadly speaking, dance from South Kalimantan is from the indigenous ethnic culture of Banjar and ethnic Dayaks. Banjar dance evolved from the time of the Banjar Sultanate and was influenced by Javanese and Malay culture, such as &quot;Japin&quot; Dance and &quot;Baksa kembang&quot; Dance.

Banjar dance art is divided into two, namely dance developed in the palace (palace), and dance art developed by the people. Kraton dance is marked by the name &quot;Baksa&quot; which comes from the Javanese language (beksan) which signifies the smoothness of motion in the dance. These dances have been around for hundreds of years, since the Hindu era, but the movements and clothing have been adapted to the current situation and conditions. For example, certain movements that are considered incompatible with Islamic adab change a little.

=== Traditional House ===
Rumah Bubungan Tinggi or Rumah Banjar or Rumah Ba-anjung is the most iconic type of house in South Kalimantan. In the old kingdom time, this house is the core building in a complex of a palace. This particular house is where the King and his family would reside. Since 1850, there are various building around it with their own respective functions. The name &quot;Bubungan Tinggi&quot; refers to its sharp roof (45 degrees steep). This type of house became so popular, that people out of the royalty also took interest in building it. Hence, there are houses with this type of architecture all over South Kalimantan, and even crossing the borders of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. This type of house, of course, took more money than the usual house, so it was naturally the house of the rich.

Nowadays most Banjar people have little interest in building Bubungan Tinggi. Beside the fact that it takes a lot of money to build, people nowadays prefer the &quot;modern&quot; type of house. Its cultural values, however, are still appreciated. It is the main figure in both South Kalimantan and Banjarmasin&#x27;s coat of arms. Many of the modern governmental buildings are built with its traits.

=== Theater ===

The only traditional theater art that developed on the island of Borneo was &quot;Mamanda&quot;. Mamanda is theater art or traditional performances originating from South Kalimantan. Compared to other performing arts, &quot;Mamanda&quot; is more similar to &quot;Lenong&quot; in terms of the relationship between players and spectators. This interaction made the audience become active in conveying funny comments which allegedly could make the atmosphere more lively.

The difference is &quot;Lenong&quot; art is now more in line with the times than the monotonous Mamanda in the royal storyline, since in &quot;Mamanda&quot; art the characters played are standard figures such as Raja, Prime Minister, Mangkubumi, Wazir, Commander-in-Chief, First Hope, Second Hope, Khadam (Clown/aide), Empress and Sandut (Putri).

These characters must be present in every performance. In order not to be left behind, &quot;Mamanda&#x27;s&quot; figures were often added with other figures such as the King from another kingdom, pirates, genie, companies and other additional figures to enrich the story.

It was alleged that the term &quot;Mamanda&quot; was used because in the play, players such as the Vizier, Minister, and Mangkubumi were called the pamanda or mamanda by the King. &quot;Mamanda&quot; etymologically consists of the word &quot;mama&quot; (mamarina) which means uncle in Banjar language and &quot;nda&quot; which means honorable. So &quot;mamanda&quot; means honorable uncle. That is &quot;greeting&quot; to uncles who are respected in the kinship system or family.

=== Traditional Weapon ===
&quot;Kris&quot; is one of the traditional weapons in South Kalimantan. The size is at least 30 cm long and the eyes are stuck in another. Weapons made of iron mixed with other metals.

&quot;Mandau&quot;, also called Parang Ilang, is a short-stemmed machete. Mandau became the main identity and weapon of the Dayak community in addition to other machete types. In general, Dayak tribes inhabiting the island of Borneo have several types of machete sharp weapons which are divided into two types, namely inland Dayak and coastal Dayak.

&quot;Sungga&quot; is one of the weapons used in the Banjar War in the Gunung Madang Fort area, Kandangan, Hulu Sungai Selatan. This weapon was installed under a bridge that was made as a trap, so that when traversed by the enemy (Dutch army), then the bridge will collapse and the enemy that fell stuck on the &quot;sungga&quot;.

== Economy ==
In 2010, South Kalimantan&#x27;s exports grew by 27%, the highest increase among all Indonesian provinces. The province&#x27;s total exports rank seventh out of all provinces.

=== Workforce ===
The agricultural sector is the sector that absorbs the most labor. In February 2012, 38.20 percent of the workforce was absorbed by the agricultural sector. The trade sector is the second largest sector in employment, which is 20.59 percent. The status of workers in South Kalimantan is still dominated by workers who work in the informal sector. In February 2012, 63.20 percent were workers in the informal sector. Most of the workers were self-employed (19.66 percent), tried to be assisted by temporary workers (18.92 percent) and free workers and unpaid workers (24.61 percent). Workers in the formal sector were recorded at 36.80 percent, consisting of workers with labor / employee status (33.35 percent) and working status assisted by permanent workers (3.45 percent).

=== Agriculture and Plantation ===
The main product of agriculture is rice, in addition to corn, cassava and sweet potatoes. While fruits consist of oranges, papaya, bananas, durian, rambutan, kasturi and langsat. Palm oil is also common in South Kalimantan.

=== Industry ===
Industry in South Kalimantan is dominated by micro and small manufacturing industries, followed by large and medium manufacturing industries. Until 2010, the number of business units totaled 60,432 units, an increase of 10.92% compared to 2009.

=== Finance and Banking ===
Judging from its performance in 2009, banks in South Kalimantan recorded lower growth compared to the previous year as a result of the global financial crisis. However, some indicators still recorded positive growth. The volume of South Kalimantan&#x27;s banking business (assets) grew 13.3% from the end of 2008 to reach Rp21.24 trillion. This asset growth is mainly supported by credit growth and deposits.

Public funds collected by South Kalimantan banking at the end of 2009 reached IDR 18.33 trillion or grew by 13% (y-o-y). all types of accounts in the form of demand deposits, savings accounts, and time deposits show positive growth of 10.51% (y-o-y), 17% (y-o-y), and 5.86% (y-o-y), respectively.

Meanwhile, in terms of lending, at the end of December 2009 the amount of loans disbursed reached Rp13.95 trillion or grew by 16% (y-o-y). This credit growth was mainly supported by consumption credit and investment credit which grew quite high at 24.81% (y-o-y) and 30.42% (y-o-y).

With these developments, the banking intermediation function reflected by the LDR (Loan to Deposit Ratio) ratio in 2009 showed an increase, from 74% in 2008 to 75.7%. Meanwhile, thanks to the hard work of all the authorities, credit risk was maintained at a safe level in 2009 with an NPL ratio of 2.14% lower than the NPL ratio at the end of 2008 which reached 4.76%.

The number of banking institutions in South Kalimantan consists of 15 conventional commercial banks, 6 Islamic public banks, 24 rural credit banks (BPR) and 1 Sharia BPR, with a network of 196 offices, and 123 ATM support.

== Transportation ==
In South Kalimantan, there are various types of transportation used by the community. Comparison of the use of land and water transportation for the South Kalimantan region is quite balanced. This is due to the geographical factor of the South Kalimantan region which has many rivers and swamps, especially for the Banjarmasin area which is divided by rivers.

A road highways connects Palangka Raya in Central Kalimantan and Banjarmasin. The distance from Palangka Raya to Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan, for example, can be taken from 3 to 4 hours with a distance of about 180 km. Another highway also connects Banjarmasin to Balikpapan in East Kalimantan. The distance from Banjarmasin to Balikpapan can be taken around 11 to 12 hours with a distance about 470 km. Most of the road in South Kalimantan has been asphalted, however, there are some roads in the interior part of the province that is in a very poor condition. As there are many rivers in South Kalimantan, many bridges have been built to accommodate cars. Currently, the provincial government has disbursed funds of Rp 200 billion to continue the construction of a bridge that connects Kotabaru in Laut Island and Batulicin in the mainland. Construction is now still in the planning stage.

Syamsudin Noor International Airport is the main airport of Banjarmasin as well as the province in a whole. The airport serves inter-island flights to other major Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya and Yogyakarta. Moreover, the airport also serves inte-Kalimantan flights to cities such as Pontianak, Balikpapan and Samarinda. Currently, the airport is being developed. It is hoped that it can accommodate international flights in the future. There are other smaller airport in South Kalimantan, such as Gusti Syamsir Alam Airport in Kotabaru and Bersujud Airport in Batulicin. One of the main problem for air transportation in South Kalimantan is that the region is often enveloped with haze due to the forest fires.
Currently, there is no railway in South Kalimantan. However, the government is currently considering building a railway line between Batulicin and Banjarbaru, which would be part of the Trans-Kalimantan railway system. This would cut the trip from the originally 5 hours by road to only 2 hours. Until now, the government still has not determined the cooperation scheme for railways in South Kalimantan, whether it is purely a collaboration between the government and other business entities. Is the city district with its assets its beneficiaries, while the business entity to carry out its operations is still awaiting its continuation. The first segment, will connect Kandangan in South Hulu Sungai Regency and Rantau in Tapin Regency. This pathway has undergone the stage of environmental impact analysis (EIA), detailed engineering design (DED) and feasibility study. While the second segment which would connect Rantau-Martapura-Banjarbaru-Banjarmasin, a feasibility study has been conducted, while the environmental impact analysis (EIA) has also been carried out. Whereas for the third segment, namely Marabahan-Anjir Pasar-Wanaraya-Handil Bakti-Sungai Tabuk, the analysis of environmental impacts is still under discussion at the transportation ministry.

In addition to land transportation in South Kalimantan, there are also many known water transports because South Kalimantan does have many rivers and straits. Transportation such as ferries, klotok boats, and speedboats, etc. are also widely used.

== Tourism ==
In South Kalimantan there are some natural attractions that consist of natural forests, long rivers swerving, lakes and highlands or mountains. In addition to natural tourism, there are several cultural and historical tours in South Kalimantan that come from the heritage of the arts and culture of the region.

The city of Banjarmasin is known for its floating market (Indonesian and Banjarese: &quot;pasar apung&quot;). The floating market is a traditional market that is located on the Barito River and is open between 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 pm. Traders and buyers here all use means of transportation (a type of boat) to peddle and search for their merchandise. There are several floating markets in Banjarmasin. One of the legendary and popular is the Lok Baintan floating market on the Martapura River. In this Floating Market, traders sell their wares using wooden boats known as jukung, here people can buy various kinds of plantation and agricultural products as well as other merchandise such as clothes, cakes and fish. There also some Banjar specialties namely &quot;soto banjar&quot; and &quot;nasi sop banjar&quot;. Historically, like the typical market features of the past, this market was originally a place for exchanging goods between people from garden produce and agriculture, and now it uses money exchange tools.

Loksado has become a favorite for tourists not only locally but also overseas. This sub-district, located in South Hulu Sungai Regency, is home to the Meratus Mountains and a diversity of local cultures, including the Meratus Dayak people culture.

The city of Martapura, South Kalimantan is the focal point of a diamond industry.

== Cuisine ==
Banjarese cuisine has been influenced by many cultures, such as Malay, Javanese, Chinese and Indian. One of the famous culinary of this province is &quot;Soto Banjar&quot;.&quot;Soto banjar&quot; is served in many restaurants throughout the province. Soto banjar is a soto made from chicken meat as its main ingredient, then added with various spices such as onion, white onion, cumin, fennel, and cinnamon to make the soto more savoury. Additional juice from lime makes this dish eve more. fresh. This dish is usually served during lunchtime. The stalls selling &quot;Soto Banjar&quot; are not only in South Kalimantan. Outside of South Kalimantan there are also many stalls that sell &quot;Soto Banjar&quot;. &quot;Soto Banjar&quot; also has been adopted as one variant of Indomie instant noodle, representing Kalimantan cuisine.

<text>Central Kalimantan () is a province of Indonesia. It is one of five provinces in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. It is the largest province in Indonesia by area since 2022, bordered by West Kalimantan to the west, South Kalimantan and East Kalimantan to the east, Java Sea to the south and is separated narrowly from North Kalimantan and Malaysia by East Kalimantan&#x27;s Mahakam Ulu Regency. Its provincial capital is Palangka Raya and in 2010 its population was over 2.2 million, while the 2020 Census showed a total of almost 2.67 million; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,774,747 (comprising 1,434,119 males and 1,339,628 females), and was projected to rise to 2,809,700 at mid 2024.

The population growth rate was almost 3.0% per annum between 1990 and 2000, one of the highest provincial growth rates in Indonesia during that time; in the subsequent decade to 2010 the average annual growth rate slowed markedly to around 1.8%, but it rose again in the decade beginning 2010. More than is the case in other provinces on Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan is populated by the Dayaks, the indigenous inhabitants of Borneo.

== History ==
Since the eighteenth century the central region of Kalimantan and its Dayak inhabitants were ruled by the Muslim Sultanate of Banjar. Following Indonesian independence after World War II, Dayak tribes demanded a province separate from South Kalimantan province.

In 1957 South Kalimantan was divided to provide the Dayak population with greater autonomy from the Muslim population in the province. The change was approved by the Indonesian Government on 23 May 1957 under Presidential Law No. 10 Year 1957, which declared Central Kalimantan the seventeenth province of Indonesia. President Sukarno appointed the Dayak-born national hero Tjilik Riwut as the first Governor and Palangkaraya the provincial capital.

== Geography ==
Central Kalimantan is the largest Indonesian province by area (Papua held this position until the 2022 partition) with a size of , about 1.5 times the size of the island of Java and it is slightly larger than Bangladesh or the U.S. state of Illinois. It is bordered by West Kalimantan and East Kalimantan provinces to the north, by the Java Sea to the south, by South Kalimantan and East Kalimantan provinces to the east, and by West Kalimantan province to west.

The Schwaner Mountains stretch from the north-east of the province to the south-west, 80% of which is covered in dense forest, peatland swamps, mangroves, rivers and traditional agriculture land. Highland areas in the north-east are remote and not easily accessible. Non-volcanic mounts are scattered in this area including Kengkabang, Samiajang, Liang Pahang and Ulu Gedang.

The centre of the province is covered with tropical forest, which produces rattan, resin and valuable timber such as Ulin and Meranti. The southern lowlands are dominated by peatland swamps that intersect with many rivers. Sabangau National Park is a protected peatland area internationally acknowledged as sanctuary for the endangered Orangutan. Recently the peat swamp forests have been damaged by the Mega Rice Project, which unsuccessfully sought to turn large areas into rice paddies.

The province&#x27;s climate is wet weather equatorial zone with an eight-month rainy season, and 4 months of dry season. Rainfall or precipitation is 2,776—3,393 mm per year with an average of 145 rainy days annually.

=== Rivers ===
Central Kalimantan has numerous rivers from the catchment areas to the north in the Schwaner Mountains, flowing to the Java Sea. The major rivers include:
* Barito River (900 km)
* Kapuas River (600 km)
* Kahayan River (600 km)
* Katingan River (600 km)
* Mentaya (Sampit) River (400 km)
* Seruyan River (350 km)
* Lamandau River (300 km)
* Arut River (250 km)
* Sabangau River (200 km)
* Kumai River (179 km)
* Jelai River (100 km)

Rivers are an important mode of transportation and a primary location for settlement. With relatively undeveloped infrastructure, the province&#x27;s economy relies heavily on the rivers.

== Ecology ==
Based upon the research of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Central Kalimantan has approximately 10 different ecological regions and is dominated by two main ecological regions. Those two are peat ecological region which covered 26% of the total area of Central Kalimantan and the fluvial plain ecoregion which covered 21% of the whole area of Central Kalimantan. Due to its high concentration of peat ecological region, Central Kalimantan is prone to drought and peat fires during the dry season and inundation during the rainy season within each episodes of the ENSO and the IOD. These situations worsen because of massive deforestation in the region and climate change.

Central Kalimantan is also home for many endemic floras and faunas like orangutans, proboscis monkeys, hornbill birds, rattan, Bornean iron wood, etc. This province currently has three national parks i.e. Sabangau National Park, Tanjung Puting National Park, and Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park which are home to the endemic floras and faunas of Kalimantan.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Central Kalimantan Province, when separated from South Kalimantan in 1958, comprised three regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) - Barito, Kapuas and Kotawaringin. However on 26 June 1959 two of these were split - Barito Regency was divided into a South Barito Regency and a North Barito Regency, while Kotawaringin Regency was divided into a West Kotawaringin Regency and an East Kotawaringin Regency. On 14 June 1965 the provincial capital of Palangka Raya was split off from Kapuas Regency to form an independent city (&quot;kotamadya&quot;). 

On 10 April 2002 an additional eight regencies were created by splitting existing regencies - Sukamara and Lamandau from parts of West Kotawaringin Regency, Seruyan and Katingan from parts of East Kotawaringin Regency, Pulang Pisau and Gunung Mas from parts of Kapuas Regency, East Barito from part of South Barito Regency, and Murung Raya from part of North Barito Regency. Thus the province now is administratively divided into thirteen regencies (each headed by a regent) and the single city. These are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.

In addition to the civil service, Central Kalimantan also recognises a traditional governing system led by traditional leaders known as &quot;Damang&quot;. The province is divided into 67 traditional law areas known as &quot;Kedamangan&quot;, headed by &quot;Damang&quot;. The system is intended to culturally recognise and preserve the customs and heritage of the Dayak tribes.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Central Kalimantan Electoral District consists of all of the 13 regencies in the province, together with the city of Palangkaraya, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Railroads ==

A Russian company had been contracted to build railroads from Central Kalimantan to East Kalimantan for coal transportation, with an estimated cost of US$2.4 billion, that was expected to start in 2013 and be completed by 2017.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===

The total population of Central Kalimantan was 2,669,969 people based upon the national census in 2020; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,773,747. The sex ratio of this province is 107 which means there are 107 males to every 100 females. The population density of Central Kalimantan is only 18 people/km2.

=== Religion ===

According to the Statistics on 2021, the largest religious group in Central Kalimantan province is Islam with more than 74% of its total population. Then, the second largest group is Christianity with more than 19% of its total population. The rest of the population adhere to the local belief of Kaharingan, Hinduism, and Buddhism with more than 5%.
=== Ethnic groups ===

Central Kalimantan is predominantly inhabited by the Dayak people that would further be divided into three major Dayak sub-ethnics. The three major Dayak tribes in Central Kalimantan are the Ngaju, Ot Danum and Dusun Ma&#x27;anyan Ot Siang. The three major tribes extended into several branches of prominent Dayak tribes in Central Kalimantan such as Lawangan, Taboyan, Dusun Siang, Boyan, Bantian, Dohoi and Kadori.

In addition to the indigenous Dayak tribes, there are also ethnic groups from other areas of Indonesia, including Malays, Javanese, Madurese, Batak, Toraja, Ambonese, Bugis, Palembang, Minang, Banjarese, Makassar, Papuan, Balinese, Acehnese and also Chinese.

==Culture==
===Traditional music===
The most well-known traditional musical instrument from Central Kalimantan is Japen, Garantung, and Gandang Manca which are traditional Dayak musical instruments. These musical instruments are usually played during traditional procession or ritual. 

Japen or Kecapi is a lute-like instrument that is honored by Dayak people. This traditional musical instrument is usually played as an accompaniment for Central Kalimantan traditional music such as Karungut recitation, a Dayak oral literature in the form of musicalized rhyme scheme. Japen is mainly made of wood and nylon rope for its strings.

Garantung is a percussion instrument that is fairly similar with kempul in gamelan. It is a type of hanging gong that is normally played ensembly with Gandang Manca or Gandang Kembar. Gandang Manca itself is a two-headed drum of Dayak traditional musical instrument that is mainly made of wood for the body of the drum and leather membranes to cover the cavity at both ends that are tied by rattan rope. Both Garantung and Gandang Manca are commonly played ensembly as an accompaniment for Dayak traditional processions and rituals.

=== Traditional architecture ===
The most notable fine arts of Dayak people is the traditional house. The traditional house of Dayak people in Central Kalimantan is commonly called Huma Betang. Huma Betang or simply called Betang like many other traditional houses in Indonesia is built on stilts. This traditional house structure is mainly made of iron wood which is commonly anti-termite and resistant to high humidity, thus the house can stand up to hundreds of years. Huma Betang is very well-known for its huge and long size. The length of this house structure is usually between 30 and 150 metres, the width is somewhere between 5 and 30 metres, and the height is approximately 3 to 6 metres. Due to its huge and long size, this house can be occupied by up to 150 people and usually inhabited by one big family.
=== Traditional carving ===

Central Kalimantan is well-known for its unique traditional carving. The three most famous carving from this province are the three dimensional wood carving sculpture of Sapundu and the traditional weapons i.e. Mandau and Talawang.

Sapundu sculpture is a three dimensional wood carving in the form of humanoid statue. This sculpture is commonly adorned with decorative motifs or even colors. Sapundu sculpture is mainly made of Bornean iron wood and usually presents during Tiwah procession. In ancient times, Sapundu sculpture symbolized the social status of its owner and was believed to possess magical powers.

The &quot;Mandau&quot; and &quot;Talawang&quot; are the main traditional weapon of Dayak people in Central Kalimantan. The &quot;Mandau&quot; is a type of sword with a single edge blade i.e. one side is convex and the other side is concave. The &quot;Mandau&quot; consists of three different parts, which are (i) the &quot;Bilah&quot; or the blade that made of &quot;Mantikei&quot; iron plate with a sharp edge and is 70 cm long, (ii) the &quot;Pulang Gagang&quot; or the hilt that is usually made of wood, deer&#x27;s horns, or even human bones, and (iii) the &quot;Sarung&quot; or the sheath which covers the blade and is typically made of wood and usually covered with bracelet-shaped bone on the upper part and wrapped by rattan rope.

The &quot;Talawang&quot; is a shield that mainly made of Bornean iron wood that is carved with certain motifs and adorned with some bright colors. In ancient times, this weapon was used as a protection against wild animals and enemy&#x27;s arrows and sword slashes. However, the function currently shifts to become a decorative ornament of Kaharingan temples, public buildings, or even people&#x27;s houses mostly in Central Kalimantan.

=== Traditional dance ===
Central Kalimantan is home for various sub-ethnics of Dayak tribe. Each of those Dayak sub-ethnics live spread out across all regencies in Central Kalimantan. This makes every regency have their own unique traditional dances. These are some of the traditional dances from Central Kalimantan:
# Kinyah Mandau Hatue Dance, originating from Kapuas Regency and depicting theatrical war and martial arts of Dayak tribes in ancient time.
# Giring-Giring Dance, coming from East Barito Regency and usually performed in group of 6 to 10 people.
# Walian Dadas Dance, originating from South Barito Regency and used to be performed as a way to heal a region from negativity.
# Babukung Dance, originally from Lamandau Regency and performed during funeral especially among Dayak Tomun people.
# Tambun Bungai Dance, originating from Palangka Raya city and depicting heroic action of Tambung and Bungai protecting the territory from enemy who tried to loot people&#x27;s crops.

<text>Evan James (also known by the bardic name Ieuan ap Iago) (18 January 1809 – 30 September 1878), was a Welsh weaver and poet from Pontypridd, originally from Caerphilly, Wales, who wrote the lyrics of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Land of my Fathers&quot;), the national anthem of Wales.
James, a weaver by trade, employed several people at his mill on the bank of the River Rhondda. According to family legend, his son James James, was walking one day in January 1856 on the banks of the river when the melody for &quot;Hen Wlad fy Nhadau&quot; came to him. When he gave the tune to his father, Evan James was able to compose the words which are the present-day Welsh national anthem. It is likely that James senior was inspired by the fact that two of his brothers had emigrated to the United States and had written in praise of their adoptive country and urging him to join them.

A memorial to Evan James and his son, in the form of two figures, representing Poetry and Music, stands in Ynysangharad War Memorial Park, Pontypridd. Evan&#x27;s face is shown alongside that of his son, but appears younger because the photographs available to the sculptor, Goscombe John, were taken many years apart.

<text>East Kalimantan (Indonesian: ) is a province of Indonesia. Its territory comprises the eastern portion of Borneo/Kalimantan. It had a population of about 3.03 million at the 2010 census (within the current boundary), 3.42 million at the 2015 census, and 3.766 million at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 4,030,488. Its capital is the city of Samarinda.

East Kalimantan has a total area of and is the third least densely populated province in Kalimantan (after North Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan). The majority of the region shares a maritime border to the east with West Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi; its Cape Mangkalihat separates the Makassar Strait from the Celebes Sea. Its former northernmost region was split off on 25 October 2012 and is now North Kalimantan; meanwhile it still shares land border to the west with West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan; to its south, East Kalimantan borders South Kalimantan. The province bordered Sabah before the split, but still borders Sarawak, Malaysia through Mahakam Ulu Regency.

East Kalimantan is now divided into seven regencies and three cities. Akmal Malik is the current acting governor of East Kalimantan.

== New national capital ==

The province will host the future capital city of Indonesia that will be built on the borders of Kutai Kartanegara and Penajam North Paser Regencies. The future capital is to be named Nusantara, with construction originally projected to start in 2020, and intended to conclude in 2024. However, at a hearing before Committee V of Indonesia&#x27;s House of Representatives on 9 June 2020, a government representative asserted that the government had not allocated the 2022 budget for the project (for 2022, the ministry proposed a budget worth over 100.46 trillion rupiah - over 7 billion US$ - a steep reduction from the figure of 149.81 trillion rupiah in 2021). Earlier, the National Planning Development Authority had said that the total sum needed to move the capital from its current location in Jakarta to East Kalimantan province amounted to 486 trillion rupiah, of which 265.2 trillion will be mobilised through the public-private partnership (PPP), 127.3 trillion from private special funds, and 93.5 trillion from the state budget. But the Ministry of Finance said that the government switched its priorities to mitigating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ministry announced that it had not allocated budget for the new capital project. Nevertheless, the new national capital was formally inaugurated in August 2024.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

East Kalimantan was once mostly covered by tropical rainforest. In prehistoric times, there was limestone cave called &quot;Lubang Jeriji Saléh&quot; located in the Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst in the district of Bengalon, East Kutai, believed to contain one of the oldest figurative art in the world. The cave paintings were first spotted in 1994 by the French explorer Luc-Henri Fage and the French archaeologist Jean-Michel Chazine, from Kalimanthrope. In 2018, a team of scientists investigating the cave, led by Maxime Aubert from Griffith University and Pindi Setiawan from the Bandung Institute of Technology, published a report in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; identifying the paintings as the world&#x27;s oldest known figurative art. The team had previously investigated cave paintings in the neighbouring island of Sulawesi. In order to date the paintings, the team used dating techniques on the calcium carbonate (limestone) deposits close to them.

=== 4th century to 17th century ===

East Kalimantan is home to several kingdoms, such as the first and oldest Hindu kingdom of Indonesia, the Kingdom of Kutai Martadipura founded in the 4th century CE, it was then succeeded by the Sultanate of Kutai ing Martadipura in the 14th century CE. Other kingdoms are also located in East Kalimantan such as the Sultanate of Pasir. East Kalimantan region include Pasir, Kutai, Berau and also Karasikan (Buranun / pre-Sultanate of Sulu) claimed as conquered territory Suryanata Maharaja, the governor of Majapahit in the State Dipa (which is located in the Great Temple in Amuntai) until 1620 in the Sultanate of Banjar. However, in the Chinese History Annals, Ming shi 明史, at 1417, some parts of the eastern Kalimantan was recorded as a kingdom under the rule of the Philippine kingdom of then Hindu Sulu as Kalimantan was ruled by a Sulu monarch named Mahalatu Gelamading (Maharaja Klainbantangan) where his title, Klainbantangan, in Chinese rendering, was named after his territory Kalimantan. At this point in time, Sulu had rebelled against Majapahit rule and had invaded Northeast and East Borneo until the very territory of Kalimantan. Between the years 1620–1624, kingdoms in East Kalimantan turned into an area influence of the Sultanate of Sultan Alauddin Makassar, before the Bungaya agreement. According to the Hikayat Banjar, the Sultan of Makassar never borrowed land for trade covers an area east and southeast of Borneo to the Sultan Mustain Billah of Banjar when Kiai Martasura sent to Makassar and entered into an agreement with the Sultan Tallo I Mangngadaccinna Daeng I Ba&#x27;le &#x27;Sultan Mahmud Karaeng Pattingalloang, which became Mangkubumi and principal advisor to the Sultan Muhammad Said, king of Gowa in 1638–1654 and also in-law of Sultan Hasanuddin, which will make the East Kalimantan region as a place to trade for the Sultanate of Makassar (Gowa-Tallo), since that began to arrive people from South Sulawesi. However, based on the agreement between the Sultanate of Banjar and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1635, VOC help Banjar restore lands in East Kalimantan into spheres of influence of the Sultanate of Banjar. It is embodied in the Bungaya agreement, that the Sultanate of Makassar are not allowed to trade up to the east and the north Borneo.

=== 18th century to 20th century ===
In accordance with treaties, on January 1, 1817, Sultan Sulaiman of Banjar handed East Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, part of West and South Kalimantan (including Banjarmasin) over to the Dutch East Indies. On May 4, 1826, Sultan Adam al-wathiq Billah of Banjar reaffirmed the handover of these territories to the Dutch East Indies colonial administration. In 1846, the Dutch began to put a Resident Assistant in East Borneo at Samarinda (now the province of East Kalimantan and the eastern part of South Kalimantan) named H. Von Dewall. East Kalimantan was then part of the Dutch East Indies. East Kalimantan with its then administrative area was established based on the Law No. 25 of 1956 with the first governor being APT Pranoto.

=== Split of North Kalimantan province ===
North Kalimantan was formally inaugurated as the 34th province of Indonesia on April 15, 2013. The new province was previously part of East Kalimantan Province.

== Geography ==
East Kalimantan Province comprises a land area of 125,336.81 square kilometers and a comprehensive ocean management area of 25,656 km2, located between 113°44&#x27;E and 119°00&#x27;E, and between 2°33&#x27;N and 2°25&#x27;S. The province is divided into seven regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and three cities (&quot;kota&quot;), together subdivided into 103 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) and then into 1,026 villages (rural &quot;desa&quot; and urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;). The regencies (with their administrative capitals) and cities are enumerated below. East Kalimantan is one of the main gates to the eastern part of Indonesia. The area is also known as a storehouse of timber and mining, has hundreds of rivers (scattered across almost all regencies and cities) which area the main means of transportation in addition to land transport, with the longest river being the Mahakam.

East Kalimantan borders North Kalimantan in the north, South Kalimantan in the south, Central Kalimantan in the southwest, and West Kalimantan and Sarawak in the east. It touches the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait in the east, with its large Mangkalihat Peninsula separating the two. There are hills in almost all districts, and there are numerous lakes. Most lakes are located in the Kutai Regency, with the most extensive lakes, Semayang and Melintang, having an area of 13,000 ha and 11,000 ha respectively.

=== Climate ===
Such as the climate of Indonesia in general, East Kalimantan tropical climate and has two seasons, dry and rainy seasons. The dry season usually occurs in May to October, while the rainy season in November to April. This situation continued every year interspersed with transitional season in certain months. Moreover, because of its location on the equator, the climate in East Kalimantan are also affected by wind monsoon, monsoon wind is November–April west and east monsoon winds from May to October. In recent years, the situation in East Kalimantan season is sometimes erratic. In the months that it is supposed to rain, there is no rain at all, or vice versa in the months that should be dry it rains for a much longer time.

==== Temperature and humidity ====
Temperatures somewhere high and low are determined by the area of the ocean surface and the distance from the beach. In general, East Kalimantan hot climates with temperatures in 2013 ranged from 21.6 °C in Berau October to 35.6 °C in Berau in September. Aside from being a tropical area with extensive forests, in 2013 the average humidity between 83 and 87 percent of East Kalimantan. The lowest air humidity observed by the meteorological station Samarinda happens in a few months with 82 percent humidity. While the highest occurred in Berau in February with 91 percent humidity.

==== Rainfall and wind conditions ====
Rainfall in East Kalimantan region varies by month and location of monitoring stations. Average highest rainfall recorded at the Meteorological Station Berau amounted to 245.1 mm and the lowest for the year 2013 was recorded at the Meteorological Station Samarinda is 237.8 mm. At some monitoring stations monitor wind conditions in East Kalimantan in 2013. Observations show that wind speeds between 3 and 4 knots. The highest wind speed was 4 knots in Balikpapan and Berau, while the lowest was 3 knots in Samarinda.

== Government and administrative divisions ==

=== Administrative divisions ===
As of 2025, East Kalimantan consists of 7 regencies and 3 cities.

== Ecology ==
Illegal logging has removed much of the original forests of the province. Less than half the original forest remains in places such as the Kayan Mentarang and the Kutai national parks.

The projects that supports tropical rainforest conservation includes a WWF project and Samboja Lestari lodge, one of Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation&#x27;s reforestation and orangutan rehabilitation projects.

== Economy ==
East Kalimantan&#x27;s economy heavily depends on earth resources such as oilfield exploration, natural gas, coal and gold. Balikpapan has an oil refinery plant that was built by Dutch governance before World War II, destroyed during World War II, and rebuilt after Indonesian independence.

Other developing economic sectors include agriculture and tourism.

Obstacles to economic development include a lack of transportation infrastructure. Transportation depends on traditional boats connecting coastal cities and areas along main river, Mahakam River.

In 2012, Russia&#x27;s state railway firm Joint Stock Company (JSC) signed a memorandum of understanding with the East Kalimantan governor over railway lines to transport coal and other freight. The first stage will connect an area near Balikpapan port to West Kutai Regency in a 183-kilometer line and is estimated to cost about $1.8 billion. It will commence in 2013 and by 2017 it is hoped that it carry 20 million tons of coal annually. The second phase will connect a line to Murung Raya in Central Kalimantan with a 60 kilometer line, which will cost an estimated $600 million.

Several oil fields have been discovered in the Mahakam River Delta including Attaka, Badak (1971), Semberah, Nilam, Sanga Sanga, Bekapai (1972), Handil (1974), Samboja, Jakin and Sepinggan. The Handil, Badak and Bekapai fields are anticline structural traps with oil reservoir sandstones between 450 and 2900 m. The delta is in the Kutai basin, bounded by the Mankalihat and Paternoster carbonate arch, containing Eocene shales overlain by Oligocene fluvial deposits during marine regression, culminating in the formation of the delta in the late Miocene.

== Demographics ==

Within the current boundary, East Kalimantan was populated by 3,028,487 people as of 2010.
=== Ethnicity ===

The most populous ethnic group in East Kalimantan is the Javanese (29.55%) who are spread in almost all regions, especially the transmigration areas to urban areas. The second largest ethnic group is Bugis (18.26%), which occupy many coastal areas and urban areas. The third largest ethnicity is Banjar (13.94%) who are quite dominant in the city of Samarinda and Balikpapan. East Kalimantan is a major destination of migrants from Jawa, Sulawesi and South Kalimantan.With population of approximately 3.859 million, and area of 127,347 km2, the province is considered sparsely populated.

The fourth largest group is the Dayak (9.91%), which occupies the interior part of the province. Kutai (9.21%) which inhabit Kutai Kartanegara, East Kutai and West Kutai, was fifth. In the sixth to ten consecutively are Toraja (1.16%), Paser (1.89%), Sunda (1.59%), Madura (1.24%) and Auto Buton (1.25%), and the rest are other groups from various regions in Indonesia.

=== Language ===
People in East Kalimantan generally use Indonesian in official purposes and Banjarese for inter-ethnic communication. Due to the large number of Banjarese people in the province, their language became the main lingua franca especially in cities like Samarinda and Balikpapan. Besides Banjarese, there is a significant presence of Javanese and Buginese speakers as well, due to the large migration of Javanese and Buginese people into the region.

Other languages spoken in East Kalimantan is Kutai Malay (a distinct Malay variety closely related but distinct from Banjarese), Paser (related to Lawangan), Tidung, Berau Malay, Tunjung, Bahau, Modang Lundayeh and more others. However, Kutai, Paser, and Kenyah languages are considered under the threat of extinction.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2021 estimates, 3,320,000 people are Muslims, 286,150 are Protestants, 168,140 are Roman Catholics, 15,630 are Buddhists, 8,500 are Hindus and 308 are Confucians or adhere to folk religions.

<text>William Arthur Johnson (born January 27, 1952), better known as Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson, is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL) from 1974 through 1988. A 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time NFL Team selection, Johnson was one of the first players to display elaborate celebrations in the end zone.

==Early life==
Johnson earned the nickname &quot;White Shoes&quot; in high school in the Chichester School District in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, where he dyed his shoes as part of a dare. Johnson attended Division III school Widener College in Pennsylvania, where he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. As a 5&#x27;9&quot;, 170-pound sophomore, Johnson was named to the 1972 Associated Press College Division All-American team. Johnson was drafted by the Houston Oilers, in the 15th round of the 1974 NFL draft.

==Professional career==

===Houston Oilers===
Johnson joined the Houston Oilers as a kickoff returner, with his speed and quickness becoming an occasional part of the offense. As a rookie, he began celebrating touchdowns with a dance known as the &quot;Funky Chicken&quot;, a dance based on a song from soul singer Rufus Thomas. It was one of the first touchdown celebrations in league history.

As a kick returner, Johnson returned five punts for touchdowns, along with two kickoffs, in his first four years with the Oilers, and added 12 more touchdowns on offense. He was selected to the Pro Bowl as a kick returner in 1975, and was named MVP of the game, during which he returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown. He made another Pro Bowl appearance in 1977. In 1979, he suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss most of the next two seasons and lingered with him for the rest of his career. When he returned in 1980, he was no longer the kick returner, serving only as a backup wide receiver.

===CFL and the Atlanta Falcons===
Johnson played the 1981 season in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes. He caught 65 passes for 1,060 yards and five touchdowns, and returned 59 punts for 597 yards. He returned to the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons in 1982. In 1983, he doubled as a full-time kick returner, where he scored his sixth career touchdown on a punt return, and starting wide receiver, leading the team in receptions. Johnson earned his third Pro Bowl berth that season. Most notably, he caught a Hail Mary pass to defeat the San Francisco 49ers. He missed most of 1984 due to injury, and was benched as a return man in 1985. Johnson was forced to curtail his end-zone dances after the NFL instituted a rule against excessive and premeditated celebration. He led the Falcons in receptions and receiving yards in 1985. Johnson was injured in 1986 and retired after the 1987 season, although he played one game for the Washington Redskins in 1988.
==Coaching career==
Johnson is an assistant varsity football coach at Duluth High School in Duluth, Georgia.

==Professional softball career==
Johnson appeared in 25 games for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Professional Slo-Pitch Softball League (APSPL) in 1978, one of several men&#x27;s professional softball leagues, batting .349 with four home-runs.

==Honors==
In 1994, Johnson was selected as the punt returner on the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. His was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.

Johnson is the only man selected to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team who is not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Johnson is one of 29 individuals to be selected to multiple All-Decade teams. On December 17, 2023, Johnson was inducted into the Tennessee Titans Ring of Honor.

<text>South Sumatra () is a province of Indonesia, located in the southeast of the island of Sumatra. The capital and largest city of the province is the city of Palembang. The province borders the provinces of Jambi to the north, Bengkulu to the west and Lampung to the south, as well a maritime border with the Bangka Belitung Islands to the east. It is the largest province in the island of Sumatra, and it is slightly smaller than Portugal, the department of Boquerón in Paraguay or the U.S. state of Maine. The Bangka Strait in the east separates South Sumatra and the island of Bangka, which is part of the Bangka Belitung Islands province. The province has an area of and had a population of 8,467,432 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 8,743,522 (comprising 4,453,902 males and 4,289,620 females). The province is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, natural gas and coal. The province is inhabited by many different Malay sub ethnic groups, with Palembangese being largest ethnic group. Most speak the Palembang language, which is mutually intelligible to both Indonesian and local Palembang Malay. Other ethnic groups include the Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau and Chinese. Most are concentrated in urban areas and are largely immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.

==History==
===Pre-history===
South Sumatra has been settled by humans since the Palaeolithic era. The evidence of those settlements is proven by discoveries of Palaeolithic tools in the riverbed of Saling and Kikim rivers in Bungamas Village, Lahat Regency and Seventy-eight skeletons dating back to 3,000–14,000 years ago, presumably of Austronesian and Austromelanesoid origins was excavated from the site of Harimau Cave in Padang Bindu Village, Ogan Komering Ulu Regency. Relics of seven stone chambers believed to be about 2,500 years old were found near a coffee plantation in Kotaraya Lembak, Lahat Regency.

===Srivijaya===
Around 7th century AD, an ancient Buddhist kingdom of Srivijaya was established in an area that&#x27;s now Palembang. This kingdom became the center of trade and was a maritime power, but this kingdom did not expand its power outside the islands of Southeast Asia, with the exception of contributing to the population of Madagascar as far as 3,300 miles west. Some experts are still debating the area that was the center of the Srivijaya Kingdom. It was likely that the kingdom used to move its administrative center, but the capital remained directly governed by the authorities, while the supporting areas were governed by the local &quot;datuk&quot;.

In the 7th century, the Chinese noted that there were two kingdoms namely &quot;Malayu&quot; and &quot;Kedah&quot; that were part of the Srivijaya empire.

The Srivijaya empire had existed since 671 according to the notes of the Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing. From the Kedukan Bukit inscription in 682, this empire became known under the leadership of Dapunta Hyang. That he departed on the &quot;siddhayatra&quot; holy journey to &quot;take blessings&quot;, and led 20,000 soldiers and 312 people on board with 1,312 soldiers on foot from Minanga Tamwan to Jambi and Palembang. The Kedukan Bukit Inscription is reputed to be the oldest inscription written in Malay. Experts argue that the writer of this inscription adapted Indian orthography.

Based on the &quot;Kota Kapur&quot; Inscription dated from 686 CE that is found on the island of Bangka, this empire has dominated the southern part of Sumatra, the islands of Bangka and Belitung, to Lampung. This inscription also mentions that Emperor Sri Jayanasa launched a military expedition to punish the &quot;Bhumi Jawa&quot; kingdom who were not loyal to Srivijaya, this event coincided with the collapse of Tarumanagara in West Java and &quot;Holing&quot; (Kalingga) in Central Java, which was most likely due to Sriwijaya&#x27;s attack. It is also possible that the Bhumi Jawa kingdom mentioned in the inscription is referring to the Kingdom of Tarumanegara. Srivijaya continued to grow and succeeded in controlling the maritime trade routes in the Straits of Malacca, the Sunda Strait, the South China Sea, the Java Sea and the Karimata Strait.

The expansion of this kingdom into Java and the Malay Peninsula, allowed Srivijaya to control the main trade routes in Southeast Asia. Archeologist found the ruins of Srivijaya temples as far as Thailand and Cambodia. In the 7th century, the port of Champa in eastern Indochina began to divert traders from Srivijaya. To prevent this, Maharaja Dharmasetu launched several attacks on coastal cities in Indochina. The city of Indrapura on the banks of the Mekong river was captured by Srivijaya in the early 8th century. Srivijaya continued its domination of Cambodia, until the Khmer king Jayawarman II, founder of the Khmer Empire, severed ties with Srivijaya in the same century. At the end of the 8th century some kingdoms in Java, including Tarumanegara and Holing, were under the rule of Srivijaya. According to records, during this period the Sailendra people migrated to Central Java and ruled there. In the same century, the Langkasuka kingdom in the Malay peninsula became part of the kingdom. In the following period, Pan Pan and Trambralinga, located north of Langkasuka, were also under the influence of Srivijaya.

Based on historical records from Arabia, Srivijaya was called &quot;Sribuza&quot;. In 955 CE, Al Masudi, a traveler and classical Arab historian wrote about Srivijaya, describing it as a large kingdom that was rich, with many soldiers. Srivijaya&#x27;s produced camphor, agarwood, cloves, sandalwood, nutmeg, cardamom and gambier. Another note from a Persian expert named Abu Zaid Hasan who received information from Sujaimana, an Arab trader, that the empire was well-advanced in the field of agriculture. Abu Zaid wrote that the kingdom of &quot;Zabaj&quot; (another Arabic name for Srivijaya) had fertile land and extensive power to the other side of the sea.

Srivijaya controlled the maritime trade route in Southeast Asia throughout the 10th century, but at the end of the century the Kingdom of Medang in East Java grew into a new maritime force and began to challenge the dominance of Srivijaya. The Chinese news from the Song dynasty called the Srivijaya Kingdom in Sumatra the name &quot;San-fo-tsi&quot;, while the Kingdom of Medang in Java by the name &quot;She-po&quot;. It is said that &quot;San-fo-tsi&quot; and &quot;She-po&quot; were involved in competition for control of Southeast Asia. Both countries sent ambassadors to each other to China. The &quot;San-fo-tsi&quot; ambassador who departed in 988 was held in Canton when he returned, because his country was attacked by Javanese troops. This attack from Java allegedly took place around the 990s, between 988 and 992 during the reign of Sri Cudamani Warmadewa.

The kingdom of Medang succeeded in capturing Palembang in 992 for a while, but later the Medang forces were successfully repelled by Srivijaya forces. The &quot;Hujung Langit&quot; inscription of 997 mentions a Javanese attack on Sumatra. This series of attacks from Java ultimately failed because Java failed to establish a foothold in Sumatra. Capturing the capital city of Palembang was not enough because the Sriwijaya spread itself in several port cities in the Malacca Strait. The Srivijaya emperor, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, escaped out of the capital and traveled around regaining its strength and reinforcements from his allies and subordinate kings and succeeded in repelling the Javanese navy.

In 1025, the empire was defeated by the Chola Empire (during the period of Emperor Rajendra Chola I) of southern India. The Chola Empire had conquered the Srivijaya colonies, such as the Nicobar Islands region and at the same time succeeded in capturing the ruling Srivijaya king Sangrama Vijayatunggavarman. During the following decades, the entire Sriwijaya empire was under the influence of the Chola dynasty. Rajendra Chola I gave the opportunity to the kings he conquered to remain in power while remaining subservient to him. Srivijaya&#x27;s capital eventually moved northward to Jambi. This can be attributed to the news of the &quot;San-fo-ts&#x27;i&quot; delegation to China in 1028. Another factor in Sriwijaya&#x27;s decline was natural factors. Because of the sedimentation of mud on the Musi River and several other tributaries, the merchant ships arriving in Palembang diminished. As a result, the city of Palembang is getting away from the sea and not being strategic. As a result of the coming of the merchant ship, the tax decreased and weakened the economy and position of Sriwijaya.

According to the Chinese Song dynasty book &quot;Zhu Fan Zhi&quot;, written around 1225 by Zhao Rugua, the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the Southeast Asian archipelago were Srivijaya and Java (Kediri), with the western part (Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java/Sunda) under Srivijaya&#x27;s rule and the eastern part under Kediri&#x27;s domination. It said that the people in Java followed two religions, Buddhism and the religion of Brahmins (Hinduism), while the people of Srivijaya followed Buddhism. The book described the people of Java as being brave, short-tempered and willing to fight. It also noted their favourite pastimes as cockfighting and pig fighting. The coin used as the currency were made from a mixture of copper, silver, and tin.

Srivijaya remained a formidable sea power until the 13th century. According to George Cœdès, at the end of the 13th century, the empire &quot;had ceased to exist... caused by the simultaneous pressure on its two flanks of Siam and Java.&quot; However, there was a power vacuum in the region since there was no prominent power to hold the region except for the waning Majapahit Empire, centered on Java island. The vacuum allowed pirates to flourish in the region.

After being conquered by the Majapahit in 1375 AD, the Palembang region was made a vassal of the Majapahit Empire, under the leadership of Hayam Wuruk. The government in Palembang was handed over to a regent who was appointed directly by the Majapahit. However, internal problems in the Majapahit Empire distracted them from the conquered territories, causing the Palembang region to be controlled by traders from China until the Majapahit regained control of Palembang after sending a commander named Arya Damar.

===Palembang Sultanate===
By the late 15th century, Islam has spread throughout the region, replacing Buddhism and Hinduism as the dominant religion. Around the early 16th century, Tomé Pires, an adventurer from Portugal, said that Palembang had been led by an appointed &quot;patih&quot; (regent) from Java who was later referred to the Demak Sultanate and participated in attacking Malacca, which at that time had been controlled by the Portuguese. In 1659, Sri Susuhunan Abdurrahman proclaimed the establishment of the Palembang Sultanate. The Sultanate of Palembang stood for almost two centuries, from 1659 to 1825. Sultan Ratu Abdurrahman Kholifatul Mukminin Sayidul Iman, or Sunan Cinde Walang, was the first king of the Sultanate of Palembang.

The reign of Sultan Muhammad Bahauddin (1776–1803) was known as the golden era of the Palembang Sultanate, the sultanate&#x27;s economy increased sharply because of trade, including with the VOC. The VOC was upset with Sultan Bahauddin&#x27;s trade monopoly which caused their contracts to be rejected often. Sultan Bahauddin preferred to trade with Britain, China and Malay people in Riau. The impact of the policy generated enormous wealth for the empire. The Palembang Sultanate was strategically located in conducting trade relations, especially spices with outside parties. The Palembang Sultanate also ruled over the Bangka-Belitung islands which had a tin mine and had been traded since the 18th century.

As the Dutch East India Company increased its influence in the region, the Sultanate started to decline and lost its power. During Napoleonic Wars in 1812, the sultan at the time, Mahmud Badaruddin II rejected British claims to suzerainty. The British, under Stamford Raffles responded by attacking Palembang, sacking the court, and installing sultan&#x27;s more cooperative younger brother, Najamuddin to the throne. The Dutch attempted to recover their influence at the court in 1816, but Sultan Najamuddin was uncooperative with them. An expedition launched by the Dutch in 1818 and captured Sultan Najamudin and exiled him to Batavia. A Dutch garrison was established in 1821, but sultan attempted an attack and a mass poisoning to the garrison, which were intervened by the Dutch. Mahmud Badaruddin II was exiled to Ternate, and his palace was burned to the ground. The Sultanate was later abolished by the Dutch and direct colonial rule was established.

===Japanese occupation and independence===
Southern Sumatra was occupied by the Japanese on January 15, 1942, after the Battle of Palembang in World War II. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, South Sumatra became a part of Sumatra Province as a residency with Adnan Kapau Gani as the resident. On January 1, 1947, the Dutch tried to regain its sovereignty over South Sumatra by invading Palembang and fighting ensued across South Sumatra until Indonesia&#x27;s independence was recognized by the Dutch on December 27, 1949. The area occupied by the Netherlands in South Sumatra was incorporated into State of South Sumatra under the United States of Indonesia until the disbandment of the union and the founding of the republic.

===Post-independence division of the province===
On 12 September 1950, South Sumatra province was established with a territory much larger than it is today, as it encompassed the southern third of Sumatra island covering areas that were eventually formed into separate provinces: Lampung was carved from the southern part of the province in 1964, Bengkulu from the coastal western part of the province in 1967, and Bangka Belitung on 4 December 2000.

==Geography==
South Sumatra has an area of and is located on the island of Sumatra, western Indonesia which lies south of the equator at 1–4 degrees south and 102–108 degrees east. The province is bordered by Jambi to the north, Lampung to the south and Bengkulu to the west, while in the east the Bangka Strait separates the province and the island-province of Bangka Belitung Islands.

On the east coast the land consists of swamps and brackets which are affected by tides. Its vegetation is in the form of palmate plants and mangrove. A little more western is a vast lowland. Far to the west near the border of Bengkulu and Jambi lies the Bukit Barisan mountains, which divides South Sumatra and is a mountainous area with an altitude of above sea level. Barisan Hill consists of the summit of Mount Seminung ( asl), Mount Dempo ( asl), Mount Patah ( asl), and Mount Bungkuk ( asl). To the west of Bukit Barisan is a slope. In the Bukit Barisan valley there are areas of rubber, oil palm, and agriculture plantations, especially coffee, tea and vegetables. Mount Dempo is the highest point in the province.

South Sumatra has large rivers that can be navigated, but currently, because of the silting process, cannot be navigated by large ships. Most of the rivers have flows from the Bukit Barisan mountains, except the Mesuji, Lalan and Banyuasin River. Most water from the South Sumatra section of Bukit Barisan mountains flows eastwards into Bangka Strait as Musi River, with Ogan, Komering, Lematang, Kelingi, Lakitan, Rupit River and Rawas River are its major tributaries. A few rivers in South Sumatra flow westwards into Indian Ocean, for example Manna River in Pagaralam and Tanjung Sakti.

In January 2020, two islands in South Sumatra, Betet Island and Gundul Island, were submerged as a result of climate change, and four other islands were close to being submerged.

The province is home to several nature reserves, including Isau-Isau Wildlife Reserve.

=== Climate ===
As in most other province of Indonesia, South Sumatra has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall. Throughout the year the province is only affected by two seasons, namely the rainy season and the dry season. The air temperature varies from 24.7 to 32.9 degrees Celsius with air humidity levels ranging from 82% to 88%. The relative rainy season falls from October to April. Variation in rainfall ranges from . December is the month with the most rainfall while the drier season usually occurs from June to September.

The climate in South Sumatra is similar to other regions in Indonesia, only known for two seasons, namely the dry season and the rainy season. From June to September southeast winds flow from Australia with relatively less water vapor, resulting in a drier season. Conversely in December to March many wind currents contain water vapor from Asia and the Pacific Ocean during the rainy season. Such conditions occur every half year after passing the transition periods in between April–May and October–November.

== Governors ==
==Government and administrative divisions==

The capital of South Sumatra province is Palembang. As at 2000 this province was divided into six regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) - Lahat, Muara Enim, Musi Banyuasin, Musi Rawas, Ogan Komering Ilir and Ogan Komering Ulu - plus the autonomous city (&quot;kota&quot;) of Palembang. On 21 June 2001 three new autonomous cities were created - Lubuklinggau from part of Musi Rawas Regency, Pagar Alam from part of Lahat Regency, and Prabumulih from part of Muara Enim Regency. A seventh regency - Banyuasin - was formed on 10 April 2002 from part of Musi Banyuasin Regency; and three further regencies were created on 18 December 2003 - Ogan Ilir from part of Ogan Komering Ilir, and South Ogan Komering Ulu and East Ogan Komering Ulu from parts of Ogan Komering Ulu Regency.

An eleventh Regency - Empat Lawang - was formed on 2 January 2007 from part of Lahat Regency. Two new regencies have subsequently been created by the splitting of existing ones—Penukal Abab Lematang Ilir from part of Muara Enim Regency on 14 December 2012, and North Musi Rawas from part of Musi Rawas Regency on 10 June 2013. All thirteen regencies and the four cities are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. It was announced in 2022 that the east-central part of Muara Enim Regency was to be split off to form a fourteenth regency - Rambang Lubai Lematang; however, this has not been enacted by 2024, because of the moratorium maintained since 2013 by the Indonesian Government on the creation of new regencies and cities, so no statistics relating to this latest division are yet available.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Sumatra I Electoral District consists of 4 of the regencies in the province (Musi Rawas, Musi Banyuasin, Banyuasin and North Musi Rawas), together with the cities of Palembang and Lubuklinggau, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Sumatra II Electoral District consists of the remaining 9 regencies (Ogan Komering Ulu, Ogan Komering Ilir, Muara Enim, Lahat, East Ogan Komering Ulu, South Ogan Komering Ulu, Ogan Ilir, Empat Lawang and Penukal Abab Lematang Ilir), together with the cities of Pagar Alam and Prabumulih, and elects 9 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Demographics==
=== Ethnic groups ===
The province has no clear ethnic dominance, though the indigenous Musi-speaking Palembang have a plurality, followed by the Javanese, most of whom have been recent migrants from Java as part of the government-sanctioned transmigration project created to balance the population, especially from the highly overpopulated Java island; as a result, Javanese is also widely spoken and understood, especially in areas with a high population of transmigrant, for example Belitang. Forming the next largest group is the other Malayic-speaking populations as well as the Komering, a distinct Malayo-Polynesian people related to the native Lampungese from neighboring Lampung. Minangkabau, Chinese, and Sundanese also form minorities in the province.

The Palembang people are the majority in this province, divided into two groups: &quot;Wong Jeroo&quot; is a descendant of nobility and is slightly lower than the courtiers from the past kingdom based in Palembang, and &quot;Wong Jabo&quot; is a commoner. An expert on the origin of Palembang people who are also descendants of the king, admitted that the Palembang people were the descendants of Arabs, Chinese, Javanese and other ethnic groups in Indonesia. The Palembang people themselves have two different languages, namely &quot;Baso Palembang Alus&quot; and &quot;Baso Palembang Sari-Sari&quot;. The Palembang people still lives in a house built on water. The architectural model of the Palembang house which is most typical is the &quot;rumah limas&quot; which is mostly erected on stilts on the water to protect from flooding that continues to occur until now. In the Musi river area, Palembang people often offer their wares on boats.

The Komering are one of the tribes or cultural regions in South Sumatra, located along the Komering River.

While Indonesian is the official language in the province, most of the Malays speak a dialect of the Malay language called the Palembang Malay or Musi. Currently, Palembang Malay has become the lingua franca in the region. Palembang Malay originated from the Old Malay language which blends with Javanese and is pronounced according to the accent of the Palembang people. Moreover, this language has absorbed words from Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Chinese, Portuguese, English and Dutch, because Palembang was once a large trading city, attracting various kinds of merchants from various places. In the past, Palembang Malay was written with the Jawi script, a modified version of the Arabic script. Nowadays, the user of the Jawi script is diminishing and being replaced by the Latin script.

Palembang Malay consists of two register, first is the everyday language that is used almost by everyone in the city or also called the &quot;bahasa pasar&quot; (market language).

As used by children to parents, daughter-in-law to parents-in-law, students to teachers, or between speakers of the same age as the purpose of mutual respect, because &quot;Bebaso&quot; means to speak politely and subtly.

However, migrants often use their local language as a daily language, such as Komering, Rawas, Musi and Lahat. Migrants from outside South Sumatra sometimes also use their local language as a daily language in their families or regional communities. However, to communicate with other Palembang residents, residents generally use the Palembang Malay as their daily language of instruction. In addition to the indigenous people, in Palembang there are also migrants and descendants, such as from Java, Minangkabau, Madura, Bugis and Banjar. Many descendants living in Palembang are Chinese, Arabs and Indian.

This spear is shaped like a wooden spear with 3 sharp eyes at the end. The spear length is as high as an adult, which is around 180 cm and used to be used by Srivijaya royal warriors as the main weapon. &quot;Kris&quot; is not only used by the people of Java. Some other sub-ethnic Malays also recognize this type of weapon in their culture, including the people of South Sumatra. Although it has the same shape, the South Sumatra &quot;kris&quot; has its own characteristics. The number of curves or curves is always an odd number between 7 and 13 with a wide angle. That is why the typical South Sumatra &quot;kris&quot; tends to be longer and taper. &quot;Skin&quot; is a traditional South Sumatra weapon which is thought to originate from acculturation of local culture to the culture of Chinese traders and East Asia in the past. This weapon looks like a typical West Sumatra &quot;Kerambit&quot;, but is smaller in size and has 2 sharp blades.

== Transport ==
Many forms of transportations are available in the province. As a province traversed by several large rivers, the people of South Sumara also recognize the importance water transport, which is called &quot;ketek&quot;. This &quot;ketek&quot; serves river crossings through various piers along the Musi, Ogan and Komering Rivers.

There are three public operational airports in the province, with the Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport in Palembang being the largest and the busiest in the province. This airport is located northwest of Palembang, serving both domestic and international flights. The airport is also a hajj embarkation for residents of South Sumatra. Domestic flights are served to and from Jakarta, Bandung, Batam, Pangkal Pinang and other cities, as well as international destinations such as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The other two airports are the Silampari Airport in Lubuklinggau and the Atung Bungsu Airport in Pagar Alam; these two airports only serve regional flights.

South Sumatra also has three main ports namely Boom Baru, Port 36 Ilir and Tanjung Api-Api. These three ports serve passenger transportation using ferries to Muntok (Bangka) and Batam. Currently the Tanjung Api-Api Port is being built which serves the transportation of passengers and goods in and out of South Sumatra.

In addition, there are several railway lines in the province. Kertapati railway station in Palembang is the largest station in the province. It serves trains to and from Lubuklinggau and Bandar Lampung in Lampung province, and also smaller towns such as Baturaja, Lahat and Prabumulih. Currently, the railway only terminates in Lubuklinggau, but there is a plan to construct a railway to Bengkulu, which would allow to boost passengers movement and economic growth. Moreover, a railway from Palembang to Betung in Jambi is also in the planning stage, which would be connected further to Riau and North Sumatra. Overall, these projects would form the backbone of the Trans-Sumatra Railway.

The Palembang Light Rail Transit started operating in August 2018. It is one of its first kind in Indonesia and it is used to carry passengers from the Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport to the Palembang city center.

Currently, the only toll road in South Sumatra is the 22 km Palembang-Indralaya toll road. However, in the masterplan of the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road, the province would be connected by toll roads to other provinces like Bengkulu, Jambi and Lampung. Construction of the Bakauheni-Bandar Lampung-Palembang toll-road is predicted to be finished by late 2019, while the Palembang-Betung-Jambi toll-road and the Lubuklinggau-Bengkulu toll-road is still in planning stage.

==Economy==
There are five sectors that support economic growth in South Sumatra, such as the processing industry, mining, agriculture, construction, and large and retail trade, and the development of the Tanjung Api-Api Special Economic Zones (KEK), South Sumatra&#x27;s economic growth is also supported by tourism.

The coal deposits of South Sumatra amount to 22.24 billion tons or 48.45 percent of the total national reserves. The province also has 4.18 trillion standard cubic feet of natural gas and 757.4 standard cubic feet of natural oil.

However, the agricultural sector is still the cornerstone of employment in South Sumatra compared to other sectors with absorption reaching 1.9 million people. This figure is in accordance with the potential of the area which has an area of around 774 thousand hectares of agriculture. The potential of agricultural resources in South Sumatra is quite prominent with annual production of rice reaching 4.2 million tons, corn production reaching 289 thousand tons, soybeans production reaching 16 thousand tons, palm oil production reaching 2.718 million tons, coffee (dry beans) production reaching 135.2 thousand tons, coconut production reaching 65 thousand tons. In addition to the agricultural sector, the other two sectors also absorb labor, namely the large and retail trade sector, car and motorcycle repair and the processing industry. In the trade sector there are 688,000 workers, and the processing industry reaches 279,300 people.

The economy of South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 continued to show improvement compared to previous quarters. The realization of economic growth in South Sumatra in the second quarter of 2017 was 5.24% (YoY), higher than the first quarter of 2017 of 5.13% (YoY). From the demand side, the component of foreign exports is still the main pillar of economic growth. This was mainly supported by improvements in the prices of superior commodities in South Sumatra, namely rubber and coal. In addition, export performance was driven by improvements in the economic conditions of the main destination countries for South Sumatra&#x27;s exports, including the United States, China and Europe. On the other hand, an increase in export performance has no impact on increasing household consumption. The slowdown in household consumption is estimated to be caused by the consumption pattern of people experiencing a shift. The community began to reduce tertiary needs reflected in the decline in the consumption index of durable goods. Meanwhile, in the second quarter of 2017 government consumption declined due to some government projects still in the auction stage.

== Cuisine ==

The South Sumatran cuisine or also known as the Palembang cuisine is the cuisine of the city of Palembang and the surrounding area in South Sumatra. It is the second most well-known cuisine from Sumatra after Padang. Palembang cuisine primarily uses freshwater fish and prawns as key ingredients due to the paramount role of the Musi River for the area. Popular freshwater fish includes &quot;patin&quot; (&quot;Pangasius&quot;), &quot;baung&quot; (&quot;Hemibagrus&quot;), &quot;lais&quot; (&quot;Kryptopterus cryptopterus&quot;), &quot;lele&quot; (catfish), &quot;gabus&quot; (snakehead), &quot;mas&quot; (carp) and &quot;gurame&quot; (gourami). Historically, Palembang waters were teeming with &quot;belido&quot; (giant featherback), and it has become the city&#x27;s official animal mascot. It is valued for its succulent flavour and soft texture. However, due to overfishing, today the &quot;belido&quot; fish are scarce and probably already extinct in Musi river area. Because of its location that is not far from the sea, seafood such as shrimp, &quot;tenggiri&quot; (wahoo), &quot;kakap merah&quot; (red snapper) and Spanish mackerel are also popular in Palembang. Besides freshwater fish dishes, there are many variations of dishes, snacks, drinks, and sweets in Palembang cuisine.

Spices are also generally included although not as liberally as its same-island counterpart. Palembang cuisine is noted by its preference for the sour and sweet flavour, as evidenced in &quot;pindang&quot; fish soup, strong-smelling &quot;tempoyak&quot;-based dish made from fermented durian, and also &quot;kuah cuko&quot; spicy sweet vinegar sauce of &quot;pempek&quot; fishcake. Those dishes are popular fare and often associated with the city.

Malay, Javanese, Indian, and Chinese culture has influenced Palembang&#x27;s culinary scene. Pempek, tekwan and mie celor are the example of Chinese cuisine influence on Palembang. Pempek is basically fishcake made from deboned fish flesh and tapioca flour, which was a local adaptation of East Asian surimi fishcake making. Like most of noodle dishes of Indonesia, mie celor can trace its origin back to Chinese influences. It was popularly believed that Palembang preference of sweet flavour was due to Javanese influences that favoured palm sugar. Indeed, Palembang absorbs many Javanese elements, including language and cuisine. For example, both Javanese and Palembang Malay dialects refer fish as &quot;iwak&quot;, and cooking method employing banana leaf package as &quot;brengkes&quot; or &quot;brengkesan&quot;. Martabak Palembang and nasi minyak which uses ghee, on the other hand, demonstrate Indian cuisine influence in the city.

== Sports ==

South Sumatra, especially the city of Palembang is notable as the host city 2018 Asian Games along with Jakarta, the first Asian Games hold officially by two cities and the fourth host city of Asian Games in Southeast Asia after Bangkok in 1998. Palembang is also the main host of 2011 Southeast Asian Games and hosted two matches of 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Sport facilities have been built across the city since 1971 to host &quot;Pekan Olahraga Mahasiswa&quot; (POM) IX, although the city&#x27;s main sport complex, Jakabaring Sport City started its construction in 1998 and expanded later in 2010. In order to keep the sport complex in frequent use, several plans have been raised by the government to encourage more sporting events into the city, including the purchase of an association football club, Persijatim Solo F.C in 2004 which then renamed to Sriwijaya F.C. Palembang also planned to build a race track inside the complex to host a MotoGP race in the city.

Football is regarded as the most popular sport in South Sumatra. Sriwijaya F.C is the only active professional football club in South Sumatra and is widely followed across the province, especially in its home city Palembang. During its home matches, the stadium often flooded with fans wearing yellow shirts on south stands, green shirts on north stands, and black shirts on east stands, representing three main ultras of the club. Badminton, basketball, volleyball and futsal also get wide attention in the city. Besides Sriwijaya F.C., notable sport teams in Palembang are BSB Hangtuah (basketball) and Palembang Bank Sumsel Babel (volleyball). Indonesian badminton players Mohammad Ahsan and Debby Susanto are also from Palembang.

<text>Craig Michael Bartlett (born October 18, 1956) is an American animator. He wrote, directed, created, and produced the Nickelodeon television series &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; and the PBS Kids television series &quot;Ready Jet Go!&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur Train&quot;.

==Career==
Bartlett&#x27;s first job, after graduating from the Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, was at Will Vinton Studios in Portland, Oregon, where he learned the art of stop-motion animation, working on movies such as &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot;. Bartlett moved to Los Angeles in 1987 to animate the &quot;Penny&quot; claymations for the second season of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; on CBS. He later made an animated ID for NBC with Klasky Csupo.

He later worked at BRC Imagination Arts, directing projects such as &quot;Postcards&quot; and &quot;Mystery Lodge&quot; for Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. He also animated the music video for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic from the 1993 album &quot;Alapalooza&quot;.

Bartlett met the Nickelodeon execs while story editing &quot;Rugrats&quot; in its first three seasons. He pitched &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; to them in the fall of 1993 and produced a pilot the next spring. The series was greenlit in January 1995. &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; was in production continuously from 1995 to 2001, made by Bartlett&#x27;s own production company, Snee-Oosh, Inc., which he founded in 1986. The series culminated in a TV movie originally titled &quot;Arnold Saves the Neighborhood&quot;, but Nickelodeon decided to release it theatrically as &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, in June 2002.

A dispute over a second planned &quot;Arnold&quot; movie resulted in Bartlett leaving Nickelodeon to write, direct and produce an animated TV movie for Cartoon Network called &quot;Party Wagon&quot;, a story originally intended as a pilot for an ongoing series. It ended up being the first Cartoon Network movie-length pilot to be broadcast, but not picked up until &quot;&quot;, which was created by Maxwell Atoms, who created &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot;.

In 2002 he published the official novelization of the first &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot; movie (having written it with Maggie Groening; ).

In 2005 Bartlett returned to BRC to make a multimedia simulator attraction for NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, called the &quot;Shuttle Launch Experience&quot;. In the course of the three-year project, Bartlett interviewed 26 astronauts to gather their experiences from launch to orbit. One of these was four-time shuttle flier and commander and current NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr.

After developing various pilots and feature scripts, Bartlett moved to The Jim Henson Company, where he co-wrote the animated film &quot;Unstable Fables: 3 Pigs and a Baby&quot;. He stayed at Henson to work as story editor on a PBS Kids preschool show called &quot;Sid the Science Kid&quot; with PBS executive Linda Simensky, whom he had worked with at Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.

In September 2008, a show for preschoolers called &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Dinosaur Train&quot; was picked up by PBS Kids; produced by Brian Henson, this was the first show created by Bartlett to be picked up since &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;. The series debuted on PBS stations on September 7, 2009.

In April 2015, &quot;Ready Jet Go!&quot; (formerly &quot;Jet Propulsion&quot;) was also picked up by PBS Kids. Produced by Wind Dancer Films and his company, Snee-Oosh, Inc., the series premiered on PBS stations on February 15, 2016.

In November 2015, Viacom announced that Bartlett would return to Nickelodeon to write &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie&quot;. It premiered on November 24, 2017.

==Personal life==
Bartlett attended and graduated from Anacortes High School in Anacortes, Washington. In 1987, Bartlett married Lisa Groening, sister of Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; and &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, after whom Lisa Simpson is named. They have two children, Matt and Katie. In August 2018, it was reported that Craig and Lisa were going through a divorce settlement and that they had been separated since 2015.

<text>Jane Ellen Harrison (9 September 1850 – 15 April 1928) was a British classical scholar and linguist. With Karl Kerenyi and Walter Burkert, Harrison is one of the founders of modern studies in Ancient Greek religion and mythology. She applied 19th-century archaeological discoveries to the interpretation of ancient Greek religion in ways that have become standard. She has also been credited with being the first woman to obtain a post in England as a &#x27;career academic&#x27;. Harrison argued for women&#x27;s suffrage but thought she would never want to vote herself. Ellen Wordsworth Crofts, later second wife of Sir Francis Darwin, was Jane Harrison&#x27;s best friend from her student days at Newnham, and during the period from 1898 to Ellen&#x27;s death in 1903. The depth and influence of Harrison’s friendship with Eugénie Sellers Strong—ended by a dramatic breech in the 1890’s—is explored in a monograph by Mary Beard: after their breakup Sellers became an influential authority on the material vulture of imperial, while Harrison’s work dug deeper and deeper into the primitive ritual origins of Greek drama. Though moving in different directions chronologically, in terms of their focus, the women appear otherwise as doppelgängers of one another in their concerns, style and characteristic forms of argument deriving from an approach that became known as classical anthropology. Harrison’s Prolegomena to Greek Religion had a compelling and inspirational impact on the later artworks of T.S.Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and Hilda Doolittle and her scholarly legerdemain was formative to the group of classicists known as the Cambridge ritualists. 

==Life and career==
Harrison was born in Cottingham, Yorkshire on 9 September 1850 to Charles and Elizabeth Harrison. Her mother died of puerperal fever shortly after she was born and she was educated by a series of governesses. Her governesses taught her German, Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew, but she later expanded her knowledge to about sixteen languages, including Russian.

Harrison spent most of her professional life at Newnham College, the progressive, recently established college for women at Cambridge. Mary Beard described Harrison as &quot;the first woman in England to become an academic, in the fully professional sense – an ambitious, full-time, salaried, university researcher and lecturer&quot;.

Between 1880 and 1897, Harrison studied Greek art and archaeology at the British Museum under Sir Charles Newton. Harrison then supported herself lecturing at the museum and at schools (mostly private boy&#x27;s schools). Her lectures became widely popular and 1,600 people ended up attending her Glasgow lecture on Athenian gravestones. She travelled to Italy and Germany, where she met the scholar from Prague, Wilhelm Klein. Klein introduced her to Wilhelm Dörpfeld who invited her to participate in his archaeological tours in Greece. Her early book &quot;The Odyssey in Art and Literature&quot; then appeared in 1882. In 1888, she began to publish in the periodical that Oscar Wilde was editing called &quot;The Woman&#x27;s World&quot; on &quot;The Pictures of Sappho&quot;. She ended up translating &quot;Mythologie figurée de la Grèce&quot; (1883) by Maxime Collignon as well as providing personal commentary to selections of &quot;Pausanias, Mythology &amp; Monuments of Ancient Athens&quot; by Margaret Verrall in the same year. These two major works caused Harrison to be awarded honorary degrees from the universities of Durham (1897) and Aberdeen (1895).

Harrison was engaged to marry the scholar R. A. Neil, but he died suddenly of appendicitis in 1901 before they could marry.

Harrison became the central figure of the group known as the Cambridge Ritualists. In 1903, her book &quot;Prolegomena on the Study of Greek Religion&quot; appeared. Harrison became close to Francis MacDonald Cornford (1874–1943), and when he married in 1909 she became extremely upset. She then made a new friendship with Hope Mirrlees, whom she referred to as her &quot;spiritual daughter&quot;.

Harrison retired from Newnham in 1922 and then moved to Paris to live with Mirrlees. She and Mirrlees returned to London in 1925 where she was able to publish her memoirs through Leonard and Virginia Woolf&#x27;s press, The Hogarth Press. She died at age 77 at her home in Bloomsbury. She was buried in St Marylebone Cemetery, East Finchley.

Harrison was an atheist.

Harrison was, at least ideologically, a moderate suffragist. Rather than support women&#x27;s suffrage by protesting, Harrison applied her scholarship in anthropology to defend women&#x27;s right to vote. In responding to an anti-suffragist critic, Harrison demonstrates this moderate ideology:

To this end, Harrison&#x27;s motto was Terence&#x27;s &quot;homo sum; humani nihil mihi alienum est&quot; (&quot;I am a human being; nothing that is human do I account alien.&quot;)

==Career==

===Scholarship===
Harrison began formal study at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, where she gained a Certificate, and, in 1874, continued her studies in the classics at Cambridge University&#x27;s Newnham College. Her early work earned Harrison two honorary doctorates, an LLD from University of Aberdeen in 1895, and DLitt from the University of Durham in 1897. This recognition afforded Harrison the opportunity to return to Newnham College as a lecturer in 1898, and her position was renewed continuously until Harrison retired in 1922. She had been a candidate for the Yates Professor of Classical Art and Archaeology at University College London after Reginald Stuart Poole had died in 1895. The hiring committee had recommended Harrison to the position, but that decision was blocked by Flinders Petrie in favor of Ernest Gardner. Petrie argued that while Harrison was an expert on religion, she did not have the knowledge base Gardner did, so he got the job and worked closely with Petrie for 30 years.

===Early work===
Harrison&#x27;s first monograph, in 1882, drew on the thesis that both Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and motifs of the Greek vase-painters were drawing upon similar deep sources for mythology, the opinion that had not been common in earlier classical archaeology, that the repertory of vase-painters offered some unusual commentaries on myth and ritual. Her approach in her great work, &quot;Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion&quot; (1903), was to proceed from the ritual to the myth it inspired: &quot;In theology facts are harder to seek, truth more difficult to formulate than in ritual.&quot; Thus she began her book with analyses of the best-known of the Athenian festivals: Anthesteria, harvest festivals Thargelia, , Plynteria, and the women&#x27;s festivals, in which she detected many primitive survivals, Skirophoria, Stenia and Haloa.

===Cultural evolution (or social Darwinism)===
Harrison alluded to and commented on the cultural applications of Charles Darwin&#x27;s work. Harrison and her generation depended upon anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor (who was himself influenced by Darwin and evolutionary ideas) for some new themes of cultural evolution, especially his 1871 work, &quot;Primitive Culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, language, art, and custom&quot;. After a socially Darwinian analysis of the origins of religion, Harrison argues that religiosity is anti-intellectual and dogmatic, yet she defended the cultural necessity of religion and mysticism. In her essay &quot;The Influence of Darwinism on the Study of Religion&quot; (1909), Harrison concluded:

==Later life==

World War I marked a deep break in Harrison&#x27;s life. Harrison never visited Italy or Greece after the war: she mostly wrote revisions or synopses of previous publications, and pacifist leanings isolated her. Upon retiring (in 1922), Harrison briefly lived in Paris, but she returned to London when her health began to fail. During the last two years of her life Harrison was living at 11 Mecklenburgh Square on the fringes of Bloomsbury.

==In literature==

In &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1929), in addition to female authors, Virginia Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from Harrison. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as &quot;the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?&quot;

The critic Camille Paglia (see Paglia&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Sexual Personae&quot; (passim), and the long essay &quot;Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders: Academe in the Hour of the Wolf&quot; in Paglia&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Art and American Culture: New Essays&quot;, 1993) has written of Harrison&#x27;s influence on her own work. Paglia argues that Harrison&#x27;s career has been ignored by second-wave feminists, who Paglia thinks object to Harrison&#x27;s findings and efface the careers of prominent pre–World War II female scholars to bolster their claims of male domination in academia.

Tina Passman, in 1993 in her article &quot;Out of the Closet and into the Field: Matriculture, the Lesbian Perspective, and Feminist Classics&quot;, discussed the neglect of Harrison by the academy, and tied that neglect to an unpopularity of lesbian perspectives in the field.

Mary Beard&#x27;s numerous essays and her book on Harrison&#x27;s life, (&quot;The Invention of Jane Harrison&quot;, Harvard University Press, 2000), as well as several other biographies of Harrison, have moved the needle toward greater appreciation of Harrison&#x27;s achievements, as well as further understanding of the context in which she worked.

<text>127 (one hundred [and] twenty-seven) is the natural number following 126 and preceding 128. It is also a prime number.

== In mathematics ==

*As a Mersenne prime, 127 is related to the perfect number 8128. 127 is also the largest known Mersenne prime exponent for a Mersenne number, formula_1, which is also a Mersenne prime. It was discovered by Édouard Lucas in 1876 and held the record for the largest known prime for 75 years.
**formula_1 is the largest prime ever discovered by hand calculations as well as the largest known double Mersenne prime.
** Furthermore, 127 is equal to formula_3, and 7 is equal to formula_4, and 3 is the smallest Mersenne prime, making 7 the smallest double Mersenne prime and 127 the smallest triple Mersenne prime.
*There are a total of 127 prime numbers between 2,000 and 3,000.
*127 is also a cuban prime of the form formula_5, formula_6. The next prime is 131, with which it comprises a cousin prime. Because the next odd number, 129, is a semiprime, 127 is a Chen prime. 127 is greater than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes; thus, it is a strong prime.
*127 is a centered hexagonal number.
*It is the seventh Motzkin number.
*127 is a palindromic prime in nonary and binary.
*127 is the first Friedman prime in decimal. It is also the first nice Friedman number in decimal, since formula_7, as well as binary since formula_8 .
*127 is the sum of the sums of the divisors of the first twelve positive integers.
*127 is the smallest prime that can be written as the sum of the first two or more odd primes: formula_9.
*127 is the smallest odd number that cannot be written in the form formula_10, for is a prime number, and is an integer, since formula_11 formula_12 formula_13 formula_14 formula_15 formula_16 and formula_17 are all composite numbers.
*127 is an isolated prime where neither formula_18 nor formula_19 is prime.
*127 is the smallest digitally delicate prime in binary.
*127 is the 31st prime number and therefore it is the smallest Mersenne prime with a Mersenne prime index.
*127 is the largest number with the property formula_20 where formula_21 is the th prime number. There are only two numbers with that property; the other one is 43.
*127 is equal to formula_22 where formula_21 is the th prime number.
*127 is the number of non-equivalent ways of expressing 10,000 as the sum of two prime numbers.

<text>North Maluku () is a province of Indonesia. It covers the northern part of the Maluku Islands, bordering the Pacific Ocean to the north, the Halmahera Sea to the east, the Molucca Sea to the west, and the Seram Sea to the south. It shares maritime borders with North Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi to the west, Maluku to the south, Southwest Papua to the east, and Palau and the Philippines to the north. The provincial capital is Sofifi, mostly part of the city of Tidore Islands on the largest island of Halmahera, while the largest city is the island city of Ternate. The population of North Maluku was 1,038,087 in the 2010 census, making it one of the least-populous provinces in Indonesia, but by the 2020 Census the population had risen to 1,282,937, and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,328,594.

North Maluku was originally the centre of the four largest Islamic sultanates in the eastern Indonesian archipelago—Bacan, Jailolo, Tidore and Ternate—known as the &quot;Moloku Kië Raha&quot; (the Four Mountains of Maluku). Upon Europeans&#x27; arrival at the beginning of the 16th century, North Maluku became the site of competition between the Portuguese, Spanish and the Dutch to control trade. In the end, the Dutch emerged victorious, beginning three centuries of Dutch rule in the region. The Japanese invaded the region during World War II, and Ternate became the center of the Japanese rule of the Pacific region. Following Indonesian independence, the region became a part of the province of Maluku.

The province of North Maluku was officially established on 12 October 1999, by separation from Maluku. The island city of Ternate served as its &quot;de facto&quot; capital until 2010, when the provincial government moved to Sofifi on the mainland of Halmahera. The regional economy in North Maluku largely relies on the agricultural sector, fisheries and other types of marine products. The main commodities that support the economic pulse in North Maluku include copra, nutmeg, cloves, fisheries, gold and nickel. North Maluku&#x27;s agricultural products include rice, corn, roasted sweet potatoes, beans, coconut, potatoes, nutmeg, sago, and eucalyptus.

== Etymology ==
Historically, the term Maluku referred to the four royal centres in North Maluku, namely Ternate, Tidore, Bacan and Jailolo. A type of confederation consisting of the four kingdoms, which most likely emerged in the 14th century, was called Moloku Kie Raha or &quot;Four Mountains of Maluku&quot;. Although the four kingdoms subsequently expanded and covered the entire North Maluku region (as now defined) and parts of Sulawesi and New Guinea, the area of expansion was originally not included in the term Maluku. This only referred to the four main clove-producing islands to the west of Halmahera: Ternate, Tidore. Moti and Makian. Bacan further to the south, and Jailolo on Halmahera, were also commonly included in Maluku Proper, the four kingdoms forming a ritual quadripartition with connotations to local cosmology.

The etymology of the word &quot;Maluku&quot; is not very clear, and it has been a matter of debate for many experts. The first recorded word that can be identified with &quot;Maluku&quot; comes from Nagarakretagama, an Old Javanese eulogy of 1365. Canto 14 stanza 5 mentioned &quot;Maloko&quot;, which Pigeaud identified with Ternate or Moluccas. A theory holds that the name Maluku comes from the concept of &quot;Maluku Kie Raha&quot;. &quot;Raha&quot; means four, while &quot;kie&quot; here means mountain. referring to 4 mountains of Ternate, Tidore, Bacan, and Jailolo (Halmahera) which have their own kolano (title for local kings). Therefore, the Maluku can come from: &quot;Moloku&quot; here means to grasp or hold. Using these the meaning of &quot;Moloku Kie Raha&quot; is &quot;confederation of four mountain&quot;. However the root word &quot;loku&quot; comes from local Malay creole word for a unit, therefore not an indigenous language. The other idea is the word originated from &quot;Maloko&quot; which is a combination of &quot;Ma&quot; which is for support and &quot;Loko&quot; refer to area. The phrase &quot;Maloko Kie Raha&quot; means &quot;the place/world which has four mountains&quot;.

==History==
=== Precolonial era ===
The island of Ternate or Gapi began to grow in the early 13th century. The early Ternate population was the result of an exodus from Halmahera. Initially there were four villages in Ternate, each headed by a &quot;momole&quot; (head of a clan). they were the first to make contact with merchants who came looking for spices. The population of Ternate became increasingly heterogeneous with settlements of Arab, Javanese, Malay and Chinese traders. With the increasingly busy trading activities there was an increase of threats coming from pirates, the Momole Guna Tobona leaders held a conference to form a stronger organization and appoint a single leader as king.

In 1257, according to traditional chronology, Momole Cico, Sampalu&#x27;s leader was elected and appointed as the first &quot;kolano&quot; (king) with the title Baab Mashur Malamo (1257-1277). The Kingdom of Gapi was centered in the village of Ternate, which later grew bigger and more populous, the population was also referred as Gam Lamo or the big village (later Gamalama). Ternate was the largest and most populous settlement on the island, so the people would call the kingdom Ternate rather than Gapi. Under the leadership of several generations of rulers, Ternate developed from a kingdom on a small island, to becoming the largest and most influential country in eastern Indonesia, especially in the Moluccas. It was organized in settlement units called &quot;soa&quot; which stood under a headmen or &quot;bobato&quot;. At the top, the &quot;kolano&quot; was assisted by four chief officials, &quot;dopolo ngaruha&quot;, led by a first minister or &quot;jogugu&quot;.

Starting in the mid-15th century, Islam was adopted by the leading families in the kingdom, due to the influence of Muslim merchants from Java, India and the Malay World. Some aspects of Islamic law were applied, though Islam was only patchily disseminated until the second half of the 16th century. Sultan Zainal Abidin substituted the title of &quot;kolano&quot; with that of Sultan, following other rulers from the Malay World. With this, Muslim scholars became important figures in the Ternate kingdom.

Opposite to Ternate lies the island of Tidore, the seat of the Kingdom of Tidore, or Duko. According to the genealogies of the kings of Ternate and Tidore, the first &quot;kolano&quot; of Tidore was Sahjati (Muhammad Naqil) who ascended the throne in 1081. The ruler was known as &quot;Kië ma-kolano&quot;, &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;. It was only at the end of the 15th century that Islam was adopted as the official religion of the kingdom. The 9th King of Tidore, Sultan Jamaluddin, chose to convert to Islam because of the preaching of Sheikh Mansur from Arabia. Of the other two kingdoms, Jailolo was the most powerful in the Moluccas in the pre-European era until its powers dissipated in the 16th century. Bacan had importance as a link between the Austronesian and the Papuans in the 16th century, but also shrank to insignificance due to military setbacks and severe population decline in the 16th and early 17th centuries.
=== Colonial era ===
The first European to land in the Moluccas was Ludovico di Varthema, an Italian explorer who claims to have visited the region in 1505. In 1512, the Portuguese set foot in Ternate for the first time under the leadership of Francisco Serrão. With the approval of Sultan Bayan Sirrullah, Portugal was allowed to establish a trading post in Ternate. Portugal came not only to share the trading opportunities, but to control the commerce in spices, nutmeg and cloves, in Maluku. For this reason, the foreigners first had to subordinate to Ternate. Their superior weaponry and possession of the trading entrepôt of Malacca made them attractive as allies. But as soon as they were permanently established, the Europeans began to interfere in local politics. Simultaneously, Al-Mansur of Tidore received the remnants of the Magellan expedition in 1521 and tried to secure the Spanish as allies, though the presence of Spain in Maluku were very limited up to 1582. Ternate and Tidore lived in a near-permanent state of rivalry during the 16th and 17th centuries, though there was also a ritual dualism in their relationship.

Sultan Bayan Sirrullah died in 1521, leaving heirs who were still very young. The Tidorese princess Nukila, the widow of the sultan, and Prince Taruwese, son of the deceased sultan by a low-ranking wife, acted as guardians. Queen Mother Nukila intended to unite Ternate and Tidore under one crown, headed by one of her two sons, Pangeran Hidayat (later Sultan Dayalu) or prince Abu Hayat (later Sultan Abu Hayat II). Meanwhile, Prince Tarruwese wanted the throne for himself.

The Portuguese took advantage of this opportunity and pitted them against each other, resulting in civil strife. Queen Nukila&#x27;s side was supported by Tidore while Prince Taruwese was supported by Portugal. After overcoming his adversary, Prince Taruwese was in turn betrayed and killed by the Portuguese. The Portuguese captain acted as an adviser to the kingdom. Through his influence, the royal council was persuaded to appoint prince Tabariji as sultan in 1533. But when the Ternatans began to show hostility to Christianized regions in Halmahera, Tabariji was exiled to the Portuguese colony of Goa, India in 1535. There he was converted to Christianity and was later pushed to write a testament that bequeathed Ternate to the King of Portugal. This made the next sultan Hairun a vassal of Portugal, but he disregarded the testament and built up his power behind the backs of the Portuguese.

Portugal helped Hairun conquer the Jailolo kingdom in 1551, reducing it to a Ternate vassal. However, because of the treatment of his brothers and himself caused deep resentment of Sultan Hairun. He tried to weaken the Portuguese positions in Maluku, sending expeditions to attack the partly Christianized Ambon Island. The actions of the Portuguese also caused anger among the people who backed the Sultan. In response, the Portuguese captain, Diogo Lopes de Mesquita invited Hairun for negotiations but murdered the sultan who entered the fort without his bodyguards.

The assassination of Sultan Hairun incited the people of Ternate to expel Portugal. Even other parts of the Moluccas chose to support the leadership and struggle of the new Sultan Baabullah. The fortresses of Portugal throughout Maluku and the eastern regions of Indonesia were attacked. After five years of war, the Portuguese were expelled from northern Maluku in 1575. Under the leadership of Sultan Baabullah, the power of Ternate reached its peak. His area of influence stretched from North and Central Sulawesi in the west to the Papuan Islands in the east, from the southern Philippines in the north to the Lesser Sunda Islands in the south. The Bacan Sultanate, whose ruler, Dom João Hairun, had converted to Christianity, was also forced to apostate and yield. However, the Portuguese held out in Ambon and established a fortress in Tidore in 1578, since the Tidorese Sultan Gapi Baguna began to fear Baabullah&#x27;s ambitions.

After the death of Sultan Baabullah, the sultanate began to weaken. The Spanish, who had united with Portugal in 1580, tried to regain control of Maluku by attacking Ternate via the Iberian base in Tidore. With Spain strengthening its position in the Philippines, Ternate formed an alliance with local Muslim lords in Mindanao to drive off the Spanish, but failed. Sultan Saidi Berkat defeated several invasion attempts, but was eventually captured by the Spaniards in 1606 and exiled to Manila. The Spanish-allied Tidore took over some Ternatan dependencies.
Surviving Ternatan aristocrats requested the help from the Dutch, the Dutch responded and helped Sultan Mudafar Syah I to reestablish himself on Ternate Island. On 26 June 1607 the sultan signed a contract that gave the Dutch East India Company (VOC) a monopoly in purchasing spices in his realm, in return for Dutch assistance against Spain. In 1607, the Dutch also built Fort Oranje on Ternate, which was their first stronghold in the archipelago. The VOC expelled the Spanish from most of Maluku in the following years, though Spain kept Tidore and Fort Gammalamo in Ternate until 1663. The unbalanced relationship between the Netherlands and Ternate caused dissatisfaction with the rulers and nobles of Ternate. Among them were Hidayat, a young Ambonese &quot;kimelaha&quot; (governor) who was also a former regent of Ternate and led the opposition against both Mudafar Syah and the Dutch. He ignored the Dutch trade monopoly agreement by selling spices to Javanese and Makassar traders. The resistance offered by him and his successors, and by the Muslim vassal state Hitu on Ambon, led to a long series of wars up to the 1650s where the VOC subjugated Ambon with Ternate&#x27;s assistance.

Meanwhile, the Sultanate of Tidore succeeded in preventing direct Dutch interference in their territory and remained independent until the end of the 18th century. Over the 17th century Tidore built up its positions in south-east Halmahera and Papua that yielded foodstuff, forest products and slaves. However, the VOC eventually succeeded in pacifying Ternate and Tidore. In its height, the VOC pursued an orderly, and controlling strategy, helped by a strong and flexible organization. Both Ternate and Tidore agreed to extirpate all clove trees in their realms in the 1650s, ensuring Dutch monopoly on clove cultivation. Because of the colonial policy, Maluku became an economic backwater after the mid-17th century. On the other hand, the rulers were able to strengthen their personal powers with their subjects under European protection. Ternate was reduced to a vassal of the VOC in 1682, and Tidore met the same fate in 1780. The Tidorese prince Nuku led a successful anti-Dutch rebellion that encompassed much of Maluku and western Papua in 1780–1805. Helped by the British invasion in 1796–1803 he was able to push back Dutch positions, but resistance collapsed after his death. In the end, Ternate and Tidore as well as other kingdoms in Maluku were incorporated in the Dutch East Indies. For more than a century after 1816, the archipelago remained under strict Dutch control, though the sultanates Ternate, Tidore and Bacan remained as &quot;zelfbesturende landschappen&quot; (self-ruling territories) until the Indonesian Revolution.
=== Modern era ===
The Empire of Japan invaded Maluku early in 1942 as part of its Dutch East Indies Campaign of World War II, ousting the Dutch from the region. Halmahera became the site of a Japanese naval base at Kao Bay. 2 years later, US forces and their allies launched the Battle of Morotai in 1944; bombing the island in August and invading it in September. Imperial Japanese forces on Morotai held out until 1945 but failed to expel the Allies. In the latter part of 1944, 61,000 personnel landed on Morotai. Two thirds of them were engineers, who rapidly established facilities including harbors and two airstrips plus extensive fuel stores. The formal surrender of the Second Japanese Army took place at Morotai on 9 September 1945. The last Japanese holdout from the war, Private Teruo Nakamura (Amis: Attun Palalin), was discovered by the Indonesian Air Force on Morotai, and surrendered to a search patrol on December 18, 1974.

After the Japanese surrendered, the Dutch regained control of the region, before handing it over to the Indonesian government in 1949. In 1957, the Permesta movement was declared in Manado, North Sulawesi, aiming to overthrow the Indonesian government, The movement received support from the United States and Taiwan. In January 1958 the CIA began developing covert support networks to the PRRI and Permesta rebels. Supported by the American, Permesta forces captures Morotai and Halmahera as well as several islands. In May 1958 Indonesian National Armed Forces started to gather amphibious forces to retake both Morotai and the rebel-held town of Jailolo on the island of Halmahera. By May 16 the assault fleet started to gather in Ambon harbour and on May 20 its troops landed on Morotai while élite &quot;Pasukan Gerak Tjepat&quot; (PGT or &quot;Quick Reaction Force&quot;) troops parachuted onto the island. Permesta forces surrendered as the island was captured in less than a month. It alarmed the Permesta rebels on Jailolo, many of whom fled back to North Sulawesi. Thereafter the rebellion was largely confined to the Minahassa Peninsula of Sulawesi, where Permesta remnants waged a guerilla campaign until the last unit surrendered in January 1962.

During the administration of President B. J. Habibie, the idea emerged to accelerate development in several potential regions by forming new provinces. Maluku was one of the potential areas for accelerating development through the parttion of the province, mainly because of the pace of development between the northern and southern regions and or between the middle and southeast regions were uneven. On that basis, the government established North Maluku Province (with the temporary capital in Ternate) which was confirmed by Law Number 46 of 1999 concerning the division of North Maluku Province, Buru Regency and Tanimbar Islands Regency.

North Maluku was also the site of the Maluku sectarian conflict. Although the area was more peaceful than the neighbouring Maluku province, there were several clashes between Christians and Muslims in Ternate and Halmahera. Several people were killed in Kao, Halmahera as residents of both faiths and Makianese Muslim migrants fought for three days, the violence had started with the invasion of Sosol, one of the two villages destroyed by the Makianese gang. A team of leaders was tasked with securing peace by the regional government, however no modifications were made to the redistricting decision and tension remained. The conflict spread from Halmahera to neighbouring Ternate and Tidore. On 6 November 1999, a several-hundred strong Muslim gang, led by local Makianese political elite and thought to be mostly Makianese refugees, raged through Ternate attacking the Christian minority there. The police forces of Ternate were only able to guard their own institutions from attack, yet the traditional guards of the Sultan of Ternate, mostly composed of local Ternate Muslims, were particularly effective at protecting the local Christian population from attack. The Sultan&#x27;s guard had both established secure perimeters around areas of the city, including the mostly Chinese-owned business district, and physically stood between the mobs and possible victims in some cases and were later commended for preventing a potential massacre. At least 4 people died, however, and the Indonesian Navy later evacuated the several thousand Christian residents of both islands to Bitung and Manado in North Sulawesi. 

The conflict was resolved after the Malino II Accord was signed by both parties.

==Geography==
The islands of North Maluku are mostly of volcanic origin, with the volcanoes of Dukono on Halmahera and Gamalama on Ternate still active and the whole of Tidore consisting of a large stratovolcano. 

The largest of the 1,474 islands are Halmahera (with an area of 18,039.6 km2, or 56.4% of the land area of the province), Taliabu (2,913.2 km2), Obi (2,542.3 km2), Morotai (2,266.4 km2), Bacan (1,899.8 km2), Mangole (1,228.5 km2), Sulabesi (557.8 km2), Kasiruta (472.67 km2) and Mandioli (229.8 km2). 

The North Maluku Islands are formed by the movement of three tectonic plates, namely Eurasia, the Pacific and Indo-Australia which have occurred over geological ages. This movement formed the volcanic archipelago that stretched from north to south off western Halmahera, including Hiri Island, Ternate Island, Tidore Island, Mare Island, Moti Island and Makian Island. Each of these islands constitutes a stratovolcano. Further south lie the Kayoa and Bacan Islands (there are also two stratovolcanoes on Bacan Island). Halmahera Island itself is a volcanic island even though volcanic activity occurs only in a part of its territory.

The islands have a tropical rainforest climate (Af).

==Ecology==

The rainforests of Halmahera, Morotai, the Obi Islands, the Bacan islands and other islands of North Maluku have been described by the World Wildlife Fund as the Halmahera rain forests ecoregion and are home to a number of plant and animal species unique to the islands, which are in the Wallacea transition zone, containing a mixture of species of Asian and Australasian origin. The predominant trees of the forest are &quot;Anisoptera thurifera&quot;, &quot;Hopea gregaria&quot;, &quot;Hopea iriana&quot;, &quot;Shorea assamica&quot;, &quot;Shorea montigena&quot;, &quot;Shorea selanica&quot;, and &quot;Vatica rassak&quot;.

The endemic mammals found here include the Obi mosaic-tailed rat (&quot;Melomys obiensis&quot;), masked flying fox (&quot;Pteropus personatus&quot;), and four arboreal marsupials, the ornate (&quot;Phalanger ornatus&quot;), Rothschild&#x27;s (&quot;P. rothschildi&quot;), blue-eyed (&quot;P. matabiru&quot;) and Gebe (&quot;P. alexandrae&quot;) cuscuses. There are over two hundred different birds on the islands, twenty-six of which are endemic, a large number for this small island group. The endemics include four birds which are the only species in their genera, including the elusive invisible rail (&quot;Habroptila wallacii&quot;), the white-streaked friarbird (&quot;Melitograis gilolensis&quot;), and two birds of paradise, the paradise-crow (&quot;Lycocorax pyrrhopterus&quot;) and Wallace&#x27;s standardwing (&quot;Semioptera wallacii&quot;). The islands are also home to the largest bee in the world, Wallace&#x27;s giant bee (&quot;Megachile pluto&quot;).

Most of the natural forest remains on these mountainous islands, although much of the coastal and lowland areas have been cleared for clove-planting since the sixteenth century, especially on the islands of Ternate and Tidore. Logging has occurred more recently on Halmahera and Morotai.

The Sula Islands are part of the Sulawesi lowland rain forests ecoregion.

==Government and administrative divisions==
In 1999, the northern part of Maluku, then comprising the North Maluku (&quot;Maluku Utara&quot;) Regency, the Central Halmahera (&quot;Halmahera Tengah&quot;) Regency and the City of Ternate, were split off to form a separate province of North Maluku (Maluku Utara). The existing North Maluku Regency was on 25 February 2003 (by law Udang-Udang Nomor 1 Tahun 2003) split into four new regencies - North Halmahera, West Halmahera, South Halmahera and the Sula Islands - while on the same date two new entities were created from parts of the Central Halmahera Regency - East Halmahera Regency and the new city of Tidore Islands. A seventh regency, covering Morotai Island, was formed on 29 October 2008 from part of North Halmahera and an eighth regency, covering Taliabu Island, was formed on 14 December 2012 from the westernmost island in the Sula Islands Regency. All are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, and according to the official estimates for mid 2023. The table also includes the number of administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) in each city or regency, the number of administrative villages (rural &quot;desa&quot; and urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) into which those districts are subdivided, and the numbers of named islands.

Notes: (a) The Regency-level BPS publication for mid 2023 shows a population figure of 96,977 for Central Halmahera which is wildly different from the Provincial-level publication figures given above. Note several of the figures for areas also show great disparity between the BPS figires published by the Province and those published by the Regencies, although both sets are &quot;official&quot;.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The North Maluku Electoral District consists of all of the 8 regencies and 2 cities in the province, and elects 3 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Economy==
In the 2010s, efforts were undertaken to further develop the province. Governor Abdul Ghani Kasuba designated South Halmahera as a tourism region for the province, inaugurating the Widi International Fishing Tournament for that purpose. Kasuba also successfully negotiated with the China-based Jinchun Group to build a nine-trillion rupiah nickel smelter in the Obi Islands.

==Demographics==

=== Population ===
The population of North Maluku at the 2020 Census was 1,282,937 people spread across eight regencies and two cities, but by mid 2023 this was officially estimated to have reached 1,328,594. South Halmahera Regency is the regency that has the largest population, with 255,384 people in mid 2023 or 19.22% of the province&#x27;s total population, followed by Ternate city with 204,920 people in 2023, or 15.42%, while the regency that has the smallest population is Central Halmahera Regency with 60,480 people or just 4.55%. The average annual population growth rate in North Maluku was 2.07% between 2010 and 2020; Morotai Island Regency was the region with the highest annual population growth rate of 3.40% per year, while the area with the lowest annual population growth rate was Ternate with 0.96% per year. With an area of 34,138.36 km2 and a population of 1,328,694 in 2023, the population density in North Maluku was 39 per km2 in 2023; the area with the highest density was Ternate with a density of 1,263 per km2, while the region with the lowest density was East Halmahera Regency with a density of only 15 per km2.

=== Ethnic groups ===
North Maluku has a very diverse population. In total there are around 28 ethnic groups and languages in North Maluku. They are divided into two families of languages based on the language used, namely Austronesian and Papuan. Austronesian groups live in the central and eastern parts of Halmahera. They include the Buli, Maba, Patani, Sawai and Weda peoples. North and West Halmahera are dominated by Papuan-speaking ethnic groups, i.e. Galela, Tobelo, Loloda, Tobaru, Modole, Togutil, Pagu, Waioli, Ibu, Sahu, Ternate and Tidore. In the Sula Islands, there are several ethnic groups such as the Kadai, Mange and Siboyo peoples. Most people in this area have a command of Ternate Malay.

===Religion===

<doc id="453688" wikidata="Q5068" url="?curid=453688" title="North Sulawesi">
<text>North Sulawesi () is a province of Indonesia. It is mainly located on the Minahasa Peninsula of the island of Sulawesi, south of the Philippines and southeast of Sabah, Malaysia, but also includes various small archipelagoes situated between the Minahasa Peninsula and southern Philippines. It borders the Philippines province of Davao Occidental and Soccsksargen regions to the north, the Maluku Sea to the east, Gorontalo (its sole land border) and the Celebes Sea to the west and the Gulf of Tomini to the southwest. The province&#x27;s furthest extent, the outlying and isolated island of Miangas to its north, is the northernmost island of Indonesia that has the country&#x27;s sole and only border with the Philippines. 

The province&#x27;s area is , and its population was 2,270,596 according to the 2010 census; this rose to 2,621,923 at the 2020 Census, while the official estimate as at mid-2023 was 2,681,540 (comprising 1,369,850 males and 1,311,690 females).

The province&#x27;s capital and largest city is Manado, which is also the main gateway and the economic center of the province. Other major towns includes Tomohon and Bitung in the northern (Minahasa) half of the province, and Kotamobagu in the southern (Bolaang Mongondow) half. There are 41 mountains with an altitude ranging from . Most geologic conditions in the province are consisted mainly of young volcanic regions, with numerous eruptions and many active volcanic cones that adorn the central Minahasa, Bolaang Mongondow and Sangihe Islands.

North Sulawesi in the past was an area of potential spices, rice and gold which became a battleground for the interests of economic hegemony between the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and the Kingdoms around this area, which ultimately led to political and military struggles. The past of this region also became the trading route between west and east and the spread of Christianity, Islam and belief or religion brought by Chinese merchants. The Portuguese first landed on the area at the 16th century. Following decades of war between the Portuguese, the Spanish and the Dutch to control the area, the area ultimately fell to the Dutch at the 17th century. The Dutch ruled the area for three centuries, before being ousted by the Japanese on the eve of World War II. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Dutch briefly regained possession of the area, before finally leaving in 1949 following the Round Table Conference, in which the Dutch recognized the newly created United States of Indonesia (RIS). Thus, North Sulawesi was incorporated into the territory of the State of East Indonesia (NIT). The NIT was finally dissolved and then merged into the RIS. 

On 17 August 1950, the RIS was officially disbanded and then re-formed as the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. The island of Sulawesi was governed briefly as a single province, before being separated into several different provinces. Thus, the province of North Sulawesi was created on 14 August 1959. The western half of this area (as that time comprising the Gorontalo Regency and the newly created Boalemo Regency) was separated from North Sulawesi on 5 December 2000 and established as the province of Gorontalo.

==Etymology==
The area around North Sulawesi used to be called Minahasa. The name is still used sometimes to refer to the province. The word Minahasa is etymologically derived from the words &quot;Mina-Esa&quot; (Minaesa) or &quot;Maesa&quot; which means &#x27;being one&#x27; or &#x27;uniting&#x27;, meaning hope to unite various sub-ethnic groups of Minahasa consisting of Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tolour (Tondano), Tonsawang, Ponosakan, Pasan and Bantik. The word &quot;Minahasa&quot; itself was only used during the colonial era. &quot;Minahasa&quot; is generally interpreted as &quot;having become one&quot;. Based on several historical documents, the word &quot;Minahasa&quot; is firstly used by J.D. Schierstein, the Dutch regent of Manado, in his report to the Governor of Maluku on 8 October 1789. The word &quot;Minahasa&quot; in his report is defined as Landraad or &quot;State Council&quot; or &quot;Regional Council&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-Colonial Era===
Archaeological research has revealed signs of human life in North Sulawesi from 30,000 years ago, based on evidence in the cave Liang Sarru on the island of Salibabu. Other evidence shows life about 6,000 years ago on the Passo Hillside Site in Kakas District and 4,000 years ago to early AD at the Liang Tuo Mane&#x27;e cave in Arangkaa on Karakelong Island.

===Colonial Period===
At the end of the 16th century, the Portuguese and Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. When Europeans arrived, the Ternate Sultanate had influence in North Sulawesi, frequented by Bugis traders from South Sulawesi. The wealth of Minahasa&#x27;s natural resources made Manado a strategic port for European traders going to and from Maluku. The Portuguese were the first European colonizers to arrive in North Sulawesi, a Portuguese ship anchored on an island off Manado in the Kingdom of Manado in 1521. The northern islands of the peninsula were under the control of the Sultanate of Maguindanao during the time. The Spanish ship docked on the island of Talaud and Siau, on to Ternate. The Portuguese built a fort at Amurang. Spain built a Fort in Manado, giving Spain control of the Minahasa Peninsula. Resistance against Spanish occupation culminated in 1660–1664. Dutch ships landed in Manado City in 1660, assisting the Minahasa Confederation against Spain. The members of the Minahasa Confederation entered into a Trade Agreement with the VOC. This trade cooperation agreement gave the VOC monopoly on trade, gradually imposing its will, eventually leading to the 1700s resistance in Ratahan, culminating in the Dutch Minahasa-War in 1809–1811 at Tondano.

Spain had colonized the Philippines and made Minahasa a coffee plantation with imported South American coffee because of its fertile land. Manado was further developed by Spain to become a center of coffee trade for Chinese merchants. In the 16th century one of the first Indo-Eurasian communities in the archipelago appeared in Manado. The first king of Manado, Muntu Untu (1630) was half Spanish. Spain then handed over Minahasa to the Portuguese in exchange for 350,000 ducats in a treaty. The rulers of Minahasa sent Supit, Pa&#x27;at, and Lontoh to ally with the Dutch to expel the Portuguese from Minahasa. In 1655 they excelled, building their own fortress in 1658 and drove out the last Portuguese a few years later.

By the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch had overthrown the sultanate of Ternate, and began to gain influence from Spain and Portugal. In 1677 the Dutch conquered the Sangir archipelago, two years later, Robert Padtbrugge, the governor of Maluku, visited Manado. His arrival resulted in an agreement with the Minahasan chiefs who led to Dutch domination for the next 300 years although the direct rule by the Dutch only began in 1870. The Dutch helped unify the Minahasa confederation, and in 1693. Dutch influence flourished with the spreading of Christianity and European culture in the land of Minahasa. The missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were one of the first attempts of mass education in Indonesia, providing an opportunity for graduates to find employment in the civil service, military, and high positions in the Dutch East Indies government. Minahasa relations with the Dutch were often poor. Causing a war between the Dutch and Tondano in 1807 and 1809. Eventually the Dutch and Minahasa became very close, with Minahasa often referred to as the 12th Dutch province. In 1947, some Manadonese formed a political movement of Twapro, short for Twaalfde Provincie (Twelfth Province) who appealed for formal integration of Minahasa into the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

===Independence===

During Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies the Allies bombed Manado greatly in 1945. During the Indonesian War of Independence, there was a split between pro-Indonesian and pro-Dutch residents. The appointment of Sam Ratulangi as the first governor of Sulawesi then succeeded in winning Minahasan support to the Republic of Indonesia. After Indonesian independence, Indonesia was divided into 8 provinces, and Sulawesi was one of these provinces. In 1946 the State of East Indonesia was formed in Sulawesi, and later became a state within the United States of Indonesia. The State of East Indonesia was dissolved, and merged into the Republic of Indonesia as part of a then unified Sulawesi Province.

In March 1957, Sulawesi military leaders held a confrontation with the central government, with demands for greater regional autonomy. They called for more active development, a fairer distribution of taxes, assistance against Abdul Kahar Muzakkar&#x27;s rebellion in South Sulawesi, and a central government cabinet headed by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta in balance. At first the movement of the &#x27;Permesta&#x27; (Charter of the Struggle of the Universe) was merely a movement of reform rather than a separatist movement.

Negotiations between the central government and Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in South Sulawesi, but Minahasan leaders were not satisfied with the outcome of the agreement and the movement broke out. Fearful of southern dominance, Minahasan leaders declared their own North Sulawesi autonomous state in June 1957. At that time the central government had controlled South Sulawesi, but in the North there were no strong figures of the central government and there were rumors that the United States was arming the PRRI rebellion in Sumatra, which has links with Minahasan leaders.

The possibility of foreign intervention prompted the central government to request military assistance from southern Sulawesi. The Permesta forces were later removed from Central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangihe Islands, and Morotai in Moluccas. The United States then halted resistance, and in June 1958 central government forces landed in Minahasa. The Permesta uprising ended in mid-1961.

The effects of the Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions was ultimately counterproductive, with central government authority increasing while regional autonomy weakened, radical nationalism strengthened than pragmatic moderation, communist party power and Sukarno increased while Mohammad Hatta was weakened, with the establishing of Guided Democracy () in 1958. But the demands of the Minahasa peoples for the province of their own would not end, and in 1964 the People&#x27;s Representative Council enacted Law no. 13 officially creating the province of North Sulawesi, with Manado as provincial seat. 14 August 1959 was designated as the anniversary of the province.

Since the 1998 reforms, the Indonesian government has begun to adopt laws that enhanced regional autonomy. Two years later, the city of Gorontalo and two Muslim-majority regencies of the province were separated to form Gorontalo Province.

== Environment ==

In 2010, about 68% were Christian (predominantly Protestant with a sizable Catholic minority), one of the few exceptions in the predominantly Muslim Indonesia, due to the prominent Dutch missionary activity during the colonial era. Also, because the Muslim-majority region of Gorontalo (then comprising a city and two regencies) was split off to form a new province on 5 December 2000. There are also Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist minorities. The largest ethnic groups are the Minahasan in the north of the province and the Mongondow to the south. The province&#x27;s chief city is Manado with a population of 458,580 people according to the mid 2023 official estimate.

===Religion===

About two-thirds of the population of North Sulawesi adhere to Christianity, while nearly one-third follow Islam; smaller numbers follow Hinduism or other faiths. Christianity is the predominant religion in those districts and cities of the Islands and Minahasa, while Islam is the largest religion in the districts and cities in the Bolaang Mongondow. Most of the Christians in North Sulawesi adhere to Protestantism, while significant minority Roman Catholic communities also exist in Manado and Bitung. Chinese folk religions such as Confucianism and Taoism also exist, mostly concentrated in Manado, which has a significant Chinese population. Manado also has a Jewish community, numbering about 800. Currently, the only synagogue in Indonesia is located in Manado. As the Indonesian government only recognizes six religions and traditional faith, those who adhere to other religions or faiths can choose to put one of the officially recognized religions or traditional faith, or &quot;Kepercayaan Terhadap Tuhan Yang Maha Esa&quot; (Believe in One Almighty God) on their ID cards.

===Ethnicity===

The Minahasan is the dominant ethnic group in the province. They are the most populous ethnic group in the Minahasa Peninsula. They mostly lived in areas covering Bitung City, Manado City, Tomohon City, Minahasa Regency, North Minahasa Regency, South Minahasa Regency and Southeast Minahasa Regency. Other ethnic groups are the Bolaang Mongondow, Sangihe, Talaud and Siau. Ethnicity in North Sulawesi is more heterogeneous then other parts of Indonesia. The Minahasan and Bolaang Mongondow are spread almost throughout the region of North Sulawesi mainland. The Sangihe, Talaud and Siau mostly inhabit the Sangihe Islands, Talaud Island, and Lembeh Island, especially in coastal areas north, east and west of mainland North Sulawesi. The Bajau people are seafaring nomads who has migrated from the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines, due to the conflict in Mindanao. They inhabits several coastal villages of North Sulawesi in the northern part of North Minahasa Regency.

In addition to the natives, North Sulawesi is also home to migrants. There are a significant Chinese population in North Sulawesi, especially around the city of Manado. The Chinese are also one of the first people to have contact with the local people before the Europeans came. According to the discovery of Chinese ancient letters in the Tompaso area, Minahasa shows the cultural interaction between the Chinese and Minahasa have existed since the Han dynasty. Most of the Chinese population in North Sulawesi are from the Hakka dialect group, while small numbers of Hokkien and Cantonese populations also exist.

Other ethnic groups such as the Javanese and the Sundanese also exist. They are mostly migrated from where they come from due to the Transmigration program enacted by the Dutch during the colonial era until the Suharto era. They generally live in urban areas, such as Manado and Bitung.

===Language===
Indonesian is the official language of the province, as well as of other parts of Indonesia. Official documents released by the provincial government as well as road signs are all written in Indonesian. However, Manado Malay is the lingua franca of the province. This language resembles Indonesian but with a distinct accent and dialect. Some of the vocabulary are derived from Dutch, Portuguese and other foreign languages. Manado Malay is often used for day-to-day communication between different ethnic groups. Minahasan languages are spoken by the Minahasan people. They are spread around the central and northern part of the province. In the Minahasa area, five (5) distinct languages are spoken: Tonsawang, Tontemboan, Toulour, Tonsea and Tombulu. To the south, the Mongondow language and the Gorontalo language are spoken. In the islands to the north which borders the Philippines, the Visayan languages are used by the local people.

Other languages spoken are Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese. They are mostly spoken by migrants coming from other parts of Indonesia. As Manado has a significant Chinese population, Hakka is also spoken by some Chinese people. Some other Chinese dialects are also spoken, such as Hokkien and Cantonese. English and Mandarin are widely understood in areas where there is a large tourism industry, such as the Bunaken National Park. Older generations tend to understand Dutch and Portuguese. People who lived in islands near the borders of the Philippines may understand Tagalog.

==Government and administrative divisions==
===Administrative divisions===
Following the separation of Central Sulawesi as a separate province in 1964, North Sulawesi was originally composed of four regencies () – Minahasa, Sangihe Talaud, Bolaang Mongondow and Gorontalo – and the independent cities () of Manado (preexisting) and Gorontalo. The city of Bitung was separated from Minahasa Regency on 15 August 1990 to become a second independent city. On 4 October 1999 a new Boalemo Regency was created from part of Gorontalo Regency, but on 5 December 2000 both Gorontalo Regency and the new Boalemo Regency were split off from the province to become jointly a new Gorontalo Province. Further regencies were created from 2002 onwards - Talaud Islands on 10 April 2002 from part of Sangihe Islands Regency, North Minahasa on 18 December 2002 from part of Minahasa Regency, and South Minahasa - and the independent city of Tomohon - on 25 February 2003 from further parts of Minahasa Regency. Further new regencies followed on 2 January 2007 - North Bolaang Mongondow and the independent city of Kotamobagu from parts of Bolaang Mongondow Regency, the Sitaro Islands from part of Sangihe Islands Regency, and Southeast Minahasa from part of South Minahasa Regency. Two further regencies were created on 24 June 2008 from further parts of Bolaang Mongondow Regency - East Bolaang Mongondow and South Bolaang Mongondow.

The province is thus now divided into eleven regencies () and four independent cities (), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.
Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People&#x27;s Representative Council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; or DPR) to create a separate Bolaang Mongondow Province. However, since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The North Sulawesi Electoral District consists of all of the 11 regencies and 4 cities in the province, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

<doc id="453690" wikidata="Q5075" url="?curid=453690" title="Southeast Sulawesi">
<text>Southeast Sulawesi (, often abbreviated to Sultra), is a province on the island of Sulawesi, forming the southeastern peninsula of that island, together with a number of substantial offshore islands such as Buton, Muna, Kabaena and Wawonii (formerly called Wowoni), together with many smaller islands. It is bordered by South Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi to the north, sharing a maritime border with Maluku and North Maluku to the east and East Nusa Tenggara to the south, as well a very narrow maritime border with East Timor to the south. The capital is the city of Kendari, on the east coast of the peninsula.

The province has no highway road connecting to the rest of the island, and the primary transportation link is a ferry across the Bone Gulf between Watampone (Bone) in South Sulawesi and the port of Kolaka in Southeast Sulawesi.

==History==
From the seventeenth century until the early twentieth century, the region was the site of the (Butung).

==Geography==

The two major mountain ranges in Southeast Sulawesi are the Tanggeasinua Range and the Mekongga Range. The major rivers are the Lalinda, the Lasolo, and the Sampara.

==Demographics==
The population of the province was 2,232,586 at the 2010 decennial census (1,120,225 males, and 1,110,344 females), increasing to 2,624,875 at the 2020 Census. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,743,574. Konawe Selatan, Konawe, Kolaka and Muna are the four most populous regencies. 

A third of the population is centered on Buton and Muna islands off the south coast of Sulawesi, and another 15% live in and around Kendari.
===Religion===
Islam is the predominant religion (96.2%). According to the 2021 estimates, 2,560,000 people were Muslims, 50,780 were Hindus, 44,870 were Protestants, 16,180 were Roman Catholics, 1,610 were Buddhists, 113 were Confusians and 63 adhered to Folk religions.

===Ethnic groups===
The main ethnic groups in Southeast Sulawesi are &quot;Tolaki&quot;, &quot;Buton&quot;, &quot;Muna&quot; etc.

==Government and administrative divisions==
Southeast Sulawesi Province is divided into fifteen regencies (including the five new regencies established in 2013 and 2014) and two autonomous cities.

As at 1995, there were just four regencies within the province - Buton, Kolaka, Konawe and Muna. On 3 August, the city of Kendari was created from part of Konawe Regency, and on 21 June 2001 the city of Bau-Bau was created from part of Buton Regency.

On 25 February 2003, South Konawe Regency was created from part of Konawe Regency. On 18 December 2003, three new regencies were created - Bombana Regency and Wakatobi Regency from parts of Buton Regency, and North Kolaka Regency from part of Kolaka Regency. On 2 January 2007, two new regencies were created - North Konawe Regency from part of Konawe Regency, and North Buton Regency from part of Muna Regency.

In 2013 the Indonesian Government enacted the creation of 11 new Regencies and Municipalities, including the following in Southeast Sulawesi:

* Konawe Islands Regency, from part of Konawe Regency (enacted by Act No.8 of 2013, on 11 January 2013).
* East Kolaka Regency, from part of Konawe Regency (enacted by Act No.11 of 2013, on 11 May 2013).

Subsequently, on 24 June 2014, the Indonesian Parliament agreed to create three more new regencies, based on consideration of technical, administrative, area, strategic and geopolitic factors:

* South Buton Regency, from part of Buton Regency (enacted by Act No.16 of 2014, on 23 July 2014).
* Central Buton Regency, from part of Buton Regency (enacted by Act No.16 of 2014, on 23 July 2014).
* West Muna Regency, from part of Muna Regency (enacted by Act No.16 of 2014, on 23 July 2014).

These regencies and cities are tabulated below, with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the location of the regency/city headquarters and their Human Development Index.

Notes

(a) Bombana Regency is mainly peninsula (the areas around Poleang and Rumbia on Sulawesi Island) but partly insular (including most of Kabaena Island). (b) The Central Buton Regency comprises the southern part of Muna Island and a small southern part of Kabaena Island, but does not include any part of Buton Island. (c) Under discussion by the Indonesian government in 2013 was a proposal to create an additional municipality of Raha, on Muna Island, but any such proposal is in abeyance and this potential extra municipality is not separated in the table above. (d) The Konawe Islands Regency comprises Wawonii Island and small offshore islets around it.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Southeast Sulawesi Electoral District consists of all of the 15 regencies in the province, together with the cities of Kendari and Bau-Bau, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

<text>Oliver Hudson Kelley (January 7, 1826 – January 20, 1913) was one of the key founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a fraternal organization in the United States.

==Early life==
Kelley was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 7, 1826. 

==Career==
In 1849, he moved to the Minnesota frontier, where he became a farmer. In 1864, he got a job as a clerk for the United States Bureau of Agriculture and traveled the Eastern and Southern United States following the American Civil War. He felt a great need to gather together farmers and their families to rebuild America as he once knew it, and thought an organization of fraternal strength would best serve the needs of the farm families.

As he traveled throughout the country, Kelley built partnerships that developed into the seven original founders of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. On November 15, 1867, he laid the groundwork to build a new foundation for American agriculture through the organization of the Grange, of which he was the first secretary until he resigned in 1878.

The other founders of the Grange were William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland, and Kelley&#x27;s niece Caroline A. Hall.

Kelley was inducted into the National Agricultural Center and Hall of Fame on October 27, 2006. Oliver Kelley Farm in Elk River, Minnesota, is maintained by the Minnesota Historical Society as a living history farm with interpreters giving people a taste of what Oliver Kelley&#x27;s life was like on the farm in the 1850s frontier and giving a feel for modern Minnesota farming in a Farm Lab section since 2017.

In 1877, Kelley founded the town of Carrabelle, Florida, which he named for his niece.

<text>Lampung, officially the Province of Lampung (), is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the southern tip of the island of Sumatra. It has a short border with the province of Bengkulu to the northwest, and a longer border with the province of South Sumatra to the north, as well as a maritime border with the provinces of Banten and Jakarta to the east. It is the home of the Lampung people, who speak their own language and possess their own written script. Its capital city is Bandar Lampung.

The province covers a land area of 33,575.41 km2 and had a population of 7,608,405 at the 2010 census, 9,007,848 at the 2020 census, and 9,313,990 (comprising 4,760,260 males and 4,553,720 females) according to the official estimates for mid-2023, with three-quarters of that being descendants of Javanese, Madurese and Balinese migrants. These migrants came from more densely populated islands in search of available land, as well as being part of the national government&#x27;s Indonesian transmigration program, of which Lampung was one of the earliest and most significant transmigration destinations.

In 1883, the volcano of Krakatoa, located on an island in the Sunda Strait, erupted into becoming one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history, with disastrous consequences for the area and elsewhere, including estimates of human fatalities in the tens of thousands and worldwide temperature and other weather effects for years.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of &quot;Lampung&quot; is unknown. But, in Batak, &quot;Lappung&quot;, meaning &#x27;big&#x27;, has been suspected to be related to the eruption of Mount Merapi, later becoming the name Lampung. However, the name of this province could come from the word &quot;Lampohwang&quot;.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Lampung was part of the Srivijaya empire, with its regional capital in Jambi, which controlled most of Southeast Asia until the 11th century era.

The entry of the Banten Sultanate in Lampung in the 16th century marked the beginning of the spread of Islam in the region. Lampung is known for pepper, which at that time was in high demand. At that time, the Dutch began pressing for control of the region. In the 1930s, Lampung still accounted for 30% of the world&#x27;s pepper production.

In 1610, the Dutch East India Company established a trading post in Banten and, later in the 17th century, began the forceful pepper cultivation in Lampung. The Dutch began to control the Lampung spice trade under Sultan Haji. The area was part of the Banten Sultanate until it was annexed by the Dutch in 1752, when it became known as the &quot;Residentie Lampoengse Districten&quot;. It became part of the Dutch East Indies.

Under Dutch rule, transmigration programs were implemented. This program involved the migration of people from Java to Lampung. Many residents of Java moved to the transmigration sites located in the eastern region of Lampung. The program was expanded after Indonesian independence in the 1960s. The Javanese brought cultural devices to Lampung, such as the gamelan and wayang.

=== After independence ===
Provinsi Lampung was created on 18 March 1964 with the implementation of the Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 3/1964, later becoming Undang-undang Nomor 14 Tahun 1964. The province broke away from Sumatera Selatan, along with Jambi, Bengkulu, and Bangka Belitung Islands.

==Geography==

Lampung Province has an area of , about the same size as Moldova. The province borders the Sunda Strait to the southeast and the Java Sea to the east. There are a number of offshore islands within Lampung Province, such as Legundi, Krakatoa, and Tabuan. These islands are located mostly in the Bay of Lampung. Pisang Island lies at the entrance to the Regency of West Lampung. There are 172 islands considered to be part of the province that have names.

The highest mountain in Lampung is Mount Pesagi, standing at above sea level in West Lampung. The river Way Sekampung is the longest river in the province, at with a catchment area of . Mount Krakatau is a volcanic caldera located in the Sunda Strait, close to the Lampung province. The Krakatoa erupted from 20 May until 21 October 1883, which caused landslides, producing high waves in the coastal area of Lampung.

Between 1969 and 1970, the total area of forest land in Lampung that had been used was 249,200 hectares. In 2000, there were 48 permits issued; in 1980, the number reached 76 permits. The topography of the region in the western part is mostly hilly, while the eastern part is mostly a lowland area that is agricultural and swampy. In 1950, nine specimens per 100 square kilometres in Lampung were collected as part of botanical research.

==Government and administrative divisions==
Lampung Province, which was formed from the southern portion of South Sumatra Province in 1964, was initially composed of just three regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;): Lampung Selatan, Lampung Tengah and Lampung Utara (and one autonomous city, Bandar Lampung). A fourth regency (Lampung Barat) was created on 16 August 1991 from part of Lampung Utara, and on 3 January 1997, two further regencies were created: Tanggamus from part of Lampung Selatan and Tulang Bawang from part of Lampung Utara.

On 20 April 1999, two additional regencies were formed: Lampung Timur from part of Lampung Tengah and Way Kanan from part of Lampung Utara, as well as a second autonomous city, Metro, from another part of Lampung Tengah. A ninth regency (Pesawaran) was created on 17 July 2007 from a part of Lampung Selatan.

On 29 October 2008, three more regencies were formed: Mesugi and Tulang Bawang Barat from parts of Tulang Bawang Regency, and Pringsewu from part of Tanggamus Regency. A thirteenth regency (Pesisir Barat) was formed on 25 October 2012 from the west coast part of Lampung Barat Regency. These are all listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010, 2020 and at the mid-2023 official estimates.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Lampung I Electoral District consists of 6 of the regencies in the province (Tanggamus, South Lampung, Pesawaran, Pringsewu, West Lampung and Pesisir Barat), together with the cities of Bandar Lampung and Metro, and elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Lampung II Electoral District consists of the remaining 7 regencies (East Lampung, Central Lampung, North Lampung, Way Kanan, Tulang Bawang, Mesuji and West Tulang Bawang) and likewise elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

In 2024, the General Elections Commission (KPU) determined 85 legislative candidates for the Lampung Province DPRD for the 2024–2029 period. The political party Gerindra Party has the most seats, winning 16 seats.

==Agriculture==

Major crops in the region include robusta coffee beans, cocoa beans, coconuts and cloves. This agriculture has included illegal growing in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. In addition, nata de coco is also manufactured in the region by domestic companies. Rubber and palm oil are also harvested.

According to Kementerian Kelautan dan Perikanan, in 2023, shrimp production in Lampung reached 59,613 tons. Indonesia has black pepper and white pepper. Lampung declined its pepper export rate in 2021 to minus 37.5 percent in a year. As of 2023, Lampung accounted for 42 percent of Indonesia&#x27;s overall pepper exports.

== Culture ==
Lampung Province has 438 cultural heritage objects. There is an ancient site of the Islamic era in the form of an ancient cemetery in Bantengsari, East Lampung. Historical sites include the Tomb of National Hero Raden Intan II in South Lampung. The province has a Lampung Province Regional Regulation Number 2 of 2008. An example of traditional houses in Lampung includes Nuwou Sesat; the shape of the house was built to avoid potential animal attacks.

=== Clothing ===

Lampung traditional clothing is divided into two customs: Lampung Saibatin and Lampung Pepadun. In general, Lampung women wear a set of traditional clothing consisting of kebaya, a belt and slippers. A set of jewelry is also worn. The men&#x27;s clothing consists of a sleeved shirt, a headband and sandals. Tapis is a woven cloth often worn by women as part of traditional clothing.

Siger is a traditional golden crown worn by Lampung women during traditional events. Siger typically has either seven or nine curves at the top. Similarly, kopiah emas is a metallic cap with sharp edges at the top that is worn mostly by men. The cap is decorated with a flower garland. Keris, Indonesia&#x27;s traditional weapon, is sometimes included as part of a decorative item in Lampung&#x27;s traditional clothing sets. Sometimes, the clothing is also used in regional Lampung dance performances such as the Bedana Dance and the Sembah Dance. Melinting is another traditional Lampungese dance.

=== Textiles ===
Lampung had a weaving tradition. Lampung weaving used a supplementary weft technique that enabled colored silk or cotton threads to be superimposed on a plainer cotton background. The most prominent Lampung textile was the Palepai, ownership of which was restricted to the Lampung aristocracy of the Kalianda Bay area. 
There were two types of smaller clothes, known as &quot;tatibin&quot; and &quot;tampan&quot;. Lampung textiles like &quot;Palepai&quot;, &quot;tatebin&quot; and &quot;tampan&quot; were called &#x27;ship cloths&#x27; because ships are a common motif. The ship motif represents the transition from one realm of life to the next, for instance, from boyhood to manhood or from being single to married, and also represents the final transition to the afterlife.

== Tourism ==
Although tourism is not Lampung Province&#x27;s main source of income, the administration has attempted to boost tourism from beaches, such as Flamboyant Tanjung Setia. There is also Pahawang Island and Sari Ringgung Beach. In 2010, 400,000 tourists visited Lampung Province, including ten thousand foreign tourists mainly from Australia and New Zealand.

Lampung also has a national park, the Way Kambas National Park; it is an elephant sanctuary in the district of Labuhan Ratu, East Lampung. The number of Sumatran elephants (&quot;Elephas maximus sumatranus&quot;) living in the region has decreased. Way Kambas National Park was established in 1985.

The 15,000-capacity Pahoman Stadium is the main stadium in Lampung. The association football stadium opened in 1977.

==Demographics==
Lampung&#x27;s three major ethnic groups are the Javanese, Lampungese and Sundanese. The Lampungese are the native ethnic group of the province. Languages used in the province include Indonesian (official), Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Minangkabau and Lampung. According to the Indonesian census from 2010, the province of Lampung is 64.17 percent Javanese, 13.56 percent Lampungese, 5.64 percent Malay and 0.53 percent Chinese.

===Religion===

The 2022 data of Ministry of Religious Affairs found 96.09% of the population as adherents to Islam and 2,22% as Christian. The remainder includes Hindus (1.4%), Buddhists (0.27%), and &quot;other&quot;, including traditional beliefs (0.02%).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Lampung is based on the 1971 Regional Regulation No. 1. The coat of arms consists of a visual depiction of rice and pepper, which are symbols of crops that are cultivated in Lampung. Laduk and payan in the form of machetes and spears are traditional weapons of the Lampung people. Gong symbolises the majesty of indigenous cultural arts. On top of the gong is a visual depiction of an umbrella that has 17 umbrella spokes, 8 edge segments, 19 segment boundaries and 45 umbrella tassels, symbolising the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. There are also 17 pepper leaves, 8 pepper fruits and 45 rice fruits. There are 64 pepper seeds, indicating the formation of Daerah Tingkat I Lampung in 1964.

There is a writing in the Lampung script below the gong that reads &quot;Lampung&quot;. The siger&#x27;s number of notches of nine at the top of the traditional crown symbolises the nine rivers that flow in the Lampung area. On the emblem, there is an inscription that reads &quot;Sang Bumi Ruwai Jurai&quot;, which means &#x27;One Land, Two Indigenous Peoples&#x27;. It is meant to symbolize the indigenous people of Lampung that has two traditions on &quot;adat&quot;, namely Saibatin and Pepadun cultural traditions.

<text>Jambi is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the east coast of central Sumatra and stretches to the Barisan Mountains in the west. Its capital and largest city is also called Jambi. It is bordered by the provinces of Riau to the north, West Sumatra to the west, Bengkulu to the southwest, South Sumatra to the south, and shares a maritime border with the Riau Islands to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the east. The province has a land area of 49,026.58 km2, and a sea area of 3,274.95 km2. Its area is comparable to the European country of Slovakia. It had a population of 3,092,265 according to the 2010 census and 3,548,228 according to the 2020 census; the official estimate of population as of mid-2023 was 3,679,169 (comprising 1,872,177 males and 1,806,992 females).

==History==
Jambi was the site of the Melayu kingdom that engaged in trade throughout the Strait of Malacca and beyond. It was recorded as having sent a mission to China in 644 CE. It was annexed by Srivijaya by 685 CE, but tried to declare its independence in the 9th century. Jambi succeeded Palembang, its southern economic and military rival, as the major player in trade in the Malacca straits. After the 1025 Chola raids in Southeast Asia, Jambi still sent missions to China.

In the early decades of the Dutch presence in the region, when the Dutch were one of several traders competing with the British, Chinese, Arabs, and Malays, the Jambi Sultanate profited from trade in pepper with the Dutch. This relationship declined by about 1770, and the sultanate had little contact with the Dutch for about sixty years.

In 1833, minor conflicts with the Dutch East Indies who were well established in Palembang, meant the Dutch increasingly felt the need to control the actions of Jambi. They coerced Sultan Facharudin to agree to greater Dutch presence in the region and control over trade, although the sultanate remained nominally independent. In 1858 the Dutch, concerned over the risk of competition for control from other foreign powers, invaded Jambi with a force from their capital Batavia. They met little resistance, and Sultan Taha fled upriver, to the inland regions of Jambi. The Dutch installed a puppet ruler, Nazarudin, in the lower region, which included the capital city. For the next forty years Taha maintained the upriver kingdom, and slowly reextended his influence over the lower regions through political agreements and marriage connections. In 1904, however, the Dutch were stronger and, as a part of a larger campaign to consolidate control over the entire archipelago, managed to capture and kill Taha, and in 1906, the entire area was brought under direct colonial control.

Following the death of Jambi Sultan, Taha Saifuddin, on 27 April 1904 and the success of the Dutch controlled areas of the Sultanate of Jambi, Jambi then was set up as a Residency and entry into the territory Netherlands Indies. Jambi&#x27;s first Resident OL Helfrich was appointed by the governor general under Dutch Decree No. 20, dated 4 May 1906, with his inauguration held on 2 July 1906.

In 1945, Sumatra comprised a single province, but in 1948 this was divided into three provinces, including the province of Central Sumatra (which included present-day Jambi Province). In 1957 this short-lived province was itself divided, and Jambi was created as an independent Province.

==Government and administrative divisions==
When Jambi Province was created in 1957, it comprised three regencies - Kerinci 
(renamed from South Pesisir Regency on 19 March 1956), Batanghari and Bungo Tebo - as well as the independent city of Jambi City . On 14 June 1965 two new regencies were formed - Sarolangun Bangko from part of Bungo Tebo Regency, and Tanjung Jabung from part of Batanghari Regency. On 4 October 1999 four additional regencies were created by splitting each of four existing regencies in two - Muara Jambi was formed from part of Batanghari Regency, while Sarolangun Bangko Regency was split into separate Sarolangun and Merangin Regencies, Tanjung Jabung Regency was split into separate Tanjung Jabung Barat (&quot;West Tanjung Jabung&quot;) and Tanjung Jabung Timur (&quot;East Tanjung Jabung&quot;) Regencies, and Bungo Tebo Regency was split into separate Bungo and Tebo Regencies. Finally, a second independent city of Sungai Penuh (&quot;Penuh River&quot;) was split off from Kerinci Regency on 1 July 2008.

Thus Jambi province is now divided into nine regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two cities (&quot;kota&quot;), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. These are divided into 141 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), in turn sub-divided into 153 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;) and 1,399 rural villages (&quot;desa&quot;).

The province forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Jambi Electoral District consists of all of the 9 regencies in the province, together with the cities of Jambi and Sungai Penuh, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==World Heritage Sites==

* Kerinci Seblat National Park
The largest of the three national parks comprising the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra, Kerinci Seblat has the distinction of being the second-largest national park in all of Southeast Asia, only after Lorentz National Park on Papua. It is one of the Sumatran Tiger&#x27;s last strongholds on the island, and within its borders sits the highest active volcano in Southeast Asia - Mount Kerinci.

* Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds

May 2011: The Jambi provincial administration is striving to have the ancient Muaro Jambi temple site at Muaro Jambi village in Maro Sebo District, Muaro Jambi Regency, recognized as a World Heritage Site.

The site was a Buddhist education centre that flourished during the 7th and 8th centuries and is made from bricks similar to those used in Buddhist temples in India.

==Demographics==
Due to transmigration policy, many ethnic groups from various parts of Indonesia, especially Java, Borneo, Sulawesi and other parts of Sumatra brought their native languages as well. The non-Pribumi people such as the Chinese Indonesians speak several varieties of Chinese.

Ethnically, the population comprises:
* 38% Jambi Malay
* 20% Javanese
* 10.2% Chinese
* 10% Kerinci
* 5.2% Minangkabau
* 3.4% Batak
* 3.3% Banjarese
* 3.1% Buginese
* 2.6% Sundanese, and 
* 4.4% other

, Islam is the largest religion in Jambi, being practised by 96.09% of the population. Minority religions are Christianity with 3,9%, Buddhism 0.92%, Confucianism 0.02% and Hinduism 0.01% of the population.

After seven consecutive seasons of being a starter for the Redskins, his responsibility was reduced to more of a third-down slot receiver due to the team&#x27;s additions of Pierre Garçon and Josh Morgan, who became the team&#x27;s new starters. In the Week 5 loss against the Atlanta Falcons, he caught a 77-yard touchdown pass from second-string quarterback, Kirk Cousins. He would later score the only two touchdowns for the Redskins in the Week 7 loss against the New York Giants. In the Week 11 win against the Philadelphia Eagles, Moss caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from rookie Robert Griffin III while under double coverage.It was also at this time, Moss was arguably one of, if not the best receiver in Washington Redskins history.

====2013 season====
During the 2013 offseason, Moss restructured his contract in order to clear up cap space. After the Week 11 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he surpassed 10,000 career receiving yards making him the seventh active player at that time to reach this milestone along with Tony Gonzalez, Reggie Wayne, Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Larry Fitzgerald, and Anquan Boldin.

====2014 season====
Set to become a free agent for 2014, Moss re-signed on a one-year deal to remain with the Redskins on March 11, 2014.

During a Redskins-Giants game on December 14, 2014, a touchdown in the closing seconds of the first half by quarterback Robert Griffin III was overturned by official Jeff Triplette after he saw that Griffin had fumbled the ball in the end zone. Moss angrily confronted Triplette and the officiating crew as they walked back to the locker room. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was assessed against Moss, and he was also ejected from the game, for which he heavily protested.

====Retirement====
On September 1, 2022, Moss was inducted into Washington&#x27;s Greatest Players list in honor of the franchise&#x27;s 90th anniversary.

Throughout his career, Moss had a total of 10,283 yards on 732 receptions for 66 touchdowns.

<doc id="453711" wikidata="Q1890" url="?curid=453711" title="Bengkulu">
<text>Bengkulu (), historically known as Bencoolen, is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the southwest coast of Sumatra. It was formed on 18 November 1968 by separating out the area of the historic Bencoolen Residency from the province of South Sumatra under Law No. 9 of 1967 and was finalized by Government Regulation No. 20 of 1968. Spread over 20,130.21 km2, its area is comparable to the European country of Slovenia and it is bordered by the provinces of West Sumatra to the north, Jambi to the northeast, Lampung to the southeast, and South Sumatra to the east, and by the Indian Ocean to the northwest, south, southwest, and west.

Bengkulu is the 28th largest province by area; it is divided into nine regencies and the city of Bengkulu, the capital and the only independent city. Bengkulu is also the 26th largest province by population in Indonesia, with 1,715,518 inhabitants at the 2010 Census and 2,010,670 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,086,006 (comprising 1,065,992 males and 1,020,014 females). According to a release by Badan Pusat Statistik, it has the eleventh highest Human Development Index among the provinces, with a score of about 0.744 in 2013. By 2014, the province is positioned 28th highest in gross domestic product and 20th highest in life expectancy, 70.35 years.

Bengkulu also includes offshore Mega Island and Enggano Island in the Indian Ocean. Bengkulu has 525 kilometres of coastline along the Indian Ocean on its western side, from Dusun Baru Pelokan in Mukomuko Regency to Tebing Nasal in Kaur Regency. Bengkulu has many natural resources such as coal and gold, and has big and potential geothermal resources. However, it is less developed than other provinces in Sumatra.

==Etymology==

Traditional sources suggest that the name Bengkulu or Bangkahulu derived from the word &quot;bangkai&quot; and &quot;hulu&quot; which means &#x27;carcasses located in a stream&#x27;. According to the story, there was once a war between small kingdoms in Bengkulu, resulting in many casualties from both sides in the streams of Bengkulu. These casualties soon rotted as they were not buried, lying in river streams. This etymology is similar to the story of a war between the Majapahit Empire and the Pagaruyung Kingdom in Padang Sibusuk, an area once ruled by the Dharmasraya empire, which also derives the name Padang Sibusuk from casualties rotting on the battlefield. During the European colonial era, the region was known as Bencoolen or British Bencoolen.

==History==
The region was subject to the Buddhist Srivijaya empire in the 8th century. The Shailendra Kingdom and Singosari Kingdom succeeded the Srivijaya but it is unclear whether they spread their influence over Bengkulu. The Majapahit also had little influence over Bengkulu. There were only few smalls ‘kedatuan’ based on ethnicity such as in Sungai Serut, Selebar, Pat Petulai, Balai Buntar, Sungai Lemau, Sekiris, Gedung Agung and Marau Riang. It became a vassal region of the Banten Sultanate (from Western Java) in the early 15th century and since the 17th century was ruled by Minangkabau&#x27;s Inderapura Sultanate (today&#x27;s in Pesisir Selatan, West Sumatra Province).

The first European visitors to the area were the Portuguese, followed by the Dutch in 1596. The British East India Company established a pepper-trading center and garrison at Bengkulu (Bencoolen) in 1685. In 1714 the British built Fort Marlborough, which still stands. The trading post was never profitable for the British, being hampered by a location which Europeans found unpleasant, and by an inability to find sufficient pepper to buy. It became an occasional port of call for the EIC&#x27;s East Indiamen.

In 1785, the area was integrated into British Empire as Bencoolen, while the rest of Sumatra and most of the Indonesian archipelago was part of the Dutch East Indies. Sir Stamford Raffles was stationed as Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen (the colony was subordinate at the time to the Bengal Presidency) from 1818 to 1824, enacting a number of reforms including the abolition of slavery, and the British presence left a number of monuments and forts in the area. Despite the difficulties of keeping control of the area while Dutch colonial power dominated the rest of Sumatra, the British persisted, maintaining their presence for roughly 140 years before ceding Bengkulu to the Dutch as part of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 in exchange for Malacca. Bengkulu then remained part of the Dutch East Indies until the Japanese occupation in World War 2.

During the early 1930s, Sukarno, the future first president of Indonesia, was imprisoned by the Dutch and briefly resided in Bengkulu, where he met his wife, Fatmawati. The couple had several children, including Megawati Sukarnoputri, who later became Indonesia&#x27;s first female President.

After independence, Bengkulu was initially part of the &#x27;South Sumatra&#x27; Province, which also included Lampung, the Bangka-Belitung Islands, and what is now South Sumatra itself, as a Residency. In 1968, Bengkulu gained provincial status, becoming the 26th province of Indonesia, preceding East Timor.

Bengkulu lies near the Sunda Fault and is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. The June 2000 Enggano earthquake killed at least 100 people. A recent report predicts that Bengkulu is &quot;at risk of inundation over the next few decades from undersea earthquakes predicted along the coast of Sumatra&quot; A series of earthquakes struck Bengkulu during September 2007, killing 13 people.

==Geography and climate==
The western part of Bengkulu province, bordering the Indian Ocean coast, is about 576 km along, and the eastern part of the condition is hilly with a plateau that is prone to erosion. Bengkulu Province is on the west side of the Bukit Barisan mountains. The province&#x27;s area is about 20,130.21 square kilometres,or slightly smaller than the European country,Slovenia.The province extends from the border province of West Sumatra to the border province of Lampung; the distance is about 567 kilometres. Bengkulu Province lies between 2° 16&#x27; S and 03° 31&#x27; S latitude and 101° 01&#x27;-103° 41&#x27;E longitude. Bengkulu province in the north borders the province of West Sumatra, in the southern the Indian Ocean and Lampung province, in the west it borders the Indian Ocean and in the east the provinces of Jambi and South Sumatra. Bengkulu province is also bordered by the Indian Ocean coastline of approximately 525 kilometres to the west. Its western part is hilly with fertile plateaus, while the western part is lowland relatively narrow, elongated from north to south and punctuated bumpy areas.

Bengkulu&#x27;s climate is classified as tropical. Bengkulu has a large amount of rainfall throughout the year, even in the driest month. The climate here is classified as Af by the Köppen-Geiger system. The annual average temperature is 26.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 3360 mm.

The total area of Bengkulu province is 20,130.21 km2. For administrative purposes, the province is divided into nine regencies and one city, together sub-divided into 93 districts.

==Population==
The 2010 census reported a population of 1,715,518 including 875,663 males and 837,730 females; by the 2020 Census this had risen to 2,010,670, and the official estimate for mid 2023 was 2,086,006.

===Ethnic groups===

Bengkulu is home to various indigenous ethnic groups. The Rejangs form the majority of the province with 60,4% of the population. The second largest ethnic group is the Javanese forming around 24%. Other minority indigenous ethnic groups includes Lembak, Serawai, Pekal, Enggano, Pasemah, Minangkabau and Malays. There is also non-indigenous ethnic groups that mostly came from other parts of Indonesia such as Sundanese, Javanese, Acehnese, Madurese, Batak, Chinese and others.

===Religion===

The 2022 data of Ministry of Religious Affairs found 97.69% of the population as adherents to Islam and 2% as Christian. The remainder includes Hindus (0.20%) who are mostly Balinese migrants, Buddhists (0.1%), and &quot;other&quot; including traditional beliefs (0.004%).
===Languages===
Like the rest of Indonesia, Indonesian is the official language for formal occasions, institutions, and government affairs while local languages are widely used in daily life.

Most indigenous languages in Bengkulu belong to the Malayan group of Austronesian languages, such as Bengkulu Malay, Lembak, Pekal and Minangkabau varieties. The most widely spoken language in the province, Rejang, is the only Bornean language to be spoken in Sumatra (and one of three outside of Borneo other than Malagasy in Madagascar and Yakan in Basilan).

Engganese is classified as a highly divergent branch of Malayo-Polynesian, however, this is still debated.. A less-studied language is Nasal language, which may be related to Rejang or form its own branch of Malayo-Polynesian. Non-indigenous ethnic groups also speak their own language/dialects.

==Government and administrative divisions==

When it was formed in 1967 from the western parts of South Sumatra province, Bengkulu Province consisted of three regencies - Bengkulu Selatan, Bengkulu Utara and Rejang Lbong - together with the independent city of Bengkulu, which lies outside any regency. Five additional regencies were established on 25 February 2003 - Kaur Regency and Seluma Regency from parts of Bengkulu Selatan, Kepahiang Regency and Lebong Regency from parts of Rejand Lrbong Regency, and Mukomuko Regency from part of Bengkulu Utara. A ninth regency (Bengkulu Tengah) was formed on 24 June 2008 from another part of Bengkulu Utara. The regencies and city are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023 (rounded to the nearest 100 persons).
Note: (a) includes Enggano Island and neighbouring small islands in the Indian Ocean.

The province forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Bengkulu Electoral District consists of all of the 9 regencies in the province, together with the city of Bengkulu, and elects 4 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Economy==
Three active coal mining companies produce between 200,000 and 400,000 tons of coal per year, which is exported to Malaysia, Singapore, South Asia, and East Asia. Fishing, particularly tuna and mackerel, is an important activity. Agricultural products exported by the province include ginger, bamboo shoots, and rubber.

<text>The Bangka Belitung Islands (; Jawi: ) is a province of Indonesia. Situated off the southeastern coast of Sumatra, the province comprises two main land masses — the islands of Bangka and Belitung — and numerous smaller islands. Bangka Belitung is bordered by the Bangka Strait to the west, the Natuna Sea to the north, the Java Sea is to the south and the Karimata Strait to the east; the two principal islands are separated by the Gaspar Strait, within which lie lesser islands such as Lepar, Pongok (or Liak) and Mendanau.

The province&#x27;s capital and largest city is Pangkalpinang. The province shares maritime borders with South Sumatra to the west, Riau Islands to the north, Banten, the Special Capital Region of Jakarta, West Java, and Central Java to the south, and West Kalimantan to the east.

Mount Maras, located on the island of Bangka, is the province&#x27;s highest point, with a height of . There are several rivers in the province, such as the Sebuku River, Baturusa River and Mendo River. Bangka Belitung is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Malays, Chinese and Javanese. Indonesian is the official language, while the local Malay dialect and Hakka serves as the lingua franca of the province.

Historically, Bangka Belitung has been part of the kingdoms of Sriwijaya, Majapahit and Palembang, before becoming a colony of foreign empires (Dutch, British and Japanese). Bangka Belitung was a residency within the Dutch East Indies. Upon the independence of Indonesia, the region was administered as part of the province of Sumatra and subsequently of South Sumatra. Bangka Belitung officially became the 31st province of Indonesia on 4 December 2000.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bangka&quot; is derived from the word &quot;wangka&quot; (वन्च, &#x27;vanca&#x27;) meaning &quot;tin&quot; in Sanskrit, because this region is indeed rich in tin mining. The name &quot;Wangka&quot; first appeared along with the name &quot;Swarnabhumi&quot; in the Indian literary book Milindrapantha from the 1st century BC. Swarnabhumi is identified as the island of Sumatra, the strong allegation that the so-called &quot;Wangka&quot; is the island of Bangka. Louis-Charles Damais, in his book &quot;Epigraphy and History of the Nusantara&quot;, affirms that Bangka comes from the word vowel (vanca).

The name &quot;Belitung&quot; is derived from &quot;Billitonite&quot; meaning the Black Meteorite in Dutch, which is commonly found in the island of Belitung. This stone itself was discovered at the time of tin mining in Belitung. Later on, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications began named the island &quot;Billitonite&quot; or Billiton. Nowadays, &quot;Billitonite&quot; or Black Meteorite, is a distinct souvenir from Belitung Island.

==History==
Bangka Belitung is an area that has a unique range of cultures and languages. Just like other provinces in Indonesia, Bangka Belitung were European and Japanese colonies. Prior to the colonial era, Bangka Belitung was part the Sriwijaya and Majapahit kingdoms who settled Bangka Belitung to expand their power.

The first Europeans arrived in Bangka was the British on 20 May 1812. However, with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, the British left Bangka Belitung, and the Dutch took over. Due to the agreement, the Dutch were able to take control of the Pacific Islands. However, there was a coup attempt by local elite through Depati Barin and his son Depati Amir causing a war from 1849 to 1851 to oppose the colonization in Bangka Belitung, the war was won by the Dutch and Depati Amir was exiled to Kupang in East Nusa Tenggara. Depati Amir was memorialized as a national hero and his name was remembered through its regional airport, the Depati Amir Airport.

During WWII, the Empire of Japan briefly occupied the region. Following the surrender of Japan and the end of the war, the islands become part of an independent Indonesia.

Bangka Belitung has a long history of Chinese in-migration, mainly Hakka. Chinese people in the 13th century had started to migrate into the Bangka region. In the 17th century, the rulers of Palembang saw there was extraordinary potential and later they founded tin mines in Belitung. The tin mine was the main reason the Dutch decided to bring contract workers from mainland China, resettling in Belitung. The tin helped drive the island&#x27;s development and make it the place it is today. Since then, some of the Chinese migrants returned to china while others decided to stay. The ones who decided to stay began assimilating with local people and this was followed by intermarriages. They live peacefully in spite of differences in religion and ethnicity. When anti-Chinese riots occurred in some parts of Indonesia at the end of the Suharto regime in 1998, the locals and those of Chinese descent were not much concerned and still lived peacefully in the Bangka Belitung province.

===Ethnicity===

Bangka Island and Belitung Island were originally inhabited by the Orang Laut, over the course of a long history formed by the process of culture and acculturation. The Orang Laut themselves came from various islands. Sea people from Belitung sailed and inhabited the coast along the Malay Peninsula, then returned to Bangka Island and Belitung Island, while those who lived in the Riau Islands sailed to Bangka. There are also groups of Orang Laut from Sulawesi and Kalimantan. In the next wave, the Bugis, who were originally from South Sulawesi, came and settled in Bangka, Belitung and Riau. Then came the Johor Malay, Siantan Malay, Malay-Chinese, and also native Chinese, mingling during the process of acculturation and culture. Finally came the Minangkabau, Javanese, Banjarese, Madurese, Acehnese and some other ethnic groups.

The Malay is the largest ethnic group in the province. They form around 52.5% of the total population. The Malays are mostly concentrated around the interior of Bangka and Belitung. The Malay are divided into the Bangka Malay and the Belitung Malay. These 2 group are slightly different ranging from their culture to their language. Most of the Malays works in either the farming industry or the fishing industry. The Malay in Bangka Belitung have a very distinct lifestyle compared to other Malay people, especially with those in Malaysia.

The second largest ethnic group is the Chinese, forming around 29.1% of the total population. The Chinese are mostly concentrated in the coastal part of Bangka and Belitung or urban areas. The Chinese in Bangka Belitung were originally from Southern China, especially from Guangdong, migrating from the 18th century to the early 20th century to have better job opportunities. During the colonial era, most of the Chinese worked in the mining industry as well as making their own businesses. Most of the Chinese in Bangka Belitung are Hakka, while significant Hokkien and Cantonese communities also exist. The Chinese culture in Bangka is slightly different from the Chinese in Belitung. The Chinese in Bangka were imported in the early 18th century when the mine was officially opened. They generally did not bring their wives and thus married indigenous people, so the Chinese in Bangka are mostly peranakans who speak the Hakka Language mixed with Malay. Belitung Chinese are considered &quot;totok&quot; (&quot;full-blooded&quot;) because when they came in the 19th century they brought their wives. They adapted to the culture of the archipelago, among others, by changing their clothing into local clothing such as clothes with kebaya kurung or sarong.

Those educators in Bangka Island who cared about the importance of higher education then initiated the presence of universities in Bangka by forming the Foundation of Education Bangka (&quot;Yapertiba&quot;), which later in 1982 founded STIH Pertiba with the Department of Law and STIE Pertiba with Management majors located in Pangkalpinang City. Yapertiba also established STAI Bangka located in Sungailiat City. PT. Timah Tbk. participated in developing the world of higher education by establishing the Polytechnic of Tin Manufacturing in 1994, located in Sungailiat City which has 3 majors.

<doc id="453716" wikidata="Q607661" url="?curid=453716" title="Freedom (Neil Young album)">
<text>Freedom is the 19th studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released on October 2, 1989. &quot;Freedom&quot; relaunched Young&#x27;s career after a largely unsuccessful decade. After many arguments and a lawsuit, Young left Geffen Records in 1988 and returned to his original label, Reprise, with &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot;. &quot;Freedom&quot; brought about a new, critical and commercially successful album. It was released as an LP record, cassette tape, and CD.

==Writing==
The songs on &quot;Freedom&quot; were written over the span of more than a decade. &quot;Too Far Gone&quot; dates to the &quot;Zuma&quot; era, and would be performed regularly in concert in 1976. &quot;The Ways of Love&quot; was written in the mid-1970s, attempted for &quot;Comes a Time&quot;, and first performed live during the May 1978 Boarding House concerts for &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;. &quot;Eldorado&quot; would first appear as &quot;Road of Plenty&quot; in concert in 1986. Young would rehearse the song with Buffalo Springfield during a brief attempt at a reunion that year. &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; on a Limb&quot; appear on &quot;Summer Songs&quot;, a 1987 collection of solo performances of eight new songs that Young would release on his website on Christmas Day, 2021.

&quot;Crime in the City&quot; would first be performed and recorded with twelve verses as &quot;Sixty to Zero&quot;. He wrote the song in 1988 while sailing in the Pacific: 

&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; was inspired by a relationship of Niko Bolas&#x27; that had fallen apart. The music was influenced by Roy Orbison. According to Young in a November 1990 Vox interview with Nick Kent: 

&quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; originates with a phrase Young borrowed from guitarist Poncho Sampedro. Sampedro would explain in a 2013 interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: 

==Recording==
The first songs recorded for the album were &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Crime in the City&quot;. Young recorded the songs at his home studio at Broken Arrow Ranch in late July 1988, in between sessions for the CSNY album &quot;American Dream&quot; The sessions took place during a break in the tour supporting &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot;, and feature performers from his touring band. &quot;Ordinary People&quot; from &quot;Chrome Dreams II&quot; was also recorded at this time, as was a driving, electric version of &quot;Crime in the City&quot;. Both the electric version and the acoustic album version were recorded as &quot;Sixty to Zero&quot; with all verses. The album take was later edited to remove the first half of the verses. Young explained the edit in a contemporary interview for Dutch radio: &quot;It&#x27;s too long as one thing. It&#x27;s meant to stand by itself, not to be played with anything else. If I play the long version in concert, it&#x27;s too overpowering. If you can imagine listening to anything for 18 minutes, it disturbs the flow. It&#x27;s too much of the same thing so I do the short version.&quot;

After the completion of the Bluenotes tour in December 1988, Young booked time at the Hit Factory in Times Square, New York with bassist Rick Rosas and drummer Chad Cromwell, the rhythm section from the previous tour. Young would dub the trio &quot;Young and the Restless&quot;, a play on the name of the long running soap opera. During the sessions, Young would pursue the loudest sound possible by routing his guitar &quot;Old Black&quot; through different combinations of amps. According to producer and sound engineer Niko Bolas, the loudness was in response to the saccharine production of &quot;American Dream&quot;: &quot;That record came about as a direct result of doing CSNY. Neil was so pissed off at having to do a record that he didn’t want to do, with pretty songs that he fuckin’ hated, that he just retaliated.&quot; The trio recorded the songs &quot;Heavy Love&quot;, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, &quot;Cocaine Eyes&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;On Broadway&quot;, &quot;Eldorado&quot; and &quot;Boxcar&quot;. Young sequenced an early version of &quot;Freedom&quot; from these songs plus the earlier &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Crime in the City&quot; with a proposed title of &quot;Times Square&quot;. Instead of releasing the album, Young embarked on a tour of Australia and then Japan with the Restless plus Ben Keith and Poncho Sampedro. He would dub this band The Lost Dogs. To promote the tour, Young released a five-song EP of the Hit Factory songs, &quot;Eldorado&quot;. The release was limited to Australia and Japan.

Though the &quot;Times Square&quot; tracks would still form the core of the album, Young would continue to incorporate more material. At his ranch in March 1989, Young would record new songs &quot;No More&quot; and &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; and revisit &quot;Too Far Gone&quot; and &quot;The Ways of Love&quot; from the 1970s. In July, he would round out the album by recording &quot;Hanging on a Limb&quot; and overdub vocals to &quot;The Ways of Love&quot; with Linda Ronstadt. A live acoustic take of &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; from Jones Beach from June would open the album. &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; became one of Young&#x27;s signature songs and a live favorite, and bookends the album in acoustic and electric variants, a stylistic choice previously featured on &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot;. Young explains the wide array of music in the album thus: &quot;I knew that I wanted to make a real album that expressed how I felt. I just wanted to make a Neil Young record per se. Something that was just me, where there was no persona, no image, no distinctive character like the Bluenotes guy or the guy in &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Rockin&#x27;&quot;. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve felt like doing an album like this in years.&quot; Although he originally planned to release a purely electric rock album (&quot;nothing but abrasiveness from beginning to end&quot;), Young says the final product is &quot;almost like listening to the radio - it keeps changing and going from one thing to another.&quot;

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performance==
Young would perform the songs &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot;, &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; and &quot;No More&quot; live in September 1989 for the television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. For the performance, Young played with Poncho Sampedro, Charley Drayton and Steve Jordan. In concert, Young would typically play &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; well into the set, when the band&#x27;s energy is at a high. To achieve the same level of energy, Young worked out with his trainer 30 minutes prior to the performance. He explained to author Jimmy McDonough: &quot;I had to pretend I wasn&#x27;t there. I had a dressing room, a little place with an amp in it, in another part of the building. And I walked from there into &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;—and then left. I developed a whole new technique for television. I had my trainer, and we just lifted weights and I did calisthenics to get my blood to the level it would be at after performing for an hour and twenty-five minutes—which is usually how long I&#x27;d be onstage by the time I did that song. To perform that song the way it’s supposed to be performed, you have to be at peak blood level.&quot;

Comedian Dennis Miller would later say that &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; was the single greatest performance on the show in its history.

==Reception==

&quot;Freedom&quot; has received mainly positive reviews, especially in comparison to the rest of Young&#x27;s &#x27;80s work. AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann explained that it &quot;was the album Neil Young fans knew he was capable of making, but feared he would never make again.&quot; He also stated that &quot;there were tracks that harked back to [his] acoustic-based, country-tinged albums.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, rated it an A. He declared that it contains a combination of &quot;the folk ditties and rock galumph that made (Young) famous&quot; and &quot;the Nashvillisms and horn charts that made him infamous.&quot; He also said &quot;it features a bunch of good stuff about a subject almost no rocker white or black has done much with--crack&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it five out of five stars. He called it &quot;the sound of Neil Young, another decade on, looking back again in anger and dread&quot; and that it is about &quot;the illusion of freedom&quot; and &quot;Young&#x27;s refusal to accept that as the last word on the subject.&quot; Fricke summed up the review by calling it &quot;a harsh reminder that everything still comes with a price.&quot;

AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwald offered strong praise for the second track, &quot;Crime in the City,&quot; calling it &quot;undoubtedly the centerpiece of the album,&quot; &quot;cinematic in scope&quot; and &quot;one of Neil Young&#x27;s most accomplished works&quot;.
The album is ranked number 996 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (3rd. edition, 2000).

<text>Jabalia, also spelled Jabalya (), is a city in the State of Palestine located north of Gaza City, in the North Gaza Governorate of the Gaza Strip. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Jabalia had a population of 172,704 in 2017. The Jabalia refugee camp is adjacent to the city to the north. The nearby town of Nazla is a part of the Jabalia municipality.

==Archaeology==
A large cemetery dating to the 8th century CE was found near Jabalia. The workmanship indicates that the Christian community in Gaza was still very much in existence in the early Islamic era of rule in Palestine, and capable of artistic achievements. The remains of the pavement spared by the iconoclasts show depictions of wild game, birds, and country scenes. The late dating of the mosaic pavement proves that the intervention of the iconoclasts, after 750, is later than previously thought and is associated with Abbasid conservatives.

While working on the Salah al-Din Road, laborers accidentally uncovered a monastery from the Byzantine period. The site was excavated by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities. Now the stunning Byzantine mosaics of the monastery are covered with sand to shield them from erosion caused by the direct impact of the winter rain. Byzantine ceramics have also been found.

In 2022, the restoration of a fifth-century Byzantine church carried out by the French organisation Premiere Urgence Internationale and the British Council was finished. The church is decorated with mosaics and religious texts written in Greek.

==History==
Jabalia was known for its fertile soil and citrus trees. The Mamluk Governor of Gaza Sanjar al-Jawli ruled the area in the early 14th century and endowed part of Jabalia&#x27;s land to the al-Shamah Mosque he built in Gaza.

Until 2014, Jabalia also had the ancient Omari Mosque. The site was believed to have housed a mosque since the seventh century, and its portico and minaret dated back to the 14th century, but the Omari was destroyed by Israeli bombings in 2014. The portico consists of three arcades supported by four stone columns. The arcades have pointed arches and the portico is covered by crossing vaults.

===Ottoman period===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, Jabalia appeared in 1596 tax registers as being in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Gaza of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Gazza. It had a population of 331 households, all Muslim, who paid taxes on wheat, barley, vine yards, and fruit trees; a total of 37,640 akçe. 2/3 of the revenue went to a waqf.

In 1838, Edward Robinson noted &quot;Jebalia&quot; as a Muslim village, located in the Gaza district.

In 1863, Victor Guérin found in the mosque fragments of old constructions, and at the well some broken columns. He further noted: &quot;This village, towards the west, borders on the dunes of the coast. It is surrounded, on the other three sides, by fertile gardens, separated from each other by hedges of cacti and other thorny shrubs. Cultivated with care, they are planted with fig, pomegranate, almond, apricot, lemon and orange trees. There are also a few apple trees. Residents go to sell their fruit in Gaza&#x27;s various markets.&quot; 

An Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that the village had a population of 828, in a total of 254 houses, though the population count included men, only. In the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s 1883 &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot;, Jabalia was described as being a large adobe village, with gardens and a well on the northwest. It had a mosque named &quot;Jamia Abu Berjas&quot;.

===British Mandate era===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Jabalia had a population of 1,775 inhabitants, all Muslim, increasing in the 1931 census to 2,425, still all Muslims, in 631 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Jabalia had a population of 3,520, all Muslims, with 11,497 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 138 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 1,009 for plantations and irrigable land, 1,036 for cereals, while 101 dunams were built-up land.

===Post-1948===

During the early months of First Intifada on 27 March 1989 Fares S&#x27;aid Falcha, aged 50, was beaten by Israeli soldiers. He died 3 weeks later in the Makassed Hospital. A report was compiled by the Military Police Investigators and details were passed on to the Chief Military Prosecutor.

In late 2006, Jabalia was the scene of mass protests against airstrikes on homes. Israel contacted the residences of several Hamas members who launched missiles at Israeli civilians from the houses, warning them of an airstrike within the next 30 minutes. Neighbors responded by forming a human shield and successfully stalled the demolition. In 2021, seven people were killed by a Hamas rocket.

===Israel-Hamas war ===

The Jabalia refugee camp, which has been the target of multiple Israeli air strikes during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, was struck again on 31 October. The Israeli air-strike killed at least 50 Palestinians and trapped more than a hundred beneath the rubble, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Indonesia Hospital said most casualties were women and children. Gaza Interior Ministry stated the camp had been &quot;completely destroyed,&quot; with preliminary estimates of about 400 wounded or dead. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that Israeli fighter jets attacked the refugee camp, and stated that the attack killed a Hamas commander who led the 7 October attacks, dozens of Palestinian militants, and destroyed Palestinian tunnels. Hamas claims none of its commanders were present and that Israel was using these claims as an excuse for the attack. The mayor of Jabalia stated Israel had destroyed 75 percent of Jabalia&#x27;s water wells.

The Battle of Jabalia began on 8 November 2023 as part of the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and ended its first phase in late January 2024 with an Israeli withdrawal. Following this, Palestinian forces and the IDF intermittently clashed in Jabalia. A May 2024 IDF offensive into the city ended on 31 May 2024 with an IDF withdrawal after over two weeks of intense fighting and more than 200 airstrikes. Palestinian officials said that 70% of the refugee camp was destroyed. The Israeli military said that it had destroyed over 10 kilometers of underground tunnels that it says the militants used. The Israeli military also said that it had destroyed a number of weapons production sites and rocket launchers. During the weeks-long operation, troops recovered the bodies of seven Israeli hostages.

Having failed to dismantle Hamas in Jabalia, the IDF reinvaded the city after four months on 5 October 2024.

==Demographics==
Jabalia&#x27;s residents have various origins, including the Hauran, Egypt, Bedouin communities, as well as people from Hebron and Jaffa.

A number of male pseudohermaphrodite births have been reported in Jabalia. Jehad Abudaia, a Canadian-Palestinian pediatrician and urologist, has suggested that consanguinity due to cousin marriages accounts for the prevalence of pseudohermaphrodite births. In the Gaza Strip, pseudohermaphrodite conditions often go undetected for years after birth due to the region&#x27;s lower standards of medical treatment and diagnostics.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

<text>Jaguar warriors or jaguar knights, &quot;ocēlōtl&quot; (singular) or &quot;ocēlōmeh&quot; (plural) were members of the Aztec military elite. They were a type of Aztec warrior called a &quot;cuāuhocēlōtl&quot; (derived from &quot;cuāuhtli&quot; (&quot;eagle&quot;) and &quot;ocēlōtl&quot; (&quot;jaguar&quot;). They were an elite military unit similar to the eagle warriors.

The jaguar motif was used due to the belief the jaguar represented Tezcatlipoca. Aztecs also wore this dress at war because they believed the animal&#x27;s strengths would be given to them during battles. Jaguar warriors were used at the battlefront in military campaigns. They were also used to capture prisoners for sacrifice to the Aztec gods. Many statues and images (in pre-Columbian and post-Columbian codices) of these warriors have survived. They fought with a wooden club, studded with obsidian volcanic glass blades, called a macuahuitl. They also used spears and atlatls.

To become a jaguar warrior, a member of the Aztec army had to capture a total of four enemies from battles. This was said to honor their gods in a way far greater than killing enemy soldiers on the battlefield. For a warrior to kill an enemy was considered clumsy.

== Education ==

The formal education of the Aztecs was to train and teach young boys how to function in their society as warriors. The Aztecs had no standing army, so every boy not of noble birth was trained to become a warrior. All boys who were between the ages of 10 and 20 years old would attend one of the two schools. These two schools were the Telpochcalli (the neighborhood school for commoners) and the Calmecac, the exclusive school for nobles. At the Telpochcalli students would learn the art of warfare, and would become warriors. At the Calmecac students would be trained to become military leaders, priests, government officials, etc.

At the age of 15, sons of commoners would be sent to a Telpochcalli within their neighborhood. Here, boys would be trained in the art of warfare and accustomed to military life. The instructors at these schools were veteran warriors who had experience in warfare and leadership. The schools focused on bravery and included a great deal of physical effort and intense pain to increase the strength and stamina of the students. Manual labor included transporting goods such as branches for firewood. The longer the student had attended the school, the more branches he would be expected to carry. This test of carrying firewood would be used to determine if the boy would do well in warfare.

Other manual labor tasks carried out from the Telpochcalli would be community projects. These projects would mainly consist of cleaning areas, building walls, digging canals, and farming. From these projects, students would work hard to complete tasks, and gain the physical experience needed to engage in warfare. The students of this school would also be used to transport shields, food, military supplies, weapons, armor, and wood to warriors on the battlefield. The reason for forcing the students to be near the battlefield was to make them fearless of warfare. Students were under heavy surveillance at all times. If a student was caught leaving training his punishment would be severe. Often, he would be beaten and his hair removed. Removing a student&#x27;s hair would remove any sign of that boy&#x27;s being a warrior. Drinking pulque was prohibited; if caught, the student could be beaten to death. Relationships outside of the school were also prohibited; if a student was caught sleeping with a woman, he would be beaten to death, or severely punished.

== Life as a jaguar warrior ==
Following the warrior&#x27;s path was one of the few ways to change one&#x27;s social status in Aztec culture. Eagle and Jaguar warriors were full-time warriors who worked for the city-state to protect merchants and the city itself. They were expected to be leaders and commanders both on and off the battlefield and acted as sort of a police force for the city. Men who reached this rank were considered as nobles and elites of society and were granted many of the same privileges as a noble. They were allowed to drink &quot;pulque&quot;, have concubines, and dine at the royal palace. Jaguar warriors also participated in gladiatorial sacrifices.

<text>East Nusa Tenggara () is the southernmost province of Indonesia. It comprises the eastern portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, facing the Indian Ocean in the south and the Flores Sea in the north. It consists of more than 500 islands, with the largest ones being Sumba, Flores, and the western part of Timor; the latter shares a land border with the separate nation of East Timor. The province is subdivided into twenty-one regencies and the regency-level city of Kupang, which is the capital and largest city.

Archaeological research shows that Liang Bua cave in East Nusa Tenggara has been inhabited by humans since about 190,000 years ago. The site was home to early humans, including &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot;, who were found in the cave&#x27;s archaeological layers.

East Nusa Tenggara is known for its natural beauty such as Komodo National Park, Labuan Bajo, Lake Kelimutu, and exotic beaches. The province is rich in culture, with diverse tribes, languages, and traditions such as ikat weaving and the Pasola ceremony in Sumba. East Nusa Tenggara also has a strong missionary history, seen from the majority Catholic population and one of two Indonesian provinces where Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion, alongside South Papua. In addition, its marine ecosystem is very rich, making it a popular destination for divers.

== History ==
After the declaration of Indonesian independence in 1945, the eastern part of Indonesia declared the State of East Indonesia. The state was further included in the United States of Indonesia as part of the agreement with the Dutch contained in the transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia in 1949.

In 1950, United States of Indonesia dissolved itself into a unitary state and began to divide its component area into provinces. In 1958, by Indonesian law (&quot;Undang-Undang&quot;) No. 64/1958, three provinces were established in the Lesser Sunda Islands: Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara. The area of East Nusa Tenggara province included the western part of Timor island, Flores, Sumba and many smaller islands in the region.

The province was originally (from 1958) sub-divided into twelve regencies, but on 11 April 1996, the City of Kupang, was separated from Kupang Regency and given regency-level status. Then, following the fall of the Suharto regime in 1998 and the passage of a new regional autonomy law, there was a dramatic subdividing (known as &quot;pemekaran&quot;) of regional governments across Indonesia, at both provincial and regency level. Between 1999 and 2012, nine new regencies were created in East Nusa Tenggara by the division of existing regencies:
*On 4 October 1999, a new Lembata Regency (Regional code 53.13) was formed by the division of the East Flores Regency.
*On 10 April 2002, Rote Island and adjacent islands were split off from Kupang Regency, to form a new Rote Ndao Regency (53.14).
*On 25 February 2003, Manggarai Regency was split into two and a new West Manggarai Regency (53.15) was established.
*On 2 January 2007, the administration of East Nusa Tenggara province was expanded by the establishment of three new regencies &lt;br&gt;– Nagekeo (53.16) was cut out of Ngada Regency, and Central Sumba (53.17) and Southwest Sumba (53.18) were both cut out of West Sumba Regency.
*On 17 July 2007 a new regency of East Manggarai (53.19) was cut out of Manggarai Regency.
*On 29 October 2008 a further regency – Sabu Raijua (53.20) (comprising the Savu Islands group) – was formed from part of the remaining Kupang Regency.
*On 14 December 2012 yet another regency – Malaka (53.21) – was created out of the southern half of Belu Regency.

Therefore, as from early 2013, there are twenty-one regencies plus the one autonomous city (Kupang) in the province.

== Government and administrative divisions ==

The province is divided into twenty-one regencies and one independent city (Kupang). These are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.
Notes: (a) includes Alor and Pantar islands. (b) East Flores Regency includes Adonara and Solor islands as well as the eastern part of Flores Island. &lt;br&gt;(c) West Manggarai Regency includes Komodo and Rinca islands off the west coast of Flores.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The East Nusa Tenggara I Electoral District consists of the 10 regencies jn the Northern (Flores) group, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The East Nusa Tenggara II Electoral District consists of the 7 regencies in the Southeastern (Timor) group and the 4 regencies in the Southwestern (Sumba) group, together with the city of Kupang, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Geography ==

Located in the east of Lesser Sunda Islands, East Nusa Tenggara faces the Indian Ocean in the south and the Flores Sea in the north. This province borders East Timor (&quot;Timor-Leste&quot;) in the western part of Timor island, and is also close to the province of West Nusa Tenggara (&quot;Nusa Tenggara Barat&quot;) and the province of Maluku.

The province consists of about 566 islands, the largest and most dominant are Flores, Sumba, and the western part of Timor. The smaller islands include Adonara, Alor, Komodo, Lembata (formerly called Lomblen), Menipo, Raijua, Rincah, Rote Island (the southernmost island in Indonesia), Savu, Semau, and Solor. The highest point in the province is Mount Mutis in the South Central Timor Regency, 2,427 meters above sea level.

== Demographics ==

The Census population of the province was 4,683,827 in 2010 and 5,325,566 in 2020,

Based on the latest data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the population of East Nusa Tenggara Province has reached around 5.5 million people. Population growth in East Nusa Tenggara is at a fairly stable level, although variations in growth rates are seen in various districts and cities. Kupang City as the provincial capital is the city with the largest population, followed by other large regencys such as Sikka and Manggarai.

The average population density in East Nusa Tenggara is around 110 people per km², but the population distribution is uneven. Urban areas such as Kupang City have a much higher density than rural areas spread across the outer islands, such as Alor, Rote, or Savu.

===Ethnicity and religion===
East Nusa Tenggara Province is known for its very rich ethnic and cultural diversity. Ethnicity in East Nusa Tenggara consists of several main groups, including the Flores tribe, Sumba tribe, Timor tribe, Rote tribe, Alor tribe, and Sabu tribe, foreign ethnic groups such as the Chinese, Arabs, as well as Eurasians (primarily of Portuguese and Dutch ancestry) are also present in the province. Each tribe in East Nusa Tenggara has its own regional language that is different from each other, including Manggarai language, Ngada language, Sikka language, Sabu language, Rote language, and various other dialects. Indonesian is used as the official language in administration and education, but regional languages are still used in daily life in many local communities.

East Nusa Tenggara Province is one of the provinces in Indonesia with a majority Christian population, both Catholic and Protestant. The influence of Christianity is very strong in East Nusa Tenggara, especially in the Flores and Sumba regions, which were influenced by the arrival of European missionaries, especially from Portugal and the Netherlands, centuries ago. In Flores, around 85% of the population is Catholic, making it one of the areas with the largest Catholic population in Indonesia.

However, East Nusa Tenggara also has a significant Muslim community, especially in Kupang City and certain regencies such as in coastal areas or on islands such as Alor and Timor. In addition, there are also Hindus, as well as local beliefs that are still adhered to by some people, especially in Sumba and Timor.

== Economy ==
The economy of East Nusa Tenggara Province is dominated by the agriculture, fisheries, and tourism sectors. Most of the East Nusa Tenggara population works in the agricultural sector, with main crops such as corn, rice, cassava, beans, and coconuts. The livestock sector also plays an important role, especially in areas such as Sumba and Timor, where many residents raise cattle, horses, and pigs.

In addition, the fisheries sector is one of the main sources of livelihood for people in coastal areas and small islands. Fish, seaweed, and other marine products are important commodities developed by local communities.

On the other hand, the tourism sector in East Nusa Tenggara has experienced rapid development in recent years, especially with the increasing popularity of tourist destinations such as Labuan Bajo and Komodo National Park which attract tourists from within and outside the country. The stunning natural beauty such as exotic beaches, volcanoes, and underwater biodiversity are the main attractions for tourists.

=== Economic activity ===
East Nusa Tenggara Province has a diverse economy with agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cultivation as its main pillars. Subsistence farming dominates economic activity, with corn and smallholder plantation crops such as coffee being the main products. Local plants such as the lontar palm (Borassus flabellifer) and the sugar palm (Arenga pinnata) also play an important role in the local economy.

On Sumba Island, palm trees play a major role in providing wood, roofing materials, and producing food in the form of fruits and palm sugar obtained from tapping the fruit stems. In other areas such as West Manggarai, palm trees are also a source of raw materials and processed products that are useful for local communities. Products from palm and palm trees can even be processed into alcoholic beverages through traditional fermentation, which is part of the local economy.

In addition, the forestry sector also plays an important role in supporting the provincial economy. Forests in East Nusa Tenggara provide important resources such as firewood, building materials, and other non-timber products used by local communities. Forestry managed with sustainable principles not only contributes to the economy, but also helps maintain ecosystems and environmental balance, which is very important for communities that depend on natural resources.

Seaweed farming is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in coastal and island areas. In the Alor Islands, for example, informal village-based seaweed farming has become an important source of additional income for the community. Much of this seaweed is exported in its raw form to countries such as Japan, indicating greater economic potential in this sector.

Fisheries are also a mainstay sector for coastal communities. Marine products such as fish, shrimp, and various other marine products are not only a source of food for local communities but also have great potential as export products. This fisheries activity makes a significant contribution to the local economy.

Overall, the economy of East Nusa Tenggara is highly dependent on the use of natural resources traditionally managed by local communities. With agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and seaweed farming as the backbone of the economy, the province continues to develop its potential while preserving the environment and local cultural richness. Through sustainable management of natural resources, East Nusa Tenggara seeks to improve the welfare of its people and strengthen its contribution to the national economy.

Poverty and Alleviation in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT)

NTT is known as one of the poorest provinces in Indonesia, with various factors causing chronic poverty in this region. The arid geographical conditions and consisting of remote islands make access to basic resources and services difficult. Agriculture, which is the main livelihood, is often hampered by less fertile soil and prolonged drought, resulting in low agricultural productivity. In addition, limited infrastructure worsens people&#x27;s access to education, health, and markets.

The low level of education in NTT is also one of the main causes of poverty. Limited access to education, especially in rural areas, means that many children cannot continue their education, thus hampering their ability to get better jobs. This is exacerbated by poor health conditions, where many residents cannot access basic health services due to the lack of medical facilities, health workers, and remote access.

The government and various organizations have made a number of efforts to alleviate poverty in NTT. Some of these include the development of infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and health facilities, which aim to open access and improve connectivity throughout the region. Programs to improve the quality of education such as building schools and sending teachers to remote areas are also being implemented to increase school participation rates.

Efforts to empower the community&#x27;s economy include skills training and access to micro-credit to encourage small and medium enterprises. The tourism sector, which has great potential in NTT, has also begun to be developed as an alternative source of income. In addition, the government has launched social assistance programs such as the Family Hope Program (PKH) and Non-Cash Food Assistance (BPNT) to support poor families in meeting their basic needs.

Although various programs have been implemented, challenges still exist. Corruption, slow bureaucracy, and lack of community involvement in development often hinder the effectiveness of the program. In addition, the impact of climate change on agriculture adds to the complexity of the problem. However, with a sustainable approach and active community participation, there is hope that poverty in NTT can be reduced significantly, bringing prosperity to its residents.

==Infrastructure==
Although infrastructure development in East Nusa Tenggara continues to grow, the province still faces challenges in terms of inter-island connectivity. Land, sea, and air transportation continue to be improved to connect remote areas, but some areas are still difficult to reach, especially during the rainy season when road conditions become less good. On the other hand, the construction of roads, bridges, ports, and airports has been carried out in stages to improve mobility and accessibility, as well as support economic and tourism development in the province.

===Education===
Education in East Nusa Tenggara continues to improve despite various challenges. Accessibility to education is still difficult, especially in remote areas and islands, where many schools lack basic facilities such as proper buildings, laboratories, and libraries. The quality of teaching also needs to be improved due to the uneven distribution of teachers and the lack of qualified teaching staff in rural areas. Efforts to improve this sector continue to be carried out through government programs such as scholarships and the construction of new schools, although infrastructure and teaching staff challenges remain major issues.

===Health===
The health sector in East Nusa Tenggara sees major challenges in terms of access to and quality of health services. Many remote areas are difficult to reach, and health facilities are often inadequate with limited equipment and medicines. The shortage of medical personnel, especially in rural areas, further exacerbates this situation. Major health problems in NTT (East Nusa Tenggara) include malnutrition, high maternal and infant mortality rates, and infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Efforts to improve are being made through the construction of new health facilities, national health programs, and interventions from non-governmental organizations, although geographic and logistical challenges remain major obstacles.

== Tourism ==
East Nusa Tenggara is a province rich in diverse and fascinating tourist attractions, and the provincial government is actively working to promote tourism. Although the basic infrastructure for the sector, such as transport, accommodation, and information services, still needs strengthening, there are several unique and appealing destinations for visitors to explore:

*Komodo Island – Home to the world-famous Komodo dragon.
*Kelimutu Volcano – Located on Flores, featuring three striking crater lakes of varying colors.
*Mount Mutis – East of Kupang, the province&#x27;s highest point, popular for hiking and bird-watching.
*Semana Santa in Larantuka – A religious tradition celebrated annually.
*Sumba Island – Known for traditional housing and the Pasola festival.
*Alor Island – A renowned diving destination with rich marine biodiversity.
*Nemberalla Beach – Situated in Rote Ndao, popular for its pristine waters and surfing.
*Pink Beach – Located on Padar Island, famous for its unique pink sand.
*17 islands National Park – On Riung Island, known for its natural beauty and tranquility.

Many local community groups continue to strive to further develop and promote the tourism industry. However, more support and investment are needed to fully unlock the province&#x27;s tourism potential and ensure that these destinations reach a wider audience. With enhanced infrastructure and sustained promotion, East Nusa Tenggara has the potential to become one of Indonesia&#x27;s premier tourist hotspots.

<text>West Nusa Tenggara ( – NTB) is a province of Indonesia. It comprises the western portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands, with the exception of Bali which is its own province. The area of this province is which consists of two main islands, namely Lombok Island and Sumbawa Island as well as several other small islands. The two largest islands in this province are the smaller but much more populated Lombok in the west and the much larger in area but much less densely populated Sumbawa island in the east. Mataram, on Lombok, is the capital and largest city of the province. It shares maritime borders with Bali to the west and East Nusa Tenggara to the east.

Geographically, West Nusa Tenggara is divided into a flat coastal area, especially in western and southern Lombok, and a mountainous area that includes Mount Rinjani, the highest mountain in the province at 3,726 meters, which is also an active volcano and one of the most popular natural tourist destinations. On Sumbawa Island, the landscape is more varied with steeper hills and mountains and dry grasslands in the east.

The province has a population of around 5 million, with the majority of the population living in coastal areas and large cities such as Mataram, the provincial capital located on Lombok Island. West Nusa Tenggara is known for its Sasak culture in Lombok and Samawa and Mbojo culture in Sumbawa, which still maintain their local customs and arts.

West Nusa Tenggara is also known for its natural environment, including beaches such as Kuta Beach in Lombok and Lakey Beach in Sumbawa, which are popular surfing destinations. The Gili Islands (Gili Trawangan, Gili Air, and Gili Meno) located off the coast of Lombok are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia, known for their clear sea water and coral reefs.

Apart from beach tourism, West Nusa Tenggara also has cultural and historical sites, such as Sade Village in Lombok which maintains traditional Sasak architecture and lifestyle, as well as ancient palaces from the era of the Bima Sultanate in Sumbawa.

== History ==
=== Pre-Islamic period ===
Based on analysis of prehistoric objects found such as complex sarcophagi, decorated stoneware, machetes, and axes, West Nusa Tenggara was originally inhabited by people from Southeast Asia.

The most numerous of the indigenous people in this region are called the Sasak people, most of whom live on the island of Lombok, while on the island of Sumbawa the indigenous people are divided into two groups, ethnic Sumbawa (Samawa) and Bima. However, with the wave of migrants from Bali, Makassar, Java, Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara, the indigenous people now largely remain in the interior.

The region was part of the Majapahit Empire during its height in the 14th century, conquering all the kingdoms located on the islands of both Lombok and Sumbawa. In the book &quot;Negarakertagama&quot; by Mpu Prapanca in 1365, it was written that West Lombok was named &quot;Lombok Mirah&quot; and East Lombok was named &quot;Sasak Adi&quot;, Taliwang, Dompo (Dompu), Sape, Sanghyang Fire, Bhima (Bima), Seram (Seran) and Hutan Kedali (Utan).

=== Islamic period ===
In the early reign of the kings in West Nusa Tenggara, the influence of Hinduism was very strong, but with the collapse of the Majapahit Empire, the influence of Hinduism began to decrease with the onset of the influence of Islam in the coastal communities.

The creation of the Demak Sultanate in Central Java had a huge impact on the spread of Islam in West Nusa Tenggara. The influence of Islam in West Nusa Tenggara was generally brought by the Malays. The influence of Islam in Bima was supported by King I Maliingkaang Daeng-Mannyonriq of Makassar, who was then known as Karaeng Matoaya who played an important role in the spread of Islam in the region.

The influence of Islam in the Bima Sultanate emerged during the reign of King Manuru Salehi around 1605 and began to grow rapidly during the reign of King Abdul Kahir. King Abdul Kahir is also known as the Sultan of Bima because he was the king who first embraced Islam in Bima, beginning a new era, separate from the previous Bima kings who embraced Hinduism. Islam became the official religion of the kings in West Nusa Tenggara.

=== Colonial period ===

The Europeans who first came to Nusa Tenggara were the Portuguese who landed on the islands of Solor and Timor in 1605. At the same time, the Dutch also came to the islands of Hitu and Ambon, in the Malukus. The first Dutch ship that entered the area was the &quot;Ter Ver&quot; which docked in Kupang in 1611. The arrival of the Dutch led to a long dispute between the Portuguese and the Dutch in Nusa Tenggara. The Dutch assisted the local kings who resisted the Portuguese. The Netherlands then expanded its influence in Nusa Tenggara, to make a variety of agreements with small kings around the island of Sumbawa.

The arrival of the Dutch colonial administration greatly impacted Indonesian society, with the decline of the Sultanate of Gowa in the 17th century. Gowa nobility who did not submit to the colonial government fled from Makassar and built pockets of resistance in West Nusa Tenggara. To combat the resistance, the colonial government began to concentrate power in West Nusa Tenggara. This was reinforced by the emergence of Lombok for international trade, so the desire of the Dutch to rule West Nusa Tenggara became stronger.

The Dutch colonial government sent Stephen van Hegen for a close look at the Bima Sultanate in 1660. The arrival of the Dutch-influenced the political and economic situation in the area. In 1669, the Government of the Bima Sultanate led by Sultan Ambela Abdul Khair Sirajuddin, made peace and friendship ties with the colonial government with the agreement that:
* The Sultanate of Bima and Dompu will not attack Makassar
* To keep the peace, only members of the Dutch East India Company may visit the Bima area
* Bima and Makassar will not make any contact at all.
* Foreign traders from Europe, India, Java, Malaya, Arab lands, Aceh, and Champa must not engage in trade with Bima, except by special permit from the Dutch East India Company.

The agreement with the Sultan of Bima and Dompu recognized the existence of the Dutch colonial power. The Netherlands sought to consolidate its control by blocking the Bima port to prevent the arrival of aid from Makassar or other foreign countries. The effort was made so that the existing ports in Bima and Lombok would not fall into British hands.

Because of Dutch supremacy in the region, the king and the people in the region could not move freely. This situation became worse with the eruption of Mount Tambora on April 5, 1815, which shook the entire region, and the consequences could be felt throughout the Moluccas, Java, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. Mount Tambora&#x27;s eruption resulted in the disappearance of the two kingdoms of Tambora and Papekat. More than 10,000 people were killed.

=== Independence ===
West Nusa Tenggara province previously had been part of the State of East Indonesia with the creation of the United States of Indonesia and had been part of the province of the Lesser Sunda Islands (&quot;Nusa Tenggara&quot;) after the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.

The province of West Nusa Tenggara was created with the enactment of Law No. 64 of 1958 dated 14 August 1958, on the Establishment of the new provinces of Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, and East Nusa Tenggara, with its first governor being AR. Moh. Ruslan Djakraningrat.

== Geography ==

West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) is a province in Indonesia located in the southern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands, consisting of two main islands, namely Lombok Island and Sumbawa Island, as well as several small islands around them such as the Gili Islands. Geographically, the province is surrounded by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Flores Sea to the north. To the west, West Nusa Tenggara borders the Province of Bali, while to the east it borders the Province of East Nusa Tenggara.

The West Nusa Tenggara region has a varied topography, with relatively flat coastal areas in some parts of the island, especially in western and southern Lombok. On the other hand, there are mountainous areas that are characteristic of this region, especially Mount Rinjani on Lombok Island which reaches a height of 3,726 meters above sea level, making it the second highest mountain in Indonesia. Mount Rinjani is an active volcano and the center of the Mount Rinjani National Park, which includes mountainous forests, savannas, and a stunning crater lake called Segara Anak.

Sumbawa Island, on the other hand, has a more varied landscape with steeper mountains, hills and valleys in the west, and dry grasslands in the east. The island also has several active volcanoes such as Mount Tambora which is known for its eruption in 1815, one of the largest eruptions in history with global impact.

Natural resources in West Nusa Tenggara include fertile agricultural land, especially in the lowlands and mountain slopes, as well as marine fisheries in coastal areas. In addition, the province is also known for its mineral wealth, such as the gold mine on Sumbawa Island which is one of the largest mines in Indonesia.

=== Climate ===
In terms of climate, West Nusa Tenggara has a tropical climate with two main seasons, namely the rainy season which lasts from November to March and the dry season from April to October. Due to its geographical conditions, several areas in West Nusa Tenggara, especially the eastern part of Sumbawa, experience a long dry season with low rainfall, so this area tends to be dry and barren.

Based on the latest data from the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), the maximum temperature in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) currently ranges from 31.5 to 34.0 °C, while the minimum temperature ranges from 21.0 to 25.5 °C. The highest temperature usually occurs in October, while the lowest temperature tends to occur in July to August. As a tropical climate region, NTB has a fairly high relative humidity, averaging between 55 and 90%, depending on the season and location. Humidity tends to be higher during the rainy season, which lasts from November to March, while the dry season is usually drier with lower humidity.

Rainfall in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) is lower than in western Indonesia such as Sumatra and Kalimantan. Western Indonesia tends to be wetter, with annual rainfall ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 mm due to the influence of the southwest monsoon. Meanwhile, West Nusa Tenggara, which is influenced by the southeast monsoon from Australia, has lower rainfall, ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 mm per year. Lombok Island is generally wetter than Sumbawa Island, which often experiences drought during the dry season.

== Economy ==
West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) is a province in Indonesia that boasts a diverse and developing economy. Its primary economic activities revolve around agriculture, tourism, fisheries, and mining, with a growing focus on infrastructure development and investment in renewable energy and small businesses.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is the backbone of NTB’s economy, providing livelihoods for the majority of the population. The fertile soils and favorable climate conditions across Lombok and Sumbawa islands allow for both wet and dry farming practices. Key agricultural products include rice, corn, soybeans, peanuts, and tobacco. Rice, being the staple food in Indonesia, occupies a significant portion of the province&#x27;s farmland, with farmers utilizing traditional methods alongside modern techniques to increase yields.

Corn and soybeans are equally important as they contribute to both local consumption and trade. Additionally, the province produces a variety of cash crops like coconut and cashews, which are exported to other regions and countries. The island of Lombok, in particular, has earned a reputation for its quality tobacco, which is used in cigarette production.

Cattle farming is another important economic activity in NTB, especially in Lombok, where beef cattle are raised both for domestic consumption and export. The province is one of the country’s top beef producers, with significant government support for livestock health and breeding programs.

===Tourism===
Tourism has emerged as a major pillar of NTB’s economy, particularly on Lombok and the nearby Gili Islands (Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno, and Gili Air). These islands have become internationally renowned for their stunning beaches, clear waters, and vibrant coral reefs, which attract both international and domestic tourists. Popular activities include snorkeling, diving, and surfing, particularly around the Gili Islands and along the southern coast of Lombok.
Mount Rinjani, the second-highest volcano in Indonesia, is one of the province&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions. The mountain has several trekking routes with views of its crater lake, Segara Anak. Additionally, cultural tourism is common in Lombok, with visitors drawn to the traditional Sasak villages, where they can experience local customs, weaving techniques, and traditional architecture.

To expand beyond Lombok’s established tourism hubs, the provincial government has been promoting other areas such as Sumbawa Island, which is known for its surfing spots, unspoiled beaches, and traditional buffalo races. &#x27;The &#x27;Mandalika Special Economic Zone&#x27; (SEZ), located in southern Lombok, has been earmarked as a key development area. Mandalika is intended to attract significant investment in luxury resorts, hotels, and tourism infrastructure. One of the centerpiece developments is the Mandalika International Street Circuit, which hosts MotoGP races, further enhancing NTB’s appeal as a global tourism destination.

===Fisheries and marine resources===
Given its coastline and marine biodiversity, fisheries and marine resources play an essential role in NTB&#x27;s economy. Fishing provides jobs for many coastal communities, especially on Lombok and Sumbawa islands. West Nusa Tenggara is a significant producer of high-value fish species such as tuna, shrimp, and snapper, which are exported to both domestic and international markets. In addition to traditional fishing methods, West Nusa Tenggara has increasingly embraced aquaculture, particularly shrimp farming and seaweed cultivation.

The cultivation of seaweed, particularly in the shallow waters around Lombok and Sumbawa, has proven to be highly profitable, with most of the production being exported for use in food products, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Government programs have been initiated to support small-scale fishermen and seaweed farmers by providing better access to technology, credit, and market opportunities.

Efforts to manage fisheries sustainably have also gained traction, with initiatives aimed at regulating fishing practices to prevent overfishing and protect marine ecosystems. These initiatives ensure the long-term viability of NTB&#x27;s fisheries sector, which is vital for both the local economy and food security.

===Mining===
Mining is one of the most prominent industries in West Nusa Tenggara, particularly in the western part of Sumbawa Island. The province is home to the Batu Hijau mine, one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines. Operated by PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara (formerly by Newmont Mining Corporation), Batu Hijau has been a significant contributor to the regional and national economy. The mine generates substantial export revenue through the extraction of copper and gold, which are critical to global industries ranging from electronics to energy production.

However, the mining industry in West Nusa Tenggara has also sparked concerns about its environmental and social impact. Issues such as deforestation, water pollution, and the displacement of local communities have been raised by environmental groups and local residents. In response, the government and the mining company have been working on improving sustainability practices, including reducing environmental degradation and increasing community engagement to ensure that mining activities benefit local populations.

===Infrastructure and Economic Development===
West Nusa Tenggara has been making strides in infrastructure development, particularly to support its tourism and trade sectors. Significant investments have been made in transportation infrastructure, including the development of highways, ports, and airports. The Lombok International Airport in Lombok is one of the key gateways to the region, facilitating both international and domestic flights and serving as a crucial link to Bali and other Indonesian provinces.

Road infrastructure has been steadily improved, with better connectivity between tourist areas, agricultural regions, and urban centers. Ports on Lombok and Sumbawa have been modernized to support the export of goods such as agricultural products, fishery products, and minerals.

In addition to transportation, West Nusa Tenggara has focused on improving its energy infrastructure. The province is exploring opportunities in renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, to meet its growing energy needs sustainably. Investments in rural electrification programs aim to increase access to electricity in remote areas, enhancing the quality of life for residents and supporting economic activities in those regions.

Efforts to diversify the economy include encouraging investment in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in sectors such as agro-processing, handicrafts, and food production. NTB’s local government has also placed emphasis on improving human resources by investing in education, vocational training, and skill development programs. These initiatives are designed to equip the local workforce with the skills necessary to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving economy.

== Government and administrative divisions ==

The province is administratively divided into eight regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two municipalities (&quot;kotamadya&quot;). When created, the province consisted of just six regencies (West Lombok, Central Lombok, East Lombok, Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima); the city of Mataram was separated from West Lombok Regency on 26 July 1993, and the city of Bima was separated from Bima Regency on 10 April 2002. Two additional regencies were created - West Sumbawa from part of Sumbawa Regency on 18 December 2003, and North Lombok from part of West Lombok Regency on 24 June 2008. The regencies and cities are listed below with their administrative capitals, their areas, and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as of mid-2023.

Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People&#x27;s Representative Council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; or DPR) to create a separate Sumbawa Island province; there is no information as to whether the remaining part of the present province (i.e. the districts comprising Lombok Island) would then be renamed. However, since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The &#x27;West Nusa Tenggara I Electoral District&#x27; consists of the 4 regencies on Sumbawa Island, together with the city of Bima, and elects 3 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The &#x27;West Nusa Tenggara II Electoral District&#x27; consists of the 4 regencies on Lombok Island, together with the city of Mataram, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

== Demographics ==
West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) Province is located in the southern part of Indonesia, consisting of two large islands, Lombok and Sumbawa, with diverse tribes and cultures. According to the latest census, the population of NTB has reached around 5 million people.

===Ethnic groups===
The province has significant ethnic diversity, with the main tribes being:

*Sasak
The Sasak Tribe is the largest ethnic group inhabiting Lombok Island. This tribe has a rich culture with traditions that are still preserved, including in the fields of agriculture, dance, and traditional music such as &quot;Gendang Beleq&quot;. The majority of the Sasak tribe is Muslim, with some of them practicing Islam Wetu Telu, a form of Islam influenced by local beliefs.

*Samawa (Sumbawa)
The Samawa Tribe or Sumbawa Tribe is the indigenous people of the western part of Sumbawa Island. This tribe is known for its strong agrarian and fishing culture. The Samawa Tribe has customs and traditions such as the Samawa Traditional Festival which features their traditional music and dance. Most of them are also Muslim.

*Mbojo (Bima)
The Mbojo tribe inhabits the eastern region of Sumbawa Island, especially in the Bima and Dompu areas. They are known for their very strong customs and their own language, namely the Bima or Mbojo language. In everyday life, the Bima people are heavily involved in agricultural and fishing activities. Islam is also the main belief for this tribe.

*Balinese
In several areas in West Nusa Tenggara, especially on Lombok Island, there is a fairly large Balinese community. They are generally descendants of Balinese immigrants who settled in Lombok centuries ago. The Balinese tribe in Lombok maintains Balinese Hindu customs and traditions, which can be seen through the temples and traditional ceremonies they perform.

In addition to these main tribes, West Nusa Tenggara is also inhabited by immigrant tribes such as the Bugis, Javanese and Chinese who contribute to the cultural diversity in this province.

In general, West Nusa Tenggara is a region rich in cultural and ethnic diversity, with traditional values that are still upheld by its people amidst the development of the times.

=== Religion ===
West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), which includes the islands of Lombok and Sumbawa, is predominantly Muslim, with 96.88% of the population adhering to Islam. Islam is deeply rooted in the culture of the indigenous Sasak, Samawa, and Mbojo peoples, shaping daily life, customs, and education since its introduction in the 16th century.

Hinduism, practiced by 2.38% of the population, is centered in the Balinese community, particularly on Lombok, where Hindu temples and traditional festivals like Galungan and Nyepi are still observed. Buddhism (0.31%), largely practiced by the Chinese community, is present mainly in urban areas such as Mataram. Protestantism (0.25%) and Roman Catholicism (0.18%) are practiced by small groups, mostly migrants from other Indonesian regions like Flores and Timor.

Despite Islam’s predominance, West Nusa Tenggara is known for its peaceful interfaith coexistence, with mutual respect among different religious groups. Religious festivals across communities foster a sense of unity and enrich the province’s cultural landscape, reflects the history of West Nusa Tenggara as a crossroads of diverse traditions and beliefs.

==Culture==
The province of West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), which consists of two large islands, Lombok and Sumbawa, has a diverse and unique cultural wealth. The culture in West Nusa Tenggara is a blend of the heritage of indigenous tribes such as Sasak, Samawa, and Mbojo (Bima), influenced by religion, customs, and relations with immigrants and other nations for centuries. Overall, the culture in West Nusa Tenggara reflects the harmony between traditional beliefs, arts, customs, and the daily lives of its people.

* Sasak Culture in Lombok
The Sasak people are the indigenous people of Lombok Island, and they have a culture that is very strongly influenced by Islam. Sasak culture is known for its traditional wedding ceremony called Merariq, where the wedding is preceded by the tradition of &quot;running away&quot; the bride as a symbol of the family&#x27;s agreement and readiness to unite.

In the field of art, the Sasak people are associated with their Gendang Beleq music, a traditional music that uses large drums and is usually played in ceremonies or celebrations. Woven songket cloth and handmade gold and silver jewelry are also part of their valuable cultural heritage.

* Samawa Culture in Sumbawa
The Samawa people, who live in the western part of Sumbawa Island, have traditions that are closely related to agriculture and the sea. One of the most important traditions is &quot;Barapan Kebo&quot;, or buffalo racing, which is held after the harvest season as a form of gratitude.

In daily life, the Samawa people still maintain the customary social structure, where customary laws and traditions such as mutual cooperation are still carried out. They are also known for their traditional weaving skills which produce Sumbawa woven cloth which has distinctive patterns and colors.

* Mbojo Culture in Bima
The Mbojo people inhabit the eastern part of Sumbawa Island, especially in the Bima and Dompu regions. Their culture is heavily influenced by Islam, but also retains strong traces of the historical Mbojo kingdom. One important tradition is &quot;Mpa&#x27;a Sampari&quot;, a traditional ceremony held to welcome distinguished guests with dance, music, and traditional Bima clothing.

The Bima community is also known for its &quot;Tembe Nggoli&quot; craft, This fabric usually has geometric motifs and distinctive colors, and is used in various traditional events and important ceremonies. In terms of art, the Mbojo tribe has the Sere dance, a traditional war dance that depicts courage and toughness.

===Traditional Arts and Crafts===
In addition to the richness of dance and music arts, West Nusa Tenggara is also famous for its various handicrafts, such as &quot;Batik Sasambo&quot;, which is a typical West Nusa Tenggara batik that reflects the culture of the Sasak, Samawa, and Mbojo tribes. This batik has motifs inspired by nature and the daily lives of the West Nusa Tenggara community, and is one of the region&#x27;s leading products.

In addition, ikat and songket weaving are also the pride of the West Nusa Tenggara community. These crafts are produced through a process that requires high patience and precision. Lombok and Sumbawa weaving have unique and varied motifs, reflecting the identity of each tribe.

===Traditional Cuisine===
NTB&#x27;s traditional food is also an integral part of its culture. Ayam Taliwang, a typical Lombok food, is famous for its spicy and rich spice taste. Plecing Kangkung and Sate Rembiga are also popular foods in NTB that reflect the richness of local spices and ingredients.

===Traditional and Religious Ceremonies===
Traditional and religious ceremonies are still highly maintained in West Nusa Tenggara. Islamic celebrations such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are celebrated enthusiastically throughout the region, but traditional ceremonies such as &quot;Peresean&quot; (traditional rattan fighting) are also often held in a series of certain traditional events.

<text>Louis Patrick Gray III (July 18, 1916 – July 6, 2005) was acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) from May 3, 1972, to April 27, 1973. During this time, the FBI was in charge of the initial investigation into the burglaries that sparked the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to the resignation of President Nixon. Gray was nominated as permanent director by Nixon on February 15, 1973, but failed to win Senate confirmation. He resigned as acting director on April 27, 1973, after admitting to destroying documents that had come from convicted Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt&#x27;s safe—documents received on June 28, 1972, 11 days after the Watergate burglary, and given to Gray by White House counsel John Dean.

Gray remained publicly silent about the Watergate scandal for 32 years, speaking to the press only once, near the end of his life; this was shortly after Gray&#x27;s direct subordinate at the FBI, FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt, revealed himself to have been the secret source to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; known as &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Gray was born on July 18, 1916, in St. Louis, Missouri, the eldest son of Louis Patrick Gray Jr., a Texas railroad worker. He worked three jobs while attending schools in St. Louis and Houston, Texas, graduating from St. Thomas High School in 1932, at the age of 16 (having skipped two grades). Gray initially attended Rice University; however, his true goal was to be admitted to the United States Naval Academy. He was finally admitted to the Naval Academy in 1936 and he immediately dropped out of Rice University in his senior year so he could attend.

At the time, however, Gray could not afford the bus or train fare to Annapolis, so he hired on as an apprentice seaman on a tramp steamer out of Galveston. During the journey to Philadelphia (the closest the steamer could get him to Maryland), Gray taught calculus to the ship&#x27;s captain, a Bulgarian named Frank Solis, in return for basic lessons in navigation. Once in Philadelphia, Gray hitchhiked to Annapolis.

Once at the academy, Gray walked onto the football team as the starting quarterback, played varsity lacrosse and boxed as a light heavyweight. In 1940, Gray received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Naval Academy.

==Naval career==
The United States Navy commissioned Gray as a line officer, and he served through five submarine war patrols in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. He suffered a ruptured appendix at the start of his sixth patrol and was unable to get to a hospital for 17 days, an ordeal that should have killed him. In 1945, Gray visited Beatrice Castle Kirk (1923–2019), the widow of his Naval Academy classmate, Lieutenant Commander Edward Emmet DeGarmo (1917–1945). They were married in 1946. He adopted her two sons, Alan and Ed; and they had two of their own, Patrick and Stephen.

In 1949, Gray received a Juris Doctor degree from George Washington University Law School, where he edited the law review and became a member of the Order of the Coif. He was admitted to practice before the Washington, D.C., Bar in 1949; later, he was admitted to practice law by the Connecticut State Bar, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the United States courts of appeals, the United States Court of Claims, and the Supreme Court of the United States.

By 1960, Gray&#x27;s achievements in the Navy included commanding the U.S.S. &quot;Tiru&quot; (SS-416) and two other submarines on war patrols during the Korean War; earning the rank of captain two years before he was legally allowed to be paid for it; and serving as congressional liaison officer for the United States Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Chief of Naval Operations. He indicated his desire to retire from the Navy, but Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke told him, &quot;If you stay, you&#x27;ll have my job some day.&quot; He did not stay, but joined a Connecticut law firm in 1961.

==Department of Justice==
In 1969, Gray returned to the federal government and worked under the Nixon administration in several different positions. In 1970, President Nixon appointed him as Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division in the Department of Justice. In 1972, Gray was nominated to be Deputy Attorney General, but before he could be confirmed by the full United States Senate his nomination was withdrawn.

==Acting Director of FBI==
Instead, President Nixon designated him as Acting Director of the FBI after the death of J. Edgar Hoover. Gray served for less than a year. Day-to-day operational command of the Bureau remained with Associate Director Mark Felt.

==Watergate involvement==
===Watergate and the FBI&#x27;s investigation===
On June 17, 1972, just six weeks after Gray took office at the FBI, five men were arrested after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel complex in Washington, D.C.

Gray first learned of the Watergate break-ins on June 17 from Wes Grapp, the Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles field office. Gray immediately called Mark Felt, his second in command. At the time, Felt only had limited information, remaining unclear as to whether it was a burglary or bombing attempt.

Felt had more information the next day, when he informed Gray that the burglars had connections to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CRP), that one burglar (McCord) was head of security for the committee, and that at least one listening device had been found. Gray recalled the conversation concluding with the exchange:

&quot;Are you absolutely certain that we have jurisdiction?&quot; I asked.

&quot;I&#x27;m sure of it,&quot; he [Felt] answered.

&quot;Just check it and be absolutely certain,&quot; I ordered. &quot;And then investigate it to the hilt with no holds barred.&quot;

On the same day, June 18, 1972, Gray also met later-identified Watergate conspirator Fred LaRue in California. The two discussed Watergate, according to LaRue, and made arrangements to meet again back in Washington, D.C. In his own memoir, Gray relates the LaRue meeting as a chance encounter at a hotel swimming pool and quotes their entire Watergate-related conversation:

&quot;The Watergate thing is a hell of a thing,&quot; he said.

&quot;You bet it is, Fred,&quot; I answered. &quot;We&#x27;re going to investigate the hell out of it.&quot;

That was all either of us said about it.

For the first six months of the investigation, Gray remained heavily involved. It was only when it became apparent that the White House was involved that Gray recused himself from the investigation and handed control over to Felt.

===Cover-up===
On June 23, 1972, White House Chief of Staff Bob Haldeman and President Nixon held one of the infamous &quot;smoking gun&quot; conversations in which they conspired to use the CIA to block the FBI investigation into the money trail leading from the Watergate burglars to the Committee to Re-elect the President, which would constitute hard evidence that Committee members were involved in the planning of the burglaries.

According to Gray, this plan was first put into action when he had a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy director of the CIA, in which he quotes Walters as saying, &quot;If the investigation gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto some of our covert projects. Since you&#x27;ve got these five men under arrest, it will be best to taper the matter off here.&quot; This conversation implicitly stated that the FBI should not interview Manuel Ogarrio and Kenneth Dahlberg, individuals connected with the money used to fund the Watergate burglars.

This would later be backed up by the Director of the CIA, Richard Helms, when he specifically told Gray that Karl Wagner and John Caswell should also not be interviewed, as they were, he stated, active CIA agents at the time.

The basis for such a request came from a long-standing understanding between the CIA and the FBI that they would not reveal each other&#x27;s informants. This effort by the White House and the CIA succeeded in delaying the interviews of both Ogarrio and Dahlberg for a little more than one week, at which point Gray and his senior FBI staff, including Mark Felt, Charlie Bates, and Bob Kunkel, decided that, due to the increasing importance of these individuals in the investigation, they needed a written request from the CIA not to interview them, which would have to state in greater detail the reasons for not interviewing these individuals. Once the decision was made, Gray called Vernon Walters and demanded that written request the next morning, or he would order the interviews to go forth.

The next morning, Walters arrived and delivered a three-page memorandum, marked &quot;SECRET&quot;, that did &quot;not&quot; ask the FBI to hold off on the interviews. The meeting concluded with Walters suggesting to Gray that he should warn the President that some members of the White House staff were hindering the FBI&#x27;s investigation. After the conversation, Gray ordered the interviews to proceed immediately.

Ultimately, the CIA cover-up delayed the FBI investigation no more than two weeks.

While not active in any Watergate activities per se, Gray was aware through his dealings with John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored what he could do to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau&#x27;s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir &quot;Blind Ambition&quot;, he used Gray as a shill knowing that &quot;we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.&quot; In fact, even though Gray thought of this as a political and not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the &quot;nation&#x27;s chief law enforcement officer,&quot; Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, &quot;I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as we walked to a park and sat down on a bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation.&quot;

===Felt and the search for the source===
The Nixon White House tapes reveal that Bob Haldeman told Nixon that Felt was the source of leaks of confidential information contained in the FBI&#x27;s investigation to various members of the press, including Bob Woodward of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Gray claimed that he resisted five separate demands from the White House to fire Felt, stating that he believed Felt&#x27;s assurances that he was not the source. Eventually, Gray demanded to know who was claiming Felt to be leaking. Attorney General Richard Kleindienst told Gray that Roswell Gilpatric, former deputy secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and now outside general counsel to &quot;Time&quot;, had told John Mitchell that Felt was leaking to Sandy Smith of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

After Felt admitted in the May 2005 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article that he lied to Gray about leaking to the press, Gray claimed that Felt&#x27;s bitterness at being passed over for the FBI directorship was the cause of his decision to leak to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and others.

===Confirmation hearings===
In 1973, Gray was nominated as Hoover&#x27;s permanent successor as head of the FBI. This action by Nixon confounded many, coming at a time when revelations of involvement by Nixon administration officials in the Watergate scandal were coming to the forefront. Under Gray&#x27;s direction, the FBI had been accused of mishandling the investigation into the break-in, doing a cursory job and refusing to investigate the possible involvement of administration officials. Gray&#x27;s Senate confirmation hearing was to become the Senate&#x27;s first opportunity to ask pertinent questions about the Watergate investigation.

During the confirmation hearing, Gray defended the bureau&#x27;s investigation. During questioning, he volunteered that he had provided copies of some of the files on the investigation to White House Counsel John Dean, who had told Gray he was conducting an investigation for the President. Gray testified that before turning over the files to Dean, he had been advised by the FBI&#x27;s own legal counsel that he was required by law to comply with Dean&#x27;s order. He confirmed that the FBI investigation supported claims made by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other sources about &quot;dirty tricks&quot; committed and funded by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, and in particular, activities of questionable legality committed by Donald Segretti. The White House had for months steadfastly denied any involvement in such activities.

During the hearings, Gray testified that Dean had &quot;probably lied&quot; to the FBI, increasing the suspicions of many of a cover-up. The Nixon administration was so angered by this statement that John Ehrlichman told Dean that Gray should be left to &quot;twist slowly, slowly in the wind.&quot;

===Destruction of documents and resignation from the FBI===
On June 21, 1972, Gray met with John Dean and John Ehrlichman in Ehrlichman&#x27;s office. During this meeting, Gray was handed several envelopes full of documents from the personal safe of E. Howard Hunt. Dean instructed Gray, in the presence of Ehrlichman, that the documents were &quot;national security documents. These should never see the light of day.&quot; Dean further repeatedly told Gray that the documents were not Watergate-related.

Six months later, Gray said he finally looked at the papers as he burned them in a Connecticut fireplace. &quot;The first set of papers in there were false top-secret cables indicating that the Kennedy administration had much to do with the assassination of the Vietnamese president (Diem),&quot; Gray said. &quot;The second set of papers in there were letters purportedly written by Senator Kennedy involving some of his peccadilloes, if you will.&quot;

After learning from Ehrlichman that Dean was cooperating with the US Attorney and would be revealing what happened on June 21, Gray told his staunchest congressional supporter, Senator Lowell Weicker, so that he might be prepared for that revelation. As a result, Weicker leaked this revelation to some chosen reporters.

Following this revelation, Gray was forced to resign from the FBI on April 27, 1973.

==Legal struggles==
For the next eight years, Gray defended his actions as Acting Director of the FBI, testifying before five federal grand juries and four committees of Congress.

On October 7, 1975, the Watergate Special Prosecutor informed Gray that the last Watergate-related investigation of him had been formally closed. Gray was never indicted in relation to Watergate, but the scandal dogged him afterwards.

In 1978, Gray was indicted, along with Assistant Director Edward Miller, for allegedly having approved illegal break-ins during the Nixon administration. Gray vehemently denied the charges, which were dropped in 1980. Felt and Miller, who had approved the illegal break-ins during the tenures of four separate FBI directors, including Hoover, Gray, William Ruckelshaus, and Clarence M. Kelley, were convicted and later pardoned by President Ronald Reagan. Exonerated by the Department of Justice after a two-year investigation, Gray returned to his law practice in Connecticut.

==Later life==
After his time in Washington, Gray returned to practicing law at the firm of Suisman, Shapiro, Wool, Brennan, Gray &amp; Greenberg in New London, Connecticut.

In a 2005 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, Mark Felt claimed to be Deep Throat, the infamous source of leaks to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Woodward, Bernstein, and &quot;Post&quot; executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee confirmed the claim. Gray spoke about the Watergate scandal for the first time in 32 years on June 26, 2005, ten days before his death from pancreatic cancer. He told ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; that he was in &quot;total shock, total disbelief&quot; when asked about Felt&#x27;s claim. &quot;It was like I was hit with a tremendous sledgehammer.&quot;

Gray died on July 6, 2005. He was working on his memoirs with his stepson Edward Gray, using his extensive and never-released personal Watergate files. His stepson finished the book &quot;In Nixon&#x27;s Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate&quot;, which disputes the claim that Felt was Deep Throat, citing Woodward&#x27;s own notes and other evidence as proof that Deep Throat was a fictional composite made up of several Woodward sources, only one of whom was Felt.

===Gray and the &quot;New York Times&quot;===
In 2009, Bob Phelps, a former editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Robert M. Smith, a former reporter for the &quot;Times&quot;, claimed that they had received information from Gray that would have allowed the &quot;Times&quot; to break the Watergate story before &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, but they failed to act upon it.

In August 1972, Gray and Smith had lunch. According to Smith, during this lunch Gray mentioned details of Donald Segretti and John Mitchell&#x27;s involvement in the Watergate burglaries.

After the lunch, Smith reportedly rushed to his editor, Phelps, with the story, but it amounted to nothing. Smith left his job the next day for Yale Law School, and Phelps lost track of the story while covering the 1972 Republican Convention.

However, while only Gray and Smith knew exactly what was said at that lunch, Gray&#x27;s son, Edward, denies that his father could have implicated either the Attorney General or the President.

Gray goes on to point out that at the time of this lunch the Attorney General was Richard Kleindienst, who was never implicated in any of the Watergate scandals. Even if Smith meant that he was talking about John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, Gray further points out that no one (outside of the conspirators) knew of Mitchell&#x27;s involvement until the following April, when John Dean admitted as much to special prosecutors.

==Documents==
Gray was a meticulous record-keeper, which is most easily evidenced by the 40 boxes of personal records he took with him from his year with the FBI. The archive would grow even after Gray left the FBI as a direct result of the legal proceedings in which he was forced to take part in the years to follow.

This archive has become what is undoubtedly the &quot;most complete set of Watergate investigative records outside the government.&quot;

<doc id="453741" wikidata="Q9010699" url="?curid=453741" title="James Grant (British Army officer, born 1720)">
<text>James Grant, 4th of Ballindalloch (1720–1806) was a British Army officer who served as a major general during the American War of Independence. He served as Governor of East Florida from 1763 to 1771, and between 1773 and 1802 he had seats in the House of Commons.

==Early career==
Grant was born on the family estate of Ballindalloch in Banffshire in the Northeast of Scotland. He began his military career by purchasing a commission as captain in the Royal Scots on 24 October 1744. The regiment was shipped to the Continent and Grant fought with them in the Battle of Fontenoy during the War of the Austrian Succession.

==French and Indian War==

By 1757, Grant was a major of the 77th Regiment of Foot (Montgomerie&#x27;s Highlanders), fighting in the French and Indian War in the British Thirteen Colonies. In 1758, he led part of the regiment in an expedition led by General John Forbes. On this expedition, he became acquainted with others who would also play larger parts in the American Revolutionary War: George Washington, Francis Marion, and Hugh Mercer, among others. He also gained a contempt for the colonial or militia troops that would colour his later views.

In September, Grant was assigned to lead an advance party of around 800 men to determine the French strength at Fort Duquesne (the future site of Pittsburgh). The force was made up mainly of militia, but he took along a number of officers from the regulars since he had little respect for the colonial troops. He decided to split his force, hoping to encourage a French attack that he could surprise and overwhelm. Having no wilderness experience, he was ambushed himself by Indians and French on 14 September 1758. At this engagement, the Battle of Fort Duquesne, the British force was repelled with 342 men killed, wounded or captured. The prisoners consisted of Major Grant and 18 of his men. He was paroled soon after and tried to blame his defeat on the failure of the colonial militia to follow orders.

In 1761, Grant commanded an expedition against the Cherokee during the Anglo-Cherokee War.

After being briefly stationed at Fort Ticonderoga, his regiment was moved to the Caribbean Theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War. They fought at the Siege of Havana, held by Spanish forces in Cuba, which ended in the surrender of the city to the British. When the war was over, the regiment was disbanded in America in 1763.

==Governor of Florida==
With the Treaty of Paris, Britain gained control of Florida from the Spanish. They divided it into two colonies, and James Grant was named governor of East Florida in 1764. He moved to the capital of East Florida at St. Augustine and resided in the Governor&#x27;s House. He ended Indian raids with the Treaty of Fort Picolata, an attempt to maintain peaceful relations between American Indian groups and Florida colonists and to entice future immigrants to his colony. During the Anglo-Cherokee War of 1759–1761, Grant had become familiar with systems of gift exchange and reciprocity used by Southeast Indian groups, which he sought to implement in Florida. Grant also established the Florida-Georgia border.

Grant&#x27;s ventures were ultimately profitable, but numerous efforts failed to produce results. He encouraged new agriculture, setting up trade in the commodities of cotton, indigo, timber, and cochineal. He personally gained and developed several plantations as grants.

Then, in 1771, illness forced him to return to Scotland. Grant was succeeded as Governor by General Patrick Tonyn, brother-in-law of English merchant and planter Francis Levett.

Grant left his overseer Alexander Skinner in charge of his enslaved Africans and his plantation Grant&#x27;s Villa, seven miles north of St. Augustine. Skinner kept Grant informed of activities on the plantation through many letters from April 1771 until his death in March 1779. After Skinner&#x27;s death, Grant appointed Dr. David Yeats, the Secretary of the East Florida Colony, as his agent to manage his plantations in his absence. As with Skinner&#x27;s letters, Yeats&#x27; letters to Grant concerning the properties have long interested Florida colonial historians. Yeats named his son Grant David Yeats after Grant. Grant D. Yeats (1773–1836) became a noted English physician, author and mayor of Bedford.

Back home in Scotland, Grant was elected to Parliament in 1773 as an MP for Tain Burghs. In the period leading up to the American Revolutionary War, he became one of the most outspoken of the anti-American members in Parliament. In a speech early in 1775, he remarked that the colonists &quot;...could not fight...&quot;, and declared that he could &quot;go from one end of America to other and geld all the males.&quot;

==American War of Independence==
By the summer of 1775, Grant returned to active service with the rank of colonel. He was ordered to return to North America. He arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, on 30 July. In the aftermath of the Battle of Bunker Hill, he urged General Gage to move the British troops to New York City, so that they would have room to manoeuvre. His advice was ignored at the time. Grant was a supernumerary until December when he was made colonel and commander of the 55th Regiment of Foot. He would hold that command until 1791.

His prediction that Boston was an untenable position was proved correct the following spring. On 17 March 1776, he accompanied the general withdrawal of British troops to Halifax, Nova Scotia. By the summer of 1776, General William Howe had replaced Gage as commander, and took Grant&#x27;s advice about securing New York. Grant was given the provisional rank of major-general and played several key parts in Howe&#x27;s movements. Fortunately for the Americans, Howe refused some advice from Grant, who proposed burning Boston, Marblehead, Massachusetts; New York City, and Philadelphia.

===Battle for New York===
As the British tried to gain control of the major port city in the New York Campaign, Grant had become Howe&#x27;s primary planning officer. He developed two plans, each designed to both gain control of territory and to deal a serious or fatal blow to the Continental Army. These resulted in the Battle of Brooklyn, and Battle of White Plains. Both of these were British victories, as was the overall campaign, but General Washington avoided the death blow to his troops each time.

In the Battle of Long Island on 26 and 27 August, Major General Grant led the division that landed on the left wing. He was to engage the American right and divert attention from Howe&#x27;s flanking manoeuvre with the main body. An advance unit of his troops engaged the Americans at the Red Lion Inn, which was the first engagement of the battle. Grant completed his mission, and strongly defeated the American General William Alexander&#x27;s division.

After the event, Grant was unfairly criticised by some for allowing the escape of most of this force. He had almost 7,000 men in ten regiments opposing Alexander&#x27;s 1,600 Continentals, but there were factors at play other than troop strength. First, Grant stopped his advance according to the British plan, awaiting Howe&#x27;s attack on the American rear, rather than attacking the Americans who were dug in on the Brooklyn heights. Second, he was running low on ammunition. Boats and logistic support were busy ferrying and supplying the Hessian units on the right and the main body that was landing at Gravesend, Brooklyn.

Grant quick-marched his battalion to the Battle of White Plains, but he arrived too late. In 1777, Grant devised the battle plans for the Battle of Brandywine Creek.

=== Philadelphia and the West Indies ===
Grant was unsuccessful in trapping Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, at the Battle of Barren Hill, on 20 May 1778. Lafayette held the position along the Schuylkill River with 2,200 troops and five guns. His front was picketed by 150 light infantry and 50 Oneida Indians under Allen McLane and his left was held by James Potter and 600 Pennsylvania militia. The bulk of his command was formed by a veteran brigade under Enoch Poor. Sir William Howe sent Grant with 6,000 men and 15 guns to circle wide to the right and come in behind Lafayette&#x27;s force, while he attacked in front with 4,000 soldiers. Charles Grey with 2,000 British and Hessian grenadiers was ordered to strike the American left flank. The manoeuvre began auspiciously when Potter&#x27;s militia dispersed in the face of Grant&#x27;s column. However, the capture of two of Grey&#x27;s soldiers warned Lafayette of his danger. Meanwhile, Grant halted his troops to wait for Grey to appear and this allowed the Americans to begin moving back to Matson&#x27;s Ford. When Grant finally lurched forward again, Lafayette sent some of Poor&#x27;s troops forward in a feint. Grant was fooled and stopped his advance a second time. By the time he realised what was happening, most of the Americans had slipped out of his grasp via a road that the British were not aware of. Grant nevertheless unleashed his cavalry in pursuit, but they took the wrong route and only arrived in time to see the last of Lafayette&#x27;s men crossing at Matson&#x27;s.

Finally, Grant was shipped off to the West Indies. On 27 October 1778 he led a successful expeditionary force to capture the French West Indian island of St. Lucia. A superior French garrison, surrendered on 28 December, at the Battle of La Vigie.

On 1 April 1779, Lord Germain instructed Grant to establish small garrisons throughout the West Indies. Grant had the moral courage to defy Germain and refused to carry out this order. In his letters of 8 and 17 July, he pointed out to the Secretary of State for America that naval superiority was paramount and that the small detachments on every island would not be wise. Instead, he deployed the West Indies garrisons to cover the major naval bases. He posted the 15th, 28th, and 55th Foot and 1,500 gunners at Saint Kitts. The 27th, 35th, and 49th Foot and 1,600 gunners defended Saint Lucia. Meanwhile, the royal dockyard at Antigua was held by an 800-man garrison of the 40th and 60th Foot. Grant also reinforced the fleet with 925 soldiers. He embarked for England on 1 August 1779, but his dispositions provided the basis for the British successes in the Caribbean during the final years of the war.

==Later career==
In 1780, he was defeated in parliamentary elections. In 1782, he was appointed a lieutenant general. In 1787, he was re-elected to Parliament, this time for Sutherland. He held the seat until 1802.

In 1789, he was appointed governor of Stirling Castle, and commanding general of the army in Scotland. In 1791, he was transferred from the 55th as Colonel to the 11th Foot. In 1796, he was appointed a full General and retired from active military services. In 1802, he retired to his estate on the Avon and Spey rivers as the Laird of Ballindalloch, after relinquishing his seat in Parliament. In 1805, he retired from the British army. He died at 86 on 13 April 1806. His estate went to his grandnephew, George Macpherson.

His papers are at the National Archives of Scotland and have been copied for the Library of Congress.

<text>The New Laws (Spanish: Leyes Nuevas), also known as the New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians, were issued on November 20, 1542, by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (King Charles I of Spain) and regard the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Following denunciations and calls for reform from individuals, such as the Dominican friar Bartolomé de Las Casas, these laws were intended to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the &quot;encomenderos&quot;, by limiting their power and dominion over groups of natives.

Blasco Núñez Vela, the first Viceroy of Peru, enforced the New Laws. He was opposed by a revolt of &quot;encomenderos&quot; and was killed in 1546 by the landowning faction led by Gonzalo Pizarro. Pizarro wanted to maintain a political structure built upon the Incan model the Spanish found in place. Although the New Laws were only partly successful, due to the opposition of colonists, they did result in the liberation of thousands of indigenous workers, who had been held in a state of semi-slavery.

==Origins==
The New Laws were the results of a reform movement in reaction to what were considered to be the less effective, decades-old &quot;Leyes de Burgos&quot; (Laws of Burgos), issued by King Ferdinand II of Aragon on December 27, 1512. These laws were the first intended to regulate relations between the Spanish and the recently conquered indigenous peoples of the New World. These are regarded as the first humanitarian laws in the New World. They were not fully implemented because of opposition by powerful colonists.

While some encomenderos opposed the restrictions imposed by the laws as against their interests, others were opposed because they believed the laws institutionalized the system of forced Indian labor. During the reign of King Charles I, the reformers gained strength. A number of Spanish missionaries argued for stricter rules, including Bartolomé de las Casas and Francisco de Vitoria. Their goal was to protect the Indians against forced labor and expropriation, and to preserve their cultures. Some discussions challenged the very legitimacy of the conquest and colonization.

Eventually, the reformists influenced the King and his court to pass reforms that came to be known as the New Laws.

==Contents==

===Main points===
*Governors had an obligation to take care of the well-being and preserve Native Americans (referred to as &quot;Indians&quot; by the law).
*That there was no motive to enslave them in the future, not by war, nor due to rebellion, nor to ask for a rescue, nor for any reason or in any way.
*That native Americans currently enslaved must be freed immediately, unless the owner could prove (in Spain, which implied travelling back there) the full juridical legitimacy of such a state.
*That the &quot;bad habit&quot; of making Native Americans work as &quot;tamames&quot; against their will or without fair payment must be ended immediately.
*That they must not be taken to remote regions to fish for pearls.
*That only the viceroy had the right to establish &quot;encomiendas&quot; on Native Americans. The prohibition to establish &quot;encomiendas&quot; included all religious orders, hospitals, commonalities and civil servants.
*That the &quot;distribution&quot; (of people and lands) given to the original conquerors (as a feudal lordship of sorts) should stop immediately after their death, and both land and the native people would become subject to the Crown.

===Causes and goals===
Some of these laws were redundant. Some established protections and rights for Native Americans that native Spaniards did not have themselves. Given the distance from the colonies and the time needed to travel between there and Spain, the Crown was unable to fully monitor compliance with the more ambiguous laws.

The main examples are the cases of slavery and &quot;encomiendas&quot;. The new laws included the prohibition of enslavement of the Indians and provided for gradual abolition of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system in America by forbidding it to be inherited by descendants. The New Laws stated that the natives would be considered free persons, and the &quot;encomenderos&quot; could no longer demand their labour. 

The prohibition against enslaving Indians &quot;in any case, not even crime or war&quot;, was a right that did not apply to native Castilians themselves. The enslavement of Native Americans had been declared illegal in Castile in 1501, when Isabella I declared native Americans to be both people and subjects of the Castilian crown, and so subject to the same rights and obligations as any other subject of the queen. Under those regulations, slavery was permitted almost exclusively as a penalty for a serious crime or some exceptional circumstances. Granting extra protection for Native Americans was an attempt by the crown to address its inability to monitor, from Spain, the legitimacy of the claims regarding reasons to enslave a person in the New World, and it acknowledged that false claims could be fabricated to enslave and exploit the native peoples. 

The introduction and corruption of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system is now considered to have been an alternative for outright slavery and a Castilian institution that did not work properly in America. The &quot;encomienda&quot; was a system that interchanged a person&#x27;s work for military protection by a higher authority. It had been part of the Castilian legal system since the Reconquista. Given the limited size of the Crown&#x27;s army, this system allowed nobles or warlords to trade protection for the labor of persons under their purview. It was a way to aid in ensuring the safety of the population of the border areas during the repopulation of the no-man&#x27;s-land between Castile and the southern Muslim areas. It required either the consent of both parties or the direct intervention of the king, who was responsible for setting reasonable conditions for the parties and to intervene (militarily if required) in case of abuses.

In America, however, colonists used encomiendas to create conditions similar to slavery in areas that did not require such protection. Authorities other than the king claimed the right to assign encomiendas and assigned the most unpleasant or dangerous jobs to the natives. 

The New Laws established more specific regulations or stipulated the conditions under the Crown&#x27;s authority: 
*The natives were required only to pay tribute to the &quot;encomenderos&quot;; if they worked, they were to be paid wages in exchange for their labor. 
*The laws prohibited using indigenous people to work in the mines (where many had died) unless it was absolutely necessary, and then under the same working conditions as Spanish mine workers. 
*Indians were to be taxed fairly and treated well. 
*Public officials or clergy with &quot;encomienda&quot; grants were ordered to return them immediately to the Crown. 
*&quot;Encomienda&quot; grants would not be passed on via inheritance, but would be cancelled at the death of the individual &quot;encomendero&quot;.

== Effects ==

The King promulgated the &quot;New Laws&quot; in 1542. In addition to regulating encomienda and treatment of Indians, they reorganized the overseas colonial administration. Several General Captainships were established, such as the Kingdom of Guatemala, to create another level of Crown authority in the colony. 

===Resistance in Peru===
When the New Laws were passed, every European man holding an encomienda in Peru learned that his grant of labor could be confiscated if he was guilty of having taken part in the civil disturbances of Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. As a result, privileged Spanish colonists were disturbed about implementing the New Laws. In Peru, Gonzalo Pizarro led a revolt of protesting encomenderos, who took to arms to &quot;maintain their rights by force&quot; for control of Indian lands and labor.

The Supreme Court of Peru invited Pizarro to take control of the government after his forces reached Lima from Bolivia. Pizarro took over Lima and Quito (now in Ecuador). Viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela, who had attempted to impose the decrees, was overthrown. Pizarro and his army killed Núñez Vela in 1546. Pizarro&#x27;s power stretched from Peru north to Panama. Charles I and the court became alarmed, and were convinced that the immediate abolition of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system would bring economic ruin to the colonies. To deal with the revolt, Charles I sent Pedro de la Gasca to the colony; a bishop and diplomat, he did not command an army but was given full powers to rule and negotiate a settlement with Pizarro and his followers. However, Pizarro declared Peru independent from the King. La Gasca provisionally suspended the New Laws. Pizarro was later captured and executed, accused of being a &quot;traitor to the King.&quot;

== Level of compliance ==
Although in New Spain (now Mexico), the initial reaction of &quot;encomenderos&quot; was noncompliance, they did not organize a rebellion as in Peru. New Spain&#x27;s first viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, prudently refrained from enforcing the parts of the New Laws most objectionable to the &quot;encomenderos&quot;. Over time, the &quot;encomenderos&quot; complied with most aspects of the laws. Most already maintained a horse and arms in case of Indian rebellion, and had established a residence in a Spanish settlement. They hired priests to minister to the Indians whose labor was granted to them. While they were not allowed to retain their &quot;encomiendas&quot; in perpetuity, they were permitted to bequeath the properties and labor once. They allowed Indians to fulfill obligations by payment of tribute, often in produce. The dramatic declines in Indian population due to epidemic disease, however, resulted in economic losses for the &quot;encomenderos.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1545, the Crown revoked the inheritance restriction of the New Laws. By strengthening the power of the &quot;encomenderos,&quot; the &quot;encomienda&quot; system was made secure. While the New Laws were partly successful, they did result in the liberation of thousands of indigenous workers from enforced servitude.

Most of the ordinances of the New Laws were later incorporated into the general corpus of the Laws of the Indies. In some cases they were superseded by newer laws. A weaker version of the New Laws was issued in 1552.

<text>The Riau Islands () is a province of Indonesianot to be confused with neighbouring Riau from which the Riau Islands Province were separated in 2002. The capital of the province is Tanjung Pinang, while the largest city is Batam. It shares a maritime border with Riau and Jambi to the west, Bangka Belitung Islands to the south, Singapore to the northeast, Malaysia and West Kalimantan to the east, and Vietnam and Cambodia to the north. It comprises a total of 2,408 islands (1,798 having names) scattered between Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and Borneo including the Riau Archipelago. Situated on one of the world&#x27;s busiest shipping lanes along the Malacca Strait and the Natuna Sea (South China Sea), the province shares water borders with neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. The Riau Islands also have relatively large potential mineral resources and energy, as well as marine resources.

The Riau archipelago was once part of the Johor Sultanate, which was later partitioned between the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, in which the archipelago fell under Dutch influence. A Dutch protectorate, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, was established in the region between 1824 and 1911 before being directly ruled by the Dutch East Indies. The archipelago became a part of Indonesia following the occupation of the Japanese Empire (1942–1945) and the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). The Riau Islands separated from the province of Riau in September 2002, becoming Indonesia&#x27;s third-youngest province.

A free trade zone of the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle, the Riau Islands has experienced rapid industrialisation since the 1970s. The Riau Islands is one of the country&#x27;s most prosperous provinces, having a GDP per capita of () as of 2011, the fourth highest among all provinces in Indonesia after East Kalimantan, Jakarta and Riau. In addition, as of 2018, the Riau Islands has a Human Development Index of 0.748, also the fourth highest among all provinces in Indonesia after Jakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta and East Kalimantan.

The population of the Riau Islands is heterogeneous and is highly diverse in ethnicity, culture, language and religion. The province is home to different ethnic groups such as the Malays, Tionghoa, Javanese, Minangkabau and others. Economic rise in the region has attracted many immigrants and workers from other parts of Indonesia. The area around Batam is also home to many expatriates from different countries. Approximately 80% of these are from other Asian countries, with most of the westerners coming from the United Kingdom, rest of Europe, as well as Australia and the United States. The province also has the second largest number of foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia, after Bali.

== Etymology ==
There are several possible origins of the word &quot;riau.&quot; The first possible origins is that &quot;riau&quot; is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;rio&quot;, which means river. After the fall of the Malacca Sultanate in the early 16th century, the remaining Malaccan nobles and subjects fled from Malacca to mainland Sumatra while being pursued by the Portuguese. The Portuguese is believed to have reached as far as the Siak River.

The second version claims that &quot;riau&quot; comes from the word &quot;riahi&quot; which means sea water. The word is allegedly derived from the figure of Sinbad al-Bahar in the book of the One Thousand and One Nights.

Another version is that &quot;riau&quot; is derived from the Malay word &quot;riuh,&quot; which means crowded, frenzied working people. This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the Malay people in present-day Bintan. The name is likely to have become famous since Raja Kecil moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719. This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.

== History ==
=== Pre-sultanate era ===
Riau has for centuries been the home of Malay and Orang Laut people (sea nomads). Later migrants came from southern China and Indochina, today people from a large region of Asia has settled on the Islands. The Riau archipelago is located between the China-India maritime trading route, and was early in the 14th century, together with Temasek (Singapore). Chinese maritime records one of Riau archipelago&#x27;s islands was inhabited by Malay pirates.

As many as three hundred ships were used to force Chinese ships returning from the Indian Ocean into pirate harbors and to attack those who resisted. Large quantities of Chinese ceramics have been recovered on Bintan, some date back to the early Song dynasty (960–1127). An Arabian explorer, Ibnu Battuta, wrote about Riau in the 13th century: &quot;&quot;Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them&quot;.&quot; Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, the Riau archipelago, especially Bintan, is still referred to as the &quot;Pirate Island&quot;.

During the 12th to 13th century, the Riau archipelago was a part of the Srivijaya Empire. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of Palembang, visited Riau in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him, and he combined flotilla of 800 vessels sailed for Bintan where he later became a king. It is also said that it was he who gave name to Singapore. Upon landing on Temasek, the old name of Singapore, he spotted an animal, which he thought was a lion, and renamed Temasek as Singapura (Lion City). He also proclaimed himself as a king of Singapore.

According to the Malay Annals, Sri Tri Buana, fleeing from the sacking of Palembang, stayed on Bintan for several years, gathering his strength before founding the Kingdom of Singapura (Singapore).

=== Sultanate era ===

During the rule of Sultan Mansur Shah (1459–1466), the Riau archipelago became part of the Malacca Sultanate. The fall of Malacca Empire in 1511 when Malacca fell to the Portuguese. Sultan Mahmud Shah fled to Pahang and then to Johor and Bintan in 1521. There, he held out against Portuguese attacks, he even laid siege on Malacca in 1524, before a Portuguese counterattack forced him to flee to Sumatra where he died in 1528. Sultan Alauddin succeeded his father and set up a new capital in the south. The archipelago became the part of the &quot;war triangle&quot; between the Portuguese, the Johor Sultanate and the Acheh Sultanate of northern Sumatra.

Bintan saw many rulers during the time, as the three countries grew and declined in power. Subsequently, the Portuguese attacked Johor in 1587. The Siege of Johor, resulted in a Portuguese victory. The forces of Johor were unable to prevent the heavy Portuguese infantry from landing and storming the city after a naval bombardment, its Sultan was forced to retreat into the jungle in a rout. The Portuguese captured ample spoils, which included over 1000 cannon, the great majority of them of small caliber, 1500 firearms, and burned upwards to 2000 craft of many sizes. Following the attack, Dom Pedro de Lima (brother of Dom Paulo de Lima) also sacked Bintan, then a vassal of Johor.

After the fall of Malacca in 1511, the Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor-Riau, based on Bintan Island, and were for long considered the centre of Malay culture. Riau was a centre of Islamic studies and teaching. Many orthodox scholars from the Indian Subcontinent and Arabia were housed in special religious hostels, while devotees of Sufism could seek initiation into one of the many Tariqah (Sufi Brotherhood) which flourished in Riau. On the northern part of Sumatra around the same period, the Aceh Sultanate was beginning to gain substantial influence over the Straits of Malacca. With the fall of Malacca Muslim traders often skipped Malacca in favour of Aceh or Johor&#x27;s capital Johor Lama (Kota Batu). Therefore, Malacca and Aceh became direct competitors. With the Portuguese and Johor frequently in conflict, Aceh launched multiple raids against both sides to tighten its grip over the straits. The rise and expansion of Aceh encouraged the Portuguese and Johor to sign a truce and divert their attention to Aceh. The truce, however, was short-lived and with Aceh severely weakened, Johor and the Portuguese had each other in their sights again. During the rule of Sultan Iskandar Muda, Aceh attacked Johor in 1613 and again in 1615.

With the fall of Portuguese Malacca in 1641 and the decline of Aceh due to the growing power of the Dutch, Johor started to re-established itself as a power along the Straits of Malacca during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III (1623–1677). Its influence extended to Pahang, Sungei Ujong, Malacca, Klang and the Riau Archipelago.

In the early 18th century, the descendants of the Sultan and the Regent of Johor were fighting for power. Bugis aristocrats from Sulawesi was asked to assist the Regent of Johor, and managed to achieve control of Riau due to the internal struggle between the members of the Johor Sultanate. The Bugis made Bintan a major trading center. Riau and Bintan also attracted British, Chinese, Dutch, Arab and Indian traders. The Dutch however started to look upon Riau and the Bugis as a dangerous rival to Dutch trade in the region, drawing away trade from their ports in Malacca and Batavia (Jakarta). A Dutch fleet attacked Riau in 1784 but failed to hold the islands. Another attempt later the same year also failed before they managed to break the Bugis blockade of Malacca in June 1784. The Bugis commander, Raja Haji was killed during battle and the Bugis units retreated, which opened the way for a Dutch counterattack on Riau. The Bugis was expelled from Bintan and Riau, and a treaty between the Dutch and the Malay sultans granted Dutch control over the area. The treaty caused much anger among Malay rulers, and again in 1787 a force that was offered refuge by Sultan Mahmud drove out the Dutch. This also led to the return of the Bugis and the rivalry between the Bugis and Malay. Peace between the two parties was finally reached in 1803. Around this time Sultan Mahmud gave Penyengat Island as a wedding gift to his bride, Raja Hamidah, Raja Ali Haji&#x27;s daughter. Penyengat became for a period a center of government, Islamic religion and the Malay culture.

=== Colonial rule ===

In 1812, the Johor-Riau Sultanate experienced a succession crisis. The death of the Mahmud Shah III in Lingga left no heir apparent. Royal custom required that the succeeding sultan must be present at his predecessor&#x27;s deathbed. However at the time Mahmud Shah III died, the eldest prince, Tengku Hussein, was in Pahang to celebrate his marriage to the daughter of the Bendahara (governor). The other candidate was Tengku Hussein&#x27;s half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman. To complicate matters, neither of the candidates was of full royal blood. The mother of Tengku Hussein, Cik Mariam, owed her origin to a Balinese slave lady and a Bugis commoner. Tengku Abdul Rahman had a similarly lowborn mother, Cik Halimah. The only unquestionably royal wife and consort of Mahmud Shah was Engku Puteri Hamidah, whose only child had died an hour after birth. In the following chaos, Engku Puteri was expected to install Tengku Hussein as the next sultan, because he had been preferred by the late Mahmud Shah. Based on the royal &quot;adat&quot; (customary observance), the consent of Engku Puteri was crucial as she was the holder of the &quot;Cogan&quot; (Royal Regalia) of Johor-Riau, and the installation of a new sultan was only valid if it took place with the regalia. The regalia was fundamental to the installation of the sultan; it was a symbol of power, legitimacy and the sovereignty of the state. Yang Dipertuan Muda Jaafar (then-viceroy of the sultanate) supported the reluctant Tengku Abdul Rahman, adhering to the rules of royal protocol, as he had been present at the late Sultan&#x27;s deathbed.

Rivalry between the British and the Dutch intensified. The British had earlier gained Malacca from the Dutch under the Treaty of The Hague in 1795 and saw an opportunity to increase their regional influence. They crowned Tengku Hussein in Singapore, and he took the title Hussein Shah of Johor. The British were actively involved in the Johor-Riau administration between 1812 and 1818, and their intervention further strengthened their dominance in the Strait of Malacca. The British recognised Johor-Riau as a sovereign state and offered to pay Engku Puteri 50,000 Ringgits (Spanish Coins) for the royal regalia, which she refused. Seeing the diplomatic advantage gained in the region by the British, the Dutch responded by crowning Tengku Abdul Rahman as sultan instead. They also obtained, at the Congress of Vienna, a withdrawal of British recognition of Johor-Riau sovereignty. To further curtail the British domination over the region, the Dutch entered into an agreement with the Johor-Riau Sultanate on 27 November 1818. The agreement stipulated that the Dutch were to be the paramount leaders of the Johor-Riau Sultanate and that only Dutch people could engage in trade with the kingdom. A Dutch garrison was then stationed in Riau. The Dutch also secured an agreement that Dutch consent was required for all future appointments of Johor-Riau Sultans. This agreement was signed by Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar representing Abdul Rahman, without the sultan&#x27;s consent or knowledge.

Just as the British, both the Dutch and Yang Dipertuan Muda then desperately tried to win the royal regalia from Engku Puteri. The reluctant Abdul Rahman, believing he was not the rightful heir, decided to move from Lingga to Terengganu, claiming that he wanted to celebrate his marriage. The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince&#x27;s fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to Van Der Capellen, the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue. With the royal regalia in Dutch hands, Abdul Rahman was invited from Terengganu and proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor, Riau-Lingga and Pahang on 27 November 1822. Hence, the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau Empire was now Abdul Rahman, rather than the British-backed Hussein.

This led to the partition of Johor-Riau under the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824, by which the region north of the Singapore Strait including the island of Singapore and Johor were to be under British influence, while the south of the strait along with Riau and Lingga were to be controlled by the Dutch. By installing two sultans from the same kingdom, both the British and the Dutch effectively destroyed the Johor-Riau Sultanate. Under the treaty, Tengku Abdul Rahman was crowned as the Sultan of Riau-Lingga, bearing the name of Sultan Abdul Rahman, with the royal seat in Daik, Lingga. Tengku Hussein, backed by the British, was installed as the Sultan of Johor and ruled over Singapore and Peninsular Johor. He later ceded Singapore to the British in return for their support during the dispute. Both sultans of Johor and Riau acted mainly as Puppet monarchs under the colonial powers.

The globalization of the 19th century opened new opportunities for the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Proximity Singapore, 40 miles away, shaped the political climate of the kingdom, giving Riau Malays an opportunity to familiarize themselves with new ideas from the Middle East. The opening of Suez Canal meant a journey to Mecca via Port Said, Egypt and Singapore could take no more than a fortnight; thus these cities became major ports for the Hajj pilgrimage. Inspired by the experience and intellectual progress attained in the Middle East and influenced by the Pan-Islamism brotherhood, the Riau Malay intelligentsia established the Roesidijah (Club) Riouw in 1895. The association was born as a literary circle to develop the religious, cultural and intellectual needs of the sultanate, but as it matured, it changed into a more critical organisation and began to address the fight against Dutch rule in the kingdom. The late 19th century was marked by growing awareness among the elite and rulers of the importance of &quot;watan&quot; (homeland) and one&#x27;s duty towards their native soil. It was also viewed that the penetration of the west in the state was slowly tearing apart the fabric of the Malay-Muslim identity.

By the dawn of the 20th century, the association had become a political tool against colonial power, with Raja Muhammad Thahir and Raja Ali Kelana acting as its backbone. Diplomatic missions were sent to the Ottoman Empire in 1883, 1895 and in 1905 to secure the liberation of the kingdom by Raja Ali Kelana, accompanied by a renowned Pattani-born Ulema, Syeikh Wan Ahmad Fatani. The Dutch Colonial Office in Tanjung Pinang labelled the organisation as a left-leaning party. The organisation also won support from the &quot;Mohakamah&quot; (Malay Judiciary) and the &quot;Dewan Kerajaan&quot; (Sultanate Administrative Board). Its activities outraged the Dutch.

The movement was an early form of Malay nationalism. Non-violent and passive resistance measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts. The Dutch then branded the movement as a passive resistance (Dutch: &quot;leidelek verset&quot;), and passive acts such as ignoring the raising of the Dutch flag were met with anger by the Batavia-based &quot;Raad van Indie&quot; (Dutch East Indies Council) and the Advisor on Native Affairs, Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje. Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the &quot;Raad van Indie&quot;, advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier Aceh War had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore resistance. Later, on 1 January 1903, the Dutch Colonial Resident found that the Dutch flag was not being raised during his visit to the royal palace. In his report to the governor he wrote; &quot;it seems that he (Sultan Abdul Rahman II) acted as if he was a sovereign king and he raises his own flag&quot;. Based on several records in the Indonesian National Archive, there were some reports that the Sultan then apologized to the governor over the &quot;flag incident&quot;.

On 18 May 1905, the Dutch demanded a new agreement with the sultan, stipulating further limits on the powers of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, requiring that the Dutch flag must be raised higher than the flag of Riau, and specifying that Dutch officials should be given supreme honor in the land. The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere loan from the Dutch Government. The agreement was drawn up due to the fact that the appointment of Sultan Abdul Rahman II had not been made with the consent of the Dutch and he was also clearly against colonial rule.

The Dutch insisted that the sultan sign the agreement, but after consulting the fellow rulers of the state, Engku Kelana, Raja Ali, Raja Hitam and other members of the ruling elite, he refused, and decided to form a military regiment under the leadership of the prince regent, Tengku Umar. During a visit of the Dutch Resident&#x27;s visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the rulers of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being intimidated by the sultanate. The affiliates of the Roesidijah Klub, mainly the members of the administrative class, were thus able to slowly maneuver Abdul Rahman, once a supporter of Dutch rule, to act against the colonial power&#x27;s wishes.

On the morning of 11 February 1911, when the sultan and the court officials were in Daik to perform the &quot;Mandi Safar&quot; (a ritual purifying bath), ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy anchored in Penyengat Island and deployed hundreds of native soldiers (Dutch: &quot;marechausse&quot;) to lay siege to the royal court. This was followed by the arrival of Dutch official K.M Voematra from Tanjung Pinang at the Roesidijah Club headquarters to announce the deposition of Abdul Rahman II. The Dutch then seized the official coronation regalia, and to prevent their seizure by the Dutch, many official buildings were deliberately razed by members of the court themselves. A mass exodus of civilians and officials to Johor and Singapore then took place. To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and &quot;Tengku Ampuan&quot; (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel &quot;Sri Daik&quot;, while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore, where he died there in 1930 and was buried in Keramat Bukit Kasita, Kampung Bahru Road.

The Dutch officially annexed the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies (Dutch: &quot;Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden&quot;). The Dutch Residency consisted of Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, the Riau mainland and Indragiri, while the Tudjuh Archipelago was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division (Dutch: &quot;Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh&quot;).

=== Japanese occupation ===

When World War II broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the East Indies. This led the British to consider creating a buffer state in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in Terengganu. However, as the war approached Southeast Asia, the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and decided to shelve the restoration plan.

A day after the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, the 25th Army crossed the Singapore Strait and landed on Batam Island without resistance. The Dutch KNIL garrisons stationed on Batam had already abandoned the island on 14 February 1942, after hearing reports of the impending total collapse of Singapore across the strait. Six days after the fall of Singapore, Japanese forces captured Tanjungpinang, marking the complete fall of the Riau Islands under Japanese control.

=== Independence struggle ===
In the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the &quot;Gerakan Kesultanan Riau&quot; (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war chaos. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the World War II, a royalist faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays (Malay: &quot;Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati&quot;) (PMRS) emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay émigrés and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for self-governance in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council (Dutch: &quot;Riouw Raad&quot;, Malay: &quot;Dewan Riouw&quot;). The Riouw Council was the devolved national unicameral legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a Parliament.

After establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as &quot;Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow&quot; (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from Tudjuh Archipelago, Great Karimun, Lingga and Singkep. The group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the republican group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archival records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including Minangkabau, Javanese, Palembang, and Batak. He later formed a group known as the &quot;Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw&quot; (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-newly independent Indonesia, as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under Sukarno would give the pribumis a fair chance to run the local government.

The royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the &quot;Bendera Merah-Putih&quot; (Indonesian Flag) during the Indonesian Independence Day celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists &#x27;pro-Dutch&#x27;. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting autonomous rule to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the &quot;Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation&quot; which in the following year was admitted as part of the United States of Indonesia - with seats in the federal People&#x27;s Representative Council and Senate.

The call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the &quot;Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation&quot; on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became &quot;Keresidenan Riau&quot; under Central Sumatra Province under the United States of Indonesia. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the &quot;daerah-daerah pulihan&quot; (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957 - composed of both the islands and parts of the mainland, formerly part of the Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura.

The leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt. The Geopolitical roots of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred monarchist Peninsular Malay Nationalist observed across the border in British Malaya with the pro-republic and pan-ethnic Indonesian Nationalism manifested in her own Dutch East Indies domain.

=== Contemporary era ===

After the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in 1963. During this period, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar used in British Malaya was the principal currency in the region. To affirm its fiscal stake in the region, a decree was passed on 15 October 1963 to replace the Malaya and British Borneo dollar (the circulating currency) with an Indonesian-issued currency, the Riau rupiah, which replaced the dollar at par. Although the rupiah resembled the Indonesian rupiah in appearance, having a much higher value. Malayan money was withdrawn from 1 November 1963. The Riau rupiah was exchangeable as a foreign currency with the Indonesian rupiah. Since 1 July 1964, the Riau rupiah is no longer valid, being replaced by the Indonesian rupiah at a rate of 1 Riau rupiah = 14.7 Indonesian rupiah.

Due to its proximity to Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia, the Riau Islands area became the focus point during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. During this period, the territorial waters of the Riau Islands began to be visited by many Indonesian military forces who were members of the Indonesian Operations Command Corps or better known as the Indonesian Marine Corps. The city of Batam became one of the staging point of Indonesian troops during the confrontation, with the construction of military bases around the city. Anti-Malaysian guerrillas were gathered at Tanjung Balai Karimun to be trained and then sent to Sambu Island for briefing before operation. These guerrillas aimed to sabotage and spread information to help Indonesia fight the British in Malaysia, disrupting the economy around the Riau Islands, especially Tanjung Balai Karimun. At that time, KOPASKA special forces of the Indonesian Navy infiltrated Singapore from military bases in the Riau Islands, around Batam, Tanjung Balai Asahan and the surrounding area. They usually used small boats with outboard motors and disguise themselves as local residents who usually have relatives on the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. The coastline of Batam and the surrounding islands were heavily fortified to deter possible British and Malaysian invasion.

The end of the Indonesia-Singapore trade during the confrontation had made the disnurmud the economic conditions of the Riau Islands and Singapore. The inhabitants of Riau Islands could no longer barter or sell their produce to Singapore so they couldn&#x27;t get basic necessities such as rice. Usually the basic needs of the Riau Islands population were brought in more from Singapore instead of the rest of Indonesia. Even some of the some needs of Singapore residents were usually imported from the Riau Islands has been disrupted. Hostilities ceased in 1966 after the 30 September Movement attempted a coup d&#x27;état, resulting in the overthrow of the Sukarno regime which leads to a peace agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia that was signed on 28 May 1966 at Bangkok, Thailand.

With the initial aim of making Batam an Indonesian version of Singapore, according to Presidential Decree number 41 of 1973, Batam Island was designated as an industrial working area. This was supported by the Batam Island Industrial Area Development Authority, better known as the Batam Authority Agency (BOB) which is now the Batam Development Board (Indonesian: &quot;Badan Pengusahan Batam&quot; or &quot;BP Batam&quot;). In the 1980s, based on Government Regulation No. 34 of 1983, the Batam District was upgraded to the Batam Municipality. This body runs the government and community administration and supports the development carried out by the Batam Authority (BP Batam).

Some level of unity returned in the Riau region for the first time after 150 years, with the creation of the Sijori Growth Triangle in 1989. But while bringing back some wealth to Riau, the Sijori Growth Triangle somewhat further broke the cultural unity within the islands. With Batam island receiving most of the industrial investments and dramatically developing into a regional industrial centre, it attracted hundreds of thousands of non-Malay Indonesian migrants, changing the demographic balance in the archipelago. As the Malay, who were once the dominant ethnic group in the islands, have been reduced to about a third of the population, primarily as a result of immigration from elsewhere in Indonesia, they feel that their traditional rights are threatened. Similarly, the immigrants have felt politically and financially suppressed. Both of these causes have led to increased violence. Piracy in the archipelago is also an issue.

Dissatisfied with the provincial government&#x27;s policy in Pekanbaru and to avoid Riau mainland Minangkabau domination, the Riau islanders demanded to secede. In 2002, after a short effort by the peoples of the archipelago, Riau Islands Province was created by an act of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly with the capital of the former sultanate, Tanjung Pinang, as provincial capital.

== Politics ==

=== Government ===

The province of Riau Island is led by a governor (&quot;gubernur&quot;) who is elected directly by the people. The Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010. The legislative branch of the Riau Island government is the Riau Islands Regional People&#x27;s Representatives Assembly (Indonesian: &quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kepulauan Riau – DPRD Kepri&quot;), which is considered as a unicameral legislative body. Both governors and the members of the assembly are elected by citizens every five years by universal suffrage. Prior to this, the local executives had been elected by a vote of the assembly. The governor office and the province assembly are located in Basuki Rahmat Road at Pulau Dompak, Tanjung Pinang.

The number of members of the assembly is at least thirty-five people and at most one hundred people with a term of office of five years and ends when the new assembly member takes an oath. Assembly membership was formalized by a decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs. As of 2019, there are 45 seats in the assembly, scattered in several political parties. The majority (8 seats) are currently held by Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) after the 2019 general election.

Prior to Dutch colonization, most of the modern-day province of Riau Islands is part of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The sultanate was headed by a Sultan.The Sultan, who was a Malay, acted as Head of State while the &quot;Dipertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda&quot; (deputy ruler or Viceroy), a position held by the Bugis ruling elite, served as the Head of Government. The sultan&#x27;s royal palace was located in Penyengat Inderasakti, while the &quot;Yang Dipertuan Muda&quot; resided in Daik, Lingga. After becoming a Dutch protectorate, a Dutch resident was installed as an adviser to the sultan. For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the Dutch East Indies authority. Albeit he is de jure on the apex of the monarchy system, he is under the direct control of the Dutch Resident in Tanjung Pinang. All matters pertaining the administration of the sultanate including the appointment of the Sultan and the &quot;Yang Dipertuan Muda,&quot; must be made within the knowledge and even the consent of the Dutch Resident.

After the Dutch fully annexed the sultanate, a Dutch resident was posted in Tanjung Pinang, heading the Residency of Riau and Dependencies. During the 3 years of Japanese occupation, Japanese military officers and local Indonesian nationalist leaders headed the region.

=== Administrative divisions ===

This province is divided into five regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two autonomous cities (&quot;kota&quot;). These are subdivided into 70 districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) and then into 256 villages (&quot;desa&quot; or &quot;kelurahan&quot;). Each regency is headed by a regent (&quot;bupati&quot;), while each district is headed by a district chief (&quot;camat&quot;) and each village headed by a village chief (known as a &quot;kepala desa&quot; or &quot;penghulu&quot;) for each village in the district.

During the Dutch East Indies era, the Riau Islands was included in the Residency of Riau and Dependencies (Dutch: R&quot;esidentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden&quot;), which is also based in Tanjung Pinang. The Dutch Residency consisted of Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, the Riau mainland and Indragiri, while the Tudjuh Archipelago was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division (Dutch: &quot;Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh&quot;).
The regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and the city (&quot;kota&quot;) are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2020 census and according to the official estimates for mid 2023, together with the 2021 Human Development Index of each administrative divisions.
The province forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Riau Islands Electoral District consists of all of the 5 regencies in the province, together with the cities of Batam and Tanjung Pinang, and elects 4 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

=== Geography and Climate ===

The total area of the Riau Islands is (3,192.95 sq miles), making it the 31st largest province in Indonesia, slightly smaller than the province of Banten in Java. 96% of the total area of the province is encompassed of ocean and only 4% of it is encompassed of land. The province shares maritime borders with Vietnam and Cambodia to the north, the province of Bangka Belitung Islands and Jambi in the south, East Malaysia, Brunei and the province of West Kalimantan in the east and Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and mainland Riau in the west.

The island of Batam, which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province&#x27;s population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include Bintan and Karimun, while the archipelago also includes islands such as Bulan and Kundur. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at Tanjung Pinang in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the Lingga Islands to the south of the main Riau Archipelago, while to the northeast lies the Tudjuh Archipelago, between Borneo and mainland Malaysia; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups – the Anambas Islands, Natuna Islands, Tambelan islands and Badas Islands — which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago. The 2020 census count was 2,064,564, making it one of the fastest growing province in Indonesia; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,162,100, confirming continued growth.

The highest point in Riau Islands is Mount Daik with a height of 1,165 meters (3,822 ft), which is located on Lingga Island. Most of the area on Lingga Island is hilly. The Lingga area is generally in the form of an area with a fairly high slope, where there are as many as 76.92 percent of the area which has a slope of more than 15%, while the plain area (slope less than 2%) only encompasses of 3.49 ha or 3.14 percent of the total area.

With strategic geographical location (between South China Sea, Malacca Strait and Karimata Strait) and supported by an abundance of natural potential, Riau Islands could possibly become one of the economic growth centers for Indonesia in the future, especially now that in some areas of the Riau Islands (Batam, Bintan and Karimun), a pilot project for the development of a Special economic zone is being pursued through cooperation with the Singaporean government. The implementation of the SEZ policy in Batam-Bintan-Karimun, is a close cooperation between the central government and local government, and the participation of the business world. This KEK/SER will be the nodes of the leading economic activity centers, supported by excellent service facilities and internationally competitive infrastructure capacity. Every business actor located within it will receive services and facilities of the highest quality that can compete with best practices from similar areas in Asia-Pacific.

As an archipelago, the climatic conditions in the province are affected by wind. Most of the province has wet tropical climate, there is rainy season and dry season interspersed with transition season with the lowest average temperature 20.4 °C. In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June and December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20 to 30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3–15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150–200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.
As in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall. According to Köppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Af. In the Riau Islands, the average annual temperature is 25.2 °C. Precipitation here averages 2607 mm.

Oceanographic conditions, mainly wave and sea water current, in the study sites were influenced by wet monsoon period, i.e. from November to April. During the wet monsoon (wet season) the wind is characterized very strong, which blows from North-west to South-east or from South-west to North-east, with velocity ranges 7–20 knot (≈ 13–37 km/hour). The strongest wind usually occurs in around December–February, with velocity is about 45 km/hour. During this season the sea wave may very high, sometime &gt; 2 m especially during December–February. While the east monsoon (dry season), it usually occur in period of May to October, with wind velocity is relatively calm, that is about 7- 15 knot (≈ 13–28 km/hour). The sea wave was not very high reaching only around 0.8 m. The sea water current in Riau islands follows the current pattern in Malacca strait. It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of Andaman Sea and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in Pacific Ocean is always higher than in Indian Oceans, the seawater level in South China Sea is also higher than in Andaman Sea throughout the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction throughout the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea&#x27;s current goes to the north. Therefore, majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea&#x27;s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea&#x27;s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50 cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12 cm/sec to Northwest.

Conversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of Andaman Sea go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of Malacca Strait, and the different of sea water level to South China Sea’s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around July to August, with speed about 5 cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in Batam. Water turbidity was recorded about 22 NTU during the wet season, and it is lower (about 7.4 NTU) in the dry season.

=== Biodiversity ===

Riau Islands became one of the coral reef conservation sites in Indonesia. Examples of coral reef conservation sites in the Riau Islands are Karang Alangkalam and Karang Bali. The area&#x27;s marine life has made the Natuna Sea into a scuba diving destination. While there were once threats towards the coral reefs in the region, such as blast fishing, a survey by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences found that most of the coral reef ecosystems and mangrove forests in a number of locations in the waters around Batam are in a good condition. Nevertheless, there are some threats that might endanger the ecosystem in the province, such as plastic waste which is mostly produced by households that are thrown into the sea. Illegal fishing is also one of the factor that damages the ecosystem in the region. The sea around the Natuna Islands in the previous years has been home to illegal fishing due to weak law enforcement in the region. Under the Widodo administration, the Natuna Sea has been frequently patrolled by the Indonesian Navy and the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency to prevent illegal fishing. This has resulted in the arrest of hundreds of fishing boats and their crews from countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam and China.

As most of the Riau Islands consists of islands, many beaches can be found in the province, such as Lagoi Beach, Impian Beach, Trikora Beach, Nongsa Beach, Sakerah Beach, Loola Beach, Padang Melang Beach, Nusantara Beach, Batu Leafy Beach, Indah Beach, Tanjung Siambang Beach, Tanjung Beach, Melur Beach, Melayu Beach, Pelawan Beach, Sisi Beach and Cemaga Beach.

The wealth of flora and fauna in the Riau Islands is also very diverse. The &quot;Lutjanus gibbus&quot; and &quot;Piper betle&quot; are the fauna and flora symbol of the Riau Islands province respectively. The Humphead wrasse (&quot;Cheilinus undulatus&quot;), which is an endangered type of fish, inhabits the Natuna Sea in the northern part of the province. In addition, Dugongs also live in the waters around the island of Bintan. Some other rare animals are the Tarsius, and the Natuna Island surili (&quot;Presbytis natunae&quot;), native to the island of Natuna. The Natuna Island surili is one of the 25 most endangered primates on Earth. Wealth of flora in the province includes the &quot;Oncosperma tigillarium&quot;, dragon fruit, areca nut and the rare udumbara plants that live on the Engku Puteri Plateau, Batam Center. The Riau Islands has 2 nature reserves, namely Pulau Burung Nature Reserve and Pulau Laut Nature Reserve.

== Economy ==

The geographical position of the Riau Islands, which is close to neighboring countries located near the Strait of Malacca, which is one of the busiest shipping lane in the world, is also a major factor in the need to increase competitiveness. The geographical location can be a leverage in attracting foreign and domestic investors. However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness. This is because skilled workers and investors are more interested in areas that have competitiveness than regions that are not competitive. Therefore, increasing competitiveness is a necessity to attract investors, both foreign and domestic, to invest in the economic development of the Riau Islands.

The economic growth rate of Riau Islands Province in 2005 was 6.57%. Sectors that grew well (faster than the total GRDP growth) in 2005 included the transportation and communication sector (8.51%), the manufacturing sector (7.41%), the financial sector, leasing, and corporate services (6.89%), the service sector (6.77%), and the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (6.69%). GRDP Per capita of the Riau Islands in the last five years (2001–2005) tends to increase. In 2001 the GRDP per capita (above the prevailing price – without oil and gas) was Rp. 22,808 million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp.29,348 million. But in real terms (without calculating inflation) the Per capita GRDP (without gas) in 2001 was only Rp.20,397 million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp. 22,418 million.

The potential of natural wealth in the Riau Islands comes from mining and the manufacturing industries. The manufacturing sector contributes more than 35% and the processing industry accounts for 15.26% of the economy in Riau Islands with oil and gas commodities. In addition to the mining sector, community economic activities are dominant in the agriculture, plantation and forestry sectors. Riau Islands economic growth continued to decline in the period 2011–2014, then increased in 2014. During the period 2011–2014, the economic performance of the Riau Islands had an average growth rate of 6.31%.

In 2017, the manufacturing sector formed the largest GDP per share in the province, forming around 36.8% of the total GDP per share of the province. Based on the main commodities, mineral fuels, machinery and electrical equipment remain the mainstay trade of the Riau Islands. This type of commodity has not changed significantly compared to previous years. This needs to be considered given the expansion of the market must also be accompanied by an expansion of commodities both in quality and type. Export-oriented electronics manufacturing in Batam, for example, made up half of Indonesian electronics exports in 1991 with foreign companies alone employing 45,000 workers in 2020.

The second largest sector is the Construction industry, forming around 18% of the total GDP sector. The development of the number of construction businesses in the Riau Islands fluctuated considerably during the period 2008–2010. In 2010 the number of construction companies in the province was 1,570, with the value of construction completed (revenue) of Rp 5,483 billion. Number of National Labor Force Survey Results show that the number of residents working in the construction sector has fluctuated from time to time. As many as 43,232 people were recorded in February 2009, then decreased in February 2010 to 29,932 people, again increased in August 2010 to 50,833 people, then decreased in February 2011 to 58,211 and again increased in August 2011 to 59,755 people. Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year. This fact is in line with the increasing frequency of commodity rental prices in the Riau Islands.

The third largest sector is the mining industry. Riau Islands is the largest bauxite producing region in Indonesia. This can be seen from the number of bauxite mining companies. Since 2008, the number of bauxite mining companies has always been the highest compared to other mining companies, although the number has always dropped from 2008 to 2010. In 2009 the number of bauxite companies fell by 37 companies to 32 in 2010. This decline also had an impact on the decline in the number of workers and output produced by this sector. The tin company is the second largest company in the Riau Islands after bauxite. Tin companies also have the same situation as bauxite companies that are experiencing a decline. The tin company which initially had 25 companies in 2009 decreased to 22 companies in 2010.

A small but significant sector in the province is the agriculture sector, forming around 3.5% of the total GDP sector. Despite having limited agricultural land, and production of food crops (mainly rice), the Riau Islands have not been able to meet the needs food for its population. This problem is caused by rice productivity that is still low. Cassava plants have the highest productivity, then sweet potato and rice plants are ranked third. In 2011, rice productivity in the Riau Islands reached 3.16 tons per hectare, far below the productivity of cassava and sweet potatoes, which amounted to 10.83 tons per hectare and 7.75 tons per hectare, respectively. When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. Corn and peanut crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010–2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests. Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of rubber plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While coconut plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent. As for fruit production, in 2011, only jackfruit and banana increased, where jackfruit production increased by 5 percent and banana production increased by 50 percent, compared to production in 2010. As for the production of pineapple, durian, orange and rambutan decreased in 2011.

The island of Natuna located in the north-eastern part of the province is home to the largest natural gas field in Indonesia (estimated to 1.3 billion m3). The field was discovered in 1973 by Agip. In 1980, the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina and Exxon formed a joint venture to develop Natuna D-Alpha. However, due to the high content the partnership was not able to start production. In 1995, the Indonesian government signed a contract with Exxon but in 2007, the contract was terminated. In 2008, the block was awarded to Pertamina. The new agreement was signed between Pertamina and ExxonMobil in 2010. Correspondingly, the field was renamed East Natuna to be geographically more precise. In 2011, the principal of agreement was signed between Pertamina, ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies and Petronas. In 2012, Petronas was replaced by PTT Exploration and Production. As of 2016, negotiations about the new principal of agreement have not finalized and consequently, a production sharing contract is not signed. The area around the gas field is currently disputed between Indonesia and China.

== Infrastructure ==
From 2016 until 2020, the central government has outlined more development plan for the province. In 2017, the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and People&#x27;s Housing has allocated around Rp. 500 million (US$36 million) for the development of infrastructure in the Riau Islands, which includes building new infrastructure as well as improving existing infrastructure in the province. Meanwhile, in 2019, the Riau islands provincial government has also allocated a budget of around Rp. 15,5 trillion (US$1 billion) that is allocated from the province&#x27;s Regional Revenue and Expenditures Budget. This is an increase from 2018&#x27;s annual budget, which is around Rp. 13,9 trillion (US$980 million). The government continues to work towards accelerating maritime development (both economy and tourism) in Indonesia&#x27;s foremost and outermost regions, one of which is in the Riau Islands province to support economic development, tourism, and marine resources in the Riau Islands.

=== Energy and water resources ===

Electricity distribution in the state are operated and managed by the Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). According to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, as of 2017, there are 240 power plants in the Riau Islands, consisting of 2 steam power plant, 1 Solar power plant and 237 diesel power plant. Currently, the largest power plant in the Riau Islands is the Tanjung Kasam power plant in Batam, which has a capacity of 430 MW. It started operating in 2012. The power plant supplies around 25% of the total electric needs in Batam and the surrounding region. As of 2017, there are still around 104 villages in the province that is not fully electrified yet. In response, PLN has allocated around Rp. 751 billion (US$5.3 million) to build new power plants in the province with a total capacity of 45.500 KW. The location of the power plants will be scattered at several points such as in Natuna Regency. It also aimed that by 2020, all villages in the Riau Islands will be fully electrified.

All pipes water supply in the province is managed by the Riau Islands Municipal Waterworks (Indonesian: &quot;Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Kepulauan Riau&quot; – &quot;PDAM Kepri&quot;). Reliable water supply is one of the main problem faced by the people of the Riau Islands. The province has often faced a shortage in clean water, mostly due to drought during the dry seasons. In response, the Indonesian government is currently constructing several dams across the province to anticipate water shortage in the future. Examples of dams that are being constructed are the Sei Gong Dam in Galang Islands, Batam, which as a capacity of 11,8 million m3 of water. Construction of the dam has finished in 2018 and is predicted to begin operation in 2019. Another dam that is also under construction is the Sei Busung Dam in Bintan. It is slated to begin operation 2021 and would have a water capacity of 100 million m3 .

=== Internet and telecommunication ===
In 2018, the household internet broadband penetration in the Riau Islands is 70%, which is above the Indonesian national figure around 54.86%, according to the survey results from the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (Indonesian: &quot;Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia&quot;) (APJII). Nonetheless, there are still many regions in the Riau Islands that has limited or no internet access, especially around the outlying regions of Anambas and Natuna Islands. Efforts have been taken by the government to improve internet access in the region, such as the construction of the Palapa ring, which is a massive, nationwide internet network using fiber-optic wires that will provide high-speed internet connection throughout the nation. The project aimed to make all the capital cities of regencies and municipalities in Indonesia connected with broadband or high-speed internet infrastructure. The idea was preceded by the difficulties of the outermost, rural, and disadvantaged regions in Indonesia in obtaining adequate telecommunications access. The project work process began in 2017. Currently Palapa Ring construction has been completed and has also been inaugurated. A number of Indonesian telecommunications operators have begun cooperating with the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology so that the internet network can be accessed smoothly. The Palapa Ring network was completed in late 2019 and was inaugurated by the Indonesian president Joko Widodo on 14 October 2019.

Presently, the mobile telecommunication penetration in the outlying regions of the Riau Islands such as Natuna and Anambas are increasing due to the improvement of telecommunication infrastructure compared to the previous years. Several Indonesian network providers such as XL Axiata and Telkom Indonesia has started building more BTS tower around the region to increase network coverage around the region. XL Axiata has been present in Anambas and Natuna since 2008 with 2G services that use satellite connections and then upgraded to 3G services. In March 2019, XL Axiata inaugurated the 4G data network in the Anambas Islands, by using the West Palapa Ring backbone, in collaboration with the Telecommunications and Information Accessibility Agency (BAKTI) in using the West Palapa Ring network. While in 2018, Telkomsel strengthens 4G services in Natuna Regency and Anambas Islands Regency by building two new 4G base transceiver stations. With the deployment of 4G network infrastructure in the country&#x27;s border areas, Telkomsel now operates 89 BTS tower in Natuna and Anambas, including eight 4G BTS tower.

=== Transportation ===

==== Land ====

As most of the Riau Islands consists of oceans and outlying islands, land transportation is only limited to the larger islands in the province, such as Batam and Bintan. As of 2014, there are 4,954 km (3078 mi) of connected roadways in the Riau Islands, with 334 km (208 mi) being national highways, 512 km (318 mi) being provincial highways and the rest being city/regency highways. Most of the main roads in the Riau Islands has been paved, but there are still road sections that remain unpaved, especially in the outlying regions. Despite this, efforts has been taken by the government to improve road infrastructure in the regions, such as building more roads and improve existing roads, as well as building new bridges to connect river and islands in the province.

As in other provinces in Indonesia, the Riau Islands uses a dual carriageway with the left-hand traffic rule, and major cities in the province such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang provide public transportation services such as buses and taxis along with Gojek and Grab services. The Tengku Fisabilillah Bridge which connects Batam and Tonton Island is currently the longest bridge in the Riau Islands. It stretches for 642 meters and is a cable-stayed bridge with two 118 m high pylons and main span 350 m. The bridge is part of the Barelang Bridge, a chain of 6 Bridges of various types that connect the islands of Batam, Rempang, and Galang, Riau Islands that was constructed in 1992 and finished in 1997 and was inaugurated by former Indonesian president B. J. Habibie, who oversaw the project in construction, aiming to transform the Rempang and Galang islands into industrial sites (resembling present-day Batam). Travelling from the first bridge to the last is about 50 km and takes about 50 minutes. Over time the bridge sites have grown more into a tourist attraction rather than a transportation route. The Tengku Fisabilillah Bridge will be surpassed as the longest bridge in the province by the Batam-Bintan Bridge, which is still under the planning stage. Construction is expected to start in 2020 and finish in 3 to 4 years time. The Batam-Bintan bridge will have a length of around 7 km (4 mi).

Presently, there is no toll road in the Riau Islands. However, the government has announced a plan to build a new toll road in Batam which would connect Hang Nadim International Airport in the eastern part of the island and the Batu Ampar area in the northern part. The toll road will have a length of 19 km (12 mi) and will be constructed with various construction methods. About 5.2 kilometers of the toll road will elevated while the rest will be at grade.

==== Air ====

The province is served by several airports, the largest being Hang Nadim International Airport in Batam. Originally developed to handle diversions of aircraft from Singapore Changi Airport in case of an emergency, it has sufficient facilities for wide-body aircraft such as Boeing 747s. The airport has the longest runway in Indonesia and the second longest runway in Southeast Asia, after Kuala Lumpur International Airport, at 4,214 metres (13,825 ft) long. The airport serve flights to major Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya and Palembang, as well as some international destinations such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and cities in China such as Shenzhen and Xi&#x27;an. Due to its proximity to Singapore, many people who is travelling abroad usually choose to go to Changi Airport in Singapore since it serves more destinations to other countries compared to Hang Nadim International Airport or Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta.

The second-largest airport in the province is the Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport in Bintan. It mostly serves flight to Jakarta and destinations within the province such as Batam and Natuna. Other airports in the province are the Dabo Airport in Singkep, Raja Haji Abdullah Airport in Karimun, Letung Airport and Matak Airport in the Anambas Islands and Raden Sadjad Airport in the Natuna Islands. Raden Sadjad Airport is currently being developed as a military airbase due to territory dispute between Indonesia and China on the waters off the coast of the Natuna Islands. Additional facilities, such as aircraft hangars, ILS, refueling hangar are also currently being added.

As the closest neighbour of Singapore and to realise that Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is fully used, Lion Air is developing hangars in Batam Island and Garuda Indonesia is developing a new airport, with runway and maintenance facilities so as to make a new air hub in Bintan Island.

==== Sea ====

Due to the fact that the Riau Islands is an archipelago province located in an archipelago country, water transport becomes the main type of transportation. Inter-island connections are often contacted by water transport. This type of water transport includes ferries, canoes, speedboats, freight boats, etc. This ships consists of a ship operated by the state-owned Pelni company as well as private vessels. The main ports are located in Batam and Bintan. There largest cargo port is the Port of Batu Ampar in Batam. It serves cargo ships to and from Batam and has a capacity of 1000 container.

Major cities such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang serves international ferry routes to Singapore and Malaysia. Ferries connect Batam to Singapore, Bintan, and Johor Bahru (Malaysia). Five ferry terminals are on Batam: Batam Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal, Nongsapura Ferry Terminal, Sekupang, Waterfront City, and Batam Center Ferry Terminal. Connections to Singapore are by way of Harbourfront and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminals run by Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC). While in Tanjung Pinang, the Sri Bintan Pura Harbour is the largest harbour in Bintan. This port connects the city of Tanjung Pinang with ports to the north (Lobam port and Bulang Linggi port), with islands to the west, such as Tanjung Balai Karimun, Batam, and islands to the south such as Lingga and Singkep islands. For international ferry services, the port of Sri Bintan Pura also has transportation links to Singapore (HarbourFront and Tanah Merah) and Malaysia (Stulang Laut).

=== Healthcare ===

Health-related matters in the Riau Islands is administered by the Riau Islands Health Agency (Indonesian: &quot;Dinas Kesehatan Provinsi Kepulauan Riau&quot;). According to the Riau Islands branch of the Indonesian Central Agency on Statistics, as of 2016, there are around 28 hospitals in the Riau Islands which consists of 13 state-owned hospitals and 15 private hospitals. According to the Riau Islands provincial government, there are 87 clinics in Riau Islands as of 2018, of which 70 of them are already accredited, while the remaining 17 clinics are not yet accredited. The number of hospitals and clinics in the Riau Islands are still far below the ideal level, according to the Ombudsman of the Republic of Indonesia.

The most prominent hospital is the Riau Islands Regional General Hospital (Indonesian: &quot;Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah Kepulauan Riau&quot;) in Tanjung Pinang, which is the largest state-owned hospital in the province. Other prominent hospital in the province is the Santa Elisabeth Hospital in Batam and the Embung Fatimah Regional General Hospital which is also located in Batam. Due to lack of adequate health facilities in the province, many people usually travel to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Singapore to get medical treatment as these countries has better medical infrastructure compared to the Riau Islands.

=== Education ===
Education in the Riau Islands, as well as Indonesia in a whole, falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Culture (&quot;Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan&quot; or &quot;Kemdikbud&quot;) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (&quot;Kementerian Agama&quot; or &quot;Kemenag&quot;). In Indonesia, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of six years at elementary level and three each at middle and high school levels. Islamic schools are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The Constitution also notes that there are two types of education in Indonesia: formal and non-formal. Formal education is further divided into three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary education. Indonesians are required to attend 12 years of school, which consists of three years of primary school, three years of secondary school and three years of high school.

As of 2019, there are 1,621 schools in the Riau Islands, which consists of 1,051 government-owned schools and 570 private schools. There are several international schools in the Riau Islands, which are mostly located in Batam and the surrounding area, due to its significant expatriate populations, such as Sekolah Global Indo-Asia, The Independent School Batam, Australian Intercultural School, Sekolah Djuwita Batam, etc. Most of the teachers that worked in these international schools are English-educated teachers from Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Australia, United States and Philippines.

There are around 40 universities in the Riau islands, both public and private universities. Public universities in the Riau Islands falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Research and Technology (&quot;Kementerian Riset dan Teknolog&quot;) or the Ministry of Religious Affairs for Islamic universities. Notable public universities in the province is the Raja Ali Haji Maritime University and the Sultan Abdurrahman Islamic College in Tanjung Pinang, and the Batam State Polytechnic in Batam. There are at least one international university in the Riau Islands, which is the Batam International University located in Batam.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 national census results (released in 2021 by the Indonesian Central Agency on Statistics), the Riau Islands province had a population of 2,064,564 people, spread throughout five regencies and two cities, and consisting of 1,053,296 males and 1,011,268 females. This makes the Riau Islands the 26th most populated province in Indonesia. The population in the province was predicted to increase to 2,768,000 by 2030, although this figure has since been revised downwards. The official estimate was 2,162,140 in mid 2023, giving a population density in the Riau Islands of 261.458 people per km2. The city of Batam is the most populated administrative division in the province, with 1,256,600 people in mid 2023, while the Anambas Islands Regency is the least populated in the province, with just 49,090 people. Most of the population of Riau Island is concentrated on the island nearest to Singapore, such as Batam and Bintan.

=== Ethnicity ===

Riau Islands is a very diverse and multi-ethnic province. Owing to its proximity to Singapore, many people from other parts of Indonesia has migrated to the province. As of 2010, the ethnic groups in Riau Island consist of Malays (33.71%), Javanese (23.19%), Batak (11.48%), Minangkabau (8.71%), Chinese (7.69%), and Sundanese (2.95%).

The Malays are the largest ethnic group with a composition of 33.71% of the entire population of the Riau Islands. They are the native people of the Riau Archipelago. From the ancient times, the Riau Archipelago is considered the hub of Malay cultures. In the past, several Malay kingdoms and sultanates existed in the archipelago, the most notably being the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. A major sub-group of the Malay inhabiting the province is the &quot;Orang laut&quot; (sea people). The &quot;Orang laut&quot; are Malays who are Nomadic in nature and have a rich marine culture. Presently, many &quot;Orang laut&quot; have settled in coastal areas of the province. The &quot;Orang laut&quot; are encompasses of numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the Tudjuh Archipelago, the Batam Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern Sumatra, southern Malaysia Peninsula and Singapore. The geographical condition of the Riau Islands, which has almost 99% of its area as water, has made quite a number of &quot;Orang Laut&quot; groups living in this area. In the Riau Islands, the &quot;Orang laut&quot; are usually found in islands and river mouths. The &quot;Orang laut&quot; are boat-dwelling tribe with main livelihoods as fish finders and other marine animals, such as &quot;tripang&quot; (sea cucumber). This subsystem economic model is the characteristic of their culture. Since the implementation of the policy of relocation of settlements by the Indonesian Government in the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the customs of the &quot;Orang laut&quot; are gradually disappearing.

Other ethnic group are mostly immigrants coming from different parts of Indonesia. Due to its proximity from Singapore, Riau Islands have become a melting pot for different ethnic groups coming from other parts of Indonesia. The Javanese is the dominant ethnic group of the immigrants, forming 23.19% of the total population. The Javanese who stayed here are mostly due to the Transmigration program enacted by the Dutch during the colonial period to reduce the overpopulated Java and continued until the end of the New Order. Another notable immigrants are the Minangkabau (Minang), who mostly originated from West Sumatra. Owing to its &quot;rantau&quot; (migration) culture, many Minangkabau people has migrated away from their homeland. The history of the Minangkabau migration in West Sumatra to the Riau mainland and the Riau Islands has been recorded to have lasted a very long time. When the means of transportation were still using the river, many Minang people migrated to various cities such as Tanjung Pinang and Batam. Most of Minangkabau people work as traders, peddlers, and craftsmen, in addition to doctors, lawyers, and journalists.

The Chinese is the fifth largest ethnic group in the province, forming 7.69% of the total population. Chinese traders have frequented the region since at least the 13th century, during the Yuan dynasty. The mention of &quot;Longyamen&quot; (simplified Chinese: 龙牙门; traditional Chinese: 龍牙門; pinyin: lóngyámén&quot;)&quot;, which means &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Tooth Strait&quot; in Chinese, first appeared in the &quot;Yüan shih&quot; in 1320. In 1325, &quot;Longyamen&quot; sent a mission to China with a memorial and tribute. The nearby island of Bintan had sent an earlier mission in 1323. Thus &quot;Longyamen&quot; was already known to the Yuan court before 1320. Another place named &quot;Longyamen&quot; appears in 1225 in Zhao Rugua’s text. It has been argued that this place was Lingga, south of Riau, and that the 14th-century &quot;Longyamen&quot; was in that vicinity. It is more probable, however, that the Song text referred to a different place from the Yuan texts. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that &quot;Longyamen&quot; was Singapore in the 14th and 15th centuries. Presently, the Riau Island is one of the province in Indonesia that has the largest number of Chinese population. The capital of the Riau Islands, Tanjung Pinang, is one of the city that has the largest percentage of ethnic Chinese population among other cities in Indonesia, amounting to 13.5% of the total population. Until now some of Tanjung Pinang&#x27;s economy is driven by the ethnic Chinese community. They not only controlled the small or medium-scale economy, but also developed into large-scale businesses such as shipbuilding, housing, restaurants and hospitality. In addition to moving in the economy, there are some who become politicians, people&#x27;s representatives, political figures and even civil servants. Most of the Chinese in Tanjung Pinang, as well as the Riau Islands in a whole trace their ancestors from Fujian, hence most of them are of Hokkien origin, while significant population of Teochew and Cantonese origins also exist in the Riau Islands.

Other ethnic groups, such as the Batak from North Sumatra, the Banjarese from South Kalimantan and the Buginese from South Sulawesi also inhabit the province, albeit to a lesser extent.

=== Language ===
Indonesian is the official language of the state, as well as the province. However, several varieties of Malay are spoken in the province. There are fifteen different varieties of Malay spoken in the Riau Islands, most of which are mutually intelligible with Indonesian, which is a standardized form of Malay. The Riau Islands are considered the birthplace of the modern Malay language, though it was the classical Malaccan Malay of the Johor court rather than Riau Malay that formed the basis of the standard Indonesian language. The common Riau Islands Malay dialect, which is spoken in major cities such as Tanjung Pinang and Batam is similar to the Malay used in Johor, Malaysia, although it is much more influenced by the Indonesian language. It served as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the province.

The Karimun Regency has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix &quot;A&quot; which sounds as &quot;E&quot;. The word /saya/ and /apa/ (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;What&quot; respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in Peninsular Malaysia. The dialects used in the Bintan Regency are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the Lingga Regency is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province&#x27;s northernmost regencies, Anambas and Natuna, is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the Pontianak Malay dialect spoken in West Kalimantan and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in Bangka-Belitung, especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, &quot;kitak&quot; or &quot;ketak&quot; which means you, &quot;wan&quot; which means grandma and &quot;suduk&quot; which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by Terengganu Malay and Pahang Malay that are spoken in the Malaysian states of Terengganu and Pahang respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the Malay Peninsula. Historically, the Anambas and Natuna Malays spoke the Terengganu Malay, but its speakers (mostly elderly) are rapidly diminishing and replaced by the local Malay dialects on the islands (to a lesser extent, the usage of standard Indonesian was also the cause of the diminishment of native dialect speakers). The &quot;Orang Laut&quot; people also spoke their own variety of Malay which is still related to the Malay spoken in the Batam-Bintan area.

Traditionally, the Malay language is written in Jawi script (locally known in Indonesia as &quot;Arab-Melayu&quot;), an Arabic-based writing. However, the use of Jawi is diminishing rapidly, being replaced by the Latin script introduced by the Dutch during the colonial era. Today, the Jawi script are primarily used for religious and cultural activities. Road signs and government buildings signs in the Riau Islands are also written in this script, usually written along the Latin script.

Most of the Chinese in the Riau Islands spoke a variety of Hokkien, a local variant of the Min Nan Chinese variety, as most of the Riau Islands Chinese are of Hoklo descent. The Riau Islands Hokkien is related to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of Bagansiapiapi and Selat Panjang, as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. Together, they are known as the Southern Malaysia Hokkien. This dialect is based on the Quanzhou dialect, which originated from the city of Quanzhou in Fujian, China. It is markedly distinct from Penang Hokkien and Medan Hokkien, which are based on Zhangzhou dialect, another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of Zhangzhou, also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as Teochew, Hainanese, Hakka and Cantonese, albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region have been greatly influenced by Malay and Indonesian, especially their vocabulary.

Other ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the Javanese language spoken by the Javanese, Minangkabau language spoken by the Minangkabau and different varieties of Batak spoken by different sub-groups of the Batak people.

Indonesian is widely used as the national language. Most formal education, and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, judiciary, and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang, while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The Chinese people in the Riau Islands use Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other Chinese varieties being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language. Due to it close proximity from Singapore, English or Singlish are sometimes used as another lingua franca among Riau Islands people to foreigners, especially in Batam.

===Religion===

The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from India with Hinduism, from China with Buddhism and Confucianism, from Europe with Christianity and Catholicism, as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the Nusantara archipelago. Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

As of 2016, Islam is the dominant religion in the province, forming 78.29% of the total population. Islam is generally adhered by the ethnic Malays, Javanese, Minangkabau, Banjars, Bugis, Sundanese and some Batak sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the 12th century. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula, Persia and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the Islamization process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as Muhammadiyah and the Nahdlatul Ulama.

Christianity forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.51% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are Protestantism and Catholicism, forming around 11.97% and 2.54% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from Batak sub-groups (specifically Batak Toba, Karo and Simalungun), Nias, Chinese, and migrants from North Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua, while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are migrants from East Nusa Tenggara. The province does not have its own Catholic Diocese. Instead, it is served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang, which is based in Pangkal-Pinang, Bangka Belitung Islands.

Buddhism and Confucianism forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 6.99% and 0.15% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, Hinduism only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by Balinese migrants and Indonesians of Indian descent.

== Culture ==
The culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malays and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the culture of Islam. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity and Confucianism. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the Malay world, the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.

What is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called &quot;long&quot; or &quot;sulung&quot;, the second child is called &quot;ngah&quot;/&quot;ongah&quot;, the third child is called &quot;cik&quot; and the youngest child is called &quot;cu/ucu&quot;. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example &quot;cik&quot; &quot;itam,&quot; which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.

A typical Riau Malay &quot;kampung&quot; (village) are led by a village chief called the &quot;penghulu&quot;. Presently, the &quot;penghulu&quot; is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the &quot;penghulu&quot; there is also a leader in the religious sector called &quot;imam&quot;. This &quot;imam&quot; takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of zakat and others. Thus the &quot;penghulu&quot; accompanied by the &quot;imam&quot; are the leader of the &quot;kampung&quot;.

In the &quot;kampung&quot;, most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these &quot;kampung&quot;. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause &quot;discordant eyes&quot;, &quot;discordant ears&quot;, &quot;discordant manners&quot;.

=== Arts and performance ===

Various forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.

In the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures. This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on Penyengat Island which at that time was the center of the government of the Sultanate of Riau-Lingga. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as Maulud Nabi, Isra-Mikraj, Nuzulul Quran, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two Jawi printing presses, namely Mathba‘at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba‘at al Riauwiyah. The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.
The Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing. The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as Deli, Langkat, Serdang and Asahan in North Sumatra, Jambi, West Kalimantan, and others, were also affected by the Minangkabau, Mandailing, Bugis and Javanese cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as India (Hindu-Buddhist), Arabic (Islam), Chinese, and Siamese influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.

&quot;Baju Kurung&quot; is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and southern Thailand. &quot;Baju Kurung&quot; is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with &quot;songket&quot; cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced Islam, many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the hijab, although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the Quran, or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.

However, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the &quot;Kebaya Labuh&quot; and the &quot;Teluk Belanga.&quot; The &quot;Kebaya Labuh a&quot;re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of &quot;Kebaya Labuh&quot; and &quot;Teluk Belangga&quot; traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. &quot;Kebaya Labuh&quot; is often combined with batik cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called &quot;Tanjak&quot;. The spindle is a rectangular songket that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the &quot;Teluk Belanga&quot; custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the &quot;tanjak&quot;. The custom attire of &quot;Kebaya Labuh&quot; and &quot;Teluk Belangga&quot; is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square &quot;songket&quot; shaped like songkok or peci. Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, &quot;Teluk Belangga&quot; clothing is usually accompanied by a &quot;peci&quot;. For women, the &quot;Kebaya Labuh&quot; is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.

The &quot;Mak yong&quot; is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. &quot;Mak Yong&quot; is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. &quot;Mak Yong&quot; performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The &quot;Mak yong&quot; performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums. In the Riau Islands region, the &quot;Mak Yong&quot; oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to Bangka, Johor, Malacca and Penang. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. &quot;Mak yong&quot; theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.

&quot;Zapin&quot; is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from Hadramaut in Yemen by Arab traders in the early 16th century. At that time the country of Johor became a substitute for the role of Malacca as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of &quot;Zapin&quot; dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic da&#x27;wah medium through &quot;Zapin&quot; songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called marwas or maracas. The &quot;Zapin&quot; dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, &quot;Zapin&quot; was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.

The is a traditional Riau dance by the people of Bintan. It originated back in the 12th century in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, &quot;Malemang&quot; Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called &quot;malemang&quot; or &quot;melemang&quot;. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the &quot;Melemang Bintan Penaga&quot; Dance.

===Architecture===

In Malay culture, the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the Riau Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia, Brunei and other Malay-populated countries. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.

Riau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving. Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a Riau Malay house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.

The &quot;Limas Potong&quot; house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the Riau Archipelago. &quot;Limas Potong&quot; is a stilt house, like a traditional house in Sumatra in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. &quot;Limas Potong&quot; has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.

One of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the &quot;Belah Bubung&quot; traditional house. This house is also known as the &quot;Rabung&quot; house or the &quot;Bumbung Melayu&quot; house. The name &quot;Belah Bubung&quot; was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.

===Traditional weapon===
&quot;Badik Tumbuk Lado&quot; is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. &quot;Badik&quot; itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in Sumatra. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the Malay people. No wonder the &quot;Badik Tumbuk Lado&quot; has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions. &quot;Badik Tumbuk Lado&quot; is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29 cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4 cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of Jambi, and also has similarities with the Buginese &quot;Badik&quot;, it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the &quot;keris&quot;, &quot;badik&quot; is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the &quot;Badik Tumbuk Lado&quot; is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the &quot;badik&quot; as a complement to men&#x27;s custom clothing.

The &quot;Jenawi&quot; is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. &quot;Jenawi&quot; sword is similar to a typical Japanese katana. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people&#x27;s identity on the national scene.

=== Cuisine ===
Cuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in Peninsular Malaysia, owing to its similar culture. There are also some dishes that is influenced by other parts of Indonesia, such as Java. Due to its cultural diversity, the people of the Riau Islands has developed a unique dishes that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia. The Riau Islands cuisine is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malay, Indian and Chinese. Some foods are also influenced by the culture of the Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, other ethnic groups in Sumatra and Borneo, as well as European cultures, especially the British and Dutch.

One of the most popular dish in the Riau Islands is its variety of the Nasi lemak, with some notable differences compared to the variety found in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. In archipelago region like Riau Islands, usually seafood are used to accompany nasi lemak, such as &quot;ikan bilis&quot; (anchovy), &quot;ikan tamban&quot; (&quot;Sardinella longiceps&quot;), &quot;ikan selar kuning&quot; (&quot;Selaroides leptolepis&quot;), &quot;sotong&quot; or &quot;cumi-cumi&quot; (squid) or small Prawns. The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (&quot;ikan bilis&quot;), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (&quot;sambal&quot;). The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as &quot;ikan tamban&quot;, usually fried with &quot;sambal&quot; chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible. Prawns and Squids are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as &quot;sambal udang&quot; or &quot;sambal cumi&quot;.

Another notable dish that can be found in the Riau Islands is the laksa. Laksa or Lakse in local dialect is a kind of noodle food mixed with typical Chinese and Malay spice blend.

The Bak kut teh (肉骨茶) is another dish found in the Riau Islands, usually consumed by the Chinese people in the province. the dish can only be found in the region as well as neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Bak kut means meat tea bone. &quot;Bak kut&quot; itself is pork ribs, while the word &quot;teh&quot;, which means tea in Hokkien, comes from either the dish brown sauce which is similar to the color of a tea, or that it was originally served with tea to mollify the taste.. This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.
