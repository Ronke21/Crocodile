<text>Nur Jahan (; 31 May 1577 – 18 December 1645), born Mehr-un-Nissa was the twentieth wife and chief consort of the Mughal emperor Jahangir.

More decisive and proactive than her husband, Nur Jahan is considered by certain historians to have been the real power behind the throne for more than a decade. Wielding a level of power and influence unprecedented for a Mughal empress, she was granted honours and privileges never enjoyed by any of her predecessors or successors, such as having coinage struck in her name. Her pre-eminence was in part made possible by her husband Jahangir&#x27;s addiction to hunting, alcohol and opium and his frequent ill-health.

==Birth and early life (1577–1594)==
Nur Jahan was born as Mehr-un-Nissa (1577) in Kandahar, present-day Afghanistan, into a family of Persian nobility and was the second daughter and fourth child of the Persian aristocrat Mirza Ghiyas Beg and his wife Asmat Begum. Both of Nur Jahan&#x27;s parents were descendants of illustrious families – Ghiyas Beg from Muhammad Sharif and Asmat Begum from the Aqa Mulla clan. Her paternal grandfather, Khwaja Muhammad Sharif, was first a &quot;wazir&quot; to Tatar Sultan the governor of Khurasan, and later was in the service of Shah Tahmasp, who made him the &quot;wazir&quot; of Isfahan, in recognition of his excellent service. For unknown reasons, Ghiyas Beg&#x27;s family had suffered a reversal in fortunes in 1577 and soon found circumstances in their homeland intolerable. Hoping to improve his family&#x27;s fortunes, Ghiyas Beg chose to relocate to India where the Emperor Akbar&#x27;s court was said to be at the centre of the growing trade industry and cultural scene.

Halfway along their route the family was attacked by robbers who took from them their remaining meager possessions. Left with only two mules, Ghiyas Beg, his pregnant wife, and their two children (Muhammad Sharif, Asaf Khan) were forced to take turns riding on the backs of the animals for the remainder of their journey. When the family arrived in Kandahar, Asmat Begum gave birth to their second daughter. The family was so impoverished they feared they would be unable to take care of the newborn baby. Fortunately, the family was taken in by a caravan led by the merchant noble Malik Masud, who would later assist Ghiyas Beg in finding a position in the service of Emperor Akbar. Believing that the child had signaled a change in the family&#x27;s fate, she was named Mehr-un-Nissa or ‘Sun among Women’. Her father Ghiyas Beg began his career in India, after being given a mansab of 300 in 1577. Thereafter he was appointed &quot;diwan&quot; (treasurer) for the province of Kabul. Due to his astute skills at conducting business, he quickly rose through the ranks of the high administrative officials. For his excellent work he was awarded the title of Itimad-ud-Daula or ‘Pillar of the State’ by the emperor.

As a result of his work and promotions, Ghiyas Beg was able to ensure that Mehr-un-Nissa (the future Nur Jahan) would have the best possible education. She became well-versed in Arabic and Persian languages, art, literature, music and dance. The poet and author Vidya Dhar Mahajan would later praise Nur Jahan as having a piercing intelligence, a volatile temper and sound common sense.

==Marriage to Sher Afgan Khan (1594–1607)==
In 1594, when Nur Jahan was seventeen years old, she married her first husband Ali Quli Istajlu (also known as Sher Afgan Khan). Sher Afgan was an adventurous Persian who had been forced to flee his home in Persia after the demise of his first master Shah Ismail II. He later joined the Mughal army and served under the Emperors Akbar and Jahangir. As a reward for his loyal service, Akbar arranged Nur Jahan&#x27;s marriage with Sher Afgan. Their only child together, a daughter, Mihr-un-Nissa Begum, popularly known as Ladli Begum, was born in 1605. While participating in a military campaign in Mewar under Prince Salim, Ali Quli Istajlu was bestowed the title of Sher Afgan or &quot;Tiger Tosser&quot;. Sher Afgan&#x27;s role in the rout of the Rana of Udaipur inspired this reward, but contemporaries did not record his exact actions. A popular explanation is that Sher Afgan saved Salim from an angry tigress.

In 1607, Sher Afgan Khan was killed after it was rumoured he had refused to obey a summons from the Governor of Bengal, took part in anti-state activities, and attacked the governor when he came to escort Sher Afgan to court. Some have suspected Jahangir of arranging Sher Afgan&#x27;s death because the latter was said to have fallen in love with Nur Jahan and had been denied the right to add her to his harem. The validity of this rumour is uncertain as Jahangir only married Nur Jahan in 1611, four years after she came to his court. Furthermore, contemporary accounts offer few details as to whether or not a love affair existed prior to 1611 and historians have questioned Jahangir&#x27;s logic in bestowing honours upon Sher Afgan if he wished to see him removed from the picture.

==As Mughal Empress==

===Lady-in-waiting to Ruqaiya Sultan Begum (1607–1611)===

After her husband Sher Afgan was killed in 1607, Nur Jahan and her daughter, Ladli Begum, were summoned to Agra by Jahangir for their protection and acted as lady-in-waiting to the Ruqaiya Sultan Begum, who had been one of the chief wives of the late Emperor Akbar. Given the precarious political connections of Sher Afgan before his death, his family would be in certain danger with him gone from those seeking to avenge Qutbuddin&#x27;s murder. For her protection, then, Nur Jahan needed to be at the Mughal court in Agra, she was brought back in honour (presumably because of her father&#x27;s position at court) was clear from her new post with Ruqaiya Sultan Begum.

Nur Jahan served as lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Empress for four years. The Dutch merchant and travel writer Pieter van den Broecke, described their relationship in his Hindustan Chronicle, &quot;This Begum [Ruqaiya] conceived a great affection for Mehr-un-Nissa [Nur Jahan]; she loved her more than others and always kept her in her company.&quot;

===Marriage to Jahangir (1611–1627)===
Nur Jahan and Jahangir have been the subject of much interest over the centuries and there are innumerable legends and stories about their relationship. Many stories allege an early affection between Nur Jahan and Emperor Jahangir before Nur Jahan&#x27;s first marriage in 1594. One variation recounts that they were in love when Nur Jahan was seventeen years old, but their relationship was blocked by Emperor Akbar. However more modern scholarship has led to doubts about the existence of a prior relationship between Nur Jahan and Jahangir.

===Jahangir&#x27;s proposal and marriage===

In 1611, Nur Jahan met Emperor Jahangir at the palace&#x27;s Meena Bazaar during the spring festival of Nowruz which celebrated the coming of the new year, Jahangir fell in love with her and proposed, and they were married on 25 May of the same year (Wednesday, 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal, 1020 AH/ 25 May 1611 AD). Nur Jahan was thirty-four years old at the time of her second marriage and she would be Jahangir&#x27;s twentieth and last legal wife. According to some accounts they had two children, while others report the couple remained childless. Incomplete records and Jahangir&#x27;s abundant number of children, obscure efforts to distinguish individual identities and maternity. This confusion is shown by later sources mistakenly identifying Nur Jahan as the mother of Shah Jahan. Jahangir&#x27;s wife, Jagat Gosain, a Rajput princess, was, in reality, Shah Jahan&#x27;s mother.

Jahangir gave her the title of &quot;Nur Mahal&quot; () upon their marriage in 1611 and &quot;Nur Jahan&quot; () five years later in 1616 when they had their first sex. Jahangir&#x27;s affection and trust in Nur Jahan led to her wielding a great deal of power in affairs of state. Jahangir&#x27;s addiction to opium and alcohol made it easier for Nur Jahan to exert her influence. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest symbol of power and determination of the decrees of the empire – his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. So for many years, she wielded imperial power and was recognized as the real force behind the Mughal throne.

Jahangir entrusted her with Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s second son, Prince Shah Shuja, upon his birth in 1616. This new responsibility was given to her due to her high rank, political clout and Jahangir&#x27;s affection for her. It was also an honour for the empress as Shuja was a special favourite of his grandfather.

===Family advancements and consolidating power===
After Sher Afgan&#x27;s death, Nur Jahan&#x27;s family was again found in a less than honourable or desired position. Her father was at that time, a &quot;diwan&quot; to an &quot;Amir-ul-Umra&quot;, decidedly not a very high post. In addition, both her father and one of her brothers were surrounded by scandal as the former was accused of embezzlement and the latter of treason. Her fortunes took a turn for the better when she married Jahangir. The Mughal state gave absolute power to the emperor, and those who exercised influence over the emperor gained immense influence and prestige. Nur Jahan was able to convince her husband to pardon her father and appoint him Prime Minister. To consolidate her position and power within the Empire, Nur Jahan placed various members of her family in high positions throughout the court and administrative offices. Her brother Asaf Khan was appointed grand Wazir (minister) to Jahangir.

Furthermore, to ensure her continued connections to the throne and the influence which she could obtain from it, Nur Jahan arranged for her daughter Ladli to marry Jahangir&#x27;s youngest son, Shahryar. This wedding ensured that one way or another, the influence of Nur Jahan&#x27;s family would extend over the Mughal Empire for at least another generation.

===Administration of the Mughal Empire===
Nur Jahan was fond of hunting and often went on hunting tours with her husband and was known for her boldness in hunting ferocious tigers. She is reported to have slain four tigers with six bullets during one hunt. According to Sir Syed Ahmad Khan this feat, inspired a poet to declaim a spontaneous couplet in her honor:
Nur Jahan&#x27;s administrative skills proved invaluable during her regency as she defended the Empire&#x27;s borders in her husband&#x27;s absence and navigated family feuds, rebel uprisings, and a war of succession brought on by the failure of Jahangir to name an heir before he died on 28 October 1627.

In 1626, Emperor Jahangir was captured by rebels while on his way to Kashmir. The rebel leader Mahabat Khan had hoped to stage a coup against Jahangir. Riding into battle atop a war elephant, Nur Jahan intervened herself to get her husband released. She ordered the ministers to organize an attack on the enemy in order to rescue the Emperor; she would lead one of the units by administering commands from on top of a war elephant. During the battle Nur Jahan&#x27;s mount was hit and the soldiers of the imperial army fell at her feet. Realizing her plan had failed Nur Jahan surrendered to Mahabat Khan and was placed in captivity with her husband. Unfortunately for the rebels, Mahabat Khan failed to recognize the creativity and intellect of Nur Jahan as she soon was able to organize an escape and raise an army right under his very nose. Shortly after being rescued, Jahangir died on 28 October 1627.

===Quest for retention of Power===
In 1620, Nur Jahan, in order to secure her power in the Mughal court after the decline of her husband, Jahangir&#x27;s health, offered the marriage proposal of her daughter to the charismatic Khusrau Mirza with the affirmation of bringing him back to power. He was the first choice of Nur Jahan for the marriage of her daughter, Ladli Begum as he was the favorite of common people who desperately wanted to see him on the throne and was highly backed by the revered people of the Mughal Court owing to his exceptional capabilities and talent. However, the Prince in an effort to uphold the fidelity to his chief wife refused the marriage proposal though his wife begged him to accept the proposal and subsequently, this proposal was passed on to Prince Khurram upon whose refusal it was finally passed to and accepted by Shahryar Mirza.

Tensions between Nur Jahan and Jahangir&#x27;s third son, the crowned Prince Khurram and future Shah Jahan, had been uneasy from the start. Prince Khurram resented the influence Nur Jahan held over his father and was angered at having to play second fiddle to her favourite Shahryar, his half-brother and her son-in-law. When the Persians besieged Kandahar, Nur Jahan was at the helm of the affairs. She corresponded with Kösem Sultan, the most powerful Valide Sultan and regent of the Ottoman Empire. Nur Jahan attempted, with the support of the Ottomans and the Uzbeks, to form a coalition against the Safavids. However, her efforts did not succeed. She ordered Prince Khurram to march for Kandahar, but he refused. As a result of Prince Khurram&#x27;s refusal to obey Nur Jahan&#x27;s orders, Kandahar was lost to the Persians after a forty-five-day siege. Prince Khurram feared that in his absence Nur Jahan would attempt to poison his father against him and convince Jahangir to name Shahryar the heir in his place. This fear brought Prince Khurram to rebel against his father rather than fight against the Persians. In 1622 Prince Khurram raised an army and marched against his father and Nur Jahan. The rebellion was quelled by Jahangir&#x27;s forces and the prince was forced to surrender unconditionally. Although he was forgiven for his errors in 1626, tensions between Nur Jahan and her stepson would continue to grow underneath the surface.

Jahangir died on 28 October 1627 and his death sparked a war of succession between his remaining sons, Prince Khurram who was proclaimed as Shah Jahan by Jahangir and Prince Shahryar who was backed by Nur Jahan being her son-in-law. Jahangir&#x27;s eldest son Khusrau had rebelled against the Emperor, was partially blinded as a result and was later killed by Prince Khurram during an uprising in Deccan. Jahangir&#x27;s second son, Parviz, was weak and addicted to alcohol. Afraid to lose her powers and influence in the Mughal court if Shah Jahan would succeed her husband, she backed her son-in-law, Shahryar Mirza, who she believed could be easily manipulated thus retaining influence in the Mughal court. She wished for her daughter, Ladli Begum, to become Empress after her. During the first half of the war it appeared as though Shahryar and Nur Jahan might turn out to be the victors; however, the two were thwarted by Nur Jahan&#x27;s brother, Asaf Khan. Asaf Khan, who was also the father of Mumtaz Mahal, sided with Shah Jahan. While Asaf Khan forced Nur Jahan into confinement, Shah Jahan defeated Shahryar&#x27;s troops and ordered his execution. In 1628, Shah Jahan became the new Mughal emperor.

==Later years and death (1628–1645)==

Nur Jahan was put under house arrest by her brother on the orders of new Emperor Shah Jahan and spent the remainder of her life confined in Lahore with her young widowed daughter, Ladli Begum, and her granddaughter. The three of them lived a simple and austere life.

She was granted an annual amount of 2 lakhs rupees by Shah Jahan. During this period she oversaw the completion of her father&#x27;s mausoleum in Agra, which she started in 1622 and is now known as Itmad-ud-daulah&#x27;s tomb. The tomb served as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, unarguably the zenith of Mughal architecture, the construction of which began in 1632 and which Nur Jahan must have heard about before she died. Nur Jahan died on 17 December 1645 at age 68. She is buried at her tomb in Shahdara Bagh in Lahore, which she had built herself. Upon her tomb is inscribed the epitaph &quot;On the grave of this poor stranger, let there be neither lamp nor rose. Let neither butterfly’s wing burn nor nightingale sing&quot;. Her brother Asaf Khan&#x27;s tomb is also located nearby. Her daughter, Ladli Begum was buried beside her in her mausoleum after her death.

==Patron of the arts and architecture==
According to the Dutch traveller Pelaert her patronage of architecture was extensive, as he notes, &quot;She erects very expensive buildings in all directions- &quot;sarais&quot;, or halting places for travellers and merchants, and pleasure gardens and palaces such that no one has seen before&quot; (Pelsaert, pp 50). In 1620, Nur Jahan commissioned a large &quot;sarai&quot; in Jalandhar district twenty-five miles southeast of Sultanpur. It was such an important &quot;sarai&quot; that, according to Shujauddin, &quot;&#x27;Serai Noor Mahal&#x27; in local idiom meant some spacious and important edifice.&quot;

=== Tomb of I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah ===
I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah died in January 1622, and his tomb has been generally attributed to Nur Jahan. The tomb took six years to finish (1622-1628), and was built at an enormous cost. It was built in I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah&#x27;s own garden, on the eastern bank of the Yamuna across from Agra. The building is square measuring sixty nine feet on each side, with four octagonal towers rising up one at each corner. The central Vault inside the tomb contain the cenotaphs of I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah and his wife, Nur Jahan&#x27;s mother Asmat Begum. The walls in the central chamber are decorated with paintings set in deep niches. According to Vincent Smith the pietra dura of Itimadadudddaula&#x27;s tomb was one of the earliest true examples of the technique in India. Nur Jahan also built the Pattar Masjid at Srinagar, and her own tomb at Lahore.

=== Textiles ===
According to legend, Nur Jahan is purported to have made contributions to almost every type of fine and practical art. In many cases the attributions can be traced back to Khafi Khan, who according to Ellison Banks Findly, &quot;seems to have been in the business of re-creating Nur Jahan&#x27;s talents and accomplishments beyond all realistic possibility.&quot;

Nur Jahan was very creative and had a good fashion sense, and she is credited for many textile materials and dresses like nurmahali dress and fine cloths like Panchtoliya &quot;badla&quot; (silver-threaded brocade), &quot;kinari&quot; (silver-threaded lace), etc. Nur Jahan is also credited with popularizing &quot;farsh-i-chandani&quot;&quot;,&quot; a style of sandalwood colored carpeting&quot;.&quot;

She is best known for the films &quot;Phone&quot; (2002), &quot;Sex Is Zero&quot; (2002), &quot;Miracle on 1st Street&quot; (2007), &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; (2009), &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; (2009), and &quot;Pawn&quot; (2020), as well as the television series &quot;Damo&quot; (2003), &quot;Something Happened in Bali&quot; (2004), &quot;Hwang Jini&quot; (2006), &quot;Secret Garden&quot; (2010–2011), &quot;The King 2 Hearts&quot; (2012), and &quot;Empress Ki&quot; (2013–2014).

She is one of South Korea&#x27;s most sought after and critically acclaimed actresses, particularly known for her versatility in pulling off roles in various genres such as action, comedy, horror, drama, sports and medical.

==Early life and education==
Jeon Hae-rim was scouted by an agency when she was a senior high school student. The actress stated, &quot;Ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of becoming an actress. When I was a senior in high school, an agency contacted me after seeing my picture at a photography studio.&quot; She later graduated with a degree in Bachelor of Film and Television (BFTV) from Dankook University. In 2012, the actress revealed that she had failed over 100 auditions before her debut, &quot;I passed my college entrance and written exams and was accepted to the department of theater and film. Before my debut, I auditioned for 100 or so projects but didn&#x27;t get the roles.&quot;

Jeon candidly revealed that she adopted &quot;Ha Ji-won&quot; as her stage name as a favor for her previous manager as it was the name of his first love. &quot;When I was about to debut, the first love of my manager&#x27;s name was Ha Ji-won. I think he wanted to at least use the name of his love that was not fulfilled. The first time I heard the name Ha Ji-won, I thought it was pretty and also bold.&quot;

==Career==
===1996–2001: Beginnings===
Ha Ji-won made her TV debut in the 1996 teen drama, &quot;New Generation Report: Adults Don&#x27;t Understand Us&quot;.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 &quot;Seedrache&quot; (Sea Dragon) was a trimotor flying boat designed and built by the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss. It served as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s primary seaborne long-range maritime patrol and naval reconnaissance aircraft operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the Second World War.

The BV 138 was a pre-war design by Dr Richard Vogt, originally developed under the company name of Hamburger Flugzeugbau, thus it was initially designated &quot;Ha 138&quot; instead. It had an uncommon appearance due to its combination of unusual design features, such as its twin boom tail unit, short hull, and trimotor engine configuration. In reference to the side-view shape of its fuselage, the aircraft was often referred to via the nickname &quot;Der Fliegende Holzschuh&quot; (&quot;Flying Clog&quot;,). Originally designed to be powered using two engines, the trimotor configuration was adopted prior to flight testing due to engine difficulties. Development would be protracted due to multiple redesigns being enacted.

Shortly after the maiden flight of the first prototype (D-ARAK) on 15 July 1937, identified instabilities necessitated a redesign of the hull and tail booms to improve both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic properties. The first production-standard aircraft, designated &quot;BV 138A-1&quot;, performed its first flight during April 1940, by which point Germany was at war with multiple neighbouring nations. By December 1940, it has been introduced as a military naval reconnaissance aircraft by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Despite concerns as to its structural strength, which was improved over time, it was adapted into various roles, including as a radar-equipped anti-shipping aircraft, an austere troop transport, and as an airborne aerial countermeasure to naval mines. The definitive &quot;BV 138C-1&quot; was introduced to service during March 1941. A total of 297 BV 138s were built between 1938 and 1943.

==Development==
During the early 1930s, the Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg was suffering financial hardship due to a prolonged downturn in orders amid the Great Depression affecting global demand; company officials opted to diversify via the creation of a new subsidiary company, Hamburger Flugzeugbau, which specialised in the design and manufacture aircraft. The BV 138, which was originally designated as the &quot;Ha 138&quot;, originated out of the new company&#x27;s interest in creating its first flying boat; the endeavour was considered a natural fit for the firm, being owned by a shipbuilding company meant that many staff already had good knowledge of the maritime environment and suitable construction practices thereof, while the company&#x27;s main complex was sited on the Elbe, permitting direct access to a large body of water.

Design studies into various configuration were performed; one, referred to as &quot;P.12&quot;, was selected for further development as a long range reconnaissance aircraft. In terms of its general configuration, it had a relatively short hull, a high-mounted wing that incorporated not only a pair of engines but also floats, and twin boom tail unit. During early 1935, a mock-up of the design was completed; shortly thereafter, an initial order calling for the construction of three prototypes was placed. Originally, each of these prototypes was powered by a different pair of engines, each to be capable of providing around 1,000hp; however, due to engine difficulties, the aircraft was redesigned into a trimotor with the new third engine being positioned above the centre of the wing. In this guise, the aircraft was powered by an arrangement of three Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, each capable of 650hp.

This stage of development was protracted, in part due to the need to address the original engine difficulties with an extensive redesign. On 15 July 1937, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. It differed from subsequent aircraft in several ways, having a unique hull design. Several changes were made, particularly in the area of the vertical tail surfaces and the hull, on the second prototype after flight testing revealed both hydrodynamic and aerodynamic instability. A longer and reshaped hull was adopted along with stronger tail booms. A total of five pre-production aircraft, which were capable of carrying multiple defensive machine guns, were completed during the late 1930s.

During April 1940, the first production-standard aircraft, designated &quot;BV 138A-1&quot;, performed its first flight; shortly thereafter, it was rapidly introduced into &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service in response to pressing wartime demands. In June 1940, quantity deliveries commenced to KüFlGr 506 and 906. In light of criticism that structural strengthening was required, the BV 138A-1 had a relatively short production run, being replaced by the &quot;BV 138B-1&quot; towards the end of 1940. Improvements included the adoption of the more powerful Jumo 205D diesel engine and armament changes.

The strength of the structure was only fully addressed via the introduction of the improved &quot;BV 138C-1&quot; in March 1941; this model became the definitive version of the aircraft. To address vibration-related concerns on the earlier models, the central engine of the BV 138C-1 drove a four-bladed propeller, while the other two engines were fitted with broader three-bladed counterparts; the central engine&#x27;s radiator arrangement was also revised.

==Design==

The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 is a military trimotor flying boat. It had a relatively compact hull which, with its hydrodynamic step beneath and flat sides, earned it the nickname, &quot;Fliegender Holzschuh&quot; (the flying clog). The booms of the twin tail unit, much like the smaller Focke-Wulf Fw 189 twin-engined reconnaissance monoplane, extended horizontally from the rear of the outer engine nacelles. For hydrodynamic reasons, the hull featured a distinct &quot;turn-down&quot;, or &quot;beak&quot; at the stern. While the first prototype had featured a gull wing, it was quickly determined that this wing could not generate sufficient lift, so the concept was abandoned on the second prototype. The airplanes had also a hardpoint for catapult launches from seaplane tenders.
It was powered by a total of three piston engines. The central engine was mounted above the fuselage while the wing engines were lower. The pre-production prototypes and the &quot;BV 138A-01&quot; to &quot;BV 138A-06&quot;, were powered by various makes of engines ranging from 485 to 746 kW (650–1,000 hp). The first standardized version, &quot;BV 138B-1&quot;, was powered by three 880 PS (868 hp, 647 kW) Junkers Jumo 205D two-stroke, opposed-piston aircraft diesel engines. The engine cowlings also had an atypical appearance. Due to the unique nature of the vertical orientation of the six-cylinder opposed-piston engines, they resembled the cowlings of 4 or 6-cylinder inverted inline engines found on smaller civil and utility aircraft. The choice for diesel engines made it possible to refuel at sea from U-boats, who also used diesel engines. When refuelling at sea, the airplane had to be fitted with a fuel filter as marine diesel fuel contained some condensation.

There were three gun positions on the aircraft, including an enclosed powered gun turret armed with a single MG 151/20 autocannon on the bow. Due to the fields of fire were obstructed by the tail and its the horizontal stabilizer, the defensive gun positions on the stern comprised one gun position lower on the fuselage and a second one higher up, just aft of the central engine. The gun position behind the central engine, which could see over the horizontal stabilizer, was a fully open Scarff ring-like emplacement which could mount a 7.92 mm MG 15 machine gun, but most aircraft mounted a 13 mm MG 131 heavy machine gun. The lower gun position at the rear fuselage sighted below the horizontal stabilizer. It too was left open and equipped with a machine gun on early aircraft, however, most later-built aircraft mounted an enclosed powered turret similar to the one on the bow.

==Operational history==

During the invasion of Norway in April 1940, two of the pre-production aircraft were pressed into service as troop transports. By December of that year, the BV 138 had been declared operational in the long-range reconnaissance role. The first unit to be equipped with the type being based in Western France. In addition to its use in the maritime reconnaissance role, several aircraft were specially adapted to sweep naval mines; designated &quot;BV 138MS&quot;, this role necessitated the deletion of all conventional armaments and the installation of a large (roughly diameter) dural hoop mounted horizontally under the wings, powered by an auxiliary motor generating an electric field which detonated magnetic mines. Early built aircraft often had issued related to insufficient structural strength.

In March 1941, the most successful variant of the aircraft, designated &quot;BV 138C-1&quot;, entered &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service. For naval reconnaissance, some aircraft carried FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; low-UHF band maritime search radar sets; this enabled the type to be effectively used to conduct anti-shipping missions. Dependent upon the mission role and equipment fitted, the crew could comprise as many as six personnel.

Some BV 138s served with the specialist KG200, where they would often carry up to 10 fully armed infantry troops in place of a bombload.

In preparation of a repeat of Operation Wunderland in 1943, the U-boat &quot;U-255&quot; was sent to the East coast of Novaja Zemlya where it teamed up with a BV 138. The &quot;U-255&quot; refuelled the BV 138 four times for reconnaissance flights over the Kara Sea, up to the Vilkitsky Strait. The BV 138 could not find any shipping however, that would make a mission for the German cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; worthwhile, so the operation was cancelled.

The BV 138 was tested with the Walter HWK 109-500 &quot;Starthilfe&quot; RATO jettisonable rocket pod, used in pairs, for shorter takeoff performance. All rocket units were jettisoned after use; fitted with parachutes, they could be recovered after landing.

BV 138C-1
: From this version on, the central motor was fitted with a four-blade propeller, while the wing engines kept a three-blade propeller, but the blades were reinforced and wider ; 227 built.
BV 138 MS
: &quot;Minensuch&quot; (mine-search) minesweeping version; all MS variants were converted from existing aircraft and had their armament removed; the turrets and gun positions were covered. They carried magnetic field-generating degaussing equipment, which included a hoop antenna with a diameter equal to the length of the fuselage, which encircled the hull and wings

Many German aircraft had Umbau sets available for modifications in the field. For the BV 138 there was an Umbau set for adding a bomb rack under the port wing. With such an Umbau the bomb payload could be doubled. As per German nomenclature, such aircraft held a suffix &#x27;/U&#x27;. A BV 138 C-1 aircraft with the Umbau modification would become BV 138 C-1/U1.

==Surviving aircraft==

No complete BV 138s remain in existence. However, the wreck of one aircraft, sunk after the war in a British air show, was raised from the seabed of the Øresund Sound in 2000, and is on display at the Danish Technical Museum in Helsingør.
In 2012, the wreck of a BV 138 was discovered in Lake Siutghiol at a depth of 5 m by two divers, and initially thought to be a Savoia-Marchetti S.55. The wreck, together with that of a He 114 also discovered there, were recovered by Romanian Navy divers in October of the same year. The wrecks are stored at the National Museum of the Romanian Navy in Constanța.

In June 2013, a vessel from the Norwegian Geological Survey filmed a Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 at a depth of 35 m in Porsangerfjorden, Norway, not far from the WWII German seaplane harbour in Indre Billefjord.

Another wreckage of a BV 138 was identified by the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority on the seabed near Svalbard in 2022.

<text>Tafsir ( ; ) refers to an exegesis, or commentary, of the Quran. An author of a &quot;tafsir&quot; is a (; plural: ). A Quranic &quot;tafsir&quot; attempts to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God&#x27;s will in Islam.

Principally, a &quot;tafsir&quot; deals with the issues of linguistics, jurisprudence, and theology. In terms of perspective and approach, &quot;tafsir&quot; can be broadly divided into two main categories, namely &quot;tafsir bi-al-ma&#x27;thur&quot; (lit. received tafsir), which is transmitted from the early days of Islam through the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions, and &quot;tafsir bi-al-ra&#x27;y&quot; (lit. &quot;tafsir&quot; by opinion), which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking.

There are different characteristics and traditions for each of the &quot;tafsirs&quot; representing respective schools and doctrines, such as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam, and Sufism. There are also general distinctions between classic &quot;tafsirs&quot; compiled by authoritative figures of Muslim scholarship during the formative ages of Islam, and modern &quot;tafsir&quot; which seeks to address a wider audience, including the common people.

== Etymology ==
The word &#x27; is derived from the three-letter Arabic verbal root of &quot;F-S-R&quot; (&#x27;, &#x27;interpreted&#x27;). In its literal meaning, the word refers to interpreting, explaining, expounding, or disclosing. In Islamic contexts, it is defined as understanding and uncovering God&#x27;s will which has been conveyed by the Quranic text, by means of the Arabic language and one&#x27;s own knowledge.

== Number of commentaries ==

According to American scholar Samuel Ross, there are 2,700 Qur’an commentaries extant in manuscript form, and 300 commentaries have been published. Considering that around 96% of the Arabic-language manuscripts remain unstudied, Ross argues that &quot;by extrapolation there may be thousands of additional commentaries still waiting to be discovered.&quot;

== History ==
=== Formative period ===
The first examples of &quot;tafsir&quot; can be traced back to Muhammad, who the Quran was revealed to. According to Islamic belief, he recited the verses to his companions, usually explaining their meanings to teach them, as it was one of Muhammad&#x27;s responsibilities. Elements of Muhammad&#x27;s explanations including clarifying verses whose intents are not understood, the indication of names, places, times etc. which have not been mentioned in the verse, restriction of meanings which have been given as absolute and reconciliation of expressions which seem contradictory. Scholars debate if Muhammad commented on the whole of the Quran or just portions of it.

After the death of Muhammad, his companions (&quot;sahabah&quot;) undertook the task of interpretation. They used the information received from the prophet and their own understanding. The companions were adept with the language of the Quran, social context of the revelation, the prophet&#x27;s way of thinking, and the norms of the Arabs. This allowed the companions to set the foundation for the Muslim community and a practice of interpreting the Quran. At this stage, &quot;tafsir&quot; was selective and concise regarding its coverage, and only certain words, phrases and verses were explained.

=== Modern period ===
By the time of the next generations ensuing the sahabah, scholars in the age of the successors (&quot;tabi&#x27;in&quot;) started using a wide range of sources for &quot;tafsir&quot;. The whole of the Quran is interpreted, and narrations are separated from &quot;tafsir&quot; into separate books and literature. Grammatical explanations and historical data are preserved within these books; personal opinions are recorded, whether accepted or rejected. During this time, a whole range of schools of &quot;tafsir&quot; came into existence in different scholastic centers, including Mecca, Medina and Iraq. Iraqi schools of &quot;tafsir&quot; came to be known for an approach relied on personal judgment aside from the transmitted reports, and Jewish apocryphal reports were also widely employed. Notable compilers on this age including Sufyan al-Thawri.

Until this age, &quot;tafsir&quot; had been transmitted orally and had not been collected independently in a book, rather, they had been gathered by &quot;muhaddithun&quot; (lit. scholars of hadith) in their hadith books, under the topic of &quot;tafsir&quot;, along with other narrations of Muhammad. This indicates that &quot;tafsir&quot;, in its formative age, used to be a special domain within hadith. Widening of the scope of &quot;tafsir&quot; and emergence of &quot;mufassirun&quot; in the age of the successors lead to the development of an independent discipline of &quot;tafsir&quot;.
== Criteria ==

An author of a &quot;tafsir&quot; is called a &quot;&quot; (; plural: ). Mufassirs are required to master several disciplines such as linguistics, rhetoric, theology and jurisprudence before one can authoritatively interpret the Quran.

The following criteria are in place to ensure a tafsir maintains fidelity. 

# Knowledge of the Quran - The primary criteria is understanding and knowing the Quran. A scholar must be able to refer to other of the Quran to provide an explanation of other parts of the Quran. Intra-textual analysis is essential as it maintains consistency.
# Knowledge of the Sunnah - The Sunnah, or sayings, actions, and approvals of the prophet Muhammad serve as a secondary source for a tafsir. The prophet&#x27;s explanations of the Quran serve as an authoritative weight and scholars agree that interpretations should not contradict the Sunnah.
# Understanding of the Arabic language - proficiency in the Arabic language rhetoric (Ilm-ulm-Balagha) is required to understand the syntax and grammar of the Quran. Scholars must know the nuances, expressions, and figurative language which appears in the Quran. The science of understanding the language is called Ilm-ul-Balagha (science of rhetoric) and 
# Knowledge of context (Asbab al-Nuzul) - a scholar must understand the reasons and circumstances (asbab al-nuzul) of a revelation in order to interpret the text correctly. If a verse is isolated without knowing the context, it can be misinterpreted.
# Consistency with early Tafsir (Tafsir al-Mathur) - the prophet&#x27;s companions (sahaba) and successors (tabi&#x27;un) are considered reliable sources of tafsir. Their interpretations are considered higher authority.
# Application of reason (Tasfir bi&#x27;l-Ra&#x27;y) - along with transmitted sources, scholars also can use reason to interpret the Quran. The reason applied must stay within Islamic principles. Personal opinion (ra&#x27;y) must be kept within bounds. Any reason applied must be supported by other Islamic texts or have scholarly consensus. 
# Abrogation (Naskh) - scholars must be able to identify and account for abrogated (naskh) verses to avoid misunderstanding earlier rulings. A failure to do this will cause misinterpreting and the misapplication of Islamic law. 
# Knowledge of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) - scholars must have deep understanding of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) and the methodology of legal derivation. Without this, a scholar may misinterpret legal rulings in the Quran and lead to a flawed conclusion. 
#Avoiding interpretations that contradict Islamic beliefs - a tafsir must not contradict established Islamic theology (aqeedah) as it will be considered invalid. Scholars must ensure their exegesis upholds the essentials of Islamic theology and philosophy, collectively known as &quot;Ilm al-Aqa&#x27;id&quot; and &quot;Ilm al-Kalam&quot;.

==Principles==
There are several frames of reference in which &quot;tafsir&quot; can be categorized. The main issue of framing constitutes its methodology. &quot;Tafsir&quot; can be broadly divided into two categories from the viewpoint of methodology employed in order to approach the interpretation. These categories are called &quot;tafsīr bi&#x27;l-ma&#x27;thūr&quot; (, also known as &quot;tafsīr bi&#x27;r-riwāyah&quot; ()) and &quot;tafsīr bi&#x27;r-ra&#x27;y&quot; (, also known as &quot;tafsīr bi&#x27;d-dirayah&quot; ).

===&quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;thur&quot; (or &quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;r-Riwayah&quot;)===
&quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;l-ma&#x27;thur&quot;, or commonly known as &quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;r-riwāyah&quot;, is the method of commenting on the Quran using traditional sources. &quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;r-riwāyah&quot; connotes &quot;tafsir&quot; using another portion of the Quran, or sayings of Muhammad, or saying of his companions. This classical &quot;tafsir&quot; method is agreed upon by all scholars, and is the most used method throughout history, partly because other methods have been criticized. Criticism of non-riwaya method is mostly based on two grounds; for one, Muhammad has condemned those who interpret the Quran from their own point of view, and for two, most companions of Muhammad have refrained from presenting their own ideas. Some important examples of &quot;tafsir bi&#x27;r-riwāyah&quot; are &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Bayān&quot; by al-Tabari and &quot;Tafseer al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓeem&quot; by ibn Kathir. The sources used for &quot;tafsir bi&#x27;r-riwāyah&quot; can be ordered by the rank of authority, as the Quran, hadiths, the reports by the &quot;sahabah&quot; and &quot;tabi&#x27;iun&quot;, classical Arabic literature, and Isra&#x27;iliyat.
The most authoritative source of the interpretation is the Quran itself. Interpretation of the Quran employing other Quranic reference is very common because of the close interrelatedness of the verses of the Quran with one another. The Quranic verses explain and interpret one another, which leads many to believe that it has the highest level of authenticity. Many verses or words in the Quran are explained or further clarified in other verses of the Quran. One example of the hadith which extensively employs this source of method is &quot;Al-Mizan fi Tafsir al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i. The authoritative source of method second to the Quran is Hadith, by using narratives of Muhammad to interpret the Quran. In this approach the most important external aids used are the collected oral traditions upon which Muslim scholars based Islamic history and law. Authority of this method is considered established by the statement made in the Quran that Muhammad is responsible for explanation and guidance. While some narratives are of revelation origin, others can be the result of reasonings made by Muhammad. One important aspect of these narratives is their origin. Narratives used for &quot;tafsir&quot;, and in general, must be of authentic origin (&quot;sahih&quot;). Narratives of such origin are considered requisite for &quot;tafsir&quot;.

Other source of the interpretation includes the accounts of &quot;Ṣaḥābah&quot;, companions of Muhammad, or &quot;tabi‘un&quot;, the generation after sahabah, and &quot;Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in&quot;, the generation after tabi&#x27;un. Their authority is based on an account in hadith &quot;Sahih Bukhari&quot;, which accordingly, Muhammad said: The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them (Tābi‘un), and then those coming after (the third generation). If nothing is found in the Quran or the Hadīth, the commentator has recourse to what the Ṣaḥābah reported about various verses. These are generally considered above personal opinion, because these people grew up with everyday interaction with Muhammad, and had often asked about the meanings of verses or circumstances of their revelation; and they were very knowledgeable in both Arabic literature and Islamic thought. Another non-scripture based source of the interpretation is classical Arabic literature. Classical Arabic poetry and the text of the Quran are two resources which can be used as foundational reference in ascertaining the meaning and signification of the remaining literal and figurative diction of the Quran and its style of expression. Using Arabic poetry for defining words is a long used practice, and very few scholars have not used this source. Less authoritative source of the interpretation is &quot;Isra&#x27;iliyat&quot;, which is the body of narratives originating from Judeo-Christian traditions, rather than from other well-accepted sources. The Isra&#x27;iliyat are mostly non-biblical explanatory stories and traditions (Hebrew: &quot;midrashim&quot;) giving extra information or interpretation about events or individuals recorded in the Hebrew scriptures. Scholars starting with the Sahabah have studied narrative accounts of other Abrahamic religions to further explain and clarify verses, especially parables, in the Quran. While some may be accurate, these narratives are not subject to hadith authenticity criteria, and are generally not favored for use.

===&quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;r-Ra&#x27;y&quot; (or &quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;d-dirayah&quot;)===
&quot;Tafsir bi&#x27;r-ra&#x27;y&quot;, or commonly known as &quot;tafsir bi-al-diraya&quot;, is the method of using one&#x27;s independent rational reasoning and mind (&quot;ijtihad&quot;) to form an opinion-oriented interpretation. The most distinctive feature of &quot;tafsir bi-al-diraya&quot; is the inclusion of the opinions of the commentator, thus forming the more objective view on Quranic verses. The relative paucity of traditional sources is also a practical reason why the scope of the methodology is augmented. This is considered sanctioned by the Quran itself, as written in the surah Sad verse 29: This method is not interpretation by mere opinion however, but rather opinions must be based on the main sources. Performing Quranic interpretation using solely one&#x27;s own opinion is believed to be prohibited by some Muslims. This is based on an authenticated hadith of Muhammad which states &quot;He who says (something) concerning the Qur&#x27;ân without knowledge, he has taken his seat of fire&quot;. However, this hadith can alternatively be interpreted to refer to the importance of first properly studying and learning the Quran before attempting to teach or preach it to others. Accordingly, the method of independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;) has several qualifications and conditions that need to be satisfied. Due to the nature of orientation toward opinions, this method is rejected by certain scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, and prohibited by Wahhabi Islamic doctrine. Some important examples of such &quot;tafsirs&quot; include &quot;Anwar al-Tanzil&quot; by al-Baydawi and &quot;Mafatih al-Ghayb&quot; by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Some parameters used by these scholars including linguistic resources, historical sources, methodological concepts such as &quot;maqasid&quot; or socio-cultural environment taken into consideration.

In terms of linguistic resources, literary elements of the Arabic language, including morphology, eloquence, syntax are an integral part of &quot;tafsir&quot;, as they constitute the basis of understanding and interpretation. Arabic has a systematic way of shaping words so one can know the meaning by knowing the root and the form the word was coined from. If any word can be given a meaning that is compatible with the rules of grammar, Quranic text can be interpreted that way. In terms of historical resources, scholars may choose to interpret verses according to external factors, including their historical context and their place of revelation. Historical context (&quot;Asbab al-nuzul&quot;) is particularly important to interpret verses according to how the Quran was revealed, when and under which circumstances, and much commentary was dedicated to history. The early &quot;tafsirs&quot; are considered to be some of the best sources for Islamic history. Classification of the place of revelation, whether it was revealed in Mecca or Medina, is important as well. This is because in general Meccan verses tend to have an &quot;iman&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;faith&quot;) nature that includes believing in Allah, Muhammad, and the day of judgment, whether it be theological foundations or basic faith principles. On the other hand, Medinan verses constitute legislation, social obligations, and constitution of a state.

On the more conceptual level, the idea of &quot;maqasid&quot; (goals or purpose) can be taken into account. Verses may be interpreted to preserve the general goals of shariah, which may be considered simply as bringing happiness to a person in this life and the hereafter. That way, any interpretation that threatens to compromise the preservation of religion, life, lineage, intellect or property may be discarded or ruled otherwise in order to secure these goals. Further, the socio-cultural environment may also taken into consideration. This includes understanding and interpreting the Quran while taking into account the cultural and social environment to which it has been revealed; or according to the scholars&#x27; own time. Often than not, the distinction can be made between the &quot;&#x27;amm&quot; (general) verses that aimed at universal conditions for Muslims, and &quot;khass&quot; (specific) verses that applied to specific conditions, time or need. This is considered an integral part of analyzing the universality of the Quran. Scholars usually do not favor to confine verses to a single time interval, but rather interpret according to the needs of their time.

== Sects ==
Islamic theology is divided into myriad of schools and branches, and each of the schools&#x27; comments on the Quran with their own point of view.

=== Sunni ===

The time of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari marks the classical period, which encompassed important Sunni &quot;tafsirs&quot;, such as &quot;Tafsir al-Thalabi&quot;, &quot;Tafsir of Al-Zamakhshari&quot; and &quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot;. &quot;Tafsir al-Tabari&quot; is one of the most important &quot;tafsir&quot; works in Sunni Islam. This work provides exegetical material for the whole Quran, also contains conflicting information, which Tabari tries either to harmonize or argues in support of the one he feels more correct. Further he includes different readings, which according to him, both might be correct and gives his own opinion after each argumentation. Both linguistical and theological subjects are discussed throughout his work.

The period of Ibn Taimiyya is sometimes seen as a transition point between the Classical and post-Classical exegesis, due to his unique hermeneutic method. &quot;Tafsirs&quot; are geneaological, they rely on the core of previous &quot;tafsirs&quot;. Ibn Taimiyya challenged this core tradition by asserting that the Quran should only be interpreted by the Quran alone or the &quot;sunnah&quot;. Ibn Kathir was the first who tried to use the hermeneutic method of his teacher ibn Taimiyya. By that, it is much more selective and critical compared to earlier Quranic exegesis and features only a few personal remarks. Al-Suyuti&#x27;s (1445–1505) tafsir (&quot;Al-Dur al-Manthur&quot;) uses a similar hermeneutic. Unlike ibn Kathir, his work is one of a few completely devoid of any personal comments. Yet, following the approach of ibn Taimiyya, he is selective about the inclusion of hadiths. However, contrarily to ibn Taimiyya and ibn Kathir, his tafsir is without any personal comment. Further, despite using a similar methodology to ibn Taimiyya and ibn Kathir, he includes a wider range of &quot;hadiths&quot;. 

Not earlier than the mid-nineteenth century, the modern period of &quot;tafsir&quot; started. The modern approach is marked by a generally critical attitude towards much of the intellectual heritage of Islam, a declared intention to imitate the &quot;salaf&quot;, and an emphasis on the unity of believers and a unified understanding of Islam. Other features may include, attempts to proof the rationality of the Quranic worldview, compatibility with modern sciences, liberalism, literary criticism, and making the message of the Quran emotional relevant for the believer. Although such modern approaches became a standard only late, their ideas were much earlier present in the Islamicate world. Kadizadeli (&quot;Qādīzādali&quot;), a seventeenth-century puritanical reformist religious movement in the Ottoman Empire, shared a lot of ideas with modern Islamic interpretations. Al-Shawkānī (1759–1834) has been understood retroperspective by many Muslim scholars as a &quot;salafi&quot;.

A rationalistic approach, as proposed by Syed Ahmad Khan and Muhammad Abduh attempts to prove that the Quran and modern sciences do not contradict each other. This is close to the &quot;tafsir &#x27;ilmi&quot; (scientific interpretation of the Quran), which claims that the Quran miraculously predicted scientific discoveries. Although this trend has existed prior to the modern era, its popularity is new. Nontheless, this approach still faces a lot of opposition among Muslims. Yet another approach, represented by scholars such as Amin al-Khuli, aims to decodifies the Quran to understand its impact on the first audience. Accordingly, the focus is not about historical or scientific truths, but about conveying a message through the means of the Quran. Similarly, according to yet another trend, the Quran should not only be understood as for the first Muslims, but also executed as the first Muslims did. Famous adherences to this approach include Sayyid Qutb and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi. This approach often goes in hand with an attempt to establish a state based on an idealized Muslim society.

Among Salafis, the hermeneutics of ibn Taimiyya prevail. In the English language, an abridged version of &quot;Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm&quot; (&quot;Tafsir Ibn Kathir&quot;), under the editorship of Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman, gained widespread popularity, probably due to its salafistic approach but also a lack of alternative translations of traditional &quot;tafsirs&quot;. Similarly, a translation of Tabari&#x27;s exegetical work has been published only as an abridged version, by Pierre Godé appeared in 1983.

=== Shi&#x27;ite ===
Tafsirs by Shia Muslims similarly deals with the issues concerned by Sunnis, and employs similar methodology as well, except for the adherence toward certain beliefs and creeds Shiism espouses. Distinctive features of Shia &quot;tafsirs&quot; include expounding of the concept of imamate, the heavier weight put on verses that considered to be the foundation of successorship to Muhammad within the Prophet&#x27;s family begins with Ali, and the heavier authority put on interpretations attributed to The Twelve Imams. These characteristics result in distinction being made between the esoteric and the exoteric meaning of the Quran, and the esoteric meaning attributed to the imams preferred over the exoteric meaning. Certain Shia &quot;tafsirs&quot; are influenced by Mu&#x27;tazili thoughts as well, specifically on the theological issues. Some of the important examples of Shia &quot;mufassirs&quot; and their &quot;tafsir&quot; are &quot;Al-Tibbyan Fi Tafsir al-Quran&quot; by Shaykh Tusi (460/1067) and &quot;Majma al-Bayan lif&#x27;ulum al-Quran&quot; by Shaykh Tabarsi (d. 548/1153).

On the other hand, &quot;tafsir&quot; by Zaidi school of jurisprudence, which espouses the doctrine closest with Sunnis of all Shia sects, produces &quot;tafsir&quot; resembling Sunni &quot;tafsir&quot; in its quality. Some Zaidi &quot;tafsirs&quot; are considered popular among Sunnis as well as shia.

=== Mu&#x27;tazila ===
The Mu&#x27;tazila tradition of tafsir has received little attention in modern scholarship, owing to several reasons. First, several exegetical works by Mu&#x27;tazila scholars have been studied as books on theology rather than as works of &quot;tafsir&quot;. Secondly, the large Mu&#x27;tazilite &quot;tafsir&quot; &quot;at-Tahdib fi tafsir al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by al-Hakim al-Jishumi has not been edited, and there is no complete copy of it available at any single location, which limits its accessibility to scholars.

=== Sufi ===
It is an interpretation of the Quran which includes attribution of esoteric or mystic meanings to the text by the interpreter. In this respect, its method is different from the conventional exegesis. Esoteric interpretations do not usually contradict the conventional (in this context called exoteric) interpretations; instead, they discuss the inner levels of meaning of the Quran. A &quot;hadith&quot; from Muhammad which states that the Quran has an inner meaning, and that this inner meaning conceals a yet deeper inner meaning, and so on (up to seven levels of meaning), has sometimes been used in support of this view. Islamic opinion imposes strict limitations on esoteric interpretations especially when interior meaning is against exterior one. Esoteric interpretations are found mainly in Sufism and in the sayings (hadiths) of Shi&#x27;a Imams and the teachings of the Isma&#x27;ili sect. But Muhammad and the imams gave importance to its exterior as much as to its interior; they were as much concerned with its revelation as they were with its interpretation. These are generally not independently written, however, they are found in the books of Sufis.

Among the most significant Sunni Sufi tafsirs are:

=== Quranist ===
Quranists merely believe in the Qur&#x27;an and reject other oral traditions. Turkish Islamic theologian Yaşar Nuri Öztürk denounced contemporary Islamic practices as altered. He distinguished between what he defined as true Islam and what he saw as customs and traditions introduced in the Umayyad period. In 1992, he published a 760-page, &quot;tafsir&quot;-like exegetical work called &quot;Kur&#x27;an&#x27;daki Islam&quot;. Each chapter, which deals with one surah, is structured around certain verses of the surah, or words occurring in the text, which need to be explained.

Edip Yüksel, Layth Saleh al-Shaiban, and Martha Schulte-Nafeh wrote &quot;Quran: A Reformist Translation,&quot; an English translation and commentary of the Qur&#x27;an. Yüksel is a follower of Rashad Khalifa.

Ghulam Ahmed Perwez wrote &quot;Mafhoom-ul-Quran,&quot; translated into English as &quot;Exposition of the Holy Qur&#x27;an&quot;.

== Methodologies ==

=== Scientific approach ===
According to M. Shamsher Ali, there are around 750 verses in the Quran dealing with natural phenomena and many verses of the Quran ask mankind to study nature, and this has been interpreted to mean an encouragement for scientific inquiry and of the truth. 

Scholars deeply influenced by the natural and social sciences followed the materialists of Europe or the pragmatists. Under the influence of those secular theories, they declared that the religion&#x27;s realities cannot go against scientific knowledge.

Starting in the 1970s and 80s, the idea of presence of scientific evidence in the Quran became popularized as &quot;ijaz&quot; (miracle) literature, also called &quot;Bucailleism&quot;, and began to be distributed through Muslim bookstores and websites. The movement contends that the Quran abounds with &quot;scientific facts&quot; that appeared centuries before their discovery and promotes Islamic creationism. According to author Ziauddin Sardar, the &quot;ijaz&quot; movement has created a &quot;global craze in Muslim societies&quot;, and has developed into an industry that is &quot;widespread and well-funded&quot;. Individuals connected with the movement include Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, who established the Commission on Scientific Signs in the Quran and Sunnah; Zakir Naik, the Indian televangelist; and Adnan Oktar, the Turkish creationist.

Enthusiasts of the movement argue that among the miracles found in the Quran are &quot;everything, from relativity, quantum mechanics, Big Bang theory, black holes and pulsars, genetics, embryology, modern geology, thermodynamics, even the laser and hydrogen fuel cells&quot;. 
Zafar Ishaq Ansari terms the modern trend of claiming the identification of &quot;scientific truths&quot; in the Quran as the &quot;scientific exegesis&quot; of the holy book. In 1983, Keith L. Moore, had a special edition published of his widely used textbook on Embryology (&quot;The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology&quot;), co-authored by Abdul Majeed al-Zindani with Islamic Additions, interspersed pages of &quot;embryology-related Quranic verse and hadith&quot; by al-Zindani into Moore&#x27;s original work. Ali A. Rizvi studying the textbook of Moore and al-Zindani found himself &quot;confused&quot; by &quot;why Moore was so &#x27;astonished by&#x27;&quot; the Quranic references, which Rizvi found &quot;vague&quot;, and insofar as they were specific, preceded by the observations of Aristotle and the &quot;Ayr-veda&quot;, or easily explained by &quot;common sense&quot;.

Critics argue, verses that proponents say explain modern scientific facts, about subjects such as biology, the origin and history of the Earth, and the evolution of human life, contain fallacies and are unscientific. As of 2008, both Muslims and non-Muslims have disputed whether there actually are &quot;scientific miracles&quot; in the Quran. Muslim critics of the movement include Indian Islamic theologian Maulana Ashraf ‘Ali Thanvi, Muslim historian Syed Nomanul Haq, Muzaffar Iqbal, president of Center for Islam and Science in Alberta, Canada, and Egyptian Muslim scholar Khaled Montaser. Taner Edis wrote many Muslims appreciate technology and respect the role that science plays in its creation. As a result, he says there is a great deal of Islamic pseudoscience attempting to reconcile this respect with religious beliefs. This is because, according to Edis, true criticism of the Quran is almost non-existent in the Muslim world. While Christianity is less prone to see its Holy Book as the direct word of God, fewer Muslims will compromise on this idea – causing them to believe that scientific truths must appear in the Quran.

=== Legal approach ===

Legal &quot;tafsir,&quot; or Tafsir al-Ahkam, derives legal rulings and principles from the Quran. Its practice was common in both the classical and modern periods. There is a dispute over the number of verses that contain jurisprudential guidance, with numbers ranging from 5 to 200 being reported. Works of legal tafsir were typically written from the perspectives of the madhhab of their respective authors. For example, &quot;Aḥkam al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by al-Jassas was written according to the Hanafi Madhhab, &quot;Aḥkam al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by Qaḍi Abū Bakr ibn al-&#x27;Arabī and &quot;al-Jaami&#x27; Li&#x27;Aḥkam al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by al-Qurtubi were written according to the Maliki Madhhab, and &quot;Aḥkam al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; by Ilkiya was written according to the Shafi&#x27;i Madhhab. Some also cite &quot;Zad al-Maseer&quot; of ibn al-Jawzi as an example of a legal tafsir according to the Hanbali Madhhab.

=== Linguistic ===
A newer work which incorporates and quotes the work of a multitude of previous scholars and analyzes the relevant Arabic root words (based on all available classic Arabic meanings), and references all relevant passages of the Quran, was done by Abdul Mannan Omar.

=== Comprehensive ===
Some works included numerous methodologies e.g. the very detailed tafsirs of Imam Razi&#x27;s &quot;Tafsir Kabir&quot; in Arabic and Mufti Ahmad Yar Khan Naeemi&#x27;s &quot;Tafsir Naeemi&quot; in Urdu.

<text>The Law Society of Ontario (LSO; ) is the law society responsible for the self-regulation of lawyers and paralegals in the Canadian province of Ontario. Founded in 1797 as the Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC; ), its name was changed by statute in 2018.

==History==
The Law Society of Upper Canada was established in 1797 to regulate the legal profession in the British colony of Upper Canada and is the oldest self-governing body in North America. The Society governed the legal profession in the coterminous Canada West from 1841 to 1867, and in Ontario since Confederation in 1867.

The Law Society was authorized, although not created, by the &quot;Act for the better regulating of the practice of the law&quot;, a 1797 statute. Section 1 of the act simply authorized those at the time &quot;admitted in the law and practising at the bar&quot; in the province to form themselves into a &quot;society&quot;. The 1797 statute allowed the Law Society to impose requirements for admission to the bar of Upper Canada and to test applicants against these standards.

That statute made no express provisions for any other people to become members of the Law Society: but the power to admit others than the existing practitioners was considered to be implied by section 5. Section 5 provided that &quot;no person other than the present practitioners ... shall be permitted to practise at the bar of any of His Majesty&#x27;s courts in this province, unless such person shall have been previously entered of and admitted into the said society as a student of the laws ... and shall have been duly called and admitted to the practice of the law as a barrister, according to the constitutions and establishment thereof&quot;. Incorporation of the Society occurred in 1822.

On July 17, 1797, at Wilson&#x27;s Hotel in Newark, Ontario (now Niagara-on-the-Lake), a group of lawyers, including John White, Robert Isaac Dey Gray, and Bartholomew Crannell Beardsley, inaugurated the Law Society pursuant to the 1797 act.

The Law Society&#x27;s first home was at Wilson&#x27;s Hotel, then from 1799 to 1832 at various temporary locations at York (Toronto) until Osgoode Hall was built in 1832. The Law Society continued to retain its original name, even though Upper Canada ceased to exist as a political entity in 1841. Throughout the early 1800s, the Law Society imposed increasingly onerous requirements on potential Upper Canadian lawyers, at one point requiring students-at-law to live at Osgoode Hall while they completed their legal studies. Historian Paul Romney argues such licensing requirements enhanced the legal profession&#x27;s &quot;prestige&quot; in the young colony, as compared to its position in other North American colonies or the United States.

The Law Society was reformed by statute in 1970, under the &quot;Law Society Act, 1970&quot;. That statute defined the Society as &quot;a corporation without share capital composed of the Treasurer, the benchers, and other members from time to time&quot;. Many of the reforms in the 1971 act were inspired by the McRuer report, officially the Report of the Royal Commission Inquiry into Civil Rights (1968), a wide-ranging set of law reform recommendations for Ontario developed under the leadership of James Chalmers McRuer.

On October 27, 1994, the Law Society adopted a &quot;role statement&quot; holding that it &quot;exists to govern the legal profession in the public interest&quot; and has the &quot;purpose of advancing the cause of justice&quot;.

The Law Society faced calls to change the name Upper Canada. Benchers voted to drop the name and replace it with a new one. On November 2, 2017, the Society&#x27;s governing body (Convocation) chose &quot;Law Society of Ontario&quot; as the new name. The name change was made official on May 8, 2018, following amendments to the &quot;Law Society Act&quot; as part of the 2018 provincial budget implementation bill.

In 2017, the Law Society enacted a requirement that licensees acknowledge an &quot;obligation to promote equality, diversity and inclusion&quot;, referred to as a &quot;statement of principles&quot;. The requirement was phased in over several months in late 2017. Following a public campaign called &quot;StopSOP&quot;, under which a number of benchers were elected who pledged to repeal the requirement, the requirement was repealed in September 2019. Some StopSOP advocates argued that the measure was an example of compelled speech, while opponents argued that acknowledging equal rights was essential.

== Oversight ==

The Law Society regulates the more than 50,000 lawyers in Ontario. It is responsible for ensuring that lawyers are both ethical and competent. The Society has the power to set standards for admission into the profession. It is empowered to discipline lawyers who violate those standards. Available sanctions range from admonitions to disbarment. It is based in Toronto, at Osgoode Hall.

Beginning in 1970, pursuant to the &quot;Law Society Act, 1970&quot;, the Law Society has required that potential licensees demonstrate &quot;good character&quot;.

=== Paralegals ===
Effective May 1, 2007, as a result of amendments to Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Law Society Act&quot;, the Law Society regulates more than 8,000 paralegal licensees in Ontario. Paralegals are licensed to provide limited legal services, such as providing representation before provincial tribunals.

=== Tribunal decisions ===
The Law Society Tribunal is an independent adjudicative tribunal within the Law Society of Ontario that processes, hears and decides regulatory cases about Ontario lawyers and paralegals. It began operations on March 12, 2014.
Effective November 16, 2020, Malcolm M. Mercer became the chair of the Law Society Tribunal.

== Treasurer ==
The Law Society is headed by a treasurer. The treasurer is elected by the benchers, who comprise &quot;Convocation&quot; – in effect, the Society&#x27;s board of directors, as the Society is an Ontario Corporation without share capital. All lawyer-benchers are elected by the Society&#x27;s members, and eight lay benchers are appointed by the provincial government.

The current Treasurer is Peter Wardle (elected on June 19, 2024), and the current CEO of the Law Society is Diana Miles.

<text>The Companions of the Prophet () were the Muslim disciples and followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who saw or met him during his lifetime. The companions played a major role in Muslim battles, society, hadith narration, and governance during and after the life of Muhammad. The era of the companions began following the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, and ended in 110 AH (728 CE) when the last companion Abu al-Tufayl died. 

Later Islamic scholars accepted their testimony of the words and deeds of Muhammad, the occasions on which the Quran was revealed and other important matters in Islamic history and practice. The testimony of the companions, as it was passed down through trusted chains of narrators (&quot;asānīd&quot;), was the basis of the developing Islamic tradition. From the traditions (&quot;hadith&quot;) of the life of Muhammad and his companions are drawn the Muslim way of life (&quot;sunnah&quot;), the code of conduct (&quot;sharia&quot;) it requires, and Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;).

The two largest Islamic denominations, the Sunni and Shia, take different approaches to weighing the value of the companions&#x27; testimonies, have different &quot;hadith&quot; collections and, as a result, have different views about the ṣaḥābah.

The second generation of Muslims after the ṣaḥāba, born after the death of Muhammad, who knew at least one ṣaḥāba, are called &quot;Tābi&#x27;ūn&quot; (also &quot;the successors&quot;). The third generation of Muslims after the &quot;Tābi&#x27;ūn&quot;, who knew at least one &quot;Tābi&quot;, are called &quot;tābi&#x27; al-tābi&#x27;īn&quot;. The three generations make up the &quot;salaf&quot; of Islam.

== Etymology ==
The term sahaba means &quot;companions&quot; and derives from the verb meaning &quot;accompany&quot;, &quot;keep company with&quot;, &quot;associate with&quot;. &quot;Al-ṣaḥāba&quot; is definite plural; the indefinite singular is masculine (&#x27;), feminine (&#x27;).

== Types ==
In Islam, companions of Muhammad are classified into categories including the Muhajirun who accompanied Muhammad from Mecca to Medina, the Ansar who lived in Medina, and the Badriyyun who fought at the Battle of Badr.

Two important groups among the companions are the Muhajirun &quot;migrants&quot;, those who had faith in Muhammad when he began to preach in Mecca and who departed with him when he was persecuted there, and the Ansar, the people of Medina who welcomed Muhammad and his companions and stood as their protectors.

Lists of prominent companions usually include 50 or 60 names of the people thought to be most closely associated with Muhammad. However, there were clearly many others who had some contact with Muhammad, and many of those names and biographies were recorded in religious reference texts such as ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s early &quot;Book of the Major Classes&quot;. Al-Qurtubi&#x27;s &quot;Istīʻāb fī maʻrifat al-Aṣhāb&quot; (d. 1071 CE) consists of 2770 biographies of male and 381 biographies of female ṣaḥābah.

According to an observation in al-Qastallani&#x27;s &quot;Al-Muwahib al-Ladunniyyah&quot;, an untold number of persons had already converted to Islam by the time Muhammad died. There were 10,000 by the time of the Conquest of Mecca and 70,000 during the Expedition of Tabuk in 630. Some Muslims assert that they were more than 200,000 in number: it is believed that 124,000 pilgrims witnessed the Farewell Sermon Muhammad delivered after making Farewell Pilgrimage to Mecca.

==Definitions==
===Sunni===
The most widespread definition of a companion is someone who met Muhammad, believed in him, and died a Muslim. The Sunni scholar ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 H) said,
Anyone who died after rejecting Islam and becoming an apostate is not considered as a companion. Those who saw him but held off believing in him until after his death are not considered ṣahābah, only tābiʻūn (if they saw the companions).

According to Sunni scholars, Muslims of the past should be considered companions if they had any contact with Muhammad, and they were not liars or opposed to him and his teachings. If they saw him, heard him, or were in his presence even briefly, they are companions. All companions are assumed to be just (&quot;ʻudul&quot;) unless they are proven otherwise; that is, Sunni scholars do not believe that companions would lie or fabricate hadith unless they are proven liars, untrustworthy or opposed to Islam.

Some Quranic references are important to Sunni Muslim views of the reverence due to all companions; It sometimes admonishes them, as when Aisha, wife of Muhammad and daughter of the first Sunni caliph Abu Bakr, was accused of infidelity. 

Differing views on the definition of a companion were also influenced by the debate between the Traditionalists and the Muʿtazila with the traditionalists preferring to extend the definition to as many people as possible and the Mu&#x27;tazilites preferring to restrict it.

===Shia===
The Shia as well as some Sunni scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi and Amin Ahsan Islahi follow a stricter definition, believing that not every Muslim who met Muhammad should be considered a companion. In their view, the Qurʻan requires companions to demonstrate a high level of faith; thus, only those individuals who had substantial contact with Muhammad should be considered, e.g., those that lived with him, took part in military campaigns, or proselytized. 
This stricter definition means that the Shia consider each ṣaḥābiyy differently, depending on what they accomplished. They do not accept that the testimony of nearly all ṣaḥābah are an authentic part of the chain of narrators for a hadith. The Shia further argue that the righteousness of ṣaḥābah can be assessed by their loyalty towards Muhammad&#x27;s family after his death, and they accept hadith from the Imams of the Ahl al-Bayt, believing them to be cleansed from sin through their interpretation of the Qurʻan and the hadith of the Cloak.

Shia Muslims believe that some of the companions are accountable for the loss of the caliphate by Ali&#x27;s family.

As verses 30-33 from Al-Aḥzāb, Shias believe their argument that one must discriminate between the virtues of the companions by verses relating to Muhammad&#x27;s wives.

=== Baháʼí Faith ===
The Baháʼí Faith recognizes the companions of Muhammad. They are mentioned in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the primary theological work of the Baháʼí religion.

==Hadith==

===Sunni views===
According to the &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot;, after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Abu Bakr, Umar and Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah and the Anṣār of Medina held consultations and selected Abu Bakr as the first caliph. Then Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf and Uthman, companion and son-in-law of Muhammad and also essential chief of the Banu Umayyah, selected Umar as the second caliph after the death of Abu Bakr and the other Anṣār and Muhajirun accepted him.

Sunni Muslim scholars classified companions into many categories, based on a number of criteria. The hadith quoted above shows ranks of &quot;ṣaḥābah, tābi&#x27;īn,&quot; and &quot;tābi&#x27; at-tābi&#x27;īn.&quot; Al-Suyuti recognized eleven levels of companionship.

The general involvement in military campaign with Muhammad by the ṣaḥāba was highlighted by the third generation scholar named Ibn al-Mubarak, who was once asked to choose between Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, who was a companion, and Umar ibn &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz, who was famous for his piety. Ibn al-Mubarak simply responded: &quot;...dust particles in Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s nose (while fighting in Hunayn under Muhammad) were better than six hundred Umar (ibn &#x27;Abd al-&#x27;Aziz)...&quot;

===Shia views===
Following the consultation of companions about the successor of Muhammad, Shi&#x27;i scholars, therefore, deprecate hadith believed to have been transmitted from alleged unjust companions and place much more reliance on hadith believed to have been related by Muhammad&#x27;s family members, the Ahl al-Bayt, and by the companions who supported Ali. The Shia claim that Muhammad announced his successor during his lifetime at Da&#x27;wat Dhu al-Ashira, then many times during his prophethood and finally at the event of Ghadir Khumm.

Shias consider that any hadith where Muhammad is claimed to have absolved all ṣaḥābah from sin is a false report by those who opposed the Ahl al-Bayt.

<text>Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester (died circa 21 October 1204) (Latinized to &quot;de Bellomonte&quot; (&quot;from the beautiful mountain&quot;)) was an English nobleman, the last of the Beaumont earls of Leicester. He is sometimes known as Robert FitzPernel.

==Life==
Robert was the eldest surviving son of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester and Petronilla de Grandmesnil, who was either a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil. Robert&#x27;s older brother died in 1189. As a young man, he accompanied King Richard I of England on the Third Crusade, and it was while the crusading forces rested at Messina, Sicily that Robert was invested with the Earldom of Leicester on 2 February 1191, following the death of his father in 1190 at Durazzo while on his way to the Holy Land.

Robert&#x27;s newly gained estates included a large part of central Normandy. He held castles at Pacy, Pont-Saint-Pierre and Grandmesnil. Earl Robert also was lord of the vast honour of Breteuil, but the family castle there had been dismantled after the 1173-1174 War. On his return from the crusade, he turned his attention to the defence of Normandy from the French. After defending Rouen from the advances of Philip II of France, he attempted to retake his castle of Pacy. He was captured by forces of the French king and remained imprisoned for 3 years. Later, King John would bestow the new fortress and lordship of Radepont (the land of Radepont was traded to King John by the seigneur du Neubourg for lands and revenues in the pays de Caux) upon the earl.

Sometime after his release in 1196, he married Loretta de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. They had no children, and Robert&#x27;s death in 1204 brought the end of the Beaumont male line.

In the year of his death, Normandy was lost to the French; Earl Robert attempted to come to an independent arrangement with King Philip of France, in which he would hold his land in Normandy as a liege-vassal of the Kings of France, and his lands in England as a liege-vassal of the Kings of England. In any event, Robert died on 20 or 21 October 1204, and his large English estates were divided between the heirs of his two sisters. The eldest sister, Amice, had married the French baron Simon de Montfort, and their son, also named Simon de Montfort, inherited half the estate as well as the title of Earl of Leicester. The younger sister, Margaret, had married Saer de Quincy, and they inherited the other half. Three years later Saer was created Earl of Winchester.

<text>The Independent Subway System (IND; formerly the ISS) was a rapid transit rail system in New York City that is now part of the New York City Subway. It was first constructed as the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan in 1932. It was originally also known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System (ICOSS) or the Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad (ICORTR).

One of three subway networks that became part of the modern New York City Subway, the IND was intended to be fully owned and operated by the municipal government, in contrast to the privately operated or jointly funded Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) companies. It was merged with these two networks when the subway system was unified in 1940.

The original IND services are the modern subway&#x27;s A, B, C, D, E, F, and G services. In addition, the BMT&#x27;s M and R use trackage that was originally built for the IND, while the Q uses the IND Second Avenue Line, which was built after the unification of the three systems. The Rockaway Park Shuttle supplements the A service. For operational purposes, the IND and BMT lines and services are referred to jointly as the B Division.

==Nomenclature==

Until 1940, it was known as the Independent City-Owned Subway System (ICOS), Independent Subway System (ISS), or Independent City-Owned Rapid Transit Railroad. It became known as the IND after unification of the subway lines in 1940; the name &quot;IND&quot; was assigned to match the three-letter initialisms that the IRT and BMT used.

The first IND line was the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan, opened on September 10, 1932; for a while the whole system was colloquially known as the Eighth Avenue Subway. The original IND system was entirely underground in the four boroughs that it served, with the exception of a short section of the IND Culver Line containing two stations spanning the Gowanus Canal in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.

==History==

In the early 1920s, Mayor John Hylan proposed a complex series of city-owned and operated rapid transit lines to compete with the BMT and IRT, especially their elevated lines. The New York City Transit Commission was formed in 1921 to develop a plan to reduce overcrowding on the subways. The original plans included:
* Two major trunk lines in midtown Manhattan, with one running under Eighth Avenue and one under Sixth Avenue, which already had an elevated line
* A crosstown subway under 53rd Street (connecting with the Eighth and Sixth Avenue subways) running under the East River to Queens Plaza (Long Island City), meeting with a Brooklyn–Queens crosstown line, and continuing under Queens Boulevard and Hillside Avenue to 179th Street, where bus service would converge
* A subway under the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, diverging from the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan at 145th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue

These lines were completely built as planned. All but a short portion of the Culver Line (over the Gowanus Canal) are underground.

On March 14, 1925, the groundbreaking of the Eighth Avenue subway took place at 123rd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.

On July 8, 1931, the first train of R1s left Coney Island at 11:35am and ran via the BMT Sea Beach Line to Times Square. The trip took 42 minutes.

===Opening and progress through 1933===

====First Manhattan trunk line, 1932====

On September 10, 1932, the Eighth Avenue Line opened from 207th Street to Chambers Street, inaugurating the IND. In February 1933 the Cranberry Street Tunnel opened, along with the Eighth Avenue Line from Chambers Street to Jay Street–Borough Hall. On the northern end of the construction, in the Bronx, the connecting Concourse Line opened on July 1, 1933 from 205th Street to 145th Street. On the IND&#x27;s opening day, it had a relatively small subway car fleet of 300 cars, while the IRT had 2,281 subway and 1,694 elevated cars, and the BMT had 2,472 cars.

The new IND Eighth Avenue Line was built using of concrete and of steel. The roadbed of the new subway was expected to last 30 years. At the time of the line&#x27;s opening, other portions of the Independent Subway System were under construction, including five underwater tunnels:
*Cranberry Street Tunnel, long
*Rutgers Street Tunnel, long
*53rd Street Tunnel, long
*Concourse Tunnel, long
*Greenpoint Tube, long

There was some vandalism on the IND Eighth Avenue Line&#x27;s opening day, as some of the uptown stations were broken into by people who clogged turnstile slots with gum and other objects. Two months after the IND opened for business, three exits from the 96th Street and 103rd Street stations – at 95th and 97th Streets and at 105th Street, respectively – were closed due to theft.

====First branch lines====

The Queens Boulevard Line, also referred to as the Long Island City−Jamaica Line, Fifty-third Street−Jamaica Line, and Queens Boulevard−Jamaica Line prior to opening, was an original line of the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), planned to stretch between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 178th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens.

The first section of the line, west from Roosevelt Avenue to 50th Street, opened on August 19, 1933. trains ran local to Hudson Terminal (today&#x27;s World Trade Center) in Manhattan, while the (predecessor to current G service) ran as a shuttle service between Queens Plaza and Nassau Avenue on the IND Crosstown Line, which opened on the same day.

The Cranberry Street Tunnel, extending the Eighth Avenue express tracks east under Fulton Street to Jay Street–Borough Hall in Brooklyn, was opened for the morning rush hour on February 1, 1933. Until June 24, 1933, High Street was skipped.

The first short section of the IND Culver Line opened on March 20, 1933, taking Eighth Avenue Express trains (and for about a month from July to August trains) south from Jay Street to Bergen Street. The rest of the line opened on October 7, 1933 to the &quot;temporary&quot; terminal at Church Avenue, three blocks away from the Culver elevated at Ditmas Avenue. In 1936, the A was rerouted to the IND Fulton Street Line and trains from the Queens Boulevard Line replaced them.

===Second Manhattan trunk line, 1936–1940===
The first part of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, or what was then known as the Houston–Essex Street Line, began operations at noon on January 1, 1936 with two local tracks from a junction with the Washington Heights, Eighth Avenue and Church Street Line (Eighth Avenue Line) south of West Fourth Street–Washington Square east under Houston Street and south under Essex Street to a temporary terminal at East Broadway. E trains, which ran from Jackson Heights, Queens to Hudson Terminal, were shifted to the new line to East Broadway. Two express tracks were built on the portion under Houston Street until Essex Street-Avenue A; the tracks were intended to travel under the East River and connect with the never-built IND Worth Street Line in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

Just after midnight on April 9, 1936, trains began running under the East River via the Rutgers Street Tunnel, which connected the Houston-Essex Street Line with the north end of the Jay–Smith–Ninth Street Line at a junction with the Eighth Avenue Line north of Jay Street–Borough Hall. E trains were sent through the connection to Church Avenue. Simultaneously, the Fulton Street Line was opened to Rockaway Avenue and the A and C trains, which had used Smith Street, were rerouted to Fulton Street.

During construction, streetcar service along Sixth Avenue was terminated. The city had the choice of either restoring it upon the completion of construction or abandoning it immediately. As the city wanted to tear down the IRT Sixth Avenue Line right away and save on the costs of shoring it up while construction proceeded underneath it, the IRT Sixth Avenue Line was purchased for $12.5 million and terminated by the city on December 5, 1938.

On December 15, 1940, local subway service began on Sixth Avenue from the West Fourth Street subway station to the 47-50th Street subway station with track connections to the IND 53rd Street Line. The Sixth Avenue Line&#x27;s construction cost $59,500,000. The following routes were added with the opening of service:
* The AA Washington Heights Local was brought back for non-rush-hour service between 168th Street and Hudson Terminal via the Eighth Avenue Line.
* The Washington Heights Local was added for rush-hour only service between 168th Street and Hudson Terminal via the Sixth Avenue Line.
* The Bronx Concourse Express was added for service between Norwood–205th Street and Hudson Terminal via the Sixth Avenue Line.
* (Queens–Manhattan Express) service was cut back from Church Avenue to Broadway–Lafayette Street.
* (Queens–Manhattan Express) was added for service between Parsons Boulevard and Church Avenue via the Sixth Avenue Line.

Sixth Avenue express service would not begin until 1967, after the Chrystie Street Connection opened.

===More branch lines open===
The Fulton Street Line was opened from Jay Street to Rockaway Avenue on April 9, 1936, including the stub terminal at Court Street. A shuttle was operated between Court Street and Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets.

On December 31, 1936, the Queens Boulevard Line was extended from Roosevelt Avenue to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike.

The Queens Boulevard Line was extended to Hillside Avenue and 178th Street, with a terminal station at 169th Street on April 24, 1937. That day, express service began on the Queens Boulevard Line during rush hours, with E trains running express west of 71st–Continental Avenues, and GG trains taking over the local during rush hours. The initial headway for express service was between three and five minutes.
The entire Crosstown Line was completed and connected to the IND Culver Line on July 1, 1937, whereupon the GG was extended in both directions to Smith–Ninth Streets and Forest Hills–71st Avenue.

From April 30, 1939 to October 28, 1940, the Queens Boulevard Line served the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair via the World&#x27;s Fair Railroad. The World&#x27;s Fair line ran via a connection through the Jamaica Yard and through Flushing Meadows–Corona Park along the current right-of-way of the Van Wyck Expressway. Despite calls from public officials such as Queens Borough President George Harvey to make the line a permanent connection to Flushing and northern Queens, the line was demolished in 1941.

===Proposed expansion===

Mayor John Hylan proposed some never-built lines in 1922 even before the first leg of the IND was completed. These lines included:

*A West Side trunk line in Manhattan between 14th Street and the city limits at Yonkers. The line would be 4 tracks between 14th Street and 162nd Street, 3 tracks to Dyckman Street, and 2 tracks to the terminal. There would be a two-track spur from 162nd Street to 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue. From 14th Street, the line would split; two tracks would connect to the BMT Canarsie Line and two tracks would continue south to a loop at Battery Park and an East River tunnel to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street, Brooklyn. Supposedly, there was also a plan of a line to Red Hook.
*A trunk line, 4 tracks, on First Avenue from the Harlem River to 10th Street. From 10th Street, the line would split. Two tracks would run via Third Avenue and the Bowery to a new Lafayette Avenue subway in Brooklyn. The other two would run to a loop near City Hall. From the Harlem River, the line would run to 161st Street, and split into two 3-track routes: one to Fordham Road &amp; Southern Blvd and the other to Webster Ave. &amp; Fordham Road, where it would join the current IRT White Plains Road line and continue to 241st Street. Since this portion of the IRT El was already built to BMT clearances, and Hylan&#x27;s system would consider using BMT clearances as well, all that would have to be done along this section is shave back the platforms.
*A line from 125th Street (near today&#x27;s Henry Hudson Parkway) crosstown, to and across the East River, to Astoria, Queens, likely connecting to the BMT Astoria Line.
*A new subway line, with between two and four tracks at various areas, from approximately the Hunters Point Avenue station on today&#x27;s IRT Flushing Line in Queens, heading in a southeasterly direction to Lafayette Avenue, Brooklyn. At Lafayette Avenue, the line would split. Two tracks would turn into a four-track line along Lafayette Avenue. The other two tracks would run to Flatbush and Franklin Avenues.
*A 4-track subway line from Brooklyn&#x27;s Borough Hall via the Lafayette Avenue subway to Bedford Avenue. From there it was three tracks to Broadway to Cypress Hills, Brooklyn where the line would continue on the present-day BMT Jamaica Line. (The line would have ended at 168th Street, where the BMT Jamaica Line once ended.) The subway would have run directly under the line along Broadway giving it direct competition for passengers, and (in Hylan&#x27;s opinion) draining revenues from the BMT. Two tracks of the Lafayette Avenue subway would connect with the proposed First Avenue line.
*A new branch off the IRT Eastern Parkway Line in Brooklyn onto Utica Avenue, running under Utica to Flatlands Avenue.
*A 4-track subway under Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to Nostrand Avenue, to Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, turning west onto Emmons Avenue to Surf Avenue in Coney Island. A branch of this line would head out to Floyd Bennett Field under Flatbush Avenue.
*Extension of the BMT Canarsie Line to the BMT Jamaica Line somewhere beyond 121st Street in Queens.
*A new line running from Prospect Avenue via Fort Hamilton Parkway, to 10th Avenue, terminating at 90th Street. BMT Culver Line trains would use this line.
*Extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, south to Bay Ridge – 95th Street. (This was the only other line that was complete.)
*Extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line east to the Fort Hamilton Parkway Line and the BMT West End Line.
*A two-track line from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line at 67th Street to Staten Island via the Staten Island Tunnel.
*Extension of the IRT New Lots Line from New Lots Avenue to Lefferts Boulevard.
*Extension of the IRT Flushing Line to Bell Boulevard in Bayside via Main Street, Kissena Boulevard, and Northern Boulevard.
*A branch off the IRT Flushing Line to Jamaica from Roosevelt Avenue.

A major expansion of the IND was first planned in 1929. It would have added over 100 miles of new routes in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, merging with, intersecting or extending the existing IND rights-of way. It was claimed that this expansion, combined with the operating IRT, BMT, and IND lines, would provide subway service within a half mile of anyone&#x27;s doorstep within these four boroughs. Pricing – excluding acquisition and equipment costs – was estimated at US$438 million. The entire first phase had only cost US$338 million, &quot;including&quot; acquisition and equipment costs.

Not long after these plans were unveiled, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred and the Great Depression was ushered in, and the plans essentially became history overnight. Various forms of the expansion resurfaced in 1939, 1940, 1951, 1968, and 1998 but were never realized. This was the time when the IND had planned widespread elevated construction.

The Second Avenue Subway, one of the main parts of the plan, is open between 63rd and 96th Streets as of January 1, 2017.

==Post-unification==
The Court Street station on the IND Fulton Street Line was closed on June 1, 1946 due to low ridership. After World War II ended, workers and materials became available for public use again. The badly needed extension to the more efficient terminal at Broadway − East New York (the current Broadway Junction station) opened on December 30, 1946. The extension of the Fulton Street Line, the completion of which had been delayed due to war priorities, was finished by funds obtained by Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer and was placed in operation on November 28, 1948, running along Pennsylvania Avenue and Pitkin Avenue to Euclid Avenue near the Queens border. Forty additional R10 cars were placed into service for the extension. The cost of the extension was about $46,500,000. It included the construction of the new Pitkin Avenue Storage Yard, which could accommodate 585 subway cars on 40 storage tracks.

The existing 169th Street station provided an unsatisfactory terminal setup for a four track line, and this required the turning of F trains at Parsons Boulevard, and no storage facilities were provided at the station. Therefore, the line was going to be extended to 184th Place with a station at 179th Street with two island platforms, sufficient entrances and exits, and storage for four ten-car trains. The facilities would allow for the operation of express and local service to the station. Construction on the extension started in 1946, and was projected to be completed in 1949. The extension was completed later than expected and opened on December 11, 1950. This extension was delayed due to the Great Depression and World War II. Both E and F trains were extended to the new station.

During the 1950s, the IND was extended over two pieces of elevated line that were disconnected from the original BMT system: the BMT Culver Line in 1954, and the Liberty Avenue extension of the BMT Fulton Street Line in 1956. On October 30, 1954 the Culver Ramp opened, connecting the IND Culver Line to the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue. IND trains begin operating over the BMT Culver Line to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. On April 29, 1956, the Liberty Avenue Elevated, the easternmost section of the former BMT Fulton Street Line, was connected to the IND Fulton Street Line. IND service was extended from Euclid Avenue out to Lefferts Boulevard via a new station at Grant Avenue.

On June 28, 1956, service on the IND Rockaway Line began between Euclid Avenue and Rockaway Park at 6:38 PM and between Euclid Avenue and Wavecrest at 6:48 PM. A new station at Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue opened on January 16, 1958, completing the Rockaway Line.

In November 1967, the first part of the Chrystie Street Connection opened and Sixth Avenue Line express tracks opened from 34th Street–Herald Square to West Fourth Street–Washington Square. With the opening of the connection to the Manhattan Bridge, BB service was renamed B and was extended via the new express tracks and the connection to the West End Line in Brooklyn. In non-rush hours, B service terminated northbound at either West 4th Street (middays and Saturdays) or as the TT shuttle at 36th Street in Brooklyn (nights and Sundays). D service was routed via the connection and onto the Brighton Line instead of via the Culver Line. It only ran express during rush hours. F service was extended from Broadway–Lafayette Street during rush hours, and from 34th Street during other times to Coney Island via the Culver Line.

In July 1968, the 57th Street station opened and the portion of the Chrystie Street Connection connecting the line with the Williamsburg Bridge was opened for regular service (although it had been previously used in passenger service for occasional post-Chrystie Street weekend D maintenance reroutes). Service on the KK was inaugurated, running from 57th Street to 168th Street on the BMT Jamaica Line. B service began running during non-rush hours (local on 6th Avenue) to 57th Street. D trains began running express via the Sixth Avenue Line at all times.

In December 1988 the IND Archer Avenue Line opened from Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer to Jamaica–Van Wyck.

A month shy of twenty years after construction began, the IND 63rd Street Line went into service on October 29, 1989, after an expenditure of $898 million, extending service from 57th Street with new stations at Lexington Avenue, Roosevelt Island, and 21st Street at 41st Avenue in Queens. The IND line was served by trains on weekdays, trains on weekends and trains at night (signed Q northbound from 2nd Avenue and southbound as far as 57th Street), as well as the extended JFK Express. The 1,500-foot connector to the Queens Boulevard Line had not yet started construction. The BMT connection between the new Lexington Avenue station and 57th Street-7th Avenue was not in use at that time; it was built for the future connection to the Second Avenue Subway for BMT Broadway service from the Upper East Side to Lower Manhattan.

Planning for the connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line began in December 1990, with the final design contract awarded in December 1992. Construction began on September 22, 1994. The remaining section from 21st Street to the Queens Boulevard Line cost $645 million. In December 2000, the 63rd Street Connector was opened for construction reroutes. The Connector came into regular use in December 2001 with the rerouting of F service at all times to 63rd Street. The construction project extended the lower level LIRR tunnel and involved a number of other elements, including the integration of ventilation plants, lowering a sewer siphon 50 feet, rehabilitation of elements of the existing line, mitigating ground water, diverting trains which continued to run through the project area and widening of the entry point to the Queens Boulevard Line to six tracks. This new tunnel connection allowed rerouting the Queens Boulevard Line trains via the 63rd Street Tunnel, which opened up capacity through the 53rd Street tunnel to Manhattan which allowed a new local service, the V train, to provide additional Queens Boulevard service to Manhattan, along Sixth Avenue. This service was discontinued in 2010 and replaced with an extension of the M train.

* Queens Boulevard Line (): extended east to 179th Street
* Culver Line (): extended south along the ex-BMT Culver Line
* 60th Street Tunnel Connection (): connecting the BMT&#x27;s 60th Street Tunnel to the Queens Boulevard Line

The following extension is partially open:
* IND Second Avenue Line (): from 96th Street to 72nd Street, then connecting with the BMT 63rd Street Line

==Line planning==
Many IND lines were designed to be parallel to existing IRT and BMT subway lines in order to compete with them.
* The IND Concourse Line is within one to three short blocks of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line for most of its length. It was also planned to replace the then-NYW&amp;B-owned line as well as the IRT White Plains Road Line.
* The IND Eighth Avenue Line is within of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the IRT Lenox Avenue Line for most of its length. It was designed to replace the IRT Ninth Avenue Line.
* The IND Sixth Avenue Line was designed to replace the IRT Sixth Avenue Line.
* The IND Fulton Street Line is within of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and the IRT New Lots Line for most of its length in Brooklyn. It was designed to replace the BMT Fulton Street Line.
* The IND Crosstown Line was designed to replace BMT streetcars.
* The Second Avenue Subway is designed to be within 0.25 miles (0.40 km) of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and to replace the IRT Second Avenue Line and the IRT Third Avenue Line.

Additionally, some never-built lines were designed to replace old elevated lines.
* The IRT Dyre Avenue Line and IRT Pelham Line were to be recaptured by the IND Second Avenue Line.
* The IND Utica Avenue Line and the IND Archer Avenue Line were both designed to replace parts of the BMT Jamaica Line. The latter would also be planned to replace the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.

==Service letters==
As originally designed, the IND train identification scheme was based on three things: the Manhattan trunk line served (8th Avenue or 6th Avenue), the northern branch line served (Washington Heights, Grand Concourse/Bronx, or Queens Boulevard), and the service level (Express or Local). The 8th Avenue routes were A, C, and E. The 6th Avenue routes were B, D, and F. The A and B served Washington Heights. The C and D served the Grand Concourse. The E and F served Queens Boulevard via the 53rd Street Tunnel.

A single letter indicated an express service, while a double letter indicated local service. G was used for Brooklyn-Queens &quot;Crosstown&quot; service. H was used for any service on the extended Fulton Street (Brooklyn) line that did not originate in Manhattan.

The first designations were as follows:
Virtually all possibilities were used at one time or another, either in regular service or as brief special routes. The &quot;G&quot; single-letter service was used for service to World&#x27;s Fair Station in 1939.

The final pre-Chrystie Street Connection service is shown here; for more details, see the individual service pages. Terminals shown are the furthest the service reached.
After the Chrystie Street Connection opened, the original IND Service Letter scheme was gradually abandoned. All lines, whether local or express, now use a single letter, and only the 8th Avenue/6th Avenue distinction (A, C, E vs. B, D, F) has been maintained. Following consolidation under city ownership, the numbered routes of the former BMT system were also gradually relabeled to letters for consistency with the IND system.

==Platform lengths==
The IND was built with longer platforms than those of the IRT or BMT. Initial plans called for stations to be built with long platforms to accommodate trains of eleven cars. These lengths were shortened, as stations on the IND Eighth Avenue Line between 72nd Street and 163rd Street – Amsterdam Avenue have lengths of exactly . There were two exceptions: 96th Street was on both levels, as that was the standard length of platforms built for the IND after the 1940s.

The 81st Street–Museum of Natural History station had an uptown platform that was long, and a downtown platform that was . Platforms of exactly length can be found on some IND Queens Boulevard Line stations between Elmhurst Avenue and 67th Avenue.

Some of the IND Sixth Avenue Line stations have much greater platform lengths. In 34th Street–Herald Square, the uptown platform was originally , long enough to hold a 12-car train of cars. The downtown platform was originally . Both platforms of the 23rd Street station are . The 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station has platforms that are .

In the IND Second System, planned stations would have been long and tile work would have been more &quot;modern&quot;.

==Surviving IND equipment==

The Independent Subway System operated solely with one family of subway cars - commonly referred to as the R1–9 fleet - comprising the R1s, R4s, R6s, R7/As and R9 cars. After the equipment was retired in the 1970s, twenty cars were sent to various museums. Eleven of these cars are preserved by the New York Transit Museum and Railway Preservation Corp. The other nine are on private property or preserved at other museums.

<text>The Junkers Ju 88 is a twin-engined multirole combat aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works. It was used extensively during the Second World War by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and became one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the conflict.

The Ju 88 originated from a &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) requirement issued in 1934 for a new multipurpose aircraft. Junkers was one of several firms to respond, producing two separate design studies that produced both the Ju 85 and Ju 88. The design work was headed by Junkers&#x27; chief designer Ernst Zindel. The Ju 88 was envisioned to function as a so-called &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; (&quot;fast bomber&quot;) that would evade interception by enemy fighters of its era by flying at high speed. On 21 December 1936, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. The performance of the third prototype was highly favourable, resulting in the competing Henschel Hs 127 and Messerschmitt Bf 162 being abandoned. During late 1937, the Ju 88 was developed into a heavy dive bomber, but this feat proved to be too stressful for the airframe even with modifications.

A series of technical problems troubled the aircraft&#x27;s development, delaying its introduction to squadron service from 1938 to September 1939, by which point the Second World War had already started. The Ju 88 first saw action with the Luftwaffe during the invasion of Poland. It would subsequently be deployed into numerous theatres of the conflict, including the Norwegian campaign, the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, the invasion of Yugoslavia, the invasion of Greece, the Siege of Malta, the North African campaign, and the Eastern Front amongst others. While the Luftwaffe was the primary operator of the Ju 88, numerous other nation&#x27;s air services also flew the type in quantity during the war; these include the Finnish Air Force, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the Royal Romanian Air Force.

The Ju 88 was one of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s most important and heavily used aircraft during the Second World War. The aircraft, akin to several other German bombers of the era, served as a bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, and heavy fighter. Perhaps most unusually, it was adapted into a flying bomb towards the end of the war. The assembly line ran constantly from 1936 to 1945, building in excess of 15,000 Ju 88s across dozens of variants, making it the most-produced twin-engine German aircraft of the period and the second-most produced bomber of all time behind the four-engined Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Throughout its production run, the basic structure of the Ju 88 remained unchanged.

==Design and development==
===Background===

The origins of the Ju 88 can be traced back to the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) and the formulation of a new requirement in 1934 that called for a new multipurpose aircraft. This requirement quickly attracted attention from much of the German aircraft industry. However, in August 1935, the RLM revised its requirements towards the concept of a &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;, a high-speed bomber that lacked defensive turrets, seated a crew of three, and carried a payload of . This requirement was issued to a total of four aircraft manufacturers, these being Focke Wulf, Henschel, Junkers, and Messerschmitt; all firms except Focke Wulf opted to produce a response.

Junkers design team opted to perform a pair of design studies in parallel; work began on 15 January 1936. These studies subsequently produced two distinct, yet similar, aircraft, designated &quot;Ju 85&quot; and &quot;Ju 88&quot;. Both were twin-engined bomber aircraft, the main difference between the two being the Ju 85&#x27;s use of a twin fin (and twin rudder) tail unit while the Ju 88 had a single fin (and rudder) tail unit instead. Following deliberation amongst officials, the RLM decided in favour of the Ju 88. According, the passed-over Ju 85 was never put into service.

The detailed design work was performed by Junkers chief designer Ernst Zindel. He was assisted by Wilhelm Heinrich Evers and American engineer Alfred Gassner. Evers and Gassner had worked together at Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America where Gassner had been Chief Engineer. Junkers presented their initial design in June 1936, and were given clearance to build two prototypes (Werknummer 4941 and 4942). The first two aircraft were to have a range of and were to be powered by two DB 600s. Three further aircraft, Werknummer &quot;4943&quot;, &quot;4944&quot; and &quot;4945&quot;, were to be powered by Jumo 211 engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 88 V1 and V2, differed from the V3, V4 and V5 in that the latter three models were equipped with three defensive armament positions to the rear of the cockpit, and were able to carry two bombs, one under each inner wing panel.

===Into flight===
On 21 December 1936, the aircraft&#x27;s maiden flight was performed by the prototype Ju 88 V1, which bore the civil registration D-AQEN. During its first flight, it managed to reach a speed of about . On 10 April 1937, the first prototype was lost in an accident. The third prototype, Ju 88 V3, which made its first flight on 13 September 1937 and was the first to be powered by the Jumo 211A engine, participated in a series of extensive tests at the Rechlin experimental station. According to the aviation authors J.R. Smith and Antony Kay, the results of this evaluation were so positive that all work on the competing Henschel Hs 127 and Messerschmitt Bf 162 was abandoned quickly thereafter.

Upon reviewing the Ju 88&#x27;s performance, Hermann Göring, head of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, was reportedly ecstatic; it was allegedly viewed as an aircraft that could finally fulfil the promise of the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;. The streamlined fuselage was modelled after its contemporary, the Dornier Do 17, but furnished with fewer defensive guns as a result of the belief still held that it could outrun late 1930s-era fighters. During March 1939, the fifth prototype set a closed-circuit record while carrying a payload at a speed of .
The first five prototypes had conventionally-operating dual-strut leg rearwards-retracting main gear, however, starting with the V6 prototype, a main gear design debuted that twisted the new, single-leg main gear strut through 90° during the retraction sequence, much like that of the American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. This feature allowed the main wheels to end up above the lower end of the strut when fully retracted and was adopted as standard for all future production Ju 88s, and only minimally modified for the later Ju 188 and 388 developments of it. These single-leg landing gear struts also made use of stacks of conical Belleville washers inside them as their main form of suspension for takeoffs and landings.

By 1938, the design had received a series of radical modifications to adapt the Ju 88 to function as a &quot;heavy&quot; dive bomber in response to a request from the RLM. These changes, which were first implemented on the V8 and V9 prototypes, included the strengthening of the wings, the addition of dive brakes, an extended fuselage, and the number of crewmen being increased to four. 
During August 1938, &quot;Generalluftzeugmeister&quot; Ernst Udet had set out the Takt system of construction for large state-owned firms, including Junkers. Almost all of the tooling and jigs were produced at the company&#x27;s facility in Schönebeck; the wing and tail sections were constructed at Halberstadt and Leopoldschall while the fuselage was originally produced as two separate shells that were brought together at Aschersleben. Later on, fuselage construction was broken down further, a decision that made it easier to produce the numerous variations of the Ju 88. During early 1939, a pre-production batch of ten Ju 88A-0s was completed to conduct service trials of the type; the A-0 series were almost entirely identical to the Ju 88 V10 prototype.

As the outbreak of the Second World War approached, by the time &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; planners such as Udet had their opportunities to have their own &quot;pet&quot; features added (including dive-bombing by Udet), the Ju 88&#x27;s top speed had dropped to around . The Ju 88 V7 was fitted with cable-cutting equipment to combat the potential threat of British barrage balloons, and was successfully tested in this role; the V7 also had the Ju 88 A-1 &quot;beetle&#x27;s eye&quot; faceted nose glazing installed, complete with the &quot;Bola&quot; undernose ventral defensive machine gun emplacement, and was put through a series of dive-bombing tests with bombs, and in early 1940, with bombs. The A-1 series prototypes were Wrk Nrs 0003, 0004 and 0005. The A-1s were given the Jumo 211B-1 or G powerplants.

The choice of annular radiators for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) to be as short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the exhaust headers, the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.

During autumn of 1938, Dr. Heinrich Koppenberg (managing director of Jumo) assured Göring that a production rate of 300 Ju 88s per month was definitely achievable; indeed, such a rate was achieved during 1940. However, the pre-war ramping up of production was delayed drastically by developmental problems. Although planned for a service introduction in 1938, the Ju 88 finally entered squadron service (with only 12 aircraft) on the first day of the invasion of Poland in 1939. Production was painfully slow at this point, only a single Ju 88 was being manufactured per week as problems kept cropping up. The Ju 88C series of heavy fighter was also designed in early 1940, but its existence was kept secret from Göring, as he only sought bombers at this time.

===Dive bomber===
In October 1937, Ernst Udet had ordered the development of the Ju 88 as a heavy dive bomber. This decision was influenced by the success of the Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; in this role. The Junkers development centre at Dessau gave priority to the study of pull-out systems and dive brakes. The first prototype to be tested as a dive bomber was the Ju 88 V4 followed by the V5 and V6. These models became the planned prototype for the A-1 series. The V5 made its maiden flight on 13 April 1938, and the V6 on 28 June 1938. Both the V5 and V6 were fitted with four-blade propellers, an extra bomb bay and a central &quot;control system&quot;. Following the release of the bombs, the elevators automatically moved to their full-up position to bring the aircraft out of its dive and into a climb.

As a dive bomber, the Ju 88 was capable of pinpoint deliveries of heavy loads; however, despite all the modifications, dive bombing still proved too stressful for the airframe, and in 1943, tactics were changed so that bombs were delivered from a shallower, 45° diving angle. Aircraft and bomb sights were accordingly modified and dive brakes were removed. With an advanced &quot;Stuvi&quot; dive-bombsight, accuracy remained very good for its time. The maximum bomb load of the A-4 was , but in practice, standard bomb load was . Junkers later used the A-4 airframe for the A-17 torpedo carrier, which did not have the undernose &quot;Bola&quot; gondola for a ventral gun position.
===Fighter-bomber===
The Ju 88C series of standard fighter-bomber versions from the C-2 onwards culminated in the Ju 88 C-6, applying experience acquired with the A-4 bomber, equipped with the same Jumo 211J engines but replacing the &quot;beetle&#x27;s eye&quot; nose glazing with a smoothly curved all-metal nose, pierced only by the barrels of its forward-firing offensive armament. The C-6 was used mostly as fighter-bomber and therefore assigned to bomber units. As a reaction to the increasing number of attacks on German shipping, especially on U-boats in the Bay of Biscay, from July 1942 it started flying anti-shipping patrols and escort missions from bases in France.

&quot;V./Kampfgeschwader 40&quot; was specifically formed to operate the C-6. The aircraft of V./KG 40 (which was redesignated I./&quot;Zerstörergeschwader&quot; 1 in 1943) were a significant threat to antisubmarine aircraft and operated as escort fighters for the more vulnerable Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor maritime patrol bombers. Between July 1942 and July 1944, the Ju 88s of KG 40 and ZG 1 were credited with 109 confirmed air-to-air victories, at a cost of 117 losses. They were finally deployed against the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, incurring heavy losses for little effect before being disbanded on 5 August 1944. Some Ju 88 variants were also used as radio controlled bombs in the Mistel composite aircraft configuration, by coupling a bomber filled with explosive with a fighter such as the Focke-Wulf Fw 56 or the Messerschmitt Bf 109E.

=== Attack bomber ===
The Ju 88P was a specialized variant for ground attack and to function as a bomber destroyer, designed starting from 1942 and produced in small numbers, using examples of the &quot;Bordkanone&quot; heavy calibre aviation autocannon series, which required the omission of the &quot;Bola&quot; undernose gondola for clearance. The prototype, derived from a standard Ju 88 A-4, was armed with a anti-tank gun derived from the 7.5 cm PaK 40 installed in a large conformal gun pod under the fuselage. This was followed by a small batch of Ju 88 P-1, which standardized the solid sheet metal nose of the C version for all known examples of the P-series, and used the new PaK 40L semi-automatic gun, also known as the &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 7,5, which was also meant for use in both the later Henschel Hs 129B-3 dedicated anti-armor aircraft, and a never-achieved production version of the He 177A-3/R5 ground-attack &quot;Flak&quot;-suppression &quot;Stalingradtyp&quot; field-improvised version. The Ju 88P-1 was produced in some 40 units, but with the massive cannon installation resulting in a slow and vulnerable aircraft, it was soon replaced by the Ju 88 P-2, featuring two &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 guns, whose higher muzzle velocity proved useful against the Russian tanks in the Eastern Front. This aircraft was used by &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 25. The Ju 88 P-3 also used the twin BK 37 guns, and added further armor for the crew, and was delivered at one &quot;Staffel&quot; of the &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppen&quot; 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 for night attacks in the Eastern Front, in northern Norway (NSGr 8) and Italy (NSGr 9). Finally, the Ju 88 P-4 mounted a smaller-volume ventral gun pod housing a auto-loading &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 5 cannon (the same ordnance used for the field-improvised handful of &quot;Stalingradtyp&quot; He 177As created) and, in some cases, solid propellant rockets.

===Heavy fighter and night fighter===

====Ju 88C====

The Ju 88 V19 (W.Nr. 0373) was a test bed for the Ju 88C series. The Ju 88C was originally intended as a fighter-bomber and heavy fighter by adding fixed, forward-firing guns to the nose while retaining some bomb carrying ability of the A-series bomber. The C-series had a solid metal nose, typically housing one MG FF cannon and three MG 17 machine guns. The aircraft retained the ventral &quot;Bola&quot; gondola under the crew compartment though individual units sometimes removed this to reduce weight and drag to enhance performance. The Ju 88C was later used as a night fighter, and this became its main role.

The first version of the Ju 88C was the C-1 with 20 aircraft converted from A-1 airframes. Some of them entered service in the &quot;Zerstörerstaffel&quot; of KG 30 which became part of II./NJG 1 in July 1940. The C-1 was followed by the C-2 of which 20 aircraft were converted from A-5 airframes with enlarged wingspan. The C-4 became the first production version with 60 produced and 60 converted from A-5 airframes. The C-6, of which 900 aircraft were produced, was based on the A-4 airframe with more powerful engines and stronger defensive armament (single- or dual-mount belt-fed MG 81 or MG 131 instead of drum-fed MG 15 machine guns).

The C-6 as night fighter was typically equipped with FuG 202 &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; BC low-UHF band airborne intercept radar, using the complex 32-dipole &quot;Matratze&quot; antennas. The first four C-6 night fighters were tested in early 1942 by NJG 2. The trials were successful and the aircraft was ordered into production. In October 1943, many C-6s were upgraded with new radar systems. The first new radar equipment was the FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1. After the UHF-band Lichtenstein radars had been compromised to the Allies in the late spring of 1943, the next development in German AI radar was the VHF-band FuG 220 &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; SN-2, discarding the 32-dipole &quot;Matratze&quot; antennae for the much larger eight-dipole &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; (stag&#x27;s antlers) aerials, required for the longer wavelength SN-2 system.

Many Ju 88C&#x27;s had their Bola gondolas modified to hold up to two forward firing cannons. Several C-6 night fighters were equipped with two &quot;Schräge-Musik&quot; upward-firing cannons in trial fittings, and from mid 1943 onward, there was an official field modification kit available for this arrangement.

A small number of the C-series day fighters had their new solid-metal noses specially painted to resemble the bomber A-series&#x27; &quot;beetle&#x27;s eye&quot; faceted clear view nose glazing, in an attempt to deceive Allied pilots into thinking the fighters were actually bombers; the unusual &quot;camouflage&quot; attempt did result initially in a number of Allied aerial losses.

====Ju 88R====

The Ju 88R series night fighters were basically versions of the Ju 88 C-6, powered by unitized BMW 801 radial engines. The R-1 had BMW 801L engines and the R-2 had BMW 801 G-2 engines.

One of the first aircraft from the R-1 series that went into service (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 360 043) was involved in one of the most significant defections from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. On 9 May 1943, this night fighter (D5+EV), which was stationed with 10./NJG 3 in Aalborg Denmark, flew to the RAF Station at Dyce (now Aberdeen Airport) with its entire crew and complete electronic equipment on board. The fact that Spitfire Vb fighters No.165 (Ceylon) Squadron escorted it towards the end of its flight could indicate that its arrival had been expected. It was immediately transferred to Farnborough Airfield, received RAF markings and serial number PJ876, and was tested in great detail. The preserved aircraft is on exhibit at the RAF Museum, as one of the first two intact Ju 88s in aviation museums. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; learned of this defection only the following month when members of the crew, pilot &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Heinrich Schmitt (son of the former secretary to the ministry for foreign affairs (1923–1929) Gustav Stresemann) and &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Paul Rosenberger made broadcasts on British radio. The third crew-member, Erich Kantwill, refused to co-operate with the British and was treated as a regular prisoner of war.

====Ju 88G====
All previous night fighter versions of the Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The &quot;G-series&quot; fuselage was purpose-built for the special needs of a night fighter, with the A-series&#x27; &quot;Bola&quot; ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90 MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band &quot;FuG 350&quot; Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 &quot;Flensburg&quot; radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7. &quot;Staffel&quot;/NJG 2 was flown by mistake to RAF Woodbridge in July 1944, giving the Royal Air Force its first chance to check out the VHF-band Lichtenstein SN-2 radar and Flensburg radar detector gear.

G-6 versions were equipped with Jumo 213A inverted V-12 engines (using the same redesigned annular radiator cores as the Ju 188s powered by them), enlarged fuel tanks and often one or two MG 151/20 cannons in a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; (&quot;Jazz Music&quot;, i.e. slanted) installation. These guns were pointed obliquely upwards and forwards from the upper fuselage – usually at an angle of 70°.

Some of the final G-series models received updates to the engines, using a pair of high-altitude Jumo 213E inverted V-12s with the same revised annular radiator design as the 213As already used, or to the radar, using the mid-VHF band FuG 218 Neptun AI radar with either the standardized &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; aerials with shorter dipoles to suit the higher frequencies used, or more rarely the advanced &quot;Morgenstern&quot; 90° crossed-element, six-dipole Yagi-form antenna. Only a very few Ju 88G-6 night fighters were ever fitted with the semi-experimental FuG 240 Berlin N-1 cavity magnetron based, 3 GHz-band (centimetric) radar, whose dish antenna was housed in a smoothly contoured radome on the G-6&#x27;s nose. Only about 15 of the Berlin systems were completed before V-E Day.

Many &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; night fighter aces, such as Helmut Lent (110 victories) and Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein (87 victories) flew Ju 88s during their careers.

==Operational history==

===Initial operations and the invasion of Poland===
The first Ju 88s to be used in squadron service were assigned to the unit &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 88 (Ekdo 88), which was responsible for testing new bomber designs and their crews under hostile conditions. On 26 September 1939, the unit&#x27;s first operation was conducted, during which multiple Ju 88s flew over the Firth of Forth with the intention of bombing any British warships present. It is generally believed that no meaningful damage was inflicted to any British vessel during this raid, although future attacks to this area by the type were often more successful.

A total of 12 Ju 88s saw action during the invasion of Poland. Ekdo 88 selected 12 aircraft and their crews and attached them to 1./Kampfgeschwader 25. As a result of its small operational numbers, the type made no meaningful impact.

===Battle of Norway===
The Luftwaffe committed II./&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 30 to the campaign under X. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; for Operation Weserübung. The unit was equipped with Ju 88s and engaged Allied shipping as its main target. On 9 April 1940, Ju 88s of KG 30 dive-bombed, in cooperation with high-level bombing Heinkel He 111s of KG 26, and helped damage the battleship and sink the destroyer . However, the unit lost four Ju 88s in the action, the highest single loss of the aircraft in combat throughout the campaign.

===Battle of France===

The Luftwaffe&#x27;s order of battle for the French campaign reveals all but one of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; (I. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;) contained Ju 88s in the combat role. The mixed bomber units, including the Ju 88, of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 51 (under the command of &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 3) helped claim between 233 and 248 Allied aircraft on the ground between 10 and 13 May 1940. The Ju 88 was particularly effective at dive-bombing. Between 13 and 24 May, I. and II./KG 54 flew 174 attack against rail systems, paralysing French logistics and mobility. On 17 June 1940, Ju 88s (mainly from &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 30) destroyed a &quot;10,000 tonne ship&quot;, the 16,243 grt ocean liner , off Saint-Nazaire, killing some 5,800 Allied personnel. Despite this, the rival He 111 was more heavily used for offensive bombing during this campaign. 

Some 133 Ju 88s were pressed into the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, but very high combat losses (as well as accidents) forced a quick withdrawal from action to re-train crews to fly this very high-performance aircraft. Some crews were reported to be more scared of the Ju 88 than the enemy, and requested a transfer to an He 111 unit. By this time, major performance deficiencies in the A-1 led to an all-out effort in a major design rework. The outcome was a longer, wingspan, from extended rounded wing tips that had already been standardised on the A-4 version, that was deemed needed for all A-1s; thus the A-5 was born. Surviving A-1s were modified as quickly as possible, with new wings to A-5 specifications.

===Battle of Britain===

By August 1940, A-1s and A-5s were reaching operational units just as the Battle of Britain was intensifying. On 11 August 1940, the first major bombing raid upon Britain by the Ju 88 was conducted against Weymouth and Portland. Subsequent attacks that month were flown against targets in Portsmouth, Farnborough, Driffield, Brize Norton, and Middle Wallop. On 7 September 1940, the Luftwaffe redirected its attacks towards London. From October 1940, as a result of the high loss rate, daytime bombing of Britain ceased in favour of night time bombing.

The Battle of Britain proved to be very costly to the Luftwaffe. The Ju 88&#x27;s higher speed did not prevent losses from exceeding those of its Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111 stablemates despite being deployed in smaller numbers than either. During 1940, Ju 88 losses over Britain totalled 303 aircraft between July and October 1940. Do 17 and He 111 losses for the same period were 132 and 252 machines destroyed, respectively. Amongst the factors responsible for the high loss rate were the poor coordination between Luftwaffe fighter and bomber aircraft and the austere conditions of the French airfields from where these bombers operated.

Of all the losses suffered by the Ju 88 at that time, however, a number were due to the tricky behaviour of the aircraft, especially when compared with the proven He 111, and to the crews&#x27; lack of experience on the type – many having converted to the Ju 88 only shortly before. Of the 39 losses recorded for July 1940, for example, only 20 were due to enemy action. The others being written off in training accidents, crashes, or malfunctions over mainland Europe. A series of field modifications were made to make the Ju 88 less vulnerable, including the replacement of the single MG 15 rear machine gun by a twin-barreled MG 81Z machine gun and the fitting of additional cockpit armour.

One incident involved ground fighting between the crew of an A-1 and soldiers from the London Irish Rifles during the Battle of Graveney Marsh on 27 September 1940. It was the last action between British and foreign military forces on British mainland soil.

Between January 1943 and April 1944, a smaller scale reprisal bombing campaign was waged using Ju 88s against the British mainland. On 21 January, almost every available bomber on the Western Front was dispatched to attack London. Attacks continued against various British cities for months but the number of aircraft in each raid dwindled. In late April, in an attempt to disrupt preparations for the D-Day landings, Ju 88s were redirected towards British ports along the southern coast; these were largely ineffective and thus were abandoned within the space of a month. By August 1944, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Ju 88 force had been heavily diminished.

===The Balkans and Greece===
The Ju 88 was used by VIII Fliegerkorps during the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. That same month, the type was also used during the German invasion of Greece (Operation Marita); at the start of the conflict, several Ju 88s dropped mines along the approaches to the harbour of Piraeus and bombed ships in the vicinity, which took the port out of action for weeks.

During May 1941, the German invasion of Crete commenced. On 22 May, numerous Ju 88s, along with various other bomber aircraft of the Luftwaffe, attacked vessels belonging to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet, reportedly sinking one cruiser, damaging two other cruisers and a single battleship in the process. Following the Italian surrender in 1943, Ju 88s were also used during the German invasion of the Italian-held Dodecanese Islands, which took place between September and November 1943.

===Eastern Front===
In advance of Operation Barbarossa, a combination of Ju 86s and Ju 88s were used to systematically map out the western portion of the Soviet Union as part of Germany&#x27;s pre-invasion preparations. By the summer of 1941, most of the units equipped with the Dornier Do 17 were upgrading to the Ju 88. With a few exceptions, the majority of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bomber units were flying the He 111 and Ju 88 by this point.

On 22 June 1941, the invasion commenced; the Ju 88 units met with instant success, attacking numerous enemy airfields and positions at low level and causing enormous losses for little damage in return. 3./&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 3 attacked Pinsk airfield in the morning of 22 June 1941. It caught, and claimed destroyed, 60 Soviet bombers on the ground. The 39 SBAP Regiment of the 10 Division SAD actually lost 43 Tupolev SBa and five Petlyakov Pe-2s. Ju 88s from &quot;Kampfgeschwader 51&quot; destroyed over 100 aircraft after dispatching 80 Ju 88s to hit airfields. In general the Soviet aircraft were not dispersed and the Luftwaffe found them easy targets. A report from the Soviet 23rd Tank Division of the 12th Armoured Corps described a low-level attack by Ju 88s on 22 June, resulting in the loss of 40 tanks. However, the Ju 88s were to suffer steady attritional losses. At 0415 on 22 June 1941, III./KG 51 attacked the airfield at Kurovitsa. Despite destroying 34 Polikarpov I-153s, the Ju 88s were intercepted by 66 ShAP I-153s. Six Ju 88s were shot down before the German fighter escort dealt with the threat. By the end of the first day of the campaign, Ju 88 losses amounted to 23 destroyed.
Immediately following the initial attacks, it was decided to send Ju 88s to bomb Moscow. Over a hundred bombers were dispatched on these missions every night during the opening portion of the campaign. The air campaign against the Soviet capital was not sustainable in light of other demands, tapering down to only seven aircraft per night by December 1941.

Due to the lack of sufficient numbers of Ju 87 &quot;Stukas&quot;, the Ju 88 was quickly employed in the direct ground support role. This decision resulted in severe losses being incurred from ground fire. &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 1, &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 76 and &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 77 reported the loss of 18 Ju 88s over enemy territory on 23 June. and KG 77 reported the loss of a further four Ju 88s, of which 12 were 100% destroyed.

In the north, the VVS North-Western Front lost 465 aircraft on the ground, 148 of them bombers, to the Ju 88s of KG 1. A further 33 were damaged. Out of a total of 1,720 aircraft deployed by the VVS Northern Front on 22 June, it lost 890 and a further 187 suffered battle damage in eight days. The Ju 88s units helped virtually destroy Soviet airpower in the northern sector. Again, the Ju 88 demonstrated its dive-bombing capability. Along with He 111s from KG 55, Ju 88s from KG 51 and 54 destroyed some 220 trucks and 40 tanks on 1 July, which helped repulse the Soviet South Western Front&#x27;s offensive. The Ju 88s destroyed most rail links during interdiction missions in the area, allowing &quot;Panzergruppe 1&quot; to maintain the pace of its advance.

Ju 88 units operating over the Baltic states during the battle for Estonia inflicted severe losses on Soviet shipping, with the same dive-bombing tactics used over Norway, France and Britain. KGr 806 sank the Soviet destroyer &quot;Karl Marx&quot; on 8 August 1941 in Loksa Bay Tallinn. On 28 August the Ju 88s had more success when KG 77 and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer &quot;Vironia&quot;, the 2,317 grt &quot;Lucerne&quot;, the 1,423 grt &quot;Atis Kronvalds&quot; and the ice breaker &quot;Krišjānis Valdemārs&quot; (2,250 grt). The rest of the Soviet &quot;fleet&quot;, were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Ju 88s accounted for the transport ships &quot;Vtoraya Pyatiletka&quot; (3,974 grt), &quot;Kalpaks&quot; (2,190 grt) and &quot;Leningradsovet&quot; (1,270 grt) sunk. In addition, the ships &quot;Ivan Papanin&quot;, &quot;Saule&quot;, &quot;Kazakhstan&quot; and the &quot;Serp i Molot&quot; were damaged. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers were lost.

Another key use of the Ju 88 was against the Arctic convoys bringing supplies to the Soviets via the ports of Murmansk and Archangel. Effective attacks against these convoys did not commence until late March 1942; conveys after this point would often lose ships to air-launched torpedoes. Convoy PQ 17 reportedly lost 23 out of 34 ships, which was partially attributed to attacks by Ju 88s. Later conveys with heavier escorts, which sometimes included aircraft carriers, proved to be far more costly to attack.

===The Mediterranean===
During 1940, the first Ju 88s arrived in Sicily. Further units equipped with the type would be transferred to the theatre during 1941 and 1942. In December 1941, it was decided to launch an aerial campaign against the Allied-held island of Malta. During the Siege of Malta, Ju 88s sought out and attacked Allied shipping across the Mediterranean and also undertook bombing missions against the island itself. The port area was specifically targeted, as well as any supply ships spotted, in an attempt to deprive the population of key resources; the island&#x27;s airfields were also attacked, successfully destroying numerous Supermarine Spitfires on the ground during one such attack in May 1942. Ju 88s were often escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters to deter the Allied interception efforts.

By March 1943, Ju 88 operations in the Mediterranean had become largely confined to night time bombing missions against ground targets. In response to Allied attacks upon the Sardinian airfields around this time, German aircraft were withdrawn to Sicily and the Italian mainland. By the time of the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943, only a single unit equipped with Ju 88s was still stationed on the island.

===North Africa===
Ju 88s were used in the North African campaign, where they flew operations in support of the Axis forces in North Africa.

===Italian Campaign===
Prior to the Allied landings at Reggio and Salerno in early September 1943, there were a total of five Ju 88 units stationed in Italy. Missions were flown against the arriving troops, helping to bring about a temporary stalemate. A large-scale operation occurred on 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 A-4s, armed with bombs and motobomba circling torpedoes, attacked the Allied-held port of Bari, Italy. The attacking force achieved complete surprise and sunk over 20 Allied ships in the overcrowded harbour, including the U.S. Liberty ship &quot;John Harvey&quot;, which was carrying mustard gas. About 1,000 people were killed and another 1,000 wounded; many fatalities and injuries were as a result of the release of mustard gas. The attacking force lost one aircraft; the Allies had not assigned any fighters to guard Bari as they thought the Luftwaffe incapable of striking in this strength at this stage of the war. The port was completely closed for three weeks from the damage of the raid, and only resumed full operation in February 1944.

In December 1943, many of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s remaining Ju 88-equipped units in Italy were transferred away to other fronts.

===Finnish Air Force===

In April 1943, as Finland was fighting its Continuation War against the USSR, the Finnish Air Force bought 24 Ju 88s from Germany. The aircraft were used to equip No. 44 Sqn, which had previously operated Bristol Blenheims, but these were instead transferred to No. 42 Sqn. Due to the complexity of the Ju 88, the FAF spent most of 1943 training crews on the aircraft, and conducted only a handful of bombing missions. The most notable was a raid on the Lehto partisan village on 20 August 1943 (in which the whole squadron participated), and a raid on the Lavansaari air field (leaving seven Ju 88 damaged from forced landing in inclement weather). In the summer of 1943, the Finns noted stress damage on the wings. This had occurred when the aircraft were used in dive bombing. Restrictions followed: the dive brakes were removed and it was only allowed to dive at a 45-degree angle (compared to 60–80 degrees previously). In this way, they tried to spare the aircraft from unnecessary wear.
One of the more remarkable missions was a bombing raid on 9 March 1944 against Soviet Long Range Aviation bases near Leningrad, when the Finnish aircraft, including Ju 88s, followed Soviet bombers returning from a night raid on Tallinn, catching the Soviets unprepared and destroying many Soviet bombers and their fuel reserves, and a raid against the aerosledge base at Petsnajoki on 22 March 1944. The whole bomber regiment took part in the defence against the Soviets during the fourth strategic offensive. All aircraft flew several missions per day, at both day and night, when the weather permitted.

No. 44 Sqn was subordinated &quot;Lentoryhmä Sarko&quot; during the Lapland War (now against Germany), and the Ju 88s were used both for reconnaissance and bombing. The targets were mostly vehicle columns. Reconnaissance flights were also made over northern Norway. The last war mission was flown on 4 April 1945.

After the wars, Finland was prohibited from using bomber aircraft with internal bomb stores. Consequently, the Finnish Ju 88s were used for training until 1948. The aircraft were then scrapped over the following years. No Finnish Ju 88s have survived, but an engine is on display at the Central Finland Aviation Museum, and the frame structure of a German Ju 88 cockpit hood is preserved at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Vantaa.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only two complete aircraft exist. They were both flown into British hands by defecting crews during the war.
;Ju 88 D-1/Trop, Werk Nr. &quot;430650&quot;
:This is a long-range, photographic reconnaissance aircraft that was in the service of the Royal Romanian Air Force. On 22 July 1943, it was flown from Mariupol, Ukraine, to Cyprus by a Romanian pilot who wanted to defect to the Allied side. His original intention had been to fly to Syria, but strong winds blew him off-course. Four RAF Hawker Hurricanes intercepted the aircraft and escorted it to a landing at Limassol.

:Given the name &quot;Baksheesh&quot;, it was allocated the RAF serial number &quot;HK959&quot; and test–flown in Egypt. However, by this point in the war, the RAF had already acquired three Ju 88s in flying condition and &quot;Baksheesh&quot; was handed over to the United States Army Air Forces. The aircraft was fitted with additional external fuel tanks, then flown across Africa to Nigeria, across the South Atlantic to Brazil, via Ascension Island. Then finally across the Caribbean to Florida.

:In the US, it was registered as &quot;FE-1598&quot; and used for examination and test flying from 1943 to 1944 at Wright Field. In 1946, the aircraft was placed in storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. It was shipped to the US Air Force Museum on 6 January 1960. It was previously painted in spurious Luftwaffe markings, appropriately of a German WW II &quot;Aufklärungsgruppe&quot; (reconnaissance group) while on unrestored, outdoor display; however it is presently finished in its original-style Romanian military insignia and is on protected indoor display in the World War II Gallery at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

;Ju 88 R-1, Werk Nr. &quot;360043&quot;
:This aircraft is thought to have been built in mid–1942 as a model A bomber, before being converted to a model R–1 fighter in early 1943. It was flown to Scotland by its defecting crew in May 1943; two of the three crew on board (who may have been British agents) had taken the decision to defect after being ordered to shoot down a civilian BOAC Mosquito courier flight from Sweden to the UK.

:The aircraft took off from Aalborg, Denmark on 9 May, landing at Kristiansand, Norway for refuelling, it then took off again, supposedly for a mission over the Skagerrak. The defecting crew instead flew west to Scotland while holding the third crewmember at gunpoint. The aircraft was detected by British radar as it approached the Scottish coast and two Spitfires from 165 Squadron were scrambled. They intercepted &quot;360043&quot; one mile inland, whereupon the Ju 88 lowered its undercarriage, dipped its wings and dropped flares, signalling the crew&#x27;s intent to surrender. The Spitfires escorted &quot;360043&quot; to RAF Dyce, where it received slight damage from the airfield&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns while attempting to land. The Spitfire pilots (an American and a Canadian) were mentioned in dispatches for taking the risk not to open fire on the Ju 88 upon interception.
:The surrender of this aircraft was of great intelligence value at the time, as it was fitted with the latest UHF-band FuG 202 Liechtenstein BC A.I radar, for which a new form of the Window radar interference method, set up for UHF-band airborne radar jamming, was developed soon afterwards. The Ju 88R-1 was operated by the RAF&#x27;s No. 1426 (Enemy Aircraft) Flight and evaluated in depth by various British groups, including the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the Fighter Interception Unit. It was used to assist in teaching enemy aircraft recognition skills prior to the D-Day landings, and was last flown in May 1945. In September 1954 and again in September 1955, it was displayed on Horseguards Parade for Battle of Britain week. The aircraft was restored in 1975 and fitted with a replica of its characteristic &quot;Matratze&quot; 32-dipole radar antenna array, as all its radar equipment had been removed during the war. In August 1978, it was moved to the RAF Museum, its present home.

Several reasonably intact aircraft have been recovered from underwater and remote land crash sites in recent years; some of these aircraft are under restoration for static display. Notable examples include:
;Ju 88 A-1, Werk Nr. &quot;0880119&quot;, with &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; of U4+TK
:This aircraft is the subject of a long-term restoration project at the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection at Gardermoen, near Oslo, Norway. It first flew in January 1940 and served with 2.&quot;Staffel&quot;/Kampfgeschwader 30, under the call sign U4+TK (with the two-character &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; designation of U4 not recorded as ever having been used by KG 30 - that wing usually used the 4D wing code) during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. In April 1940, it was operating from the frozen surface of the Jonsvatnet, a lake near Trondheim in Norway. The lake was being used as an improvised airfield by the Germans, who were conducting operations against Allied naval ships and against the towns of Namsos and Narvik. Towards the end of April, warmer weather made the frozen lake surface unusable for flying operations and a number of aircraft were abandoned on the ice, sinking into the lake when it melted completely. The Ju 88 was recovered in late 2003, in an operation that also saw the recovery of a Heinkel He 111 H-2 6N+NH (Wk Nr 2320) and the tail section of a second Ju 88.

;Ju 88 A-4, Werk Nr. &quot;0881478&quot; 4D+AM (ex-&quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of BH+QQ)
:This aircraft, formerly of 4.&quot;Staffel&quot;/Kampfgeschwader 30 is displayed at the Norwegian Aviation Museum at Bodø Airport. On 13 April 1942, it was returning from an attack on Soviet ships when it ran out of fuel. The crew bailed out in the vicinity of Snefjord but the aircraft continued its flight and, remarkably, was left comparatively intact after crash-landing on a hillside at Garddevarre in Finnmark in the far north of Norway. It remained there until recovered by the &quot;Norsk Luftfartsmuseum&quot; in 1988.

;Ju 88 A-5, Werk Nr. &quot;0886146&quot; with &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of CV+VP
:This aircraft is held at the &quot;Deutsches Technikmuseum&quot; near Berlin. It was delivered to the Luftwaffe in June 1940 and assigned to the bomber unit Kampfgeschwader 54, who flew it in the Battle of Britain and during the German invasion of the Soviet Union.

:In June 1942, it was serving with a training unit, &quot;Kampffliegerschule&quot; 3 based on the German Baltic coast. On the night of 29 June, it was stolen by two German personnel who intended to fly to Britain and defect to the Allied side. The attempt failed and the aircraft came down in Kilsfjord, a fjord near Kragerø, Norway. One man drowned but the other, Willi Voss, was rescued by Norwegian civilians. However, he was subsequently captured, returned to Germany and executed in January 1943, even though some accounts claim Voss was forced by the other man to fly at gunpoint. The aircraft was recovered in August 2000. Restoration work was carried out in Norway between 2000 and 2004; it was moved to Germany in August 2006.

<doc id="455512" wikidata="Q3342373" url="?curid=455512" title="No!">
<text>No! is the first children&#x27;s album (and ninth studio album) by alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, released in 2002 on Rounder Records and Idlewild Recordings.

Retaining the eclecticism, humor and psychedelic sensibilities of their adult work, the lyrical stylings are decidedly different: the darker themes of death and depression have been replaced with songs extolling the virtues of imagination, robots and sleep. The album declares itself TMBG&#x27;s first album &quot;for the entire family&quot;, with the intention that songs appeal to both young and old audiences. The album contains a cover of Vic Mizzy&#x27;s safety song &quot;In the Middle, In the Middle, In the Middle&quot; sung by Robin Goldwasser.

&quot;No!&quot; was released as an enhanced CD; while it plays normally in any CD audio player, it features a CD-ROM portion as well, providing the listener with interactive flash animations by the Chopping Block.

&quot;The Edison Museum&quot; was originally written in 1991 and featured on the &quot;Edisongs&quot; compilation that year. The recorded version appearing here is largely the same as the &quot;Edisongs&quot; version, but has been slightly modified. The modified version here previously appeared on &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; in 1999. &quot;Robot Parade&quot; appears in the closing credits of &quot;Them, Robot&quot;, the 503rd episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

The largely positive reception the album received led to a collaboration with Walt Disney Records and the Disney Sound label. They released three albums through the mid-2000s, each with a theme: &quot;Here Come the ABCs&quot; (2005), &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot; (2008), and &quot;Here Comes Science&quot; (2009). The band&#x27;s fifth children&#x27;s music album, &quot;Why?&quot;, released in 2015, was intended as a more direct followup to &quot;No!&quot;

<doc id="455517" wikidata="Q5870392" url="?curid=455517" title="History of the Scots language">
<text>The history of the Scots language refers to how Anglic varieties spoken in parts of Scotland developed into modern Scots.

== Origins ==

Speakers of Northumbrian Old English settled in south-eastern Scotland in the 7th century, at which time Cumbric was spoken in the south of Scotland up to the Forth-Clyde isthmus, and the possibly related Pictish was spoken further north. At the same time Gaelic speakers began to spread from the Western Coast of Scotland north of the Clyde into the east. Over the next five hundred years with the founding of Scotland and spread of Christianity across the north of Britain by the Columban Church the Gaelic language slowly moved eastwards and southwards across the lowlands. When Northumbrian lands were incorporated into Scotland between the tenth and eleventh centuries, Gaelic became the prestige language there and had some influence, but the south east remained largely English speaking. In the far north, Viking incursions brought Old Norse speakers into Caithness, Orkney, and Shetland.

Scholars of the language generally use the following chronology:
* Northumbrian Old English to 1100
* Pre-literary Scots to 1375
* Early Scots to 1450
* Middle Scots to 1700
* Modern Scots 1700 onwards

== Pre-literary Scots ==
The nature of early forms of the language are obscure due to Viking plundering and destruction, Edward I of England&#x27;s removal of the national records and their subsequent loss, the destruction of the monasteries in border warfare, and vandalism during the Reformation. It is difficult to assess whether Scots descends largely from the Northumbrian Old English of Lothian or the Anglo-Danish of Yorkshire introduced some four hundred years later, which would explain the Norse elements in Early Scots which are lacking in Northumbrian Old English. According to linguist Paul Johnston, Scots descends &quot;from a radically restructured, Norse-influence Northumbrian going back to the Danelaw proper as much as from the original dialects of the Bernician settlers.&quot; 

== Early Scots ==

Northumbrian Old English had been established in south-eastern Scotland as far as the River Forth by the 7th century. It remained largely confined to this area until the 13th century, continuing in common use while Scottish Gaelic was the court language until displaced by Norman French in the early 12th century. English then spread further into Scotland via the burgh.

After the 12th century early northern Middle English began to spread north and eastwards. It was from this dialect that Early Scots, known to its speakers as &quot;English&quot; (&quot;Inglis&quot;), began to develop, which is why in the late 12th century Adam of Dryburgh described his locality as &quot;in the land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots&quot; and why the early 13th century author of &quot;de Situ Albanie&quot; thought that the Firth of Forth &quot;divides the kingdoms of the Scots and of the English&quot;.

Most of the evidence suggests that English spread further into Scotland via the burghs, proto-urban institutions which were first established by King David I. Incoming burghers were mainly English (especially from Northumbria and the Earldom of Huntingdon), Flemish and French. Although the military aristocracy employed French and Gaelic, these small urban communities appear to have been using English as something more than a &quot;lingua franca&quot; by the end of the 13th century. The growth in prestige of English in the 14th century, and the complementary decline of French in Scotland&#x27;s Royal Court, made English the prestige language of most of eastern Scotland.

Divergence from Northumbrian English was influenced by the Norse of Scandinavian-influenced English-speaking immigrants from the North and Midlands of England during the 12th and 13th centuries, Dutch and Middle Low German through trade and immigration from the low countries, and Romance via ecclesiastical and legal Latin, Norman and later Parisian French due to the Auld Alliance. Some loan words entered the language resulting from contact with Scottish Gaelic, often for geographical features such as &quot;ben&quot;, &quot;glen&quot;, &quot;crag&quot;, &quot;loch&quot; and &quot;strath&quot;; however, there are several others like &quot;bog&quot; from &quot;bog&quot; (moist or damp), &quot;twig&quot; (catch on) from &quot;tuig&quot; (understand), &quot;galore&quot; (lots of) from &quot;gu leòr&quot; (plenty), &quot;boose&quot; or &quot;buss&quot; from &quot;bus&quot; (mouth), and &quot;whisky&quot; from &quot;uisge-beatha&quot; (water of life).

Eventually the royal court and barons all spoke &quot;Inglis&quot;. Further spreading of the language eventually led to Scottish Gaelic being confined mostly to the highlands and islands by the end of the Middle Ages, although some lowland areas, notably in Galloway and Carrick, retained the language until the 17th or 18th century. From the late 14th century even Latin was replaced by &quot;Inglis&quot; as the language of officialdom and literature.

== Middle Scots ==

By the early 16th century what was then called &quot;Inglis&quot; had become the language of government, and its speakers started to refer to it as &quot;Scottis&quot; and to Scottish Gaelic, which had previously been titled &quot;Scottis&quot;, as &quot;Erse&quot; (Irish). The first known instance of this was by Adam Loutfut . In 1559 William Nudrye was granted a monopoly by the court to produce school textbooks, two of which were &quot;Ane Schort Introduction: Elementary Digestit into Sevin Breve Tables for the Commodius Expeditioun of Thame That are Desirous to Read and Write the Scottis Toung&quot; and &quot;Ane Intructioun for Bairnis to be Learnit in Scottis and Latin&quot;. In 1560 an English herald spoke to Mary of Guise and her councillors, at first they talked in the &quot;Scottish tongue&quot; but because he could not understand they continued in French.

By this time Scots had diverged significantly from its neighbour south of the border and had become the vehicle for an extensive and diverse national literature. Free variation was a prominent and important feature of the Middle Scots spelling system, however, all writers displayed some greater or lesser degree of consistency in their spelling habits. A literary standard applied but it was less than uniform. From the middle of the 16th century Scots began to become increasingly Anglicized. At the time of King James I, the King James version of the Bible and other editions of the Scripture printed in English became popular. By the late 16th century almost all writing was composed in a mixture of Scots and English spellings, the English forms slowly becoming more common so that by the end of the 17th century Scots spellings had almost disappeared completely. This process took slightly longer in unpublished vernacular literature and official records. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603 the Scots speaking gentry had increasing contact with English speakers and began to remodel their speech on that of their English peers. It was this remodelling that eventually led to the formation of Scottish English.

From 1610 to the 1690s during the Plantation of Ulster some 200,000 Scots settled in the north of Ireland taking what were to become Ulster Scots dialects with them. Most of these Scots came from counties in the west of Scotland, such as Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, and Galloway, but others came from the Borders. The Ulster-Scots language has been greatly influenced in pronunciation by Hiberno-English. Additionally, it has loan-words from Irish.

== Modern Scots ==

In the 18th century &#x27;polite society&#x27; now considered Scots as &#x27;provincial and unrefined&#x27; and much of the gentry endeavoured to rid itself of the former national tongue. Elocutionists such as Thomas Sheridan and John Walker were employed to teach Scots, both in London and Scotland, the formalities of proper English. However, this status was not universally accepted by all educated Scots of the period and a new literary Scots came into being. Unlike Middle Scots, it was usually based on contemporary colloquial speech. Its orthography was generally an adaptation of the imported standard, though some orthographic features from Middle Scots continued to be used. This modern literary Scots was exemplified by Allan Ramsay and his followers, and their successors such as Robert Burns. Many writers and publishers found it advantageous to use English forms and copious apostrophes to secure a larger English readership unfamiliar with Scots. The pronunciation undoubtedly remained Scots as the rhymes reveal. Early in the 19th century the publication of John Jamieson&#x27;s &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scots Language&quot; was accompanied by a renewed interest in Scots among the middle and upper classes. In this period the absence of an official standard or socially acceptable norm led to further dialect divergence.

<doc id="455520" wikidata="Q528079" url="?curid=455520" title="The Big Buddha (Hong Kong)">
<text>The Big Buddha is a large bronze image of Buddha, completed in 1993, and located at Ngong Ping, near Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, Hong Kong.

==Construction==
The image’s base is a model of the one in the United Kingdom. One of the five large Buddha images in China, it is enthroned on a lotus on top of a three-platform altar. Surrounding it are six smaller bronze images known as &quot;The Offering of the Six Devas&quot; that are posed offering flowers, incense, lamp, ointment, fruit, and music to the Buddha, representing the Six Perfections of generosity, morality, patience, zeal, meditation, and wisdom, necessary for Enlightenment in life. .

The tall image weighs over , and was constructed from 202 bronze pieces. In addition to the exterior components, there is a strong steel framework inside to support the heavy load. Visitors have to climb 268 steps to reach the Buddha, though the site also features a small winding road for vehicles to provide access for disabled people. The Buddha&#x27;s right hand is raised, representing the removal of affliction, while the left rests open on his lap in a gesture of generosity.

The monument also features three internal exhibit floors beneath the image: the halls of the Universe, of Benevolent Merit and of Remembrance. One of the most renowned features inside is a relic of Gautama Buddha, consisting of some of his alleged cremated remains.

==History==
The Big Buddha was constructed beginning in 1990, and was finished on 29 December 1993, which the Chinese reckon as the day of the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment. When the image was completed, monks from around the world were invited to the opening ceremony. Distinguished visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and the United States all took part in the proceedings.

On 18 October 1999, the Hong Kong Post Office issued a definitive issue of landmark stamps, of which the HK$2.50 value depicts The Big Buddha. On 22 May 2012, it was also featured on the HK$3 value of the Five Festival set, this one celebrating the birth of Sakyamuni Buddha.

==Visiting and access==

Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha are open to the public between 10:00 and 17:30. Access to the outside of the Buddha is free of charge, but there is an admission fee to go inside the Buddha.

Visitors can reach the site by bus or taxi, travelling first to Mui Wo (also known as &quot;Silvermine Bay&quot;) via ferry from the Outlying Islands piers in Central (pier No. 6) or to Tung Chung station via the MTR, or cable car. Visitors may then travel to and from the Buddha via the following bus routes:

*Mui Wo ↔ Ngong Ping — NLB No. 2
*Tung Chung ↔ Ngong Ping – NLB No. 23

The Ngong Ping 360 gondola lift between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping (25 minutes).

<text>The brothers of Jesus or the adelphoi () are named in the New Testament as James, Joses (a form of Joseph), Simon, Jude, and unnamed sisters are mentioned in Mark and Matthew. They may have been: (1) sons of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Joseph; (2) sons of Joseph by a former marriage; or (3) sons of Mary of Clopas, named in Mark 15:40 as the &quot;mother of James and Joses&quot;, who has been identified as either the sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus, or a sister-in-law to Joseph. 

Those who uphold the perpetual virginity of Mary reject the idea of biological brethren and maintain that the brothers and sisters were either cousins of Jesus (option 3, the position of the Catholic Church) or children of Joseph from a previous marriage (option 2, the Eastern Orthodox Church). Some Lutheran Churches have accepted both option 2 and option 3 as being valid explanations for the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary.

== Etymology ==
According to context, the Greek plural noun ἀδελφοί (&quot;adelphoi&quot;), from a- (&#x27;same&#x27;) and delphys (&#x27;womb&#x27;), may mean physical brothers, physical brothers and sisters, figurative brothers, or figurative brothers and sisters. &quot;Adelphoi&quot; sometimes means more than a blood brother, e.g., Gen 29:12; Rom 9:3 (kinsman); Matt 5:22–3 (neighbor); Mark 6:17–8 (step-brother). In such instances the context must determine the meaning. &quot;Adelphoi&quot; is distinct from &quot;anepsios&quot;, meaning cousin, nephew, niece, and this word is never used to describe James and the other siblings of Jesus. The word &quot;anepsios&quot; is only employed once in the entire New Testament, being used in Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Colossians. Although neither Hebrew nor Aramaic had a word for &quot;cousin&quot;, both customarily spoke of a cousin as a &quot;son of an uncle&quot; (Heb. &quot;ben dod&quot;; Aram. &quot;bar dad&quot;) and the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, never translates either expression as &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot;.

The Vulgate renders with the Latin word &quot;frater&quot; (e.g. Mark 6:3), which, even in classical Latin, can also mean &quot;maternal cousin&quot; or &quot;paternal cousin&quot;.

==&quot;Adelphoi&quot; (brethren) of Jesus==

Mark 6 names James, Joses, Judas (conventionally known in English as Jude) and Simon as the brothers of Jesus, and Matthew 13, which probably used Mark as its source, gives the same names in different order, James, Joseph, Simon and Judas. &quot;Joseph&quot; is simply the longer form of &quot;Joses&quot;, and so it appears that James was the eldest and Joses/Joseph the next, but as Matthew has reversed the order of the last two it is uncertain who was the youngest. Unnamed sisters are mentioned in Mark 6:3 and Matthew 13:56 and may be implied in Mark 3:35 and Matthew 12:46, but their number is unknown.

The gospels indicate a rift between Jesus and his brothers in the early part of his ministry (see Mark 3:31-35 and the parallel passages in Matthew 12:46-50 and Luke 8:19-21), and they never appear among his followers during his lifetime. John has Jesus&#x27; brothers advising him to go to Judea despite being aware that his life would be in danger, and they are absent from his burial, which should have been their responsibility, but they do appear in Acts 1:14 with the Eleven (i.e., the remaining disciples after the betrayal by Judas Iscariot): &quot;These all (the Eleven) were persevering in prayer along with the women, with Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.&quot;

In 1 Corinthians 15:3–7 Paul lists a &quot;James&quot; among those to whom the risen Christ had appeared, and most scholars agree that this refers to James the brother of Jesus. The 2nd century historian Hegesippus (c.110 – 180 AD) reports that James the brother of Jesus came to be known as James the Just, and Eusebius of Caesarea (died 339) says that he spent so much of his life in prayer that his knees became &quot;like the knees of a camel.&quot; According to Clement of Alexandria, reported by Eusebius, he was chosen as bishop of Jerusalem, and from the time when Peter left Jerusalem after Herod&#x27;s attempt to kill him (Acts 12) he appears as the principal authority in the Jerusalem church, presiding at the Council of Jerusalem recorded in Acts 15. In Galatians 1:19 Paul tells how he went to Jerusalem a few years after his conversion and met Cephas (Peter) but no other apostles, only &quot;James, the brother of the Lord&quot;; Paul&#x27;s Greek leaves it unclear whether he includes, or does not include, James among the apostles. He goes on to describe a second visit fourteen years later when he met the &quot;pillars of the Church&quot;, James and Peter and John; James is mentioned first and seems to be the primary leader among these three. In chapter 2 he describes how he and Peter were later in Antioch and in the habit of dining with gentile Christians in breach of Jewish torah, until &quot;certain people from James&quot; came and Peter withdrew, &quot;fearing those who belong to the circumcision.&quot; The 1st century historian Josephus tells how he was martyred by the Jews in 62 CE on charges of breaking the Jewish Law.

Paul records in 1 Corinthians that the other brothers of Jesus (that is, other than James, who is portrayed as rooted in Jerusalem) travelled as evangelists, and that they were married (&quot;Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?&quot; - 1 Corinthians 9:5). The 3rd century Apostolic Father Eusebius left a list of 12 bishops of the early church, of whom two, Joseph/Joses and Jude, may be the brothers of Jesus. The number of sisters and their names are not specified in the New Testament, but the apocryphal 3rd century Gospel of Philip mentions a Mary, and Salome, who appears in the late 2nd century Gospel of James, is arguably the other sister.

The author of the epistle of James introduces himself as &quot;James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. He does not identify himself as the brother of Jesus or an apostle or a leader of the church in any way, but one recent study characterises this letter as &quot;the most Jewish text in the New Testament&quot;. The epistle of Jude identifies its author as &quot;Jude...the brother of James&quot;, but today there is widespread, although not unanimous, support for the view that it was composed in the early part of the 2nd century by an unknown author borrowing the name of the brother of Jesus. Hegesippus mentions a Simon or Simeon (the names are equivalent) who became leader of the Jerusalem church after the death of James, but makes this Simon a son of Clopas, the brother of Joseph.

Of the &quot;brothers,&quot; however, no direct relationship to Mary or Joseph is ever indicated. Only Jesus is referred to as &quot;son of Mary,&quot; &quot;the son of Mary,&quot; or &quot;son of Joseph.&quot; Only Jesus is the subject of the Old Testament messianic prophecies and only of him is the genealogy proposed.

==Relationship to Jesus==
The 19th century scholar J.B. Lightfoot identified three possible positions on the relationship to Jesus of those called his brothers and sisters by reference to their 4th century advocates, namely the Helvidian (after Helvidius, who wrote ), the Epiphanian (after Epiphanius of Salamis, 315-403), and the Hieronymian (after Jerome, 349-419/20). A fourth position, not mentioned by Lightfoot, is that the adelphoi were full-blooded brothers and sisters of Jesus.

===Full blood-brothers and sisters of Jesus===
This position rejects the virgin birth of Jesus and argues his brothers and sisters were full siblings. Main proponents of this belief were the Ebionites, a 2nd century Jewish Christian sect, who rejected both the incarnation and divinity of Jesus.

===Half-brothers and sisters of Jesus (Helvidian view)===
The view of Helvidius was that the &quot;adelphoi&quot; were half siblings of Jesus born to Mary and Joseph after the firstborn Jesus. This is the most common Protestant position.

The following hypothetical family tree is based on the book &quot;Jesus and His World&quot; written by John J Rousseau and Rami Arav: 




===Stepbrothers of Jesus (Epiphanian view)===
The Epiphanian view, named after its main proponent, the fourth-century bishop Epiphanius, and championed by the third century theologian Origen and fourth-century bishop Eusebius, the “brothers” and “sisters” mentioned in the New Testament are sons of Joseph from a previous marriage, and hence stepbrothers of Jesus. This is still the official position of the Eastern Orthodox Church.



===Cousins of Jesus (Hieronymian view)===
The Hieronymian view was put forward in the 4th century by Jerome, who argued that not only Mary, but Joseph too, had been a life-long virgin. Apparently voicing the general opinion of the Church, he held that the &quot;brothers of Jesus&quot; were the sons of Mary the &quot;mother of James and Joses&quot; mentioned in Mark 15:40, whom he identified with the wife of Clopas and sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus mentioned in John 19:25. The Catholic Church continues to teach that the adelphoi were cousins of Jesus.

The following family tree is from Richard Bauckham, &quot;Jude and the Relatives of James&quot;: 



Jerome&#x27;s argument produces the unlikely result of two sisters both named Mary. A modern variant eliminates this by identifying Clopas as the brother of Joseph, thereby making the two Marys sisters-in-law; in this version Jesus&#x27; cousin Simon is identified with Symeon the second leader of the church in Jerusalem. 

The following family tree is from Richard Bauckham, &quot;Jude and the Relatives of James&quot;:



== Development of the tradition ==

From the 2nd century onward the developing emphasis on ascetism and celibacy as the superior form of Christian practice, together with an emphasis on the chastity of Mary, led to the idea that she had been a virgin not only before, but during and after, the birth of Christ. There is no direct biblical basis for this idea, which in its earliest assertion appears in the mid-2nd century Protoevangelium of James; this depicts Mary as a life-long virgin, Joseph as an old man who marries her without physical desire, and the brothers of Jesus as Joseph&#x27;s sons by an earlier marriage.

By the 3rd century, the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary had become well established, but the unequivocal scriptural references to the brethren of Jesus raised obvious problems. The heretical antidicomarianites (&quot;opponents of Mary&quot;) maintained that, when Joseph became Mary&#x27;s husband, he was a widower with six children, and he had normal marital relations with Mary, but they later held Jesus was not born of these relations. Bonosus was a bishop who in the late 4th century held Mary had other children after Jesus, for which the other bishops of his province condemned him. Important orthodox theologians such as Hippolytus (170–235), Eusebius (260/265–339/340) and Epiphanius (c. 310/320–403) defended the perpetual virginity of Mary. Eusebius and Epiphanius held the &quot;adelphoi&quot; were Joseph&#x27;s children from a previous marriage. Epiphanius adds Joseph became the father of James and his three brothers (Joses, Simeon, Judah) and two sisters (a Salome and a Mary or a Salome and an Anna) with James being the elder sibling. James and his siblings were not children of Mary but were Joseph&#x27;s children from a previous marriage. Joseph&#x27;s first wife died; many years later, at the age of eighty, &quot;he took Mary (mother of Jesus)&quot;. According to Epiphanius the Scriptures call them &quot;brothers of the Lord&quot; to confound their opponents. Origen (184–254) also wrote &quot;according to the Gospel of Peter the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before Mary&quot;.

The &quot;History of Joseph the Carpenter&quot;, probably written in Egypt in the 5th century and heavily indebted to the Protoevangelium of James, depicts Joseph as an old widower with children from a previous marriage, thus clarifying the New Testament references to Jesus&#x27; brothers.

According to the surviving fragments of the work &quot;Exposition of the Sayings of the Lord&quot; of the Apostolic Father Papias of Hierapolis, who lived circa 70–163 AD, &quot;Mary the wife of Cleophas or Alphaeus&quot; would be the mother of James the Just, Simon, Judas (identified as Jude the Apostle), and Joseph (Joses). Papias identifies this &quot;Mary&quot; as the sister of Mary, mother of Jesus, and thus as the maternal aunt of Jesus. The Anglican theologian J.B. Lightfoot dismissed Papias&#x27; evidence as spurious.

The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which was probably written in the seventh century, states the brothers of Jesus were his cousins.

Both the Eastern and Western traditional churches maintain that Mary was a perpetual virgin; early Protestant leaders, including the Reformer Martin Luther, and Reformed theologian Huldrych Zwingli, also held this view, as did John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism. &quot;Eine Christliche Lehrtafel&quot; (A Christian Catechism), issued by Anabaptist leader Balthasar Hubmaier, teaches the perpetual virginity of the Virgin Mary too. The Catholic Church, following Jerome, conclude that the &quot;adelphoi&quot; were Jesus&#x27; cousins, while the Eastern Orthodox Church, following Eusebius and Epiphanius, argue they were Joseph&#x27;s children from a previous marriage. Lutherans have accepted both views as being valid explanations of the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary, while Anglicans and Methodists concur with the latter view.

Other Christian denominations, such as some Baptist groups, view the &quot;adelphoi&quot; as Jesus&#x27; half-brothers or do not specify, since the accounts in the Gospels do not speak of Mary&#x27;s relationship to them but only to Jesus.

== Absence of Jesus&#x27; brothers ==
There are some events in scripture where brothers or sisters of Jesus are not shown, e.g., when Jesus was lost in the Temple and during his crucifixion. reports the visit of Mary, Joseph, and Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem when Jesus was 12 years old but does not mention any siblings. Robert Eisenman is of the belief Luke sought to minimise the importance of Jesus&#x27; family by whatever means possible, editing James and Jesus&#x27; brothers out of the Gospel record. The Catholic apologist Karl Keating argues Mary and Joseph rushed without hesitation straight back to Jerusalem when they realized Jesus was lost, which they would surely have thought twice about doing if there were other children (Jesus&#x27; blood brothers or sisters) to look after.

The Gospel of John records the sayings of Jesus on the cross, i.e., the pair of commands &quot;Woman, behold your son!&quot; and &quot;Behold, thy mother!&quot; (), then states &quot;from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home&quot;. Since the era of the Church Fathers this statement has been used to reason that after the death of Jesus there were no other biological children to look after Mary, and she had to be entrusted to the disciple. Constantine Zalalas argues it would have been against Jewish custom for Jesus to give his mother to the care of the disciple if Mary had other living sons, because the eldest son would always take responsibility for his mother. Karl Keating says, &quot;It is hard to imagine why Jesus would have disregarded family ties and made this provision for his Mother if these four [James, Joseph/Joses, Simon, Jude] were also her sons&quot;. Pope John Paul II also says the command &quot;Behold your son!&quot; was the entrustment of the disciple to Mary in order to fill the maternal gap left by the death of her only son on the cross. Vincent Taylor points out difficulties in this interpretation of the text: it ignores both the fact that Jesus&#x27; brothers opposed his claims, and the position of honour of John, the beloved disciple.

==Descendants of Jesus&#x27; family==
The early Christian historian Sextus Julius Africanus (died ), in his &quot;Genealogy of the Holy Gospels&quot;, referred to &quot;relatives of our Lord according to the flesh&quot; whom he called &quot;desposyni&quot;, meaning &quot;from the Lord&#x27;s family&quot;. Of these individuals, only the 2nd century Bishop of Jerusalem Judah Kyriakos is historically attested by name.

<text>The Shrine Auditorium is a landmark large-event venue in Los Angeles, California. It is also the headquarters of the Al Malaikah Temple, a division of the Shriners. It was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 139) in 1975, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

==History==
Opened in 1926, the current Shrine Auditorium replaced an earlier 1906 Al Malaikah Temple which had been destroyed by a fire on January 11, 1920. The fire gutted the structure in just 30 minutes, and nearly killed six firefighters in the process.

In the late 1960s, the Shrine was referred to as &quot;The Pinnacle&quot; by the audiences of rock concerts.

In 2002, the auditorium underwent a $15 million renovation that upgraded the stage with state-of-the-art lighting and rigging systems, and included new roofing and air conditioning for both the Auditorium and Expo Center, modernized concession stands, additional restrooms, repainting of the Expo Center, and a new performance plaza and parking garage. The entire complex follows a Moroccan architectural motif.
==Building==
The new auditorium was designed in the Moorish Revival style by San Francisco-based theater architect G. Albert Lansburgh, with local architects John C. Austin and A. M. Edelman associated. When built, the auditorium could hold 1,200 people on stage and seat an audience of 6,442. An engineer who consulted on the project said that the steel truss supporting the balcony was the largest ever constructed.

The Shrine Auditorium seats approximately 6,300 people (reduced during the 2002 renovation from the original 6,700 capacity) and has a stage wide and deep.

The Auditorium features two boxes above the orchestra level holding 40 people each and seven loges on the balcony holding between 36 and 47 seats each (total capacity of the loges: 274). Of the remaining seats, 2,964 are on the orchestra level and 2,982 on the balcony level.

Adjacent to the Auditorium is the Shrine Exposition Hall. This is a multi-purpose event facility. It features of exhibit and meeting space—34,000 in the main level and 20,000 in an open mezzanine. The Exposition Hall has a capacity of 5,000 patrons. Trade shows, banquets, conventions and electronic music festivals, among other events, have been held there.


==Notable events==

The Shrine Auditorium has hosted a number of events, mainly for entertainment:

<doc id="455523" wikidata="Q1536853" url="?curid=455523" title="Gomez (band)">
<text>Gomez are an English indie rock band from Southport, Merseyside, comprising Ian Ball (vocals, guitar), Paul &quot;Blackie&quot; Blackburn (bass), Tom Gray (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Ben Ottewell (vocals, guitars) and Olly Peacock (drums, synths, computers). The band has three singers and four songwriters, employing traditional and electronic instruments. Their music covers the genres of blues, indie, alternative, rock, folk, psychedelic and experimental.

==History==
===Formation (1995–1997)===
Guitarist and vocalist Ian Ball and drummer Olly Peacock are long-time friends, having played in a three-piece band from the ages of 14 to 18. They met bassist Paul Blackburn and multi-instrumentalist Tom Gray at college. Ian Ball met vocalist/guitarist Ben Ottewell at Sheffield University.

The band played its first gig together in 1996 in Leeds at the Hyde Park Social Club on Ash Grove. At the time, they did not have a formal name. The band left a sign out which read &quot;Gomez in here&quot;, for a friend of theirs whose surname was Gomez, to indicate that it was the site of their first gig. People saw the sign and assumed that the band&#x27;s name was Gomez, and it was later made official.

The band started recording four-track demos in Peacock&#x27;s father&#x27;s garage in Southport during the summer of 1996. The demos were given to Stephen Fellows (later their manager) who distributed them to four record labels. The band, having played only one performance, decided against playing showcases in London and instead made the record companies travel to Red Tape rehearsal studios. After several weeks of playing to over 25 labels, the band signed to Hut Records (Virgin Records), in September 1997.

===&quot;Bring It On&quot; (1997–1998) ===

After signing to Hut Records in September 1997, they began recording their debut album. They entered Parr Street Studios with engineer Ken Nelson, recording new songs and improving the mixes of the demos. The band self-produced, and the album was certified platinum. A season of English Festivals (including two performances at Glastonbury) followed. The band won the Mercury Music Prize in September 1998.

In 1998, Philips Electronics chose Gomez to cover The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Getting Better&quot; for an ad campaign for Philips&#x27; new lines of flat panel and high-definition television sets. The cover song was not released on an album until 2000 with &quot;Abandoned Shopping Trolley Hotline&quot;, a collection of B-sides.

===&quot;Liquid Skin&quot; (1999–2000) ===

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Liquid Skin&quot;, was released in 1999, leading Gomez to success on the British and Australian albums charts. The band also made the Billboard Heatseeker chart for the first time. After winning the Mercury Prize, the band went back to Parr Street Studios, recording as much material as they could between tours. Ken Nelson engineered once again and the band self-produced. The album went platinum and touring followed, including a performance at Glastonbury Festival on the second stage.

===&quot;In Our Gun&quot; (2000–2003) ===

The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;In Our Gun&quot;, was released in 2002. It made the top 10 on the UK charts and the top 50 on the Australian charts. The single &quot;Shot Shot&quot; charted in the UK top 40, the Portugal top 20, and the Billboard Heatseeker chart. The band produced and recorded the record in Batsford Manor, Gloucestershire, with additional recordings in Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios. Giving the album a perfect score in his review for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Matt Cibula wrote &quot;everyone who doesn’t like this record is insane in a bad way. Screw Wilco; &quot;In Our Gun&quot; is sounding very much like the Album of the Year.&quot;

===&quot;Split the Difference&quot; (2004–2005) ===

While Gomez&#x27;s first three albums were self-produced, the band worked with Tchad Blake as producer for their fourth record. The band were fans of his compressed sounds as heard on Los Lobos and Latin Playboys recordings. The album was met with mixed critical response, with &quot;Allmusic&quot; rating it as four stars out of five and &quot;BBC Internet Music Reviews&quot; describing it as &quot;one of the finest releases of the year so far. If you were one of those people who wrote them off two years ago, it&#x27;s time to get listening again.&quot; However, the album received less favourable reviews from a number of other sources, including &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; and &quot;NME&quot;.

The band built a studio in Portslade, just outside Brighton, England (where most of them were residing). They worked independently for months recording, until they developed a record with Tchad Blake at Real World Studios. In 2007, Gomez recorded a cover of The Band&#x27;s hit &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Endless Highway: The Music of The Band&quot;. Their song &quot;How We Operate&quot; was played in the final scene of the film &quot;The Hitcher&quot;. Gomez continued to tour, including a co-headlining 2007 US tour with label-mate Ben Kweller. The band toured Australia and New Zealand before going back to the United States for a second headlining leg of their US tour. On 2 March 2007, Gomez recorded a concert at the Vic Theater in Chicago, Illinois, that was streamed via MSN Music. Ian Ball released a solo project, an album entitled &quot;Who Goes There&quot;. In 2008, Gomez opened several shows for Dave Matthews Band. Their album reached the top 40 in the UK and Australia. The first single &quot;Catch Me Up&quot; entered the UK top 40 in March 2004 and &quot;Silence&quot; was released as the second single.

Virgin/EMI then closed down Hut Recordings; the band asked to be released from their contract and Virgin agreed.

===&quot;How We Operate&quot; (2006–2007) ===

Gomez&#x27;s fifth studio record, &quot;How We Operate,&quot; was produced by Gil Norton and released on 2 May 2006. The record was developed in the band&#x27;s studio and later recorded in 6 weeks at RAK Studios, London. The album&#x27;s title track was featured in the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;Deterioration of the Fight or Flight Response&quot;, and later covered by Kevin McKidd in the season seven episode &quot;Song Beneath the Song&quot;. On 14 February 2006, their song &quot;Get Miles&quot; was featured in the &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Distractions&quot;, and on 6 March 2007, their song &quot;See the World&quot; was featured in the &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Half-Wit&quot;. &quot;See the World&quot; was also featured in the &quot;Bones&quot; episode &quot;Widow&#x27;s Son in the Windshield&quot;.

In 2005, Gomez signed a deal with Dave Matthews&#x27; ATO Records. Under the new label, the band released their first live album, &quot;Out West&quot;, in June 2005. The double disc CD was compiled from shows recorded at San Francisco&#x27;s Fillmore Theater in January 2005. In January 2006, the band performed on Jam Cruise before returning to the studio to put the final touches on &quot;How We Operate&quot;. After playing the SxSW music festival in Austin, they debuted material from the upcoming release in several US cities. The band&#x27;s 2006 spring tour included stops in Asheville, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco, and Portland. They also performed at several large outdoor festivals, including the Beale Street and Bonnaroo Festivals in Tennessee, the Jazzfest in New Orleans and Sasquatch Festival in George, WA.

A collection titled &quot;Five Men in a Hut&quot; was released on 17 October 2006. The two-disc album consists of released and unreleased tracks recorded under the Hut/Virgin label from 1998–2004. A DVD with music videos and interviews from their time with Hut was also released. They were also one of the bands featured on a John Lennon tribute aired on BBC Radio 2 to mark the 25th anniversary of the musician&#x27;s death. Gomez performed &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; by The Beatles, and &quot;Instant Karma!&quot; by Lennon. &quot;How We Operate&quot; is also the ending song to the 2007 remake of the horror film &quot;The Hitcher&quot;, and acts as the title music for the pilot episode of &quot;The Riches&quot;.

===&quot;A New Tide&quot; (2008–2010) ===

A wide range of styles were incorporated into Gomez&#x27;s sound for their next record &quot;A New Tide&quot;, including blues, Krautrock and psychedelia. The record saw Gomez accompanied by a number of guest musicians, including vocalist Amy Millan, bassist Josh Abrams, cellist Oliver Krauss, and multi-instrumentalist Stuart Bogie.

&quot;A New Tide&quot; was released on 31 March in the US, in the UK and Europe on 30 March, and in Australia on 28 March 2009. Gomez recorded &quot;A New Tide&quot; in Chicago, and played festivals including Lollapalooza that year. The album marked a return to their more experimental roots, in particular with songs such as &quot;Win Park Slope&quot; and &quot;Airstream Driver&quot;. With this album, the band wanted to create a collection of songs that would work well at live gigs. With the band members scattered across two continents, early tracks were written and recorded individually and then merged online. The material took on its ultimate shape when Gomez convened in studios in Chicago and Charlottesville with producer Brian Deck.

In early 2004, Ian Ball and Olly Peacock were involved in a project called Operation Aloha with 14 other musicians including members from Phantom Planet and Maroon 5. They produced an album over the course of 30 days in Maui, Hawaii. A self-titled album was released on 12 May 2009.

In April 2009, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Little Pieces&quot; was used in the 19th episode of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; season 5. It played at the start of the episode in a montage scene. In June 2009, Gomez opened for Pearl Jam on the European leg of the Backspacer Tour.

===&quot;Whatever&#x27;s on Your Mind&quot; (2011–2020) ===

Gomez released their seventh studio album, &quot;Whatever&#x27;s on Your Mind&quot;, on 21 June 2011. As with their last album, production on &quot;Whatever&#x27;s on Your Mind&quot; was overseen by the band as well as Brian Deck.

=== Current activities (2020-present) ===
Since 2020, Tom Gray has been lobbying the British government to regulate music streaming with the Broken Record campaign group. He stood as a Labour Party candidate for Brighton Pavilion in the 2024 general election, but failed to win the seat.

<text>The Amiot 143 (sometimes written as 143M or 143 M.5) was a 1930s French 5-seat &quot;Multiplace de Combat&quot; (M.5) designed to meet 1928 specifications for a monoplane capable of day and night bombing, long-range reconnaissance and bomber escort.

==Design and development==
Amiot received an order for two prototype Amiot 140s, to be evaluated against the competing Bleriot 137, Breguet 410 and SPCA 30. The Amiot 140 was a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. The pilot sat in an open cockpit, with positions for gunners in the nose and dorsal positions. A glazed gondola under the forward fuselage carried a bombardier/gunner, ensuring that the gunners had a clear field of fire all around the aircraft. The Amiot was intended to be powered by two Lorraine 18G Orion water-cooled W engines but these were unavailable and the first prototype was fitted with Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr engines to allow flight testing, making its maiden flight on 12 April 1931. The second prototype was completed in February 1932 but the continued unavailability of its intended engines, either the original Lorraine-Dietrichs or turbocharged Hispano-Suizas, meant that it never flew. Despite this, on 23 November 1933 an order was placed for 40 Amiot 140s, to be powered by Lorraine 12Q Eider engines.

The French Air Ministry had meanwhile revised its requirements, concentrating on the bombing role and asking for better performance. Amiot redesigned the aircraft to meet these requirements and incorporate lessons learned during testing of the Amiot 140. The gondola under the fuselage was enlarged, allowing easier operation of the aircraft&#x27;s guns and a radio-operator was added, bringing the crew to five. Manually operated gun turrets were provided in the nose and dorsal positions. Orders were placed for two prototypes, differing only in the engines fitted, with the Amiot 142 having Hispano-Suiza 12Y engines and the Amiot 143 having Gnome-Rhone 14K radial engines. The 143 flew first, on 1 August 1934, while the 142 didn&#x27;t fly until January 1935. As it was decided to allocate the Hispano-Suiza engines to fighters, the Amiot 143 was selected, and the existing order for 40 Amiot 140s was converted to 143s.

The Amiot 143 had the same high-wing and fixed undercarriage as the Amiot 140, with the wing thick enough to allow crew access to the engines by a tunnel between the wing spars. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit, level with the leading edge of the wing and the navigator-bombardier, who was also provided with flying controls, sat in the extensively glazed gondola beneath the pilot. The radio operator sat towards the rear of the gondola and in early aircraft operated two Lewis guns. Nose and dorsal turrets, each carrying a Lewis gun, completed the defensive armament, while the gondola also housed an internal bomb-bay. After 40 aircraft had been completed, the design was revised, with the aircraft being fitted with a longer nose (increasing overall length from , a revised fuel system and with the Lewis guns in the nose, dorsal turrets and ventral position each being replaced by single MAC 1934 machine guns, with a fourth gun for the navigator-bombardier firing through a hatch in the floor.

Deliveries of the design began in April 1935 and continued until March 1937, with a total of 138 being built. An improved version, the Amiot 144 was built to meet 1933 requirement for a &quot;Multiplace de Combat&quot;, fitted with a retractable undercarriage. First flying on 18 January 1936, only one was built.

==Operational history==
The Amiot 143 entered service in July 1935, with deliveries continuing until 1938. Six were going to be delivered to the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War. however there is no evidence that these were delivered during the war. By the time the last deliveries were made in March 1938, the Amiot was obsolete and was already being replaced by more modern aircraft such as the Bloch MB.131. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Amiot 143s still equipped 5 metropolitan &quot;groupes&quot; together with an African-based &quot;groupe&quot;.

During the Phoney War, Amiot 143 &quot;groupes&quot; carried out reconnaissance and leaflet raids over Germany. 87 Amiot 143 remained in front line service on 10 May 1940, of which 50 equipped four metropolitan &quot;groupes&quot;: GBs I/34 and II/34 in the north, GBs I/38 and II/38 in the East and 17 equipped one African groupe, GB II/63, which was in the process of re-equipping with Martin 167Fs. Following the start of the Battle of France, the Amiot 143 was mainly used in night attacks against German airfields and lines of communications, and experienced relatively low losses. An exception was a daylight raid by 10 Amiots from GBs I/34, II/34 and II/38 against German bridgeheads near Sedan on 14 May 1940. Despite having a fighter escort, two Amiots were shot down while a third force-landed before returning to base.

52 Amiot 143s were in the Unoccupied Zone and 25 were in French North Africa. They were reorganized into GBs I/38 and II/38 and were used until July 1941 when they were replaced by LeO 451 bombers. Some Amiots of II/38 served as transports for the French in Syria. This &quot;groupe&quot; later joined the Allies after their landings in Africa. The last Amiot 143 was retired from service in February 1944. A few Amiot 143 are reported to have been commandeered by the Germans and used as transports. Only 11 were left in the Unoccupied Zone when it was occupied by the Germans in 1943 and only three were airworthy. Had the war gone on a little longer for France, it is likely that all of the Amiot 143 would have become trainers, having been replaced by more modern bombers such as the LeO 451.

<text>THQ Inc. was an American video game company based in Agoura Hills, California. It was founded in April 1990 by Jack Friedman, originally in Calabasas, and became a public company the following year through a reverse merger takeover. Initially working in the toy business, it expanded into the video game business through several acquisitions before shifting its focus away from toys entirely. THQ continued its trend of acquiring companies throughout the 2000s.

The company published both internally created and externally licensed content in its product portfolio. THQ&#x27;s internally created game series included &quot;Darksiders&quot;, &quot;De Blob&quot;, &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot;, &quot;MX vs. ATV&quot;, &quot;Red Faction&quot;, and &quot;Saints Row&quot;, among others. The company also held exclusive, long-term licensing agreements with sports and entertainment content creators, such as Disney, DreamWorks Animation, Nickelodeon, and WWE.

After years of financial struggles, stock value drop, and debt, THQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2012 and commenced liquidation of its assets the following month. Several properties were auctioned to other companies, while the remaining staff were laid off. The &quot;THQ&quot; trademark was eventually acquired by developer Nordic Games (which had also acquired some of THQ&#x27;s auctioned-off properties) in 2014 and assumed the name &quot;THQ Nordic&quot; in 2016, while continuing a variety of their franchises under said name.

== History ==
=== Background and foundation (1990–1999) ===
THQ Inc. was founded by LJN co-founder Jack Friedman in April 1990. &quot;THQ&quot; is an initialism for &quot;Toy Headquarters&quot;. THQ acquired New Ventures, a division of Broderbund, in September 1990. In 1991, Trinity Acquisition Corp, a NASDAQ-listed special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), agreed to acquire and merge with THQ in a reverse merger takeover. The deal was a stock swap valued at about $33 million, with THQ&#x27;s shareholders owning 51.7% of the new entity. THQ&#x27;s name was retained for the new company, its ticker symbol was changed to &quot;THQI&quot;, and Friedman was named as its president. THQ then acquired video game developer Black Pearl Software of Chicago in 1993. Following the acquisition, THQ would use the Black Pearl Software name for their Sega games, while the Malibu Games name would be used for the Nintendo games.

THQ withdrew completely from the toy business in 1994 to focus solely on video game production. Around the same time, the company entered into a deal with Electronic Arts to license five titles for various consoles. Jack Friedman then left the company in 1995 to co-found the toy manufacturer Jakks Pacific.

At the Winter CES 1995, THQ signed an expanded deal with Electronic Arts to develop games for their 16-bit and 8-bit home consoles and handheld titles. From then on, the Black Pearl Software name would be used for 8-bit and 16-bit games, while THQ introduced the Kokopeli Digital Studios brand name for their 32-bit games.

In 1997, THQ was reincorporated as a Delaware Corporation, and in 1999 acquired San Jose video game developer Pacific Coast Power &amp; Light.

In June 1998, the company entered into a ten-year 50/50 joint venture with Jakks Pacific (entitled THQ/Jakks Pacific LLC) to acquire the WWF (later WWE) video game license, previously held by Acclaim Entertainment. The deal, which would begin in October 1999, would correspond with two titles per year that THQ would handle product development and sales for. 

In 1999, it signed a deal to publish &quot;Power Rangers&quot; video games. Also that year, it signed a licensing agreement with British game developer Codemasters to bring their titles to their handheld market.

===Company growth and acquisitions (2000–2009)===

In February 2000, THQ faced a class action lawsuit over a violation of federal security laws due to nondisclosure of material information. In September of the same year, the company expanded its internal product development capabilities with the acquisition of Volition located in Champaign, Illinois. Since then, THQ&#x27;s internal studio system grew to eleven studios across the globe with distinct capabilities across all viable gaming platforms. Some of these studios, such as Relic Entertainment, Vigil Games, Blue Tongue Entertainment, Juice Games, Kaos Studios and Volition, worked on games for next generation consoles as well as PCs. THQ went on to acquire Vigil Games in 2006.

In 2000, it signed a deal with Fox Interactive to bring five of the titles to the Game Boy Color market, such as the &quot;&quot; franchise. In 2001, THQ obtained an extended agreement with Nickelodeon to produce video games based on their franchises, as well as computer game rights to &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and &quot;Rocket Power&quot; and console and computer rights to other Nickelodeon shows like &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. The agreement also covered games based on original intellectual properties, such as &quot;Tak and the Power of Juju&quot;, with the potential that THQ would release a game first, followed by an animated cartoon on Nickelodeon. In 2004, THQ signed an agreement with MGA Entertainment to publish video games based on the Bratz fashion doll line.

On May 10, 2007, THQ reported its highest annual sales figures and net profits ever for the fiscal year which ended on March 31. THQ&#x27;s revenues reached over $1 billion. In March 2008, THQ announced the development of the world&#x27;s first ever cheerleading game using the Wii Balance Board. Not long after, on November 3, 2008, the company closed five of its internal studios: Paradigm Entertainment, Mass Media Inc., Helixe, Locomotive Games, and Sandblast Games.
In 2009, huge declines in sales prompted THQ to form a strategic plan to cut $220 million in annual costs by 2010 and invest in &quot;fewer, better bets.&quot; Previously in 2007, THQ had a $68-million profit and $1 billion in revenue, which put it within range of their rival Activision. Many of its big-budget games sold poorly, despite having favorable reviews, as the recession hit. Its hold on kids&#x27; games based on Nickelodeon TV shows and Pixar movies slipped as kids turned to free online games playable on the Internet. With shares down 86% from the previous year and a market value of only $173 million, THQ had the possibility of being acquired by other companies. In March 2009, THQ spun off Heavy Iron Studios and Incinerator Studios as independent companies, and announced it was looking to sell Big Huge Games. Two months later in May 2009, THQ agreed to sell Big Huge Games to 38 Studios. In August 2009, THQ acquired Midway Studios San Diego for $200,000. The sale of the studio included all assets, except for the &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; video game. In December 2009, following many lawsuits between the three companies, THQ signed a standalone eight-year deal with the WWE, replacing the THQ/Jakks Pacific joint-venture deal.

===Reorganization, financial struggles (2010–2012)===
In February 2010, THQ announced that Juice Games and Rainbow Studios would be part of a reshuffle, and would now bear the title THQ Digital Warrington and THQ Digital Phoenix, respectively. The merger reportedly led to 60 job losses between THQ&#x27;s US Rainbow studio and the UK Juice Game&#x27;s studio.

In August 2010, THQ unveiled the uDraw GameTablet, a $70 accessory for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console that let gamers draw and play on their television screens. The white, 9-by-7-inch peripheral houses a Wii Remote on the left, with a doodle pad and tethered stylus on the right. THQ said more software for the uDraw would launch every couple of months.

In January 2011, THQ sold off its THQ Wireless division to a Swedish mobile company called 24MAS. On January 12, 2011, THQ unveiled its new logo. In March 2011, THQ, after its game &quot;Homefront&quot; was released, suffered a 26% stock drop. The large drop was speculated to be a result of &quot;Homefront&quot;&#x27;s poor reception.
On June 13, 2011, THQ announced the closure of Kaos Studios (the developer of &quot;Homefront&quot;) and THQ Digital Warrington (formerly Juice Games).

On July 27, 2011, THQ announced it was dropping the long-running &quot;Red Faction&quot; franchise. This was believed to be due to the poor reception over the latest game in the franchise, &quot;Red Faction: Armageddon&quot;. In the same year on August 9, 2011, THQ announced it would shift its development focus away from licensed kids and movie-based titles by closing down THQ Studio Australia and Blue Tongue in order to focus on &quot;high-quality owned IP.&quot; The company also closed down THQ Digital Phoenix (formerly Rainbow Studios), thus dropping the &quot;MX vs. ATV&quot; franchise.

In November 2011, a uDraw for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released. However, it was a commercial failure, and is considered one of the main causes of the financial woes that broke up the company.

In January 2012, THQ announced that it was exiting the licensed kids game business to focus on adult core gaming, but would continue to sell previously released titles. In February 2012, THQ also discontinued the uDraw GameTablet for the same reason.

In May 2012, THQ reported a net loss of $239.9 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. The loss was $100 million more than the previous fiscal year&#x27;s loss of $136.1 million. That same month, Jason Rubin was appointed president of the company.

THQ filed a notice with the SEC on May 25 for a June 29 stockholder&#x27;s meeting, where THQ asked stockholders to approve a reverse split of the company&#x27;s common stock. On June 4, 2012, THQ announced a deal to turn over their license for UFC games to Electronic Arts. In July 2012, THQ reported that its stockholders had approved the 1-for-10 reverse share split of its common stock to avert a delisting from the NASDAQ.

===Bankruptcy and liquidation, THQ Nordic (2012–2013)===
On November 13, 2012, THQ reported that they could not repay a $50 million loan from Wells Fargo, and were on the verge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. With its stock price plummeting from early November values bordering on $3 down to $1.16 and with long-term liabilities of $250 million, THQ was forced to delay the release dates of its flagship titles &quot;Company of Heroes 2&quot; and &quot;&quot; to March 2013. On November 29, 2012, THQ partnered with Humble Bundle to launch the Humble THQ Bundle in an effort to raise more money. By December 12, 2012, THQ sold nearly 800,000 bundles, raising around $5 million; THQ President Jason Rubin also made a purchase, spending $11,050 on the bundle. On December 19, 2012, just days after the Humble THQ bundle ended, THQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with the intention of selling THQ and all of its assets to Clearlake Capital with Centerview Partners handling the sale. Skip Paul, a former colleague of Jason Rubin, helped orchestrate the proposed stalking horse bid from Clearlake Capital Group.

However, the bid was ultimately denied by Judge Mary F. Walrath and creditors instead approved an individual auction of THQ&#x27;s properties, which went ahead on January 22, 2013, one day prior to closure. At the auction, the &quot;Homefront&quot; franchise was acquired by Crytek (and was later acquired by Koch Media), Relic Entertainment and the video game rights to the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; series were sold to Sega, and the publishing rights to Turtle Rock Studios&#x27; &quot;Evolve&quot; and the &quot;WWE&quot; series were acquired by Take-Two Interactive. Ubisoft acquired THQ Montreal and the publishing rights to &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot; while Volition and the publishing rights to the &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;Saints Row&quot; franchises were acquired by Koch Media. Vigil Games and THQ&#x27;s publishing unit were still included in the Chapter 11 case, although all employees related to these entities were laid off. In a posting on Twitter on January 23, PlatinumGames&#x27; producer Atsushi Inaba expressed interest in acquiring the &quot;Darksiders&quot; franchise from THQ.

On February 26, THQ announced that it would sell off its remaining properties – the &quot;Darksiders&quot;, &quot;Homeworld&quot;, &quot;Red Faction&quot;, and &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot; franchises, as well as its licensed and original properties – in a court-approved auction which would be held from April 1 to 15, with the process completed by May. Around the same time, THQ shut down the servers to the 2012 remake of &quot;Nexuiz&quot;, which was developed by IllFonic. In June 2013, Interplay Entertainment acquired the rights to the &quot;&quot; franchise from THQ.

All of THQ&#x27;s remaining franchises, including the remainder of its original IPs (aside from &quot;Homeworld&quot;, which was acquired by Gearbox Software, and &quot;Drawn to Life&quot;, acquired by 505 Games) and licensed software, were auctioned to Nordic Games for $4.9 million in April 2013. The Nickelodeon game license was acquired by Activision. This would later expire, with Nickelodeon licensing out their franchises through various smaller publishers, including Nordic.

Creditors initially said the proposed sale of THQ in the bankruptcy court benefited current THQ management, including Rubin. Presiding Judge Walwrath called these criticisms a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; on record. Creditors ultimately released THQ management, including Rubin, of any malfeasance in the company&#x27;s official plan of liquidation.

The liquidation of THQ also affected other studios; British developer Blitz Games Studios shut down in September 2013, citing financial difficulties. The company&#x27;s CEO Philip Oliver said that the demise of THQ, who was a major client for the studio, was one of the major contributing factors to the closure.

On June 12, 2014, Nordic Games announced that it had acquired the THQ trademark, allowing the studio to publish games under the THQ name. In August 2016, the company was renamed THQ Nordic in an effort to better associate itself with the historic brand.

<text>The Heinkel He 115 was an all-metal twin-engined military seaplane designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Heinkel. Early on its flying history, the He 115 established several new international records for floatplanes.

The He 115 was developed during the latter half of the 1930s in response to a requirement issued by the German &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM). Heinkel opted to design a three-seat seaplane that could function as a torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft and minelayer. The initial model of the aircraft, the first prototype of which performed its maiden flight in August 1937, was powered by a pair of 960 PS (947 hp, 720 kW) BMW 132K nine-cylinder air-cooled radial engines. Subsequent models varied in several respects, such as being equipped with different engines or alternative armament arrangements, increased fuel capacity or payload, and some He 115s could even accommodate an additional crew member.

The He 115 saw active combat with multiple operators, particularly during its service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the Second World War. Early on in the conflict, German He 115s frequently deployed mines within British waters. It proved itself to be a capable anti-shipping platform, particularly against Arctic supply convoys. Other nations flew the He 115, the majority being Scandinavian. The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service operated a number that flew missions against the German invasion of Norway; several survivors escaped the occupation by flying to the UK, where they continued to be flown against the Germans until they were lost. By the twenty-first century, while a few airframes have survived, none are currently on display to the public and none are flightworthy.

==Development and design==
The origins of the He 115 can be traced back to 1935 and the issuing of a requirement by the German &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) that called for a twin engined general purpose floatplane, suitable for maritime patrol and anti-shipping strikes with both bombs and torpedoes. Numerous aircraft manufacturers responded with their own proposals, including Heinkel Flugzeugwerke and the Blohm &amp; Voss aircraft subsidiary Hamburger Flugzeugbau. On 1 November 1935, orders were placed with both Heinkel and Hamburger Flugzeugbau to produce three prototypes of their prospective designs, designated the &quot;He 115&quot; and the Ha 140 respectively.

In terms of its general configuration, the He 115 was an all-metal mid-wing monoplane with a monocoque fuselage. It was equipped with a pair of floats, each of which was attached to the underside of the engine nacelles via a large strut. The twin-spar wing was built in three sections. It featured a stepped cockpit along with a rear-facing observation compartment. Initially, the He 115&#x27;s armament consisted of two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine guns, one in the nose and one in the dorsal position. On later-build He 115s, the typical armament fitted included a fixed forward-firing 15 mm or 20 mm MG 151 cannon and two rearward-firing 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns in the engine nacelles. Furthermore, some variants carried LTF 5 or LTF 6b torpedoes and SD 500 or SC 250 bombs, while others carried LMB III or LMA mines.

During August 1937, the first prototype He 115 performed its maiden flight. Flight testing went relatively smoothly, the type&#x27;s flight characteristics proving to be quite favourable. In early 1938, the He 115 was selected over the rival Ha 140, thus securing a second order for another prototype and 10 pre-production aircraft. According to aviation historian Hans Amtmann, Hamburger Flugzeugbau did not have enough spare manufacturing capacity for series production and declined the order, leading to Heinkel&#x27;s selection instead. During March of that year, the first prototype was used to establish a series of international records for floatplanes over and closed circuits at a speed of . Prior to these records being set, the prototype had been modified to achieve greater aerodynamic performance, such as the deletion of the angular glazed nose and the rear compartment, which were replaced by fairings.

The third and fourth prototypes including a continuous glazed canopy (between the windshield and the rear position) and angled bracing struts between the vertical struts attached to the floats respectively. In 1937, ten pre-production He 115s were completed; deliveries of production standard aircraft to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; commenced one year later. The He 115A-3 was the first variant to be produced in quantity, it differed from earlier models by having a revised bomb bay and radio apparatus. During 1939, the improved HE 115B-1, which featured a more than 50 percent increase in fuel capacity, was introduced.

While production came to an end during the first half of the Second World War, the He 115 was highly regarded, to the extent that production was resumed in 1943, despite an increasingly large proportion of German&#x27;s aircraft manufacturing capacity being allocated to defensive fighter aircraft instead.

==Operational history==

===&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;===
Throughout the Second World War, the primary mission of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s He 115s was to conduct minelaying, typically during night time to lower the likelihood of interception. Following the first such mission on 20 November 1939, the He 115 was frequently used for dropping (typically via parachute) magnetic mines in British waters, normally aiming for narrow passages close to busy ports on the English south coast; the River Thames was also a prime target. These mining efforts supplemented the efforts of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The island of Sylt was used as a base for He 115s performing these missions; in response, it became a target for Allied bombing missions.

Perhaps the most effective missions performed by the He 115 were its anti-shipping operations against Arctic convoys, for which it operated out of bases in occupied northern Norway. Due to early convoys lacking any air cover, the slow and lightly-armed He 115 was less vulnerable during these attacks than it was when operating near to the English coast. Following the appearance of carriers and escort carriers, coupled with the arrival of new Soviet heavy fighters like the Petlyakov Pe-3bis, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air superiority over the convoys was challenged and losses increased.
Apart from its use as a minelayer and torpedo bomber, the He 115 was used for coastal reconnaissance and by KG 200 to drop agents behind enemy lines.

===Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service===
In response to the rising tensions in Europe, the Norwegian Ministry of Defence had ordered six He 115Ns for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service (RNoNAS) on 28 August 1939 and the aircraft were delivered from 14 July – 13 November 1939. The He 115N order was intended to replace the RNoNAS fleet of 1920s vintage Douglas DT torpedo bombers and the obsolescent Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk M.F.11, which was the mainstay of the RNoNAS in 1940. The Norwegians signed another order of six He 115Ns in December 1939, with delivery expected in March/April 1940 but this was forestalled by Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940. At the outbreak of hostilities, the RNoNAS had six He 115Ns in service (F.50, F.52, F.54, F.56, F.58 and F.60) spread along the coast from the naval air stations at Sola and Flatøy in the south to the one at Skattøra Naval Air Station outside Tromsø in the north. At the beginning of the German invasion, the aircraft at the seaplane base at Hafrsfjord near Stavanger (F.60) was captured by the Germans, but two &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; He 115s (given the codes F.62 and F.64 in Norwegian service) were seized by an improvised militia unit of Norwegian riflemen at Ørnes in Glomfjord, Nordland and by police officers at Brønnøysund, Nordland. The two aircraft were seized after they ran out of fuel and had to make emergency landings on 10 April. Manned by Norwegian aircrews, they served against their former owners for the duration of the campaign.

Seven Norwegian He 115s, five of them He 115Ns, were employed against German and German-controlled ships (see: HNoMS &quot;Uller&quot;), as well as providing ground support to the Norwegian Army offensive on the Narvik Front. On 14 April 1940, three Norwegian He 115s made a successful attack on German Ju 52s at Gullesfjordbotn. Four of the Norwegian aircraft (F.52, F.56, F.58 and F.64) made the journey to the United Kingdom shortly before the 10 June 1940 surrender, a fifth (F.50) escaping to Finland, landing on Lake Salmijärvi in Petsamo. A sixth He 115 (F.54) also tried to make the journey to Britain but was lost over the North Sea. The last of the Norwegian He 115s, F.62 (one of the two captured German aircraft), was unserviceable at the time of the evacuation and was abandoned at Skattøra, later being repaired and flown by the Germans.

===Royal Air Force===

The four escaped aircraft were reformed into the Norwegian Helensburgh Group under Commander Bugge. The exiled Norwegian Cabinet Nygaardsvold made plans shortly after arriving in Britain to use the four He 115s to perform leaflet dropping missions over Norway. This leaflet mission was to deliver a declaration to the Norwegian people, stating the Norwegian authorities were re-established in the UK and rejected any Nazi German overtures for a German–Norwegian peace deal. All four Norwegian He 115s were ordered from Helensburgh to Scapa Flow on 3 July 1940 to carry out the mission, although one had to return to Helensburgh due to engine problems. The three He 115s assembled at Scapa Flow were ordered to fly to Norway and drop the declaration over the cities of Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. Shortly before the mission was to get under way, the British Air Ministry intervened and stopped the expedition, insisting that such an undertaking would be suicidal to attempt with the slow flying He 115s. Three days later, the aircraft returned to Helensburgh.

Three of the Norwegian He 115s (F.56, F.58 and F.64) were subsequently used in covert operations off Norway and in the Mediterranean Sea with Norwegian crews. In British service, the three received new serial numbers, &quot;BV184&quot;, &quot;BV185&quot; and &quot;BV187&quot;. &quot;BV184&quot; was attacked and damaged by two Polish Spitfire fighters over the Bay of Biscay in the spring of 1942, while co-operating with French fishing boats and later lost in a refuelling fire in the UK. &quot;BV185&quot; was destroyed in an Italian air raid on Kalafrana, Malta after flying just one clandestine operation to North Africa. &quot;BV187&quot; flew several missions on the North African coast from its base in Malta before being destroyed by a pair of German Bf 109s.

===Finnish Air Force===
On 8 June 1940, the day after Norwegian forces were ordered to cease hostilities, one He 115 (F.50, deemed technically unfit to be flown to the UK), was flown to Finland posing as a civilian aircraft LN-MAB. The floatplane was interned but the pilot, experienced line captain and naval lieutenant Helge Dahl and crew were free to leave Finland. From Summer 1941, it was used by the LLv.14 of the Finnish Air Force code HE-115 and named &quot;Jenny&quot;, to ferry &quot;Sissi&quot; troops behind Soviet lines. In this role, it proved valuable in a terrain with numerous secluded lakes. It served in this role until ambushed in East Karelia on 4 July 1943. &quot;Jenny&quot; took off but soon had to ditch and the crew was taken prisoner. Two days later the floating HE-115 was strafed by Finnish Morane-Saulnier MS.406 fighters. There are reports that the Soviets salvaged the wreck for evaluation. A pair of Luftwaffe He 115 C were borrowed for similar operations in 1943–44 and operated with German markings by Finnish crew. One was returned in 1944 but the other was surrendered to the Soviets after the signing of the Moscow Armistice.

===Swedish Air Force===

The Swedish Air Force operated 12 He 115A-2s under the local designation T 2, with Air Force numbers 101–112. Another six aircraft were ordered but never delivered due to the outbreak of the Second World War. They were sturdy and well liked by their crews and were not taken out of use until 1952. The Swedish T 2s were kept on duty throughout the Second World War and made a valuable contribution to protecting and enforcing Swedish neutrality. The T 2s replaced the outdated T 1s (Heinkel HD 16s) as torpedo bombers and also served as regular bombers, for smoke screening and for long-range reconnaissance missions. Five of the 12 T 2s were lost in accidents during their service with the Swedish Air Force.

<text>A literary genre is a category of literature. Genres may be determined by literary technique, tone, content, or length (especially for fiction). They generally move from more abstract, encompassing classes, which are then further sub-divided into more concrete distinctions. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, and even the rules designating genres change over time and are fairly unstable.

Genres can all be in the form of prose or poetry. Additionally, a genre such as satire, allegory or pastoral might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre (see below), but as a mixture of genres. They are defined by the general cultural movement of the historical period in which they were composed.

== History of genres ==
=== Aristotle ===
The concept of genre began in the works of Aristotle, who applied biological concepts to the classification of literary genres, or, as he called them, &quot;species&quot; (eidē). These classifications are mainly discussed in his treatises &quot;Rhetoric&quot; and &quot;Poetics&quot;.

Genres are categories into which kinds of literary material are organized. The genres Aristotle discusses include the epic, the tragedy, the comedy, dithyrambic poetry, and phallic songs. Genres are often divided into complex sub-categories. For example, the novel is a large genre of narrative fiction; within the category of the novel, the detective novel is a sub-genre, while the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; detective novel is a sub-genre of the detective novel.

In the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle proposed three literary genres of rhetorical oratory: deliberative, forensic, and epideictic. These are divided based on the purpose of the orator: to argue for future policy or action (deliberative), discuss past action (forensic), or offer praise or blame during a ceremony (epideictic).

In the &quot;Poetics&quot;, Aristotle similarly divided poetry into three main genres: the epic, tragedy, and comedy. In the case of poetry, these distinctions are based not on rhetorical purpose, but on a combination of structure, content and narrative form. For each type, he proposed a definition as well as the rules for its construction.

=== Further development of genre ===
After the time of Aristotle, literary criticism continued to develop. The first-century Greek treatise &quot;On the Sublime&quot;, for example, discussed the works of more than 50 literary writers and the methods they used to influence their audiences&#x27; emotions and feelings.

=== Romantic genre theory ===
The origins of modern Western genre theory can be traced to the European Romantic movement in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, during which the concept of genre was scrutinized heavily.

The idea that it was possible to ignore genre constraints and the idea that each literary work was a &quot;genre unto itself&quot; gained popularity. Genre definitions were thought to be &quot;primitive and childish.&quot;

At the same time, the Romantic period saw the emergence of a new genre, the &#x27;imaginative&#x27; genre. The reason for this shift is often attributed to the social events that were taking place in the Western world in terms of wars, infighting and overthrown leadership. People felt the need for &quot;escapism&quot; to remove themselves from their respective situations. 

=== Northrop Frye ===

In 1957 Canadian scholar Northrop Frye published &quot;Anatomy of Criticism,&quot; in which he proposes a system of genres and a set of rules to describe the constraints of each genre. In this work, he defines methodological classifications of the genres of myth, legend, high mimetic genre, low mimetic genre, irony, the comic, and the tragic through the constitution of &quot;the relation between the hero of the work and ourselves or the laws of nature.&quot; He also uses the juxtaposition of the &quot;real&quot; and the &quot;ideal&quot; to categorize the genres of romance (the ideal), irony (the real), comedy (transition from real to ideal), and tragedy (transition from ideal to real). Lastly, he divides genres by the audience they are intended for into: drama (performed works), lyric poetry (sung works), and epic poetry (recited works). 

=== Genre in the twenty-first century ===

Since the Romantic period, modern genre theory often sought to dispense with the conventions that have marked the categorization of genres for centuries. However, the twenty-first century has brought a new era in which genre has lost much of the negative connotations associating it with loss of individuality or excess conformity.
==Genres==
Genre categorizes literary works based on specific shared conventions, including style, mood, length, and organizational features. These genres are in turn divided into subgenres.

Western literature is typically subdivided into the classic three forms of Ancient Greece, poetry, drama, and prose. Poetry may then be subdivided into the genres of lyric, epic, and dramatic. The lyric includes all the shorter forms of poetry e.g., song, ode, ballad, elegy, sonnet. Dramatic poetry might include comedy, tragedy, melodrama, and mixtures like tragicomedy.

The standard division of drama into tragedy and comedy derives from Greek drama. This division into subgenres can continue: &quot;comedy&quot; has its own subgenres, including, for example, comedy of manners, sentimental comedy, burlesque comedy, and satirical comedy.

The genre of semi-fiction includes works that mix elements of both fiction and nonfiction. A semi-fictional work may be the retelling of a true story with only the names changed; at the other end of the spectrum, it may present fictional events with a semi-fictional protagonist, as in Jerry Seinfeld.

Often, the criteria used to divide up works into genres are not consistent, and can be subject to debate, change and challenge by both authors and critics. However, some basic distinctions are widely accepted. For example, it is commonly accepted that the genre of fiction (&quot;literature created from the imagination, not presented as fact, though it may be based on a true story or situation&quot;) is not applied to all fictitious literature, but instead encompasses only prose texts (novels, novellas, short stories) and not fables.

==Common genres in Western literature==
* The genre of Poetry includes the subgenres of sonnets, haiku, and limerick, among others.
* The genre of Prose includes the notebook, novel, novella, and short story.

==Related methods of categorization of literature==
There are other ways of categorizing books that are not usually considered &quot;genre&quot;. Notably, this can include age categories, by which literature may be classified as adult, young adult, or children&#x27;s literature. There is also classification by format, where the structure of the work is used: graphic novels, picture books, radio plays, and so on.

<text>Frank Hoover Easterbrook (born September 3, 1948) is an American lawyer and jurist who has served as a United States circuit judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit since 1985. He was the Seventh Circuit&#x27;s chief judge from 2006 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Easterbrook was born in Buffalo, New York, on September 3, 1948, the son of Vimy and George Easterbrook. His younger brothers are author Gregg Easterbrook and Neil Easterbrook, a professor at Texas Christian University. He attended Kenmore West High School in Tonawanda, New York.

After high school, Easterbrook attended Swarthmore College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and received his Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors in 1970. He then attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; along with future judge Douglas H. Ginsburg. He graduated in 1973 with a Juris Doctor and membership in the Order of the Coif.

==Early career==
After law school, Easterbrook clerked for judge Levin Hicks Campbell of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1973 to 1974. He then joined the U.S. Solicitor General&#x27;s office as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, and was promoted in 1978 to Deputy Solicitor General. The solicitor general at the time was Robert Bork, and Easterbrook has reminisced that when he joined the Solicitor General&#x27;s office, &quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that around the same time the SG&#x27;s Office had hired three lawyers either fresh from clerkships or lacking the customary appellate experience. None of us had clerked on the Supreme Court. The &quot;Post&quot; concluded that good lawyers were no longer willing to work for the Solicitor General and attributed this to Bork&#x27;s role in firing Archibald Cox as Watergate special prosecutor. The paper thought that dark days lay ahead for the Office with a second-rate staff. The three bottom-of-the-barrel selections were Robert Reich (later Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration), Danny Boggs (future Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit), and me.&quot; Easterbrook was considered &quot;one of the very top advocates appearing before the Supreme Court in his days at the bar&quot;.

Easterbrook joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1978. He was a principal at the economics consulting firm Compass Lexecon from 1980 until his judicial appointment. Easterbrook argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General&#x27;s office and in private practice, including several landmark antitrust cases.

==Federal judicial service==

Easterbrook was nominated to the court by Ronald Reagan on August 1, 1984, to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333, 346; the United States Senate did not act on his nomination that year, and he was renominated in Reagan&#x27;s second term on February 25, 1985.

He was confirmed by the Senate on April 3, 1985, and received his commission the next day. The American Bar Association gave Easterbrook a low &quot;qualified/not qualified&quot; rating, presumably due to his youth and relative inexperience. In 2001 this rating was claimed by the George W. Bush administration as evidence of liberal bias in the ABA in its announcement that it would no longer confer with the ABA in selecting judicial nominees.

Among Judge Easterbrook&#x27;s most prominent opinions are:
* &quot;American Booksellers v. Hudnut&quot; (1986)
* &quot;Kirchoff v. Flynn&quot; (1986)
* &quot;In re Erickson&quot; (1987)
* &quot;In re Sinclair&quot; (1989)
* &quot;United States v. Van Fossan&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Miller v. South Bend&quot; (1990)
* &quot;United States v. Marshall&quot; (1990)
* &quot;Gacy v. Welborn&quot; (1993)
* &quot;ProCD v. Zeidenberg&quot; (1996)
* &quot;Asher v. Baxter International Inc.&quot; (2004)
* &quot;BMG Music v. Gonzalez&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Hosty v. Carter&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Doe v. Smith&quot; 429 F.3d 706 (7th Cir. 2005)

As a young judge in one of his early opinions, &quot;Kirchoff v. Flynn&quot;, 786 F.2d 320 (CA7 1986), a lawsuit over an arrest for feeding pigeons in a park, Easterbrook used such language as &quot;trundled to the squadrol&quot; to describe an arrest; and states of the pigeon-feeder that she &quot;will never be confused with the 30th Earl of Mar, whose hobby was kicking pigeons&quot;. He described a controversy over whether a police officer, or the plaintiff&#x27;s own bird, had attacked the plaintiff as: &quot;[Plaintiff] says that he was clobbered by a pair of handcuffs; [the officer] maintains that the [plaintiffs]&#x27; red macaw drew the blood when it landed on [plaintiff]&#x27;s head during the fracas and started pecking&quot;. In a footnote, he added &quot;Predatory birds rarely attack large animals whose eyes they can see, 11 Harv.Med. School Health Letter 8 (Feb.1986), and perhaps William&#x27;s eyes got distracted, to his macaw&#x27;s glee.&quot; This may be seen either as an example of Easterbrook&#x27;s deftness with language, or his penchant for engaging in self-indulgent pedantry. Either way, his opinions often exhibit nearly impenetrable language, such as in &quot;Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation&quot;, 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987), where he wrote, &quot;The absence of ineluctable answers does not imply the privilege to indulge an unexamined gestalt.&quot;

University of Chicago Law School Dean Saul Levmore stated that &quot;Easterbrook is an important influence on legal education through his judicial opinions. Course after law school course has changed for the better as Judge Easterbrook’s opinions have made their way into the curriculum. So long as he decides cases, and decides them in a way that cuts to the heart of an issue with such skill and pressure, no area of law can be dull&quot;.

Easterbrook had a reputation for being &quot;hard-nosed and demanding&quot; during oral argument. In &quot;Schlessinger v. Salimes&quot; (1996), for example, he characterized the lawsuit as &quot;goofy&quot; and the appellant&#x27;s arguments as &quot;nutty&quot; before issuing an order to show cause why the appellant and lawyer should not be sanctioned for a frivolous appeal. His demeanor has won him enemies in the bar. In 1994 the Chicago Council of Lawyers published an &quot;evaluation&quot; of the Seventh Circuit that evaluated all the judges and the court&#x27;s procedures in general, but notably focused extensively on only two: Easterbrook and then-chief judge Richard Posner. The evaluation of Easterbrook contained an unusual number of grievances; and the Council did not specify authorship, so the criticism is anonymous. In a section devoted to Easterbrook&#x27;s judicial demeanor, the report claims he &quot;has consistently displayed a temperament that is improper for a Circuit Judge. While Judge Easterbrook has many good qualities, there is a widespread belief that he is arrogant and intolerant with those who do not match his own intellectual level. This problem seriously interferes with the performance of his duties&quot;. The report continued to state Easterbrook &quot;has been resoundingly and repeatedly criticized as being extremely rude to attorneys at oral argument&quot; and that &quot;some attorneys&quot; said that due to the judge&#x27;s demeanor they and their clients did not feel they got a fair hearing. The Council pointed to another opinion, &quot;Kale v. Obuchowski&quot;, which derided a lawyer&#x27;s argument as &quot;pettifoggery&quot; and concluded that the appeal was &quot;frivolous, doomed and sanctionable&quot;. The Council argued that even if the lawyer&#x27;s conduct was sanctionable, &quot;the language chosen does not enhance the administration of justice&quot;.

However, this review by the council was never repeated, lending partial support to the defenders of Easterbrook and Posner that the report was an opportunity for anonymous venting by lawyers who were unhappy with the results of Seventh Circuit decisions, in no small part thanks to the decisions of Reagan appointees Easterbrook and Posner. Posner has recently commented about the report, &quot;You have here some anonymous people who are talking to the Chicago Council of Lawyers. How much credence should we put on these people? They can be sore losers. They can be crybabies.&quot;

Easterbrook served as Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit from 2006 to 2013. He is a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States and head of the Judicial Council for the Seventh Circuit.

==Influences==

Easterbrook called Learned Hand and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. his &quot;judicial heroes&quot;.

==Notable cases==
===Second Amendment cases===

In June 2009, Easterbrook wrote the decision in NRA v. City of Chicago holding that the Second Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms, did not bind state governments. This allowed the City of Chicago to maintain its ban on purchasing and possessing handguns. This decision was later overturned by the Supreme Court in McDonald v. City of Chicago.

In April 2015, Easterbrook wrote the decision in Friedman v. City of Highland Park holding that a city ordinance that generally prohibited the possession, sale or manufacture of semi-automatic assault weapons and large capacity magazines did not violate the Second Amendment. 

In May 2023, Easterbrook put a hold on an injunction that had been issued against an Illinois assault weapon and magazine ban by a federal judge in southern Illinois. This allowed the ban on firearms and magazines to take effect across the state.

===Other cases===

In December 2017, Easterbrook supported the 4–3 en banc decision to reverse an earlier federal magistrate judgment that a confession had been unlawfully coerced from 16-year-old Brendan Dassey.

On November 1, 2019, Easterbrook concurred in the denial of rehearing regarding an Indiana abortion law requiring parental notifications. A 3-judge panel had struck down the injunctions. Easterbrook, and Diane S. Sykes who joined him, were the deciding votes to deny en banc. Easterbrook in his concurrence called on the Supreme Court to hear the case, and also pointed out its parallels with June Medical Services v. Gee.

On January 23, 2020, Easterbrook wrote a decision slamming the Justice Department for arguing that a previous decision by the Seventh Circuit in the same immigration case was wrongly decided and that the Board of Immigration Appeals could ignore the decision. Easterbrook wrote, &quot;The Board [of Immigration Appeals] seemed to think that we had issued an advisory opinion, and that faced with a conflict between our views and those of the Attorney General it should follow the latter. Yet it should not be necessary to remind the Board, all of whose members are lawyers, that the &#x27;judicial Power&#x27; under Article III of the Constitution is one to make conclusive decisions, not subject to disapproval or revision by another branch of government.&quot; The Court reversed the Board&#x27;s decision and entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Jorge Baez-Sanchez v. Barr.

On June 29, 2020, Easterbrook wrote the opinion to reinstate significant voting restrictions in Wisconsin, originally put into place when Republicans controlled all branches of state government early in the previous decade and which U.S. District Judge James Peterson had overturned on constitutional grounds in July 2016. Easterbrook wrote that even though the voting restrictions are discriminatory, it was purely based upon party affiliation (the areas most impacted are heavily Democratic leaning). His conclusion that this is acceptable relies on a 2019 US Supreme Court ruling that partisan manipulation of electoral districts was also acceptable. “The changes were made because of politics,” he wrote. “This record does not support a conclusion that the legislators who voted for the contested statutes cared about race; they cared about voters’ political preferences.” He added that Democratic lawmakers could retake control of the legislature and change the laws they objected to. Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, observed “This is an amazing conclusion that opens the doors to all kinds of partisan manipulation of election practices. It completely ignores the possibility that the party in charge might be able to alter the rules to keep itself in power, thus removing the ability of the opposing party to change the laws in the other direction.” The case was argued in 2017 and it was long a mystery why the court hadn&#x27;t issued its ruling long before. Easterbrook&#x27;s written opinion offered no explanation for the delay in delivering it until preparations for the 2020 national election cycle were just beginning, during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the most closely contested &quot;battleground state&quot; of the 2016 national election cycle.

On August 2, 2021, Easterbrook wrote the unanimous majority opinion upholding Indiana University&#x27;s requirement for students to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Ten days later, circuit justice Amy Coney Barrett left the decision in place, denying a motion to block the policy temporarily while the challengers sought review from the Supreme Court. A few months later in a similar case, the full Supreme Court likewise declined a request to block vaccine requirements for health care workers in Maine.

==Academic work==

Easterbrook&#x27;s academic work focuses on corporate law, particularly the 1996 book &quot;The Economic Structure of Corporate Law&quot;, which he coauthored with Daniel Fischel. Easterbrook&#x27;s article, &quot;The Proper Role of a Target&#x27;s Management in Responding to a Tender Offer&quot;, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1161 (1981) (also coauthored with Fischel) is the most heavily cited corporate law article in legal scholarship. Easterbrook has also written articles on antitrust law and judicial interpretation, including &quot;The Limits of Antitrust&quot;, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1984); &quot;Abstraction and Authority&quot;, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 349 (1992); &quot;Statutes&#x27; Domains&quot;, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 533 (1983); and &quot;Textualism and the Dead Hand&quot;, 66 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1119 (1998). Easterbrook also expressed his opinions about how US states compete with each other in the race to the bottom to win corporations, in &quot; The Race for the Bottom in Corporate Governance&quot;, 95 Va. L. Rev. 685 (2009).

<doc id="455561" wikidata="Q201133" url="?curid=455561" title="Emblem of Algeria">
<text>The national emblem of Algeria (; Tamazight: ) is the official seal used by the government of Algeria.

==Description==
The current form of the emblem with Arabic writing was adopted on 1 November 1976, but was only differentiated from previous one by the changing of the motto from French to Arabic. Contained on the emblem is the crescent that is also found on the flag of Algeria and is a symbol of Islam. The text that encircles the emblem says in Arabic: (&quot;The People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Algeria&quot;, the country&#x27;s official name).

The hand of Fatima, a traditional symbol of the region, appears in front of the Atlas Mountains, below a rising sun representing a new era. Buildings stand for industry and plants for agriculture.

<doc id="455570" wikidata="Q905030" url="?curid=455570" title="Henry Gilman">
<text>Henry Gilman (May 9, 1893 – November 7, 1986) was an American organic chemist known as the father of organometallic chemistry. He discovered the Gilman reagent, which bears his name.

== Early life and education ==
Henry Gilman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, as the son of a tailor. He was the third of eight children. Gilman graduated from a Boston high school and later attended Harvard University, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1915. During his final year as an undergraduate at Harvard, Gilman researched with Roger Adams. During this time, the two worked on the synthesis of substituted phenyl esters of oxalic acids. Gilman worked hard on his research describing it as &#x27;a sheer delight&#x27; and often worked until midnight &#x27;without any compulsion-just for the joy of it&#x27; and claimed this was an important step toward his interest in research. After undergraduate work Gilman was invited to stay for graduate work with the head of the Harvard department of chemistry, E.P. Kohler. Based on his work, he received a Master of Arts degree in 1917 (a year late) and a PhD in 1918.

While attending graduate school, Gilman had an opportunity to travel in Europe as a recipient of the Sheldon Fellowship. He spent time at both the Polytechnicum in Zurich and at Oxford in England. During his time in Europe, Gilman met Madame Curie at the Sorbonne, the historic University of Paris. While staying in Paris, Gilman met Victor Grignard and was intrigued by the advances in organic chemistry in France made possible by Grignard reagents. Once he was able to research independently, Gilman was determined to explore the chemistry of these organometallic reagents.

==Career==
For a short time after receiving his PhD, Henry Gilman worked an associate professor at the University of Illinois after being invited by his former instructor Roger Adams. In 1919, Gilman moved on to become an assistant professor in charge of organic chemistry at Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University). At the age of 30, Gilman was given the title of full professor. While at Iowa State College, Gilman met Ruth V. Shaw, a student of his first-year organic chemistry class, and the two were married in 1929. Gilman switched to the Episcopal church from the Jewish faith upon marriage.

Gilman had high expectations for his graduate students, and it often took them more than twice as long as the norm to earn their degrees. They were expected to work in the research lab well into the night and on weekends. Gilman was known for frequently visiting the lab during the day and questioning each student as to what they had accomplished since his last visit. He would also go on business trips and not inform his secretary or students on when he would come back in an effort to discourage skipping. Gilman had another common practice for his graduate students. He would not assign a research project for his graduate students, but he would push students to produce a series of preparations. Students would write short publications that would spark ideas about additional experiments to perform, drawing all the material together to form a central thesis.

During his career, Gilman consulted for many companies such as Quaker Oats and DuPont, although he continued as a professor at Iowa State University, as it came to be known. At the usual retirement age of 70, at that time, Gilman chose not to retire from Iowa State University and remained active in research until 1975 when he was 82 years old.

World War II brought new opportunities for Gilman to do research for the government. He took part in the Manhattan Project, which was the code name for the government&#x27;s work on the atom bomb. Gilman concentrated on preparing volatile uranium derivatives, mainly dealing with alkoxides, and the syntheses of species with potential anti-malarial activities.

==Later years (1947–1986)==
In 1947, due to a combination of glaucoma and detachment of a retina Henry Gilman became blind in one eye and lost most of his vision in the other. He was forced to rely on his wife and students to act as his eyes, to read and write for him. His wife was almost always at his side to guide him in unfamiliar places and inform him of the people around him. Remarkably, he continued much of his work and never let his loss of sight hinder his skills. It could be argued that the majority of Gilman&#x27;s work was done after 1947. In 1973, the current chemistry building at Iowa State University was renamed Henry Gilman Hall.

Gilman had heart problems late in his life and was fitted with a pace-maker at the age of 88. He died in Ames, IA at the age of 93 and was followed by his wife less than two months later and she was followed by their daughter Jane six months later. They are survived by a son and four grandchildren.

==Works==

During his lifetime, Gilman completed 1020 papers, 584 of which were published after he became blind in 1947. In 1936, the Journal of Organic Chemistry was created by Gilman with the help of M.S. Kharasch. In 1938, he published a two-volume textbook titled &quot;Organic Chemistry: An Advanced Treatise&quot;, the first major organic chemistry textbook, with each chapter being contributed by leading leaders in the U.S. Subsequent additions were published in 1943 and another two editions in 1953. Gilman reagents are named after him.

==Honors and awards==
*Elected to National Academy of Sciences, 1945
*Iowa Award and Midwest Award of American Chemical Society, 1951
*Honorary Fellow of the British Chemical Society, 1961
*First American Chemical Society Frederic Stanley Kipping Award in Organosilicon Chemistry, 1962
*Distinguished Fellowship Awards, Iowa Academy of Sciences, 1975
*Priestley Medal of the American Chemical Society, 1977
*Iowa Governor&#x27;s Science Medal, 1982

Along with his numerous state, national, and international awards and honors, Gilman has had many tributes in his memory at Iowa State University. In 1962, Gilman became a distinguished professor at ISU. The chemistry building on Iowa State University&#x27;s campus was renamed Gilman Hall in 1974. That same year, the annual series of Gilman Lectures was established. In his memory, the Gilman Graduate Fellowship Fund was established in 1987.

<text>Rathfarnham () is a southside suburb of Dublin, Ireland in County Dublin. It is south of Terenure, east of Templeogue, and is in the postal districts of Dublin 14 and 16. It is between the local government areas of Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and South Dublin.

Located within the historical baronies of Rathdown and Uppercross, Rathfarnham village originally developed around a fortification overlooking a ford on the River Dodder. From the medieval period, Rathfarnham was on the perimeter of the Pale (the area of Anglo-Norman influence in Ireland, centred on Dublin), and a number of defensive structures were built in the area. Rathfarnham Castle, a fortified house, was built in the late 16th century. Developed around these structures, by the 19th century there were a number of mills operating in the area, and Rathfarnham was still somewhat rural by the early 20th century. During the 20th century, with the expansion of metropolitan Dublin, Rathfarnham became a largely residential suburban area.

The population of all electoral divisions labelled as Rathfarnham was 23,276 as of the 2022 census.

==Location==
Rathfarnham is a civil parish in the historical baronies of Rathdown and Uppercross. The civil parish contains 11 townlands. Historical sites in Rathfarnham&#x27;s townlands include: Kilmashogue, Mount Venus, Tibradden and Taylors Grange. A broad definition of Rathfarnham also includes the suburban areas of Nutgrove, Ballyboden, Whitechurch and Ballyroan.

==History==

===Early and medieval history===
The name Rathfarnham (&quot;Fearnán&#x27;s Ringfort&quot;) suggests an earlier habitation, but no remains of prehistoric fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found.

The written history of Rathfarnham begins after the Norman invasion of Ireland. Terenure and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith (&#x27;Aurifaber&#x27;) held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.

In 1199, these lands were granted to Milo le Bret, and he adapted an existing ridge to build a motte and bailey fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. Le Bret later established a more permanent fortified settlement on the site of the (later) Rathfarnham Castle and a village grew up around it on a site overlooking a ford over the River Dodder.

In the 13th century, no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the Royal Forest of Glencree. Rathfarnham became more exposed to an attack when this deer park was overrun by the Clan O&#x27;Toole from the Wicklow Mountains in the 14th century.

Located on the perimeter of the Pale (the area around Dublin under greater English control), when the English presence began to shrink after the 14th century, Rathfarnham &quot;came to be on the front lines&quot; and a number of defensive structures were built to protect the area from incursions by Gaelic Irish families.

===From the 16th century===
The site of Rathfarnham Castle, and much of the land around Rathfarnham, belonged to the Eustace family, Viscounts of Baltinglass. However, their property was confiscated, from James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass, for his support of the Second Desmond Rebellion of 1579–1583. The Eustace lands at Rathfarnham were then granted to the Loftus family, who built a fortified house on the site of an earlier structure.

In the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the Irish Confederate Wars arising out of the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In 1649, the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde&#x27;s Catholic and Royalist forces before the Battle of Rathmines. However, they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, Oliver Cromwell stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the Siege of Wexford.

Economic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century, and the village was granted a patent in 1618 to hold horse and cattle fairs. From the early 18th century a number of gentlemen&#x27;s residences were developed, including the remodelling of Rathfarnham Castle and the construction of Ashfield.

====Rathfarnham Castle====
Rathfarnham Castle itself was re-modelled from a defensively focused fortified house into a more comfortable stately home. Lower Dodder Road is still marked by a triumphal arch, from this era, which originally led to the castle. The erection of this gateway is attributed to Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely from 1769 to 1783 who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the &quot;new gate&quot; on Richard Frizell&#x27;s map of 1779. After the division of the estate in 1913, the arch became the entrance to the Castle Golf Club but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct Woodside Drive entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby River Dodder home to brown trout, otter and many birds including kingfisher, dipper and grey heron. Woodside Estate is home to red fox, rabbits and grey squirrels.

====Ashfield====
Ashfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century, it became the home of Sir William Cusac Smith, Baron of the Exchequer and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd. occupied it until the 1990s when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants.

===Industrial revolution===
New industries, especially the production of paper, developed on the Owendoher and Dodder rivers, and many mills were erected during the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 19th century, a number of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.

A millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by Frizell dated 1779, it is called the &quot;Widow Clifford&#x27;s mill and mill holding&quot; and in 1843 it is named the &quot;Ely Cloth Factory&quot;. A Mr Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains.

===Historical features===

====R115 road====
Rathfarnham contains the start of the R115 road. The road, constructed through the Wicklow Mountains and still in use primarily for tourist traffic was constructed from 1800 to 1809 to assist Crown forces in tracking down United Irishmen insurgents who were hiding in the Wicklow Mountains following the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of a number skirmishes in the early days of the rebellion between the United Irishmen and government forces.

Construction of the road commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of Glencree, with a spur down that valley to Enniskerry, rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to Laragh, over the hills into Glenmalure, and finishes at Aghavannagh. Well-known sections also include the Featherbed Mountain, the section below Kippure Mountain. The total distance was 34 Irish miles, of which the spur to Enniskerry was 5 Irish miles. The engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some &quot;turnpike roads&quot;, which are toll roads.

====Rathfarnham Road====
According to many writers, the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the Slíghe Chualann, the ancient highway, which in the time of Saint Patrick was used by travellers between Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford. This road is believed to have crossed the Dodder at the Big Bridge, now Pearse Bridge, and re-crossed it again near Oldbawn, an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through Templeogue to Oldbawn would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in 1381 and in 1652 it was described by Gerard Boate in his &quot;A Natural History of Ireland&quot; as a wooden bridge which &#x27;though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.&#x27; After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between 1728 and 1765, the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of Patrick and William Pearse.

In 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered below the road level. It was wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence of the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge.

====Old graveyard====
Next to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. This was a medieval church used for Protestant worship until 1795 when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, however, the chancel itself has disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.

Near the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of Captain James Kelly, an old Fenian who was associated with the Fenian Rising of 1867. He was the organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as &#x27;The Knight of Glendoo&#x27;. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in Wicklow Street when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.

On the opposite side of the road are Crannagh Park and Road, Rathfarnham Park and Ballytore Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named Tower Court in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of Lord Ely&#x27;s occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on a level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted halfway up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door was broken through the wall at that level.

====Rathfarnham village====

In the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at Kilmashogue and flows down through Grange Golf Club and Saint Enda&#x27;s Park. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd. Described in 1836 as Sweetman&#x27;s Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a sawmill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue.

Rathfarnham&#x27;s Protestant parish church, on the Main Street, was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old schoolhouse that dates from early in the nineteenth century. Immediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a Royal Irish Constabulary barracks that was burned down by Anti-Treaty IRA forces in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In the lane is an old blocked-up doorway of an early eighteenth-century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently, when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.

The paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is 1719 when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as 1694. In 1751 William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in 1775 made paper here. Archer&#x27;s survey of 1801 mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in 1836 and Lewis in 1837 state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated &quot;Old Mill&quot; on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither a water wheel nor machinery, an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development.

At the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey.

====Rathfarnham Lower====
The Catholic Church of the Annunciation was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel on Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription &quot;FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM 1732&quot;. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone bullaun dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times.

On the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on Taylor&#x27;s map of 1816. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr Hammond that in 1798 a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the United Irishmen hiding on the premises. In 1804, when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century.

====Nutgrove Avenue====
A short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with Churchtown. The old quiet tree-shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the narrow lanes, a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right-angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription &quot;Nutgrove School Established 1802&quot;. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth-century building containing fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately, the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. Weston St John Joyce, in his &quot;Neighbourhood of Dublin&quot;, states that this house was at one time the dower house of Rathfarnham Castle but in this, he is almost certainly mistaken, as Frizell&#x27;s map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named Ely Cottage, later altered to Ely Lodge, and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently been restored.

====Loreto Abbey====
Loreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham forms a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city. It served as the headquarters of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. William Palliser about 1725. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed leather wallpaper. William Palliser died in 1768 without issue and Rathfarnham House passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.

After his death in 1795 the house was purchased by George Grierson, the King&#x27;s Printer in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until 1821, when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order.

The foundress Rev. Mother Mary Teresa Ball made a number of improvements to the place. She is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph&#x27;s wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony&#x27;s wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier&#x27;s in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the Eucharistic Congress. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become Mother Teresa) came to Loreto Abbey to learn English. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in India.

Directly across the road from the Abbey is Beaufort House, which is now the headquarters of the Loreto Order in Ireland. This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793–1860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens. On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925.

====The Ponds====
Loreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as &#x27;The Ponds&#x27;, a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low-lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce&#x27;s &quot;The Neighbourhood of Dublin&quot; in 1912 as &quot;the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds&quot; but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses were demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th-century gabled residence named Grove Cottage.

This place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the rising of 1798. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely&#x27;s yeomanry but had taken to the field with the United Irishmen. The insurgents were attacked by the local yeomanry corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners were taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from Clondalkin, and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the Rathcoole road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.

====Harold&#x27;s Grange and Taylors Grange====
The road to Harold&#x27;s Grange continues southward from Loreto Abbey. The first site is Snugborough, which has its gable end to the road. The next is Washington Lodge, its 18th-century facade hidden by shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is Silveracre, once the home of Dr Henthorn Todd, Professor of Hebrew in Trinity College, who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century, the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of the twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.

====St Enda&#x27;s====

The next estate on the same side is Hermitage or Saint Enda&#x27;s, the former home of Patrick Pearse and later of his sister Margaret Mary Pearse. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by Edward Hudson, an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watchtower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit&#x27;s cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure, known as the &quot;Fortification&quot; or &quot;Emmet&#x27;s Fort&quot; was another of his creations. South of the house, he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a Brehon&#x27;s Chair and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall, he cut an inscription in Ogham on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: &quot;RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON&quot;. In the pretty glen adjoining the Whitechurch road he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the &quot;Fields of Oden&quot; and is so-called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an obelisk, stated to have been erected by a former owner, Major Doyne, over the grave of a horse that carried him through the Battle of Waterloo. The date however of Major Doyne&#x27;s occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, Pádraig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that &quot;a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran&#x27;s was killed and is buried.&quot; Unlike the constructions of Edward Hudson, which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken.

Edward Hudson was succeeded by his son William Elliot Hudson, who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of Thomas Davis and Charles Gavan Duffy and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857, he endowed the Royal Irish Academy with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books.

From 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of Richard Moore, Attorney-General, and in 1859 it came into the possession of Major Richard Doyne, stated to be a veteran of the Waterloo. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by Major Philip Doyne of the 4th Dragoon Guards. In 1891 Colonel Frederick le Mesurier, a barrister returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. William Woodburn.

St Enda&#x27;s School was founded by Padraig Pearse in 1909 and was at first housed in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became classrooms. In &quot;The Story of a Success&quot; Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life&#x27;s ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising, the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda&#x27;s passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the Pearse Museum.

====Priory====
Directly opposite St Enda&#x27;s was Priory, the home of John Philpot Curran, at the time of Emmet&#x27;s rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First, the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter Sarah Curran with Robert Emmet. Gertrude Curran died in 1792 at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave, he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription:

:&quot;Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran&quot;
:&quot;fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran&quot;
:&quot;who departed this life October 6, 1792&quot;
:&quot;Age twelve years&quot;.

The position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold&#x27;s photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Sometime later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was Sarah Curran&#x27;s desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.

In this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either Sarah Curran or Robert Emmet and it has been suggested as the last resting place of Robert Emmet. In October 1979 The Hermitage estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs Bernadette Foley of nearby Barton Drive drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried forever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First, the exact location was checked on the original large-scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site was marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trenches were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone.

The developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of long and wide to a depth of without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr Leslie Black was expertly carried out.

The priory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century, the house and gardens were still in good repair but after Taylor&#x27;s time, the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble.

====St Columba&#x27;s College====
St Columba&#x27;s College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham. The headmaster of the college is addressed as &#x27;warden&#x27; and the vice-principal as &#x27;sub-warden&#x27;. The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 to 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00. The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half-days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focuses considerable attention on music, drama and art. The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits. The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs.

==Pubs==
Pubs in the area include the &quot;Buglers&quot; pub in Ballyboden House on Ballyboden Road in Ballyboden. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799. On Rathfarnham&#x27;s main street, near Rathfarnham Castle, is &quot;The Castle Inn&quot;.

&quot;The Eden House&quot; pub is on Grange Road near Marlay Park. The building was formerly &quot;Eden House&quot;, one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use. &quot;The Old Orchard&quot; is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. &quot;The Blue Haven&quot; is situated at the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue.

&quot;The Yellow House&quot;, is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present Catholic church and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. A new Yellow House was built in 1825 and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885. It was refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet Francis Ledwidge worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of Slane, County Meath, caused him to leave.

==Transport==
Rathfarnham is served by the Dublin Bus route numbers 16 (Ballinteer to Dublin Airport via Dublin city centre), 15B (Stocking Avenue to Grand Canal Dock via the city centre), 74 to Dundrum and Go-Ahead Ireland route numbers S6 (to Tallaght) and 161 (to Rockbrook). The 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free Internet Wi-Fi on board.

The &quot;Dublin, Dundrum and Rathfarnham Railway&quot; planned to build the Harcourt Street railway line as far as Dundrum, with a branch line from Ranelagh to Rathfarnham. However they failed to complete the railway and the Dublin and Wicklow Railway took over the line works. They never built the line to Rathfarnham, but Dundrum did serve as the nearest station until the line&#x27;s closure in 1959.

Rathfarnham used to serve as the terminus for the Dublin tramways 16 and 17 routes from the 22 June 1879 until they both closed on 1 May 1939. 

In 2007, it was proposed that a Luas tram line (mentioned in a feasibility study as &#x27;Line E&#x27;) would be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, as road widening would be required, necessitating the compulsory purchase of a significant number of homes and gardens on the route. Because of this, the project was not progressed.

<text>Vincenzo Maria Coronelli (August 16, 1650 – December 9, 1718) was an Italian Franciscan friar, cosmographer, cartographer, publisher, and encyclopedist known in particular for his atlases and globes. He spent most of his life in Venice.

==Biography==
Vincenzo Coronelli was born, probably in Venice, on August 16, 1650, the fifth child of a Venetian tailor named Maffio Coronelli. At ten, young Vincenzo was sent to the city of Ravenna and was apprenticed to a xylographer. In 1663 he was accepted into the Conventual Franciscans, becoming a novice in 1665. At age sixteen he published the first of his one hundred forty separate works. In 1671 he entered the Convent of Saint Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice, and in 1672 Coronelli was sent by the order to the College of Saint Bonaventura and Saints Apostoli in Rome where he earned his doctor’s degree in theology in 1674. He excelled in the study of both astronomy and Euclid. A little before 1678, Coronelli began working as a geographer and was commissioned to make a set of terrestrial and celestial globes for Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma. Each finely crafted globe was five feet in diameter (c. 175 cm) and so impressed the Duke that he made Coronelli his theologian. Coronelli&#x27;s renown as a theologian grew and in 1699 he was appointed Father General of the Franciscan order.

===Later life===

Coronelli worked in various European countries in the following years, before permanently returning to Venice in 1705. Here he started his own cosmographical project and published the volumes of &quot;Atlante Veneto&quot;. In his home city he founded the very first geographical society, the in 1684. He also held the position of Cosmographer of the Republic of Venice. Later six volumes of the &quot;Biblioteca Universale Sacro-Profana&quot; were published by Coronelli. This was a kind of encyclopedia, its compiled entries ordered alphabetically.

Coronelli died at the age of 68 in Venice, having created hundreds of maps in his lifetime. 

The International Coronelli Society for the Study of Globes, founded 1952 in Vienna, is named in Coronelli’s honor.

==Globes for Louis XIV==

Cardinal César d&#x27;Estrées, friend and adviser to Louis XIV and ambassador to Rome, saw the Duke of Parma’s globes and invited Coronelli to Paris in 1681 to construct a pair of globes for the Most Christian King. Coronelli moved to the French capital in 1681, where he lived for two years. Each globe was composed of spindles of bent timber about ten feet long and four inches broad at the equator. This wood was then coated with a layer of plaster about an inch thick and covered in a layer of strong unfinished fabric. This was then wrapped in a quarter-inch layer of two very fine fabrics which provided backing for the painted information of the globes. These globes, measuring 384 cm in diameter and weighing approximately 2 tons, are displayed in the Bibliothèque nationale François Mitterrand in Paris. The globes depicted the latest information of French explorations in North America, particularly the expeditions of René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.

<text>The Office of Special Plans (OSP), which existed from September 2002 to June 2003, was a Pentagon unit created by Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, and headed by Feith, as charged by then–United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to supply senior George W. Bush administration officials with raw intelligence (unvetted by intelligence analysts, see Stovepiping) pertaining to Iraq. A similar unit, called the Iranian Directorate, was created several years later, in 2006, to deal with intelligence on Iran.

==Allegations of manipulation of intelligence==

In an interview with the Scottish &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Larry C. Johnson said the OSP was &quot;dangerous for US national security and a threat to world peace. [The OSP] lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam. It&#x27;s a group of ideologues with pre-determined notions of truth and reality. They take bits of intelligence to support their agenda and ignore anything contrary. They should be eliminated.&quot;

Seymour Hersh writes that, according to an unnamed Pentagon adviser, &quot;[OSP] was created in order to find evidence of what Wolfowitz and his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, wanted to be true—that Saddam Hussein had close ties to Al Qaeda, and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons (WMD) that threatened the region and, potentially, the United States. [...] &#x27;The agency [CIA] was out to &quot;disprove&quot; linkage between Iraq and terrorism,&#x27; the Pentagon adviser told me. &#x27;That&#x27;s what drove them. If you&#x27;ve ever worked with intelligence data, you can see the ingrained views at C.I.A. that color the way it sees data.&#x27; The goal of Special Plans, he said, was &#x27;to put the data under the microscope to reveal what the intelligence community can&#x27;t see.&#x27;&quot;

These allegations are supported by an annex to the first part of Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq published in July 2004. The review, which was highly critical of the CIA&#x27;s Iraq intelligence generally but found its judgments were right on the lack of an Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, suggests that the OSP, if connected to an &quot;Iraqi intelligence cell&quot; also headed by Douglas Feith which is described in the annex, sought to discredit and cast doubt on CIA analysis in an effort to establish a connection between Saddam Hussein and terrorism. In one instance, in response to a cautious CIA report, &quot;Iraq and al-Qa&#x27;eda: A Murky Relationship&quot;, the annex relates that &quot;one of the individuals working for the [intelligence cell led by Feith] stated that the June [2002] report, &#x27;...should be read for content only – and CIA&#x27;s interpretation ought to be ignored.&#x27;&quot;

In 2004, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; published an investigative report by Jason Vest and Robert Dreyfuss about the Office of Special Plans. In a February 2004 interview with FAIR Dreyfuss said that the Bush administration had already decided to invade Iraq but needed a reason that would satisfy the US public and the Congress so &quot;they picked on this &quot;Iraq is a threat&quot; argument. He said the OSP &quot;took these piles and piles of information, with thousands of little data bits, and they picked out the ones that supported the case for going to war, and they discarded all the rest&quot;.

Douglas Feith called the office&#x27;s report a much-needed critique of the CIA&#x27;s intelligence. &quot;It&#x27;s healthy to criticize the CIA&#x27;s intelligence&quot;, Feith said. &quot;What the people in the Pentagon were doing was right. It was good government.&quot; Feith also rejected accusations he attempted to link Iraq to a formal relationship with Al Qaeda. &quot;No one in my office ever claimed there was an operational relationship&quot;, Feith said. &quot;There was a relationship.&quot;

In another instance, an &quot;Iraqi intelligence cell&quot; briefing to Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz in August 2002 condemned the CIA&#x27;s intelligence assessment techniques and denounced the CIA&#x27;s &quot;consistent underestimation&quot; of matters dealing with the alleged Iraq–Al-Qaeda co-operation. In September 2002, two days before the CIA&#x27;s final assessment of the Iraq-al Qaeda relationship, Feith briefed senior advisers to Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice, undercutting the CIA&#x27;s credibility and alleging &quot;fundamental problems&quot; with CIA intelligence-gathering. As reported in the conservative British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Senator Jay Rockefeller, senior Democrat on the [Senate] committee, said that Mr Feith&#x27;s cell may even have undertaken &#x27;unlawful&#x27; intelligence-gathering initiatives.&quot;

In February 2007, the Pentagon&#x27;s inspector general issued a report that concluded that Feith&#x27;s office &quot;developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.&quot; The report found that these actions were &quot;inappropriate&quot; though not &quot;illegal.&quot; Senator Carl Levin, Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that &quot;The bottom line is that intelligence relating to the Iraq–al-Qaeda relationship was manipulated by high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense to support the administration&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq. The inspector general&#x27;s report is a devastating condemnation of inappropriate activities in the DOD policy office that helped take this nation to war.&quot; At Senator Levin&#x27;s insistence, on April 6, 2007, the Pentagon&#x27;s Inspector General&#x27;s Report was declassified and released to the public.

Feith stated that he &quot;felt vindicated&quot; by the report. He told the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that his office produced &quot;a criticism of the consensus of the intelligence community, and in presenting it I was not endorsing its substance.&quot;

Feith also said the inspector general&#x27;s report amounted to circular logic: &quot;The people in my office were doing a criticism of the intelligence community consensus&quot;, Feith said. &quot;By definition, that criticism varied. If it didn&#x27;t vary, they wouldn&#x27;t have done the criticism.&quot;

==Alleged unlawful activities==
Journalist Larisa Alexandrovna of &quot;The Raw Story&quot; reported in 2006 that the OSP &quot;deployed several extra-legal and unapproved task force missions&quot; in Iraq both before and after the beginning of combat. The teams operated independently of other operations, occasionally causing confusion on the battlefield. The teams appear to have had a political rather than military mission; specifically, to find Iraqi intelligence officers willing to come up with evidence of WMD in Iraq whether or not such weapons actually existed:

&quot;They come in the summer of 2003, bringing in Iraqis, interviewing them&quot;, [a source close to the UN Security Council] said. &quot;Then they start talking about WMD and they say to [these Iraqi intelligence officers] that &#x27;Our President is in trouble. He went to war saying there are WMD and there are no WMD. What can we do? Can you help us?&#x27;&quot;

According to the United Nations source, the intelligence officers did not cooperate with the OSP forces because they were aware that forged WMD evidence &quot;would not pass the smell test and could be shown to be not of Iraqi origin and not using Iraqi methodology.&quot;

==Indictment for espionage==

Lawrence Franklin, an analyst and Iran expert in the Feith office, has been charged with espionage, as part of a larger FBI investigation (see Lawrence Franklin espionage scandal). The scandal involves passing information regarding United States policy towards Iran to Israel via the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Feith&#x27;s role is also being investigated.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Feith&#x27;s office had an unconventional relationship with Israel&#x27;s intelligence services:

Allegations have also been made that Pentagon employees in the Feith office have been involved in plans for overthrowing the governments of Iran and Syria.

When Former NSA Chief General Michael Hayden testified before the Senate Hearing on his nomination as Director of Central Intelligence in May 2006, he was questioned by Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) on the pressure exerted by the Office of Special Plans on the intelligence community over the question of Hussein&#x27;s links to al-Qaeda. Hayden explained that he was not comfortable with the OSP&#x27;s analysis:

I got three great kids, but if you tell me go out and find all the bad things they&#x27;ve done, Hayden, I can build you a pretty good dossier, and you&#x27;d think they were pretty bad people, because that was what I was looking for and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d build up. That would be very wrong. That would be inaccurate. That would be misleading.

He also acknowledged that after &quot;repeated inquiries from the Feith office&quot; he put a disclaimer on NSA intelligence assessments of Iraq/al-Qaeda contacts.

<text>A Gilman reagent is a diorganocopper compound with the formula Li[CuR2], where R is an alkyl or aryl. They are colorless solids.

==Use in organic chemistry==
These reagents are useful because, unlike related Grignard reagents and organolithium reagents, they react with organic halides to replace the halide group with an R group (the Corey–House reaction). Such displacement reactions allow for the synthesis of complex products from simple building blocks. Lewis acids can be used to modify the reagent.

&lt;/math&gt;|align=center|width=540|caption=Generalized chemical reaction showing Gilman’s reagent reacting with organic halide to form products and showing Cu(III) reaction intermediate}}

== History ==
These reagents were discovered by Henry Gilman and coworkers. Lithium dimethylcopper (CH3)2CuLi can be prepared by adding copper(I) iodide to methyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at −78 °C. In the reaction depicted below, the Gilman reagent is a methylating reagent reacting with an alkyne in a conjugate addition, and the ester group forms a cyclic enone.


==Structure==
Lithium dimethylcuprate exists as a dimer in diethyl ether forming an 8-membered ring. Similarly, lithium diphenylcuprate crystallizes as a dimeric etherate, .

If the Li+ ions is complexed with the crown ether 12-crown-4, the resulting diorganylcuprate anions adopt a linear coordination geometry at copper.

For the higher order cyanocuprate Li2CuCN(CH3)2, the cyanide ligand is coordinated to Li and π-bound to Cu.

==Mixed cuprates==
More useful generally than the Gilman reagents are the so-called mixed cuprates with the formula [RCuX]− and [R2CuX]2−. Such compounds are often prepared by the addition of the organolithium reagent to copper(I) halides and cyanide. These mixed cuprates are more stable and more readily purified. One problem addressed by mixed cuprates is the economical use of the alkyl group. Thus, in some applications, the mixed cuprate with the formula is prepared by combining thienyllithium and cuprous cyanide followed by the organic group to be transferred. In this higher order mixed cuprate, both the cyanide and thienyl groups do not transfer, only the R group does.

<text>Suicide King is the third studio album by American heavy metal band King 810. Released on 25 January 2019, the work was published independently by the ensemble and produced by Josh Schroeder and David Gunn in Michigan.

== Background ==
In 2017–2018, drummer Andrew Workman, guitarist Andrew Beal and the band parted ways. In October 2018, the group released a music video for &quot;Heartbeats&quot;, the first single off of the album.

== Touring ==
In November 2018, the ensemble performed at the Buick City Events Center. Following this performance, the quartet spent November and December in the United Kingdom with PUPPY.

== Critical reception ==
Neil Criddle of &quot;Dead Press&quot; stated that &quot;Heartbeats&quot; &quot;sets things off perfectly, with a frenetically aggressive chorus with Gunn&#x27;s lyrical pace intensifying, culminating in a real sense of urgency and vitality&quot;.

Stephen Hill of &quot;Louder Sound&quot; stated that &quot;album closer &quot;Sing Me to Sleep&quot; has a dreamy, robotic nightmare vibe, &quot;Wade in the Water&quot; addresses the Flint, Michigan water crisis using old blues and Tom Waits-esque dark crooning and album highlight &quot;Black Rifle&quot; is a piano-led ballad with a funeral stomp that recalls the gravel-voiced acoustic hip hop of Everlast&quot;.

<doc id="455611" wikidata="Q2338787" url="?curid=455611" title="Phormio">
<text>Phormio ( &quot;Phormion&quot;, &quot;gen&quot;.: Φορμίωνος), the son of Asopius, was an Athenian general and admiral before and during the Peloponnesian War. A talented naval commander, Phormio commanded at several famous Athenian victories in 428 BC, and was honoured after his death with a statue on the acropolis and a state funeral. He is considered one of Athens&#x27; many great admirals, alongside Themistocles and Cimon.

==Early commands==
Phormio first appears in the historical record in 440 BC, when he shared with Thucydides, Hagnon, and others the command of the Athenian fleet in the later part of the Samian War. In 432 BC, he commanded a force of 1600 hoplites sent to assist in the siege of Potidaea. Phormio led his men up slowly from the side of the city that the Athenians had not yet surrounded and constructed a counter-wall to complete Potidaea&#x27;s investment. After Potidaea was firmly besieged, Phormio led his men in a successful campaign against Athens&#x27; enemies in the Chalcidice, and in the next year he again led an army attacking the Chalcidians, this time alongside Perdiccas II, king of Macedon.

==Naupactus==
In the winter of 429/8 BC, Phormio was sent out to the Corinthian Gulf as commander of a fleet of 20 triremes; establishing his base at Naupactus, Phormio instituted a blockade of Corinthian shipping. In the summer of 429 BC, however, Sparta began preparing a sizeable fleet and army to attack Athens&#x27; allies in the region, hoping to overrun Acarnania on land, capture the islands of Zacynthus and Cephallenia, and possibly even take Naupactus. Phormio was notified of these plans by the concerned Acarnanians, but was initially unwilling to leave Naupactus unprotected. When the Peloponnesian fleet began moving along the south shore of the Corinthian gulf, however, aiming to cross over to Acarnania, the Athenians followed along the north shore and attacked them once they passed out of the Gulf into the open sea and attempted to cross from the south to the north.

In the ensuing battle, Phormio utilized a unique and unorthodox tactic. The Peloponnesians, despite their superior numbers (they had 47 ships to the Athenians&#x27; 20, although many of their vessels were loaded with heavy infantry) pulled their ships into a defensive circle, prows facing outwards. Phormio with his ships circled around the Peloponnesian fleet, driving the circle ever tighter. The tactic was a risky one—it left the Athenians&#x27; flanks utterly vulnerable to ramming—but it paid off when a wind blew up and caused the inexperienced crews of the circled vessels to foul their oars. In this moment of confusion, the Athenians rushed in and routed the remaining ships of the fleet, seizing 12 of them.

In a second battle shortly after this, Phormio and his small force triumphed against an even larger Peloponnesian fleet of 77 ships. Drawn into the narrow waters of the Corinthian gulf to protect Naupactus, the Athenians were initially routed and divided, but 11 Athenian ships which were pursued into Naupactus were able to turn about on their pursuers and defeat the numerically superior force opposite them. This victory preserved Athenian naval supremacy in the Gulf and put an end to Peloponnesian attempts to challenge it during this period of the war.

==Legacy==
After a single land campaign in 428 BC in Acarnania, Phormio is not recorded as having held command again. In his few years of activity, however, he had left a deep imprint on the early course of the Peloponnesian War. An Athenian defeat in the Corinthian Gulf in 429/8 BC would have been a devastating blow to Athens&#x27; influence in the Greek north-east, and to the city&#x27;s reputation for naval invincibility. After his death, the Athenians commemorated his service to the state by erecting a statue of him on the acropolis and burying his body in the state cemetery.

Phormio&#x27;s son, named Asopius after his grandfather, also commanded a naval expedition during the war.

<doc id="455614" wikidata="Q5249472" url="?curid=455614" title="Declaration of war by the United States">
<text>A declaration of war is a formal declaration issued by a national government indicating that a state of war exists between that nation and another. A document by the Federation of American Scientists gives an extensive listing and summary of statutes which are automatically engaged upon the United States declaring war.

For the United States, Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution says &quot;Congress shall have power to ... declare War.&quot; However, that passage provides no specific format for what form legislation must have in order to be considered a &quot;declaration of war&quot; nor does the Constitution itself use this term. In the courts, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in &quot;Doe v. Bush&quot;, said: &quot;[T]he text of the October Resolution itself spells out justifications for a war and frames itself as an &#x27;authorization&#x27; of such a war.&quot; in effect saying an authorization suffices for declaration and what some may view as a formal congressional &quot;Declaration of War&quot; was not required by the Constitution.

The last time the United States formally declared war, using specific terminology, on any nation was in 1942, when war was declared against Axis-aligned Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, because President Franklin Roosevelt thought it was improper to engage in hostilities against a country without a formal declaration of war. Since then, every American president has used military force without a declaration of war.

This article will use the term &quot;formal declaration of war&quot; to mean congressional legislation that uses the phrase &quot;declaration of war&quot; in the title. Elsewhere, this article will use the terms &quot;authorized by Congress,&quot; &quot;funded by Congress&quot; or &quot;undeclared war&quot; to describe other such conflicts.

==History==
The United States has formally declared war against foreign nations in five separate wars, each upon prior request by the president of the United States. Four of those five declarations came after hostilities had begun. James Madison reported that in the Federal Convention of 1787, the phrase &quot;make war&quot; was changed to &quot;declare war&quot; in order to leave to the executive the power to repel sudden attacks but not to commence war without the explicit approval of Congress. Debate continues as to the legal extent of the president&#x27;s authority in this regard. 

Public opposition to American involvement in foreign wars, particularly during the 1930s, was expressed as support for a Constitutional Amendment that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war. Several constitutional amendments, such as the Ludlow Amendment, have been proposed that would require a national referendum on a declaration of war.

After Congress repealed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in January 1971 and President Richard Nixon continued to wage war in Vietnam, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution () over the veto of Nixon in an attempt to rein in some of the president&#x27;s claimed powers. The War Powers Resolution proscribes the only power of the president to wage war which is recognized by Congress.

== Declarations of War ==

The United States has formally declared war in five separate conflicts, issuing declarations against ten different foreign nations. The only country to have been the subject of multiple U.S. war declarations is Germany, which the United States formally declared war against twice, once in World War I and again in World War II. A case could also be made for Hungary, as it was a successor state to Austria-Hungary, against which the U.S. declared war in World War I.

=== Formal Declarations of War ===

Under the United States Constitution, Congress holds the sole authority to issue formal war declarations. Since the nation&#x27;s founding, Congress has exercised this power on a limited number of occasions.

The first formal declaration occurred on June 18, 1812, when the United States declared war against the United Kingdom, citing British impressment of American sailors and violations of U.S. neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars. This conflict, known as the War of 1812, concluded with the Treaty of Ghent in 1814.

On May 13, 1846, Congress declared war on Mexico at the request of President James K. Polk, following territorial disputes and military clashes in Texas. The Mexican-American War resulted in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which expanded U.S. territory to include present-day California, Arizona, and other southwestern states.

The Spanish-American War marked another instance of a formal declaration of war. The conflict was precipitated by the sinking of the USS &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana Harbor and growing tensions over Spanish colonial rule in Cuba. The war ended later that year with the Treaty of Paris (1898), which granted the United States control over former Spanish territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.

During World War I, the United States declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, citing unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram, in which Germany attempted to persuade Mexico to join the war against the United States. Later that year, on December 7, 1917, Congress also declared war on Austria-Hungary, a German ally. The conflict formally ended for the United States with the signing of separate peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Hungary in 1921.

World War II saw the most formal war declarations by the United States. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Congress declared war on Japan the next day, with near-unanimous approval. In response, Nazi Germany and Italy, led by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, declared war on the United States on December 11, prompting reciprocal declarations by Congress against both nations. In 1942, the United States further declared war on Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania, all Axis-aligned nations. The war concluded in 1945 with the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan, followed by formal peace treaties in the years after.

Each of these declarations was issued through a Congressional resolution, signed into law by the president, signifying the commencement of hostilities under the authority of the U.S. government. Since World War II, the United States has engaged in numerous military conflicts, but none have been accompanied by a formal declaration of war. Instead, Congress has authorized the use of military force through resolutions, such as those in Korea, Vietnam, and the War on Terror, including conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

==Undeclared wars==
===Military engagements authorized by Congress===
In other instances, the United States has engaged in extended military combat that was authorized by Congress.

===Military engagements authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolutions and funded by Congress===
In many instances, the United States has engaged in extended military engagements that were authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolutions and funded by appropriations from Congress.

===Other undeclared wars===

On at least 125 occasions, the president has acted without prior express military authorization from Congress. These include instances in which the United States fought in the Philippine–American War from 1898 to 1903, in Nicaragua in 1927, as well as the NATO bombing campaign of Yugoslavia in 1999, and the 2018 missile strikes on Syria.

The United States&#x27; longest war, against the Taliban in Afghanistan, began in 2001 and ended with the withdrawal of American troops on 31 August 2021.

The Indian Wars comprise at least 28 conflicts and engagements. These localized conflicts, with Native Americans, began with European colonists coming to North America, long before the establishment of the United States. For the purpose of this discussion, the Indian Wars are defined as conflicts with the United States of America. They begin as one front in the American Revolutionary War in 1775 and had concluded by 1918. The United States Army still maintains a campaign streamer for Pine Ridge 1890–1891 despite opposition from certain Native American groups.

The American Civil War was not an international conflict under the laws of war, because the Confederate States of America (CSA) was not a government that had been granted full diplomatic recognition as a sovereign nation by other sovereign states or by the government of the United States.

==War Powers Resolution==
On March 21, 2011, a number of lawmakers expressed concern that the decision of President Barack Obama to order the U.S. military to join in attacks of Libyan air defenses and government forces exceeded his constitutional authority because the decision to authorize the attack was made without congressional permission.

<doc id="455616" wikidata="Q2169548" url="?curid=455616" title="Flower Drum Song">
<text>Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein. It is based on the 1957 novel, &quot;The Flower Drum Song&quot;, by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee. It premiered on Broadway in 1958 and was then performed in the West End and on tour. It was adapted for a 1961 musical film.

After their extraordinary early successes, beginning with &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; in 1943, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee&#x27;s novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, more light-hearted than Lee&#x27;s novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.

After the release of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang&#x27;s story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally.

== Background ==
=== Novel ===

C.Y. Lee fled war-torn China in the 1940s and came to the United States, where he attended Yale University&#x27;s playwriting program, graduating in 1947 with an M.F.A. degree. By the 1950s, he was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher, translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers. He had hoped to break into playwriting, but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown, &quot;The Flower Drum Song&quot; (originally titled &quot;Grant Avenue&quot;). Lee initially had no success selling his novel, but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar, Straus and Cudahy. The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation. The reader was found dead in bed, the manuscript beside him with the words &quot;Read this&quot; scrawled on it. The publishing house did, and bought Lee&#x27;s novel, which became a bestseller in 1957.

Lee&#x27;s novel centers on Wang Chi-yang, a 63-year-old man who fled China to avoid the communists. The wealthy refugee lives in a house in Chinatown with his two sons. His sister-in-law, Madam Tang, who takes citizenship classes, is a regular visitor and urges Wang to adopt Western ways. While his sons and sister-in-law are integrating into American culture, Wang stubbornly resists assimilation and speaks only two words of English, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;. Wang also has a severe cough, which he does not wish to have cured, feeling that it gives him authority in his household. Wang&#x27;s elder son, Wang Ta, woos Linda Tung, but on learning that she has many men in her life, drops her; he later learns she is a nightclub dancer. Linda&#x27;s friend, seamstress Helen Chao, who has been unable to find a man despite the shortage of eligible women in Chinatown, gets Ta drunk and seduces him. On awakening in her bed, he agrees to an affair, but eventually abandons her, and she commits suicide.

Impatient at Ta&#x27;s inability to find a wife, Wang arranges for a picture bride for his son. However, before the picture bride arrives, Ta meets a young woman, May Li, who with her father has recently come to San Francisco. The two support themselves by singing depressing flower drum songs on the street. Ta invites the two into the Wang household, with his father&#x27;s approval, and he and May Li fall in love. He vows to marry her after she is falsely accused by the household servants of stealing a clock, though his father forbids it. Wang struggles to understand the conflicts that have torn his household apart; his hostility toward assimilation is isolating him from his family. In the end, taking his son&#x27;s advice, Wang decides not to go to the herbalist to seek a remedy for his cough, but walks to a Chinese-run Western clinic, symbolizing that he is beginning to accept American culture.

=== Genesis of the musical ===

Rodgers and Hammerstein, despite extraordinary successes earlier in their partnership, such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;South Pacific&quot;, had suffered back-to-back Broadway relative failures in the mid-1950s with &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;. While &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; had broken new ground in 1943, any new project in the late 1950s would have to compete with modern musicals and techniques, like the brutal realism in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and with other Broadway musical hits such as &quot;The Music Man&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their rule to begin work on their next musical as soon as the last opened on Broadway, but by the start of 1957, six months after &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; closed, the pair had no new stage musical in prospect. They had, however, been working since 1956 on the popular television version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS on March 31, 1957. Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for cancer in a tooth socket, and he was drinking heavily and suffering from depression. In June 1957, Rodgers checked himself into Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, and he remained there for twelve weeks. According to his daughters, Mary and Linda, this did not put a stop to his drinking.

Hammerstein, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles at the filming of &quot;South Pacific&quot;. While at the commissary, he met longtime friend, Joe Fields, who mentioned that he was negotiating for the rights to &quot;The Flower Drum Song&quot;. Intrigued by the title, Hammerstein asked for a copy of the novel, and decided that it had potential as a musical – the lyricist described it as &quot;sort of a Chinese &quot;Life with Father&quot;&quot;. Hammerstein consulted with Rodgers, and they agreed to make it their next work, to be written and produced in association with Fields. Hammerstein began work in mid-1958. In July, however, he fell ill and was hospitalized for a month. This forced him to hurry his writing, as the production team had hoped to have the show in rehearsal by the start of September; this was postponed by two weeks. In interviews, however, Hammerstein pointed out that he had, when necessary, written songs for previous shows while in rehearsals for them.

The musical retained Lee&#x27;s &quot;central theme – a theme coursing through much 20th-century American literature: the conflict between Old World immigrants and their New World offspring&quot;. Hammerstein and Fields shifted the focus of the story, however, from the elder Wang, who is central to Lee&#x27;s novel, to his son Ta. They also removed darker elements of Lee&#x27;s work, including Helen Chao&#x27;s suicide after her desperate fling with Ta, added the festive nightclub subplot and emphasized the romantic elements of the story. This made the musical more lighthearted and comedic than the novel. According to David Lewis in his book about the musical, &quot;Mr. Hammerstein and his colleagues were evidently in no mood to write a musical drama or even to invest their comedic approach with dramatic counterpoint of the sort that Jud Fry had given &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; ... [They] took the safest commercial route by following the eldest son&#x27;s search for love – the most popular theme at the time with Broadway audiences.&quot; Lewis notes that Chao&#x27;s role, though diminished in the musical, nevertheless gives it some of its darkest moments, and she serves much the same purpose as Jud Fry: to be, in Hammerstein&#x27;s words, &quot;the bass fiddle that gives body to the orchestration of the story&quot;. Though the new story was less artistically adventurous than the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein hits, it was innovative, even daring in its treatment of Asian-Americans, &quot;an ethnic group that had long been harshly caricatured and marginalized in our mainstream pop culture.&quot;

=== 1958 plot ===

Act I:
Wang Ta, a young Chinese-American man living in his father&#x27;s house in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, discusses the problems of finding a wife with his aunt, Madam Liang (&quot;You Are Beautiful&quot;) before hurrying off on a blind date. Nightclub owner Sammy Fong arrives with an offer for Ta&#x27;s immigrant father, Master Wang, a very old-fashioned Chinatown elder. Sammy&#x27;s picture bride has just arrived from China, illegally, but the shy Mei Li is clearly the wrong girl for Sammy, who already has an assertive girlfriend, a characteristic he likes. Sammy offers to sign the contract over to the Wang family: this would free Sammy from the contract and arrange a suitable wife for Ta. Sammy has taken the liberty of bringing the girl and her father with him; Wang is charmed (&quot;A Hundred Million Miracles&quot;) and invites them to live in his home on the understanding that if the proposed marriage falls through, Fong will still be bound to marry Mei Li.

Ta&#x27;s blind date proves to be the thoroughly Americanized Linda Low, who we will learn is Sammy Fong&#x27;s girlfriend and a stripper at his club. On the date with Ta (&quot;I Enjoy Being a Girl&quot;), Linda lies to Ta about her career and family. Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees find it hard to get a job befitting their education, plans to go to law school, postponing the likely career struggle by three years. The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him (&quot;I Am Going to Like It Here&quot;), though Ta is unimpressed. That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress (&quot;Like a God&quot;).

Linda comes to Madam Liang&#x27;s graduation party from citizenship school with Linda&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot; (actually the comedian from Sammy&#x27;s nightclub) and presents herself as Ta&#x27;s intended, with her &quot;brother&quot; giving his consent for the marriage. The extroverted, Americanized woman is not what Wang has in mind for his elder son, and Wang and Ta argue. Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda&#x27;s scheme: Linda, frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy, is determined to marry &quot;someone&quot;, and if Sammy won&#x27;t step forward, she will settle for Ta. Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs, Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his &quot;Celestial Bar&quot; (&quot;Fan Tan Fannie&quot;). Linda does her striptease, realizing too late who is sitting at the best table. Sammy&#x27;s special guests storm out, except for Ta, who is so humiliated that he does not know what to do. He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao, a seamstress who fits Linda&#x27;s costumes for her, and whose love for Ta is unrequited. Linda, goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises his glass to her, dumps a champagne bucket over his head.

Act II:
The drunken Ta spends the night at Helen&#x27;s apartment (&quot;Ballet&quot;). In the morning, Mei Li delivers Master Wang&#x27;s coat for Helen to mend and is distressed to see Ta&#x27;s dinner jacket there. Mei Li jumps to conclusions and leaves horrified. Ta leaves the lonely Helen, totally oblivious to her attempts to interest him. Wang wants the bar and its &quot;evil spirits&quot; shut down; his sister-in-law informs him that free enterprise cannot be shut down, and the two wonder at the foibles of the younger generation (&quot;The Other Generation&quot;). Ta arrives home to admit that his father was right, Mei Li is the girl for him. But now, Mei Li wants nothing to do with him, and the Lis leave the Wang home. Sammy Fong and Linda decide to get married (&quot;Sunday&quot;), but when he goes to the Three Family Association (a benevolent association) to announce Linda as his bride, he finds Mei Li and her father there, and the elders insist that he honor his betrothal to the immigrant girl.

Ta brings Mei Li a wedding gift of a pair of his mother&#x27;s earrings that she wore on her wedding day and tries unsuccessfully to hide the fact that he is now deeply in love with her. The wedding procession moves down San Francisco&#x27;s Grant Avenue with the bride, heavily veiled, carried on a sedan chair (&quot;Wedding Parade&quot;). Sammy drinks from the traditional wedding goblet, then offers the goblet to his new bride. Unveiled, Mei Li confesses to Sammy&#x27;s mother that she cannot marry Sammy as she is an illegal alien – a tactic she learned by watching American television. The contract is void, and that gives both Sammy and Ta the opportunity to marry their true loves, Linda and Mei Li.

=== Casting and tryouts ===
According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, Rodgers, Hammerstein and Fields had hoped to engage Yul Brynner as director. Brynner, who had gained fame in the team&#x27;s 1951 hit, &quot;The King and I&quot;, was an accomplished director. However, he was busy starring in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox. Instead, they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly, who had never directed on stage before. Kelly felt that the work would not be one of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s best, but &quot;as long as I crammed the show brim-full of every joke and gimmick in the book, I could get it to work&quot;.
The three producers sought Chinese, or at least Asian, actors to fill the cast, an idea that was, at the time, considered &quot;very risky&quot;. In the 1950s, there were relatively few Asian-American actors; Rodgers believed that Asians avoided acting because of shyness. Critics note, in any case, that Asian-Americans &quot;had found few opportunities in mainstream theatre.&quot; Joshua Logan recommended a young Japanese actress, Miyoshi Umeki, whom he had discovered and cast the previous year opposite Marlon Brando in the film &quot;Sayonara&quot; (for which she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar); she was cast as Mei Li. They cast Keye Luke, well known as Charlie Chan&#x27;s Number One Son, as Master Wang. Rodgers and Hammerstein considered young talent from &quot;The King and I&quot; who might fit the parts, and came up with teenager Patrick Adiarte, a Filipino-American who had played several of the young princes as he grew up, before finishing as the crown prince, Chulalongkorn. A talented dancer, he was cast as Wang San, Ta&#x27;s thoroughly Americanized younger brother. Pat Suzuki, a Japanese-American who had been interned during World War II, was a recent arrival in New York who had made strong positive impressions for her singing on such television programs as &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (with Jack Paar) and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. She became the first Linda Low, as Ta&#x27;s nightclub love interest was renamed.

The team found it difficult to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. Kelly and the show&#x27;s choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. No formal audition was held in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro &quot;Jack&quot; Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong&#x27;s Celestial Bar. The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show&#x27;s choreographer. The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang&#x27;s sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in &quot;South Pacific&quot;. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. Rodgers later wrote, &quot;what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman [in &quot;South Pacific&quot;], Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared to meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up.&quot;

When rehearsals began in September 1958, Hammerstein was absent, still recuperating from his surgery. Rodgers was present, but kept falling asleep. Hammerstein was told by his son James that Kelly was ineffective as a director, and began attending rehearsals. A number of changes were made to the songs. &quot;My Best Love&quot;, a song for Master Wang, was at first thought better suited to his sister-in-law, but when Juanita Hall could not make it work, the song was cut entirely. Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed a song entitled &quot;She Is Beautiful&quot; into &quot;You Are Beautiful&quot;. The team decided to include a song for Sammy Fong to explain to Mei Li that they should not wed. In the span of a few hours, they wrote the lyrics and music to &quot;Don&#x27;t Marry Me&quot;. Once the songs were finalized, Robert Russell Bennett, who had orchestrated several of the creators&#x27; most successful previous shows, did the same for the score of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;.

The musical opened for tryouts on October 27, 1958, at Boston&#x27;s Shubert Theatre. The audience gave it an enthusiastic response, causing Rodgers to leave his seat repeatedly and race to the back of the theatre, looking for someone to hug. The Boston critics thought well of the work, stating that after the show was polished, it was likely to be a hit. Shortly after the Boston opening, Fields suffered a heart attack, and, after his release from the hospital, he had to return to New York to recuperate. Author C. Y. Lee, who had quietly watched the rehearsals, recalled that, at the Boston performances, Hammerstein would have a secretary mark on the script any sound of the chairs squeaking, as indicating that the audience was restless. Hammerstein rewrote some of the book to expand the focus from Ta himself to the romantic relationships of the two couples.

== Productions ==
=== Original Broadway production ===

After the Boston tryouts, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on December 1, 1958. Sets were designed by Oliver Smith, costumes by Irene Sharaff and lighting by Peggy Clark.

C.Y. Lee sat in the audience on the first night; he later stated that he had been nervous and was &quot;bowled over&quot; by the positive audience reaction. The show attracted considerable advance sales; even when these were exhausted, sales remained strong and sellouts were the norm. Cast album sales were similar to previous Rodgers and Hammerstein hits. The show received six Tony Award nominations, but won only one Tony (Best Conductor and Musical Director, for Salvatore Dell&#x27;Isola). It was overshadowed that year by &quot;Redhead&quot;, which though it received only slightly better reviews than &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and had a considerably shorter run, dominated the Tony Awards in the musical categories. &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; ran for 600 performances, a longer run than any of the shows with which it had competed for Asian performers.

Midway through the run, Larry Blyden left the show and was replaced in the role of Sammy Fong by Jack Soo, with Larry Leung assuming the role of Frankie Wing. The production returned $125,000 profit to its backers on an investment of $360,000. Attendance began to decline in December 1959, though it continued to draw at above the 70% of capacity level which a Broadway play then needed to meet expenses. With the summer approaching, generally a bad time for attendance, it was decided to close the show, and the last Broadway performance was given on May 7, 1960.

In his autobiography, Rodgers wrote of the effect the success of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; had on his state of mind:

The entire experience of working on &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; was rewarding in many ways, not the least of which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression. My only thought was to keep on doing what I was doing, and I saw nothing in the future that could stop me.
=== Subsequent productions ===
The show opened in London&#x27;s Palace Theatre on March 24, 1960, and ran for 464 performances. Fewer Asian performers were used in London; the West End production starred Yau Shan Tung as Mei Li, Kevin Scott as Ta, George Minami as Wang, Harriet Yamasaki (&quot;Yama Saki&quot;) as Linda Low, Tim Herbert as Sammy Fong and Ida Shepley as Madam Liang. The production used Haney&#x27;s choreography, Bennett&#x27;s orchestrations and the Broadway set and costume designs, but was directed and supervised by Jerome Whyte. Both the production and the London cast album were well received.

Following the closure of the Broadway production, a U.S. national tour began on May 10, 1960, in Detroit. Four of the New York leads, Hall, Soo, Kenney and Luke, joined the tour. By this time, Hammerstein was in his final illness (he died in August 1960), and none of the three producers accompanied the show on the road. After three weeks in Detroit, the show moved to Los Angeles, where the premiere attracted a star-studded audience, including three Scandinavian princesses. San Francisco gave the show a rapturous reception when it opened at the Curran Theatre on August 1. Lee and Fields, both present for the local premiere, were given ovations. Geary Street, on which the theatre is located, was decorated with Chinese lanterns, and a marching band of &quot;Chinese girl musicians&quot; played outside. The tour continued to be successful, spending 21 weeks in Chicago alone. It closed on October 14, 1961, in Cleveland, a month before the film of the musical opened.

Lewis calls the 1961 film version of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, starring Umeki, Soo, Hall and &quot;Suzie Wong&quot; star Nancy Kwan, &quot;a bizarre pastiche of limping mediocrity&quot;. He comments that since the 1958 version of the musical was rarely revived, the film &quot;would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it so crassly misrepresented&quot; and would serve as the version that academics and latter-day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical. The film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to lose money. Nevertheless, it was nominated for five Academy Awards and featured choreography by Hermes Pan. As early as mid-1961, the musical was licensed for local productions. That summer, the San Diego Civic Light Opera filled the 4,324-seat Balboa Park Bowl to overflowing for a highly successful run of the musical. It was less successfully revived by that company five years later; though it still attracted large crowds, local critics complained that Hammerstein&#x27;s view of Asians was outdated. Other early productions included successful revivals by the St. Louis Municipal Opera in 1961 and 1965 and revivals in the San Francisco area in 1963 and 1964, both times with Soo as Sammy Fong.

The musical proved difficult to produce for amateur and school groups, however, because it requires a cast either Asian or made up as Asian. Even professional companies found it difficult to round up an entire cast of Asian singer-dancer-actors. By the late 1960s, the musical was rarely staged, and was often relegated to dinner theater productions. The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization, which licenses the partnership&#x27;s works, believes that the work&#x27;s loss of popularity was due in part to increased racial sensitivity in the U. S. after the civil rights movement. In addition, producers found the show to be thinly plotted, and the songs not integrated as organically with the characters and story, as compared with Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s most popular musicals.

&quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; came to be seen by some as stereotypical and patronizing towards Asians, and that it was &quot;inauthentic, even offensive in its relentlessly upbeat picture of a big-city Chinatown&quot;. In 1983, the announcement that it would be produced in San Francisco started a furor; the producers pointedly stated that the show would be set in the 1930s and would have &quot;a greater sensitivity toward the Chinese immigration problems at that time&quot;. They added a scene in which Mei Li listens apprehensively to a radio broadcast warning about the dangers to the United States caused by Asian immigration. Many lines of dialogue were cut, and producer Fred Van Patten stated that &quot;[w]hat we&#x27;ve done is cut things in the show that Asians said to make white people laugh.&quot; The song &quot;Chop Suey&quot; was deleted, as was Master Wang&#x27;s line that all white men look alike (based on a line in C. Y. Lee&#x27;s novel, in which Wang states that all foreigners look alike). The author gave a rare public interview to defend his novel and the musical adaptation. The production, which had been scheduled for a three-week run, closed early. A well-attended production in Oakland in 1993 adhered strictly to the 1958 script, though part of the ballet was cut for lack of rehearsal time; a more heavily censored 1996 production in San Mateo also did well at the box office.

=== 2002 revival ===
In 1996, while attending the successful revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived and decided to work on &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. To Chinese Americans, the musical &quot;represented political incorrectness incarnate. But [Hwang] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. &#x27;It was kind of a guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.&#x27;&quot; Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed &quot;Asian playwright&quot; had approached him about revising &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. Chapin called the musical &quot;a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score. ... It&#x27;s one that ... needs changes.&quot; Rodgers&#x27; will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein&#x27;s instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. Hwang&#x27;s involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.

Hwang was given a free hand with dialogue; he was not allowed to change lyrics. Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals, and the producers hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the new script, &quot;really a new musical which has a pre-existing score.&quot; Only the character names, the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the relationships were retained, but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit of both Lee&#x27;s novel and the musical&#x27;s original concept of old-world and older generation values struggling with new-world temptations and the desires of the younger generation. This concept is reflected in the struggle for survival of Wang&#x27;s Chinese opera company, as it competes with the more modern, Americanized night club run by Ta. The role of Mei-li (as spelled in the revision) was expanded. The character of Madam Liang was changed &quot;from the wise-owl aunt&quot; to a &quot;savvy career woman&quot; in show business. Chinatown is portrayed as a more gritty and difficult place for new immigrants, and the pursuit of material success is given a more cynical face, especially in Act II. The song &quot;The Other Generation&quot; was deleted; &quot;My Best Love&quot;, which had been cut in tryouts in 1958, was restored in its place, and &quot;The Next Time It Happens&quot; was imported from &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;. New orchestrations were by Don Sebesky and music director David Chase. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hwang &quot;has reshaped the story to elucidate two of his own abiding thematic interests: the idea of the theater as a prism for society and the generational clashes of diversely assimilated immigrants.&quot;

In September 2000, after development through a series of workshops, the new version was presented at two well-attended workshops for potential backers. The show failed to raise enough money for an immediate Broadway run, but Hwang hoped that an extended Los Angeles run would lead to raising additional funds. The revival was originally planned for the 2,000-seat Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, but to save money he moved it to the nearby 739-seat Mark Taper Forum. Producer Gordon Davidson engaged an all-Asian cast, including Broadway star Lea Salonga as Mei-li. When it finally opened on October 14, 2001, the production received rave reviews from the Los Angeles critics. The show regularly sold out and was so popular it became the first show at the Taper to extend its scheduled run. It finally closed on January 13, 2002.
The success of the Los Angeles run sparked sufficient investment to move the show to Broadway. Half the cast was dismissed after the Los Angeles run for unstated reasons. Mary Rodgers later commented that Randall Duk Kim replaced Tzi Ma as Wang because she had admired Kim&#x27;s performance as the Kralahome in the 1996 revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;, but Kim was unavailable for the Los Angeles run. Hwang considerably altered and trimmed his long script during Broadway rehearsals and previews; &quot;The Next Time It Happens&quot; was removed from the show. During the runup to the Broadway opening, the show received mostly positive publicity.

Opening night at the Virginia Theatre on October 17, 2002, was attended by veterans of the film and 1958 production. Though it received warm applause from the audience, the critics mostly panned it. Attendance was near-capacity during the first month of the run, but then dropped off precipitously. The producers hoped the show could hold out long enough to get a boost from the Tony Awards (though nominated for three, including best book, it won none), but in February, they announced that the show would close on March 16, 2003, after 169 performances. The show&#x27;s backers lost their entire investment.

The production was directed and choreographed by Longbottom, with scenic design by Robin Wagner, costume design by Gregg Barnes and lighting design by Natasha Katz. Critic Karen Wada, in her afterword to the published script, blamed &quot;the sluggish economy, post-September 11 jitters, the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; mixed review, and unusually bitter winter weather&quot; for the unexpectedly short run. Lee also felt that the influential &quot;Times&quot; review had hurt the show&#x27;s acceptance, but commented that Hwang added some dialogue to Act II after the Los Angeles run that Lee felt slowed the show down. The closing was followed by a national tour that garnered mixed reviews, although Hwang stated that it was well received in every city except New York.

Subsequent productions have favored the Hwang script, although the older version remains available for license and has received occasional revivals, including a 2006 staged concert as part of Ian Marshall Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Lost Musicals&quot; series. A review in London&#x27;s &quot;The Times&quot; compared this production with &quot;the much grander production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; currently docked at the Albert Hall&quot; and judged that &quot;&quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; makes the more stimulating experience.&quot;

==== 2002 plot ====
Prologue:
In 1960, Wu Mei-li, a performer in Chinese opera, flees China with a flower drum after her father dies in prison for defying the Communists (&quot;A Hundred Million Miracles&quot;).

Act I:
On arrival in the United States, Mei-li goes to the Golden Pearl Theatre in San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, where little-attended Chinese opera is presented by her father&#x27;s old friend Wang Chi-yang and Wang&#x27;s foster brother Chin. One night a week, Wang&#x27;s son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub, starring the very assimilated Linda Low, a Chinese-American stripper from Seattle. Linda&#x27;s constant companion is a gay costume designer, Harvard (so named by his success-obsessed Chinese parents). The nightclub is profitable; the Chinese opera is not. Mei-li joins the opera company (&quot;I Am Going to Like It Here&quot;) and is soon attracted to the indifferent Ta, who favors Linda. Mei-li is fascinated by Linda, who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle (&quot;I Enjoy Being a Girl&quot;). Linda is soon signed by talent agent Rita Liang, who pushes Wang to turn the theater into a club full-time (&quot;Grant Avenue&quot;), and he reluctantly opens Club Chop Suey.

Ta slowly is becoming attracted to Mei-li, who now serves as a waitress, but he has competition from fortune cookie factory worker Chao, whom Mei-li met on the slow journey from China, and who is rapidly becoming discontented with America. Wang is also unhappy, despite the club&#x27;s success, and it is no consolation the crowd is having a good time – after all, in the old country, no crowd ever came to his theater expecting to enjoy themselves. Outraged at Harvard&#x27;s poor acting skills, Wang takes the stage in his place, his stage instincts take over (&quot;Gliding Through My Memories&quot;), and he is soon an enthusiastic supporter of the change, taking the stage name Sammy Fong. Linda advises Mei-li to put on one of her old stripper dresses to attract Ta, but the stratagem backfires, since Ta is attracted to Mei-li because of her wholesomeness. Ta and Mei-li quarrel; she takes her flower drum and leaves Club Chop Suey.

Act II:
Several months pass, and Club Chop Suey has become even flashier (&quot;Chop Suey&quot;). Ta can not forget Mei-li, and his uncle Chin (a janitor under the new regime) advises Ta to pursue her (&quot;My Best Love&quot;). He finds her in a fortune cookie factory working alongside Chao. Mei-li tells Ta that she and Chao have decided to return to China together, or at least to Hong Kong, then administered by the British. Meanwhile, Wang now finds himself attracted to Madam Liang, and the two have dinner together, though they decide not to marry (&quot;Don&#x27;t Marry Me&quot;). They marry anyway.

Linda announces that she is leaving for Los Angeles, as Wang&#x27;s &quot;Sammy Fong&quot; act has effectively taken over the show, and she has received a better offer. Ta intercepts Mei-li at the docks and persuades her to remain in America; Ta leaves Club Chop Suey and the two become street performers as Chao departs for Hong Kong. Harvard announces his intention to return home and attempt a reconciliation with his disappointed parents. Despite his irritation at Ta, Wang allows him to marry Mei-li at the club (which now features Ta&#x27;s Chinese opera one day a week), as the company celebrates how Chinese and American cultures have converged to create this happy moment (Finale: &quot;A Hundred Million Miracles&quot;).

== Critical reception ==
=== Original productions ===
Of the seven major New York newspaper drama reviewers, five gave the show very positive reviews. For example, &quot;New York Journal American&quot; critic John McClain stated, &quot;&quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; is a big fat Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, and nothing written here will have the slightest effect on the proceeds.&quot; The &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; termed it, &quot;Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of our musical theatre ... a lovely show, an outstanding one in theme and treatment.&quot; Less enthusiastic, however, was the longtime &quot;New York Times&quot; critic, Brooks Atkinson, who repeatedly described it as merely &quot;pleasant&quot;. UPI&#x27;s drama critic, Jack Gaver, scored it as &quot;well north of &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;&quot; but &quot;well south&quot; of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot; and even the team&#x27;s first flop, &quot;Allegro&quot;. Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having &quot;a brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman&quot; and termed the production &quot;an excellent Broadway show&quot; though &quot;[p]erhaps it doesn&#x27;t belong in the same world ... as &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot;.&quot; Critic Kenneth Tynan, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, alluded to the show &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot; in dismissing &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; with the spoonerism, &quot;a world of woozy song&quot;.

When the national tour of the show visited the city of its setting, most San Francisco reviewers gave the show very positive reviews, though the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; critic described the musical as one &quot;which has little by way of witty dialogue, outstanding songs or vigorous choreography&quot;. Nevertheless, she called the touring production superior to the Broadway one.

=== 2002 revival ===
Michael Phillips of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the show &quot;wholly revised and gleefully self-aware ... a few tons short of a mega-musical – no fake helicopters here, no power ballads saccharine enough to stop Communism in its tracks.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; thought the revival was, &quot;while not perfect, an exhilarating accomplishment&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a bold theatrical operation, an artistic success&quot;.

Critics reviewing the New York production generally gave it poor reviews. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded the creative team&#x27;s &quot;honorable intentions&quot; in bringing back a work thought to be &quot;terminally out-of-date&quot;, but felt both the new Mei-li and the show in general lacked personality. Howard Kissel of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; termed it &quot;an entertaining, albeit vulgar revival&quot;, and Clive Barnes of the &quot;New York Post&quot; found it no more memorable than the earlier version. The review in &quot;Talkin&#x27; Broadway&quot; is scathing, criticizing Hwang&#x27;s use of the songs and characters, and the orchestrations, and commenting: &quot;Hwang&#x27;s book lacks much of the charm, warmth, and wit of the original, and never takes the high road where the low road will do. ... Hwang felt it necessary to reduce the original, uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes.&quot; Michael Kuchwara commented in his lukewarm review for Associated Press: &quot;Then there&#x27;s Linda Low&#x27;s gay confidante, Harvard. Talk about stereotypes. If you are going to perpetuate one at least give him better jokes.&quot; On the other hand, both &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave it positive reviews. The &quot;CurtainUp&quot; review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom &quot;were able to keep numbers like &#x27;Chop Suey&#x27; and milk it for its razzle-dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians.&quot; Brantley disagreed, writing, &quot;because the show&#x27;s satiric point of view is so muddled, there&#x27;s no verve in such numbers, no joy in the performing of them.&quot;

In 2006, David Lewis compared the original script to Hwang&#x27;s version:
History never completely goes away. Hwang&#x27;s champions are unlikely to fade away, either, in rhetorical defeat. Dick and Oscar and Joe mined C. Y. Lee&#x27;s novel for the generational conflict and for the three women who substantiated Ta&#x27;s honorable search for love. Those themes, like it or not, still resonate today.

== Music and recordings ==

Rodgers and Hammerstein sought to give the new work an Eastern flavor, without using existing oriental music. According to Ben Brantley in his review of the 2002 Broadway revival, the use by Rodgers &quot;of repetitive Eastern musical structures gives the numbers a sing-song catchiness that, for better or worse, exerts a sticky hold on the memory.&quot; The most oriental-sounding song in the work is &quot;A Hundred Million Miracles&quot;, which provides the eight-note drumbeat which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain. Hammerstein wrote Mei Li&#x27;s first act song, &quot;I Am Going to Like It Here&quot;, in a Malaysian poetic form called &quot;pantoum&quot; in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza become the first and third lines of the next. One critic thought that the 2001 version&#x27;s orchestrations &quot;boast more Asian accents and a jazzier edge than the original&quot;, but another felt that they &quot;pale in comparison&quot; to Bennett&#x27;s typically lilting sound.

As with many of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musicals, the work features a ballet at the start of the second act, choreographed in the original production by Carol Haney. The ballet dramatizes the confused romantic longings of Wang Ta towards the women in his life, and ends as he awakens in Helen Chao&#x27;s bed. Thomas Hischak, in his &quot;The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia&quot;, notes that the ballets in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot; (choreographed by Agnes de Mille) broke new ground in illustrating facets of the characters beyond what is learned in songs and dialogue, but describes the ballet in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; as &quot;pleasant but not memorable&quot;. Although Hischak describes Rodgers as &quot;the greatest waltz composer America has ever seen&quot;, &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; was the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical not to feature one.
Several of the characters are given &quot;I am&quot; songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with &quot;I Enjoy Being a Girl&quot;; we learn Mei Li&#x27;s hopes with the quieter &quot;I Am Going to Like It Here&quot;. Although not a formal musical number, the brief &quot;You Be the Rock, I&#x27;ll Be the Roll&quot;, sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta&#x27;s Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as &quot;virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung&quot; in a Broadway musical. Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as &quot;corny stuff ... put in there to get a laugh&quot;. Helen Chao&#x27;s sad &quot;Love, Look Away&quot; is described by Lewis as &quot;arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote&quot;.

Having decided that record companies were profiting more from the sales of their cast albums than they were, Rodgers and Hammerstein formed their own record company to produce the cast recording for the original production of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. The album sold a relatively modest 300,000 copies, compared with sales of over a million copies for Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s next and final musical, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Still, it was certified as a gold record for having at least a million dollars in sales, and it spent 67 weeks in the U.S. Top 40, three of them at number 1, and also did well in the UK when the show opened there in 1960. The original cast album is relatively complete, even including parts of the Wedding Parade, though it does not include the ballet.

In 1960, the London cast recording was released. According to Hischak, the individual performers do not sing as well as the New York cast; the London recording&#x27;s strong points are the nightclub numbers. The 1961 album from the film uses a larger orchestra and, according to Hischak, has a fuller sound than the Broadway recording. It features dubbing by the opera singer Marilyn Horne (&quot;Love, Look Away&quot;) and band singer B. J. Baker (for Linda Low&#x27;s songs). A cast album for Hwang&#x27;s revision was released in 2002 featuring strong performances from Lea Salonga as Mei-li and Jose Llana as Wang Ta. This was nominated for a Grammy, though it did not win. Hischak notes that it is unfair to compare the later version with its earlier predecessors, as Hwang&#x27;s version &quot;has some of the dark corners and richness of a musical play&quot;.

<text>Kintyre (, ) is a peninsula in western Scotland, in the southwest of Argyll and Bute. The peninsula stretches about , from the Mull of Kintyre in the south to East and West Loch Tarbert in the north. The region immediately north of Kintyre is known as Knapdale.

Kintyre is long and narrow, at no point more than from west coast to east coast, and is less than wide where it connects to Knapdale at the north. Kintyre is the lower Firth of Clyde western coast and protects the Firth from the Atlantic Ocean. The southerly tip of Kintyre is on the North Channel that separates southwestern Scotland from Northern Ireland. The east side of the Kintyre Peninsula is bounded by Kilbrannan Sound, with a number of coastal peaks such as Torr Mor. The central spine of the peninsula is mostly hilly moorland, the highest point being Beinn an Tuirc at . The coastal areas and hinterland, however, are rich and fertile. Kintyre has long been a prized area for settlers, including the early Scots who migrated from Ulster to western Scotland and the Vikings or Norsemen who conquered and settled the area just before the start of the second millennium.

The principal town of the area is Campbeltown (about by road from the Mull), which has been a royal burgh since the mid-18th century. The area&#x27;s economy has long relied on fishing and farming, although Campbeltown has a reputation as a producer of some of the world&#x27;s finest single malt whisky. Campbeltown single malts include Springbank.

Kintyre Pursuivant, one of the officers of arms at the Court of the Lord Lyon, is named after this peninsula.

==History==
=== Beginnings ===

Kintyre, like Knapdale, contains several Stone Age sites; at Ballochroy is a trio of megaliths aligned with land features on the island of Jura, while a number of burial cairns still stand at Blasthill (near Southend, Argyll). Remains from the Iron Age are no less present, with the imposing Dun Skeig, a Celtic hillfort, located at the northern edge of Kintyre. The history of the presumed Pictish inhabitants of Kintyre is not recorded, but a 2nd-century BC stone fort survives at Kildonan (near Saddell), and it is not implausible that they continued to use Dun Skeig.

The tip of Kintyre is just from Ulster, and there has long been interaction across the straits of Moyle, as evidenced by Neolithic finds in Kintyre, such as flint tools characteristic of Antrim. In the early first millennium, an Irish invasion led to Gaelic colonisation of an area centred on the Kintyre peninsula, establishing the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata. The latter was divided into a handful of regions, controlled by particular kin groups, of which the most powerful, the Cenél nGabráin, ruled over Kintyre, along with Knapdale, the region between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne (Craignish, Ardscotnish, Glassary, and Glenary), Arran, and Moyle (in Ulster).

The kingdom thrived for a few centuries, and formed a springboard for Christianisation of the mainland. Sanda, an island adjacent the south coast of Kintyre, is strongly associated with Ninian, the first known missionary to the Picts, and contains an early 5th century chapel said to have been built by him. In 563, Columba arrived in Kintyre, to pay his respects to the kings of Dal Riata, before continuing to Iona, where he established a base for missionary activity throughout the Pictish regions beyond.

=== Norwegian dominion ===

Dál Riata was ultimately destroyed when Norse Vikings invaded, and established their own domain, spreading more extensively over the islands north and west of the mainland. Following the unification of Norway, they had become the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles, locally controlled by Godred Crovan, and known by Norway as &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (Old Norse, traditionally anglicised as &quot;Sodor&quot;), meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;. The former territory of Dal Riata acquired the geographic description &quot;Argyle&quot; (now &quot;Argyll&quot;): the &quot;Gaelic coast&quot;.
In 1093, Magnus, the Norwegian king, launched a military campaign to assert his authority over the isles. Malcolm, the king of Scotland, responded with a written agreement, accepting that Magnus&#x27; had sovereign authority of over all the western lands that Magnus could encircle by boat. The unspecific wording led Magnus to have his boat dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert, while he rode within it, so that he would thereby acquire Kintyre, in addition to the more natural &quot;islands&quot; of Arran and Bute.

Supposedly, Magnus&#x27;s campaign had been part of a conspiracy against Malcolm, by Donalbain, Malcolm&#x27;s younger brother. When Malcolm was killed in battle a short time later, Donalbain invaded, seized the Scottish kingdom, and displaced Malcolm&#x27;s sons from the throne; on becoming king, Donalbain confirmed Magnus&#x27; gains. Donalbain&#x27;s apparent keenness to do this, however, weakened his support among the nobility, and Malcolm&#x27;s son, Duncan, was able to depose him.

A few years later, following a rebellion against Magnus&#x27; authority in the Isles, he launched another, fiercer, expedition. In 1098, aware of Magnus&#x27; actions, the new Scottish king, Edgar (another son of Malcolm), quitclaimed to Magnus all sovereign authority over the isles, and the whole of Kintyre and Knapdale.
In the mid 12th century, Somerled, the husband of Godred Crovan&#x27;s granddaughter, led a successful revolt against Norway, transforming Suðreyjar (including Kintyre) into an independent kingdom. After his death, nominal Norwegian authority was re-established, but de facto authority was split between Somerled&#x27;s sons and the Crovan dynasty. The exact allocation to Somerled&#x27;s sons is unclear, but following a family dispute, Donald, Somerled&#x27;s grandson, acquired Kintyre, together with Knapdale, Islay, and Jura. Donald&#x27;s father, Reginald, established Saddell Abbey, in 1207.

In the mid 13th century, increased tension between Norway and Scotland led to a series of Battles, culminating in the Battle of Largs, shortly after which the Norwegian king died. In 1266, his more peaceable successor ceded his nominal authority over Suðreyjar to the Scottish king (Alexander III) by the Treaty of Perth, in return for a very large sum of money. Although Alexander III generally acknowledged the semi-independent authority of Somerled&#x27;s heirs, he did not give them back control of the mainland territory which Scottish forces had taken during the strife, including parts of Kintyre.

=== Early Scottish rule ===

In 1293, king John Balliol established shrieval authority by creating the post of sheriff of Kintyre. Shortly after, Robert de Bruys launched a civil war challenging John for the throne. By this point, Somerled&#x27;s descendants had formed into three families - the MacRory, the MacDougalls, and the MacDonalds; the MacDougalls took John&#x27;s side, while the MacDonalds and MacRory backed de Bruys. When de Bruys defeated John, he declared the MacDougall lands forfeit, and gave them to the MacDonalds.

The head of the MacDonald family married the heir of the MacRory family, thereby acquiring the remaining share of Somerled&#x27;s realm, and transforming it into the Lordship of the Isles, which lasted for over a century. After 4 years and 3 children, however, he divorced Amy, and married Margaret, the daughter of Robert II, the Scottish king, who gave him the remaining parts of Kintyre, along with the whole of Knapdale, as a dowry.

In 1462, however, John, the then Lord of the Isles, plotted with the English king to conquer Scotland; civil war in England delayed the discovery of this for a decade. Upon the discovery, in 1475, there was a call for forfeiture, but a year later John calmed the matter, by quitclaiming Ross (Easter, Wester, and Skye), Kintyre, and Knapdale, to Scotland.

=== The Campbells and later ===
At an uncertain date before 1481, the sheriffdom of Kintyre became &quot;Tarbertshire&quot;, based at Tarbert at the northern end of Kintyre; in that year, Tarbertshire was expanded to include Knapdale. However, comital authority remained absent following the quitclaim from the Lord of the Isles; following a law and order crisis in the region, king James IV of Scotland appointed Archibald Campbell, the Earl of Argyll as governor of Tarbert Castle, with implied authority over nearby castles such as Skipness.

Following the Scottish Reformation, the MacDonalds (opponents) and Campbells (supporters) came into more direct dispute. In 1607, after a series of hostile actions by the MacDonalds, King James VI ordered their lands in Kintyre to be transferred to Archibald Campbell, heir of the earlier Archibald. Under pressure from the Campbells, the sheriff court moved to Inveraray at the extreme northeast of Tarbertshire, near the heart of Campbell power; somewhat inevitably, in 1633 shrieval authority was annexed by the sheriff of Argyll.

Archibald&#x27;s son, a dedicated supporter of the religious reformers, developed a plan to establish a large settlement, around the village of Kinlochkilkerran, at the south of Kintyre, composed of loyal Presbyterians from Lowland Scotland, in order to outnumber and undermine the local Catholic population, and reduce resistance to the state&#x27;s religious reforms. Under his son, Archibald, this became Campbeltown. Their actions also had the effect of diluting Gaelic culture, gradually replacing it with a Lowlands one.

Comital powers were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act, leaving only the shrieval unit. In 1899, counties were formally created, on shrieval boundaries, by a Scottish Local Government Act; Kintyre became part of the County of Argyll. Following late 20th century reforms, it is now within the wider region of Argyll and Bute.

<text>Alcoy, officially the Municipality of Alcoy (; ), is a municipality in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 19,186 people.

It is named after Alcoy in Spain.

==History==

===Spanish colonization===

The old town of Alcoy, located in the current barangay of Daanlungsod, known as &quot;Mambaje&quot;, becomes one of the &quot;visitas&quot; of Carcar in 1690. Mambaje is absorbed as a barrio of Boljoon in 1692. The church in Alcoy and three &quot;Bantayan sa Hari&quot; or watchtowers are built. The settlers choose Sta. Rosa de Lima as their patron saint.

A creation of the town of &quot;Mambaje&quot; was proposed. On July 16, 1866, Mambaje becomes a municipality. A year after, the first formal school opened in Alcoy, according to the Spanish Organic Law of 1863. In 1869, Mambaje was renamed to Alcoy. The seat of local government or the poblacion was moved from Mambaje to &quot;Hulomaynon&quot; (now Poblacion). In 1890, the town of Alcoy ranks first in production of coffee and sixth in cotton in the province of Cebu. Then in 1898, Alcoy joins the Anti-Spanish Uprising.

===American and Japanese period===

In 1899, Alcoy, and the rest of the Philippines, is occupied by the Americans. Resistance against the new colonizers in Cebu ceased in 1901. The town experienced a smallpox and cholera epidemic in 1903. Between 1904 and 1916, Alcoy is merged to the town of Dalaguete. Herminigildo Mosqueda becomes Alcoy&#x27;s first elected mayor after he wins the local elections in 1928.

During World War II, Hilario de los Santos organizes and heads the local guerilla resistance against the Japanese in Alcoy. The Civil Affairs unit is formed at Nug-as with former Mayor Herminigildo Mosqueda as president.

===Post-independence===

The Philippines became independent from the United States on July 4, 1946. On November 11, 1947, Pedro Romanos is the first elected mayor of Alcoy in the post-war era. In 1971, Catalino de los Santos is elected mayor and remained in office during the Martial Law period until the EDSA Revolution in 1986. The Dolomite Mining Corporation is established in 1980.

===Contemporary===

Eusebio Sestoso becomes the elected mayor of Alcoy after the EDSA Revolution in 1988. During the administration of Antonio Plando, the Siloy Festival is launched in 2005. Michael Angelo Sestoso wins the mayoralty election in 2016.

==Geography==
Alcoy is from Cebu City.

It is bordered to the north by the town of Dalaguete, to the west is the town of Alegria, to the east is the Cebu Strait, and to the south is the town of Boljoon.

===Barangays===
Alcoy is politically subdivided into 8 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.




====Daan-Lungsod and Guiwang====

Daan-Lungsod, formerly known as Mambaje, is the southernmost barangay of Alcoy. Tingko Beach is located partly in this small barangay and partly in Guiwang. A fiesta is held in Daan-Lungsod every 3 May in honor of Santa Cruz. There is a reef called &quot;Mabad-on&quot; which appears during low tide, and is completely submerged during high tide. Mabad-on is listed as Mambahi Reef in the Philippine maritime and navigation map.

The elementary school is located in Guiwang. Guiwang celebrates 13 June the feast day of Saint Anthony of Padua.

Two &quot;baluwarti&quot; (watchtowers) still stand in the two barangays. The watchtowers are the oldest-surviving structures in Alcoy and they are reminders of the Spanish occupation of Cebu Island. They were used to warn the locals that pirates were coming. Originally a settlement of Dalaguete, it was founded by the Spaniards in 1880 and was developed into a stop-over station for priests going to Dalaguete. In 1869, via a royal decree, &quot;Mambaje&quot; became a municipality and was renamed to Alcoy, after a city in Spain.

====Poblacion====

The Poblacion is the principal barangay of Alcoy. It is where the main facilities of the town are located: the municipal government center, police station, and main health center.

====Pugalo====

The country&#x27;s largest dolomite quarry is mined in Pugalo.

===Climate===

===Tourist attractions===

Alcoy&#x27;s Nug-as forest is the last rainforest of Cebu. It borders the town of Argao and is connected to the town&#x27;s Lantoy Mountain. It is the home of the Black Shama (Copsychus Cebuensis), a local species of song bird in the family Muscicapidae that is only found in Cebu, where it is known locally as &quot;Siloy&quot;.

The Siloy Festival is Alcoy&#x27;s nature festival and eco-tourism project. It is in honor of St. Rose of Lima. The festival takes its name from the local term of the Black Shama. The festival is a project meant to promote awareness of the Black Shama and its endangered nature and to help preserve Cebu&#x27;s endemic Shama species of birds, as well to help save Mother Earth. It is celebrated on 23 August every year.

Nug-as Sea of Clouds is also found in mountain barangay of Nug-as, Alcoy which also serve as a tourist attraction in the municipality. 


==Demographics==
==Economy==
Alcoy is mainly an agricultural town with Nugas, a mountain barangay, more than half of commercial crops. The rest of the communities rely on subsistence fishing and backyard farming. The country&#x27;s largest dolomite quarry is mined in Pugalo. Beaches are located in Guiwang and Daanlungsod.

<text>Henry Hindley (1701–1771) was an 18th-century clockmaker, watchmaker and maker of scientific instruments. He invented a screw-cutting lathe, a fusee-cutting engine and an improved wheel-cutting engine and made one of the first dividing engines, for the construction of accurately-graduated arcs on scientific instruments. He is thought to have made the world&#x27;s first equatorially-mounted telescope, which can now be seen in Burton Constable Hall in East Yorkshire.

Hindley was a Roman Catholic, born in Wigan (Lancs) in 1701. He was apprenticed and made clocks in Wigan from 1726 to 1730 and moved to York in 1731, where he was established first in Petergate and then Stonegate from 1741 until his death in 1771. John Smeaton&#x27;s cousin John Holmes was apprenticed to Hindley. He was succeeded by his son, who died in 1775.

Most of his surviving clocks are high quality long-case clocks featuring long going and the use of deadbeat escapements, six spoke wheels, high count trains and repeating, enclosed movements. A year-going clock with a bolt-and-shutter maintaining power is in the York Castle Museum, together with four eight-day clocks. A further example, a Hindley movement of around 1740 fitted into a walnut marquetry case of ca. 1690, is at the stately home of Temple Newsam near Leeds. Others exist in private collections.

He made turret clocks such as those for York Minster (much modified over the years) and the Bar Convent in York. One of his bracket clocks may also be seen in York Minster. He made watches in some numbers: examples exist in the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as the York Castle Museum.

<text>John Playford (1623–1686) was a London bookseller, publisher, minor composer and member of the Stationers&#x27; Company. He published books on music theory, instruction books for several instruments and psalters with tunes for singing in churches. He is perhaps best known today for his publication of &quot;The English Dancing Master&quot; in 1651.

==Biography==




Playford was born in Norwich, the younger son of John Playford. He served an apprenticeship in London with publisher John Benson from 1639/40 to 1647, after which he remained in the capital, opening a shop in the porch of Temple Church. Playford was clerk to the church, and probably resided with his wife Hannah over the shop until 1659. He was, it appears (from the title-pages of his publications) temporarily in partnership with John Benson in 1652, and with Zachariah Watkins in 1664 and 1665. Under the Commonwealth (1649–60), and for some years of Charles II&#x27;s reign, Playford almost monopolised the business of music publishing in England. His shop was the meeting-place of musical enthusiasts; Samuel Pepys was a frequent customer.

Bookseller, publisher, and member of the Stationers&#x27; Company, Playford published books on music theory, instruction books for several instruments, and psalters with tunes for singing in churches. He is perhaps best known today for his publication of &quot;The English Dancing Master&quot; in 1651, during the period of the Puritan-dominated Commonwealth (later editions were known as &#x27;The Dancing Master&#x27;). This work contains both the music and instructions for English country dances. This came about after Playford, working as an English Civil War correspondent, was captured by Cromwell&#x27;s men and told that, if he valued his freedom (as a sympathiser with the King), he might consider a change of career. Although many of the tunes in the book are attributed to him today, he probably did not write any of them. Most were popular melodies that had existed for years.

During the Restoration period, on the other hand, he endeavoured to encourage serious tastes. In 1662 he dedicated the &#x27;Cantica Sacra&#x27; to Queen Henrietta Maria. He regretfully observed in 1666 that &#x27;all solemn musick was much laid aside, being esteemed too heavy and dull for the light heels and brains of this nimble and wanton age,&#x27; and he therefore ventured to &#x27;new string the harp of David&#x27; by issuing fresh editions of his &#x27;Skill of Music,&#x27; with music for church service, in 1674, and, in 1677, &#x27;The Whole Book of Psalms&#x27; in which he gave for the first time the church tunes to the cantus part.

In typographical technique Playford&#x27;s most original improvement was the invention in 1658 of &#x27;the new-ty&#x27;d note.&#x27; These were quavers or semiquavers connected in pairs or series by one or two horizontal strokes at the end of their tails, the last note of the group retaining in the early examples the characteristic up-stroke. Hawkins observes that the Dutch printers were the first to follow the lead in this detail. In 1665 he caused every semibreve to be barred in the dance tunes; in 1672 he began engraving on copper plates. Generally, however, Playford clung to old methods; he recommended the use of lute tablature to ordinary violin players; and he resisted, in an earnest letter of remonstrance (1673), Thomas Salmon&#x27;s proposals for a readjustment of clefs. Playford&#x27;s printers were: Thomas Harper, 1648–1652; William Godbid, 1658–1678; Ann Godbid and her partner John Playford the younger, 1679–1683; John Playford alone, 1684-1685.

By 1665 Playford and his wife moved from the Temple to a large house opposite Islington Church, where Mrs. Playford kept a boarding-school until her death in October 1679. By November 1680, Playford had established himself in a house in Arundel Street &#x27;near the Thames side, the lower end, over against the George.&#x27; He suffered from a long illness in that year, and retired, leaving the main running of the business to his son Henry Playford (see below). He brought out, in his own name, a collection of catches in 1685; &quot;The Dancing Master&quot; of 1686 was the last work for which he was responsible.

He apparently died in Arundel Street about November 1686. His will was written on 5 November 1686, neither signed nor witnessed, and only proved in August 1694, the handwriting being identified by witnesses. He was probably buried in the Temple Church as he desired, although the registers do not record his name. Henry Purcell and John Blow attended the funeral. Several elegies upon his death were published; one written by Nahum Tate, and set to music by Purcell, appeared in 1687.

Playford&#x27;s original compositions were few and slight, and included some vocal and instrumental pieces in the following collections: &quot;Catch ... or the Musical Companion&quot;, 1667; &quot;Choice Songs&quot;, 1673; &quot;Cantica Sacra&quot;, 1674; &quot;The Whole Book of Psalms&quot; and &quot;The Harmonicon&quot;.

==Family==
===Henry Playford===
After Playford&#x27;s death, his only surviving son, &quot;Henry Playford&quot; (5 May 1657 - 1706?), carried on the business at the shop near the Temple Church. In partnership with Robert Carr, Henry published three books of &#x27;The Theatre of Musick;&#x27; the fourth book and his other publications appeared independently of Carr. In 1694, he sold his copyright in &#x27;The Dancing Master&#x27; to printer, John Heptinstall. From 1696 to 1703, Playford traded in the &quot;Temple Exchange&quot; &#x27;over against St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street.&#x27; He employed as printers, John Playford the younger, 1685; Charles Peregrine, 1687; E. Jones, 1687, 1696; John Heptinstall, 1696; and William Pearson, 1698. Around 1701 he instituted weekly clubs for the practice of music, which flourished in Oxford as well as in London.

Playford, in order to meet competition from purveyors of cheap music, established, in 1699, a music concert to be held three evenings in the week at a coffee house. Here his music was to be sold, and might be heard at the request of any prospective purchaser. He complained of the expense of good-quality paper, and of the scandalous abuse of selling single songs at a penny a piece, a practice &#x27;which hindered good collections.&#x27; In 1703 Playford invited subscriptions to the &#x27;Monthly Collections of Music&#x27; to be sent to his house in Arundel Street, The Strand, &#x27;over against the Blue Ball.&#x27; From 1703 to 1707 he also seems to have engaged in selling prints, paintings, &#x27;and other adornments.&#x27; In 1706, his warehouse was a room &#x27;up one pair of stairs next the Queen&#x27;s Head Tavern over against the Middle Temple Gate.&#x27; His name appears on the fifth edition of &#x27; The Pleasant Musical Companion,&#x27; dated 1707, but as a rule these publications were antedated; and his name does not occur again in advertisements or on title-pages. He died between 1706 and 1721, when his will was proved. He left a legacy to Henry Purcell, and the bulk of his property to his wife Ann (née Baker - daughter of Thomas Baker of Oxford), whom he had married in December 1688.

===John Playford the Younger===
The music printer and stationer John Playford the younger (1656–1686), nephew of John Playford the elder, entered in 1679 into partnership with Ann, the widow of William Godbid, in the printing-house at Little Britain, &#x27;the ancient and only printing-house in England for variety of musick and workmen that understand it.&#x27; It was also the chief printing-house for setting up mathematical works.

Playford&#x27;s firm printed the sixth edition of &quot;The Dancing Master&quot; in 1679, and other musical publications. In 1684, Mrs. Godbid&#x27;s name disappeared, and Playford continued the business alone. His last work for his uncle was the seventh edition of &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;, dated 1686; he printed only one of Henry&#x27;s publications, &quot;The Theatre of Musick&quot;, 1685. He died in that year, and was buried in Great Stanmore church. Playford left his property to his mother Eleanor, and to his two sisters, Anne (wife of William Killigrew), and Eleanor (who afterwards married William Walker). The printing-house (and dwelling house) was advertised for sale in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 6 May 1686.

<doc id="455626" wikidata="Q11171014" url="?curid=455626" title="Ratchet (device)">
<text>A ratchet (occasionally spelled rachet) is a mechanical device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion in only one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools. The word &quot;ratchet&quot; is also used informally to refer to a ratcheting socket wrench.

== Theory of operation ==
A ratchet consists of a round gear or a linear rack with teeth, and a pivoting, spring-loaded finger called a &quot;pawl&quot; (or &quot;click&quot;, in clocks and watches) that engages the teeth. The teeth are uniform but are usually asymmetrical, with each tooth having a moderate slope on one edge and a much steeper slope on the other edge.

When the teeth are moving in the unrestricted (i.e. forward) direction, the pawl easily slides up and over the gently sloped edges of the teeth, with a spring forcing it (often with an audible &#x27;click&#x27;) into the depression between the teeth as it passes the tip of each tooth. When the teeth move in the opposite (backward) direction, however, the pawl will catch against the steeply sloped edge of the first tooth it encounters, thereby locking it against the tooth and preventing any further motion in that direction.

=== Backlash ===
Because the ratchet can only stop backward motion at discrete points (i.e., at tooth boundaries), a ratchet does allow a limited amount of backward motion. This backward motion—which is limited to a maximum distance equal to the spacing between the teeth—is called backlash. In cases where backlash must be minimized, a smooth, toothless ratchet with a high friction surface such as rubber is sometimes used. The pawl bears against the surface at an angle so that any backward motion will cause the pawl to jam against the surface and thus prevent any further backward motion. Since the backward travel distance is primarily a function of the compressibility of the high friction surface, this mechanism can result in significantly reduced backlash.

== Uses ==
Ratchet mechanisms are used in a wide variety of applications, including these:
* Cable ties
* Capstans
* Caulking guns
* Clocks
* Computer keyboards
* Freewheel (overrunning clutch)
* Grease guns
* Handcuffs
* Jacks
* Anti-rollback devices used in roller coasters
* Looms
* Slacklines
* Socket wrenches
* Tie down straps
* Turnstiles
* Typewriters

<doc id="455627" wikidata="Q2386338" url="?curid=455627" title="Ryū (school)">
<text>is the Japanese term referring to a school in any discipline. The kanji itself is commonly used as a suffix.

In English, the word is frequently used to refer to schools of Japanese martial art, although it can also be found used in other disciplines (for example Nihon-koryū and Sōgetsu-ryū in ikebana, Kantei-ryū in calligraphy, etc.).

==In the martial arts==

Japanese martial arts are often classified and codified into . Usually a given style will have its own curriculum, ranks and licensure system. These may be based on the parent style or a combination of sources that form the background of the system. 

The name of a style may have particular meaning or may simply be a location. Toyama-ryū is named for the Toyama Military Academy in Japan. In contrast, Gōjū-ryū is the &#x27;hard-soft&#x27; style, which indicates both characteristic techniques and thematic elements that form a &#x27;signature&#x27; of the style. Sometimes this is merged or confused with the name of the dojo (as is the case with Shōtōkan-ryū karate). 

High-level practitioners of an established style may splinter off and form their own derivative styles based on their own experience or interpretation. Sometimes this is encouraged by the parent style, sometimes it represents an ideological schism between senior members of the style. Sometimes, it is done simply for &#x27;marketing&#x27; reasons or to adjust a system to modern times. 

There is no universal licensing or ranking system across all . A high-ranking person or black belt in one style does not necessarily correspond to a high-level understanding in another style or group of styles. There are many in Japan that have existed for many hundreds of years, as well as many more that were created in modern times. The concept of organizing a codified system is obviously not a Japanese or outwardly Asian one, though many international or foreign styles may adopt the nomenclature and systemization of koryū bujutsu in order to add an air of mystique or legitimacy to their system, or simply as a way to show respect to their roots and background.

<text>In music, function (also referred to as harmonic function) is a term used to denote the relationship of a chord or a scale degree to a tonal centre. Two main theories of tonal functions exist today:

* The German theory created by Hugo Riemann in his &quot;Vereinfachte Harmonielehre&quot; of 1893, which soon became an international success (English and Russian translations in 1896, French translation in 1899), and which is the theory of functions properly speaking. Riemann described three abstract tonal &quot;functions&quot;, tonic, dominant and subdominant, denoted by the letters T, D and S respectively, each of which could take on a more or less modified appearance in any chord of the scale. This theory, in several revised forms, remains much in use for the pedagogy of harmony and analysis in German-speaking countries and in North- and East-European countries.
* The Viennese theory, characterized by the use of Roman numerals to denote the chords of the tonal scale, as developed by Simon Sechter, Arnold Schoenberg, Heinrich Schenker and others, practiced today in Western Europe and the United States. This theory in origin was not explicitly about tonal functions. It considers the relation of the chords to their tonic in the context of harmonic progressions, often following the cycle of fifths. That this actually describes what could be termed the &quot;function&quot; of the chords becomes quite evident in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Structural Functions of Harmony&quot; of 1954, a short treatise dealing mainly with harmonic progressions in the context of a general &quot;monotonality&quot;.

Both theories find part of their inspiration in the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau, starting with his &quot;Traité d&#x27;harmonie&quot; of 1722. Even if the concept of harmonic function was not so named before 1893, it could be shown to exist, explicitly or implicitly, in many theories of harmony before that date. Early usages of the term in music (not necessarily in the sense implied here, or only vaguely so) include those by Fétis (&quot;Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l&#x27;harmonie&quot;, 1844), Durutte (&quot;Esthétique musicale&quot;, 1855), Loquin (&quot;Notions élémentaires d&#x27;harmonie moderne&quot;, 1862), etc.

The idea of function has been extended further and is sometimes used to translate Antique concepts, such as &quot;dynamis&quot; in Ancient Greece, or &quot;qualitas&quot; in medieval Latin.

==Origins of the concept==
The concept of harmonic function originates in theories about just intonation. It was realized that three perfect major triads, distant from each other by a perfect fifth, produced the seven degrees of the major scale in one of the possible forms of just intonation: for instance, the triads F–A–C, C–E–G and G–B–D (subdominant, tonic, and dominant respectively) produce the seven notes of the major scale. These three triads were soon considered the most important chords of the major tonality, with the tonic in the center, the dominant above and the subdominant under.

This symmetric construction may have been one of the reasons why the fourth degree of the scale, and the chord built on it, were named &quot;subdominant&quot;, i.e. the &quot;dominant under [the tonic]&quot;. It also is one of the origins of the dualist theories which described not only the scale in just intonation as a symmetric construction, but also the minor tonality as an inversion of the major one. Dualist theories are documented from the 16th century onwards.

==German functional theory==
The term &#x27;functional harmony&#x27; derives from Hugo Riemann and, more particularly, from his &quot;Harmony Simplified&quot;. Riemann&#x27;s direct inspiration was Moritz Hauptmann&#x27;s dialectic description of tonality. Riemann described three abstract functions: the tonic, the dominant (its upper fifth), and the subdominant (its lower fifth). He also considered the minor scale to be the inversion of the major scale, so that the dominant was the fifth above the tonic in major, but below the tonic in minor; the subdominant, similarly, was the fifth below the tonic (or the fourth above) in major, and the reverse in minor.

Despite the complexity of his theory, Riemann&#x27;s ideas had huge impact, especially where German influence was strong. A good example in this regard are the textbooks by Hermann Grabner. More recent German theorists have abandoned the most complex aspect of Riemann&#x27;s theory, the dualist conception of major and minor, and consider that the dominant is the fifth degree above the tonic, the subdominant the fourth degree, both in minor and in major.
In Diether de la Motte&#x27;s version of the theory, the three tonal functions are denoted by the letters T, D and S, for Tonic, Dominant and Subdominant respectively; the letters are uppercase for functions in major (T, D, S), lowercase for functions in minor (t, d, s). Each of these functions can in principle be fulfilled by three chords: not only the main chord corresponding to the function, but also the chords a third lower or a third higher, as indicated by additional letters. An additional letter P or p indicates that the function is fulfilled by the relative (German &quot;Parallel&quot;) of its main triad: for instance Tp for the minor relative of the major tonic (e.g., A minor for C major), tP for the major relative of the minor tonic (e.g. E major for c minor), etc. The other triad a third apart from the main one may be denoted by an additional G or g for &quot;Gegenparallelklang&quot; or &quot;Gegenklang&quot; (&quot;counterrelative&quot;), for instance tG for the major counterrelative of the minor tonic (e.g. A major for C minor). 

The relation between triads a third apart resides in the fact that they differ from each other by one note only, the two other notes being common notes. In addition, within the diatonic scale, triads a third apart necessarily are of opposite mode. In the simplified theory where the functions in major and minor are on the same degrees of the scale, the possible functions of triads on degrees I to VII of the scale could be summarized as in the table below (degrees II in minor and VII in major, diminished fifths in the diatonic scale, are considered as chords without fundamental). Chords on III and VI may exert the same function as those a third above or a third below, but one of these two is less frequent than the other, as indicated by parentheses in the table.
In each case, the mode of the chord is denoted by the final letter: for instance, Sp for II in major indicates that II is the minor relative (p) of the major subdominant (S). The major VIth degree in minor is the only one where both functions, sP (major relative of the minor subdominant) and tG (major counterparallel of the minor tonic), are equally plausible. Other signs (not discussed here) are used to denote altered chords, chords without fundamental, applied dominants, etc. Degree VII in harmonic sequence (e.g. I–IV–VII–III–VI–II–V–I) may at times be denoted by its roman numeral; in major, the sequence would then be denoted by T–S–VII–Dp–Tp–Sp–D–T.

As summarized by Vincent d&#x27;Indy (1903), who shared the conception of Riemann:

#There is only &quot;one chord&quot;, a &quot;perfect&quot; chord; it alone is consonant because it alone generates a feeling of repose and balance;
#this chord has two &quot;different forms&quot;, &quot;major and minor&quot;, depending whether the chord is composed of a minor third over a major third, or a major third over a minor;
#this chord is able to take on &quot;three different tonal functions, tonic, dominant, or subdominant&quot;.

==Viennese theory of the degrees==

The Viennese theory on the other hand, the &quot;Theory of the degrees&quot; (&quot;Stufentheorie&quot;), represented by Simon Sechter, Heinrich Schenker and Arnold Schoenberg among others, considers that each degree has its own function and refers to the tonal center through the cycle of fifths; it stresses harmonic progressions above chord quality. In music theory as it is commonly taught in the US, there are six or seven different functions, depending on whether degree VII is considered to possess an independent function.

==Comparison of the terminologies==
The table below compares the English and German terminologies for the major scale. In English, the names of the scale degrees are also the names of their function, and they remain the same in major and in minor.

Note that ii, iii, and vi are lowercase: this indicates that they are minor chords; vii° indicates that this chord is a diminished triad.

Reviewing usage of harmonic theory in American publications, William Caplin writes:

Caplin further explains that there are two main types of pre-dominant harmonies, &quot;those built above the fourth degree of the scale () in the bass voice and those derived from the dominant of the dominant (V/V)&quot; (p. 10). The first type includes IV, II6 or II6, but also other positions of these, such as IV6 or II. The second type groups harmonies which feature the raised-fourth scale degree () functioning as the leading tone of the dominant: VII7/V, V6V, or the three varieties of augmented sixth chords.

<text>Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester (1121 – 1190), called Blanchemains, was an English nobleman, one of the principal followers of Henry the Young King in the Revolt of 1173–1174 against his father King Henry II.

==Life==
Robert was the son of Amicia de Gael and Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, a staunch supporter of Henry II, and he inherited from his father large estates in England and Normandy.

When the younger Henry revolted in April 1173, Robert went to his castle at Breteuil in Normandy. The rebels&#x27; aim was to take control of the duchy, but Henry II himself led an army to besiege the castle; Robert fled, and the Breteuil was taken on 25 or 26 September.

Robert went to Flanders, where he raised a large force of mercenaries, and landed at Walton, Suffolk, on 29 September 1173. He joined forces with Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, and the two marched west, aiming to cut England in two across the Midlands and to relieve the king&#x27;s siege of Robert&#x27;s castle at Leicester. However, they were intercepted by the king&#x27;s supporters and defeated at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham, near Bury St Edmunds, on 17 October. Robert, along with his wife and many others, were taken prisoner. Henry II took away the earl&#x27;s lands and titles as well.

Robert remained in captivity until January 1177, well after most of the other prisoners had been released. The king was in a strong position and could afford to be merciful; not long after his release Robert&#x27;s lands and titles were restored, but not his castles. All but two of his castles had been destroyed (slighted), and those two (Montsorrel in Leicestershire and Pacy in Normandy) remained in the king&#x27;s hands.

Robert had little influence in the remaining years of Henry II&#x27;s reign, but was restored to favour by King Richard I of England. He carried one of the swords of state at Richard&#x27;s coronation in 1189. In 1190 Robert went on the Third Crusade to the Holy Land but he died at Dyrrachium in Albania on his return journey.

==Family==
Robert married Petronilla, who was a daughter of William de Grandmesnil and great-granddaughter and eventual heiress to the English lands of Domesday baron, Hugh de Grandmesnil. They had:
* Robert, who succeeded his father as Earl of Leicester;
* Roger, who became Bishop of St Andrews in 1189;
* William, possibly the ancestor of the House of Hamilton;
* Amice, who married Simon de Montfort, and whose son Simon subsequently became Earl of Leicester;
* Margaret, who married Saer de Quincy, later 1st Earl of Winchester

<text>Unkle (often stylised as U.N.K.L.E. or UNKLE, occasionally known as UNKLE Sounds) is a British musical outfit founded in 1992 by James Lavelle. Originally categorised as trip hop, the group once included producer DJ Shadow and have employed a variety of guest artists and producers.

==History==
===First incarnation (1992–1996)===
The first release credited to the &#x27;Men from U.N.K.L.E&#x27; was a remix for United Future Organization, included on their 1992 &quot;Loud Minority&quot; single. Lavelle and Goldsworthy were joined by Masayuki Kudo and Toshio Nakanishi of the Japanese hip hop crew Major Force (later Major Force West).

===Second incarnation (1997–1999)===
Lavelle drafted in DJ Shadow to work on the debut album, and essentially discarded all previously recorded material. Lavelle and Shadow released &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot; in 1998 to a mixed critical response. The album included collaborations with an all-star lineup including Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Mark Hollis (Talk Talk), Mike D (Beastie Boys), Kool G Rap, Jason Newsted (Metallica), Badly Drawn Boy and Richard Ashcroft (The Verve). The album was mixed by Shadow&#x27;s long-time collaborator, producer Jim Abbiss.

Shadow left the group after touring &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot; and was replaced by turntablist group the Scratch Perverts, who deconstructed the album and performed it live on turntables in 1999. Also in 1999, former producer Rich File remixed the track &quot;Unreal&quot;, adding vocals by Ian Brown, and the resulting track was released as the single Be There.

On 1 February 1999, Lavelle and the Scratch Perverts appeared on the Radio 1 program The Breezeblock, utilising &quot;5 turntables&quot;. The set was largely based on tracks from &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot;, with some of them reworked live by Lavelle for the live performance. The Scratch Perverts&#x27; contribution consisted of scratching over the top of the Unkle tracks, a deconstructed version of &quot;Be There&quot;, and some solo interludes.

===Third incarnation (2000–2007)===
In 2001, Lavelle and File resurfaced as Unklesounds, with a DJ mix created for Japanese radio entitled &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?&quot; This highlighted a new, more electronic direction the group had taken, and featured a number of tracks from &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot;, remixed in a techy breakbeat style.

Rich File co-produced, played and sang on the second album, &quot;Never, Never, Land&quot;, released in 2003. The album again featured a number of high-profile contributors, including Ian Brown, Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age), Robert Del Naja (Massive Attack) and Mani (The Stone Roses, Primal Scream) among others.

Lavelle and File continued releasing mixes as Unklesounds. The mix album &quot;Edit Music for a Film: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Reconstruction&quot;, featuring movie samples and tracks from film soundtracks, was created for the After Dark 2004 event at the ICA London. A single CD version was handed out at the event, and it was released officially as an extended two disc set in 2005. The group recorded music for a short film titled &quot;The Seed&quot; directed by Joe Hahn alongside John Debney and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park.

In September 2006, Global Underground released &quot;Self Defence: Never, Never, Land Reconstructed and Bonus Beats&quot;, a 4-CD box set of remixes and bonus tracks from the &quot;Never, Never, Land&quot; sessions, including tracks previously only available on the original DVD release of the album. It also contained remixes of a track mooted for their next album, featuring Ian Astbury of The Cult, titled &quot;Burn My Shadow&quot;.

&quot;War Stories&quot;, the third album from Unkle, was released in summer 2007. The album again featured a number of guests including Josh Homme, Gavin Clark, Robert Del Naja, Ian Astbury, The Duke Spirit, Autolux and Neil Davidge. Following the release of the single &quot;Hold My Hand&quot;, Pablo Clements (of The Psychonauts) became an Unkle member.

===Fourth incarnation (2008–present)===
In January 2008 Unkle released &quot;More Stories&quot;, containing a mix of B-sides, remixes, unreleased &quot;War Stories&quot; session tracks, and music composed for the film &quot;Odyssey in Rome&quot;. The same month, Rich File announced he was leaving Unkle after 10 years&#x27; collaboration to pursue work with his new band, We Fell to Earth. 
In March the Lazarides Gallery in London showcased &quot;War Paint&quot;, an exhibition of artworks inspired by the recent Unkle album &quot;War Stories&quot;, with works from Robert Del Naja, Warren du Preez, Nick Thornton Jones, Will Bankhead and Ben Drury.
Unkle began touring the UK with Zoot Woman and Sebastian and Mr. Flash from the French electro record label Ed Banger Records. The concert, set across four acts, featured live performances from past Unkle contributors including Badly Drawn Boy, Liela Moss from The Duke Spirit, Gavin Clark and Joel Cadbury from South.

Unkle&#x27;s fourth full album titled &quot;End Titles... Stories for Film&quot; was released in July 2008. It includes collaborations with Chris Goss, Black Mountain, Philip Sheppard, Dave Bateman, Joel Cadbury, and James Griffith (Lake Trout). The album is described in the sleeve notes by Lavelle as &quot;not a new album in the usual sense, but new music that has been inspired by the moving image.&quot; As such, it can be considered a companion piece both to War Stories but also to the earlier Unklesounds mix, &quot;Edit Music for a Film&quot;.

14 December 2008 saw the digital release of &quot;End Titles... Redux&quot;, an album that was released the following day in a limited pressing of 3000 CDs available from official Unkle stores. This release features seven re-interpreted tracks from the album &quot;End Titles... Stories for Film&quot; plus 2 never-before-released tracks, &quot;When Once It Was&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Storm&quot;. The exclusive package is a 6-panel soft-pack with a 12-page booklet with images by Robert Del Naja.

Upon the release of the single &quot;Heavy Drug (Surrender Sounds Mix)&quot; in August 2009, Unkle disclosed they had already begun recording their next studio album, &quot;Where Did the Night Fall&quot;, which was released in May 2010. This also included an all-star cast of performers including: Mark Lanegan, Nick Cave, The Black Angels, Sleepy Sun, and Katrina Ford, as well as ELLE J and Gavin Clark. The album is also available as a digital download from Unkle&#x27;s site.

It was announced on 18 April 2011 that Unkle would headline the Dance Stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. They would be performing a world-exclusive audio-visual DJ set at the festivals, playing songs from their back catalogue alongside remixes of other artists&#x27; songs as well as Unkle&#x27;s own material. They would be performing under the name Unkle Sounds.

On 27 February 2014, the &quot;God of Light (Original Game Soundtrack)&quot; single was published on iTunes, with two songs from the &quot;God of Light&quot; game by Playmous and EON. The in-game credits list &quot;Music composed by: UNKLE / James Lavelle / Charlie May.&quot;

On 15 July 2016 Unkle released the single &quot;Cowboys or Indians&quot;, which featured artists Ysée, Mink, and Elliott Power. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reported Unkle would release an album that same year. In January 2017, Unkle announced the pending release of the album &quot;The Road: Part I&quot;, which will be preceded by the single &quot;Sick Lullaby&quot; to be released in mid February 2017. It coincides with an exhibition at the Lazarides gallery in London.

Unkle collaborated with Michael Kiwanuka for the track &quot;On My Knees&quot; for a companion album to the 2018 Netflix film &quot;Roma&quot; and a new mix of this track later appeared on the 2021 album &quot;Rōnin I&quot;.

<text>Union Station is a major railway station and intermodal transportation hub in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is located in downtown Toronto, on Front Street West, on the south side of the block bounded by Bay Street and York Street. The municipal government of Toronto owns the station building while the provincial transit agency Metrolinx owns the train shed and trackage. It is operated by the Toronto Terminals Railway, a joint venture of the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, which directs and controls train movement along the Union Station Rail Corridor, the largest and busiest rail corridor in Canada. Constructed in 1927, Union Station has been a National Historic Site of Canada since 1975, and a Heritage Railway Station since 1989. 

Its central position in Canada&#x27;s busiest inter-city rail service area, &quot;The Corridor&quot;, as well as being the central hub of GO Transit&#x27;s commuter rail service, makes Union Station Canada&#x27;s busiest transportation facility and the second-busiest railway station in North America (behind New York Penn Station), serving over 72million passengers each year. More than half of all Canadian inter-city passengers and 91 percent of Toronto commuter train passengers travel through Union Station.

Via Rail and Amtrak provide inter-city train services while GO Transit operates regional rail services. The station is also connected to the subway and streetcar system of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) at its adjacent namesake subway station. GO Transit&#x27;s Union Station Bus Terminal, located in CIBC Square, is connected to Union Station by a enclosed walkway above Bay Street. The Union Pearson Express, which provides train service to Toronto Pearson International Airport, has a platform a short walk west of the main station building, accessible by the SkyWalk.

==Site location==

Toronto&#x27;s Union Station is located at 61 Front Street West, between Bay and York Streets in Toronto&#x27;s business district, with Toronto&#x27;s Entertainment District beginning across Bay Street. It is roughly at the city&#x27;s east-west centre. It is also close to Lake Ontario, which marks Toronto&#x27;s southern boundary. The southernmost part of the Gardiner Expressway, which lies between Union Station and Lake Ontario, provides easy core access to GO Transit buses. Union Station&#x27;s columned façade and main entrance faces north, towards downtown Toronto. The Fairmont Royal York Hotel, a former railway hotel, is directly across Front Street from Union Station and can be accessed from the station both at street level and via an underground passageway called Path. The Dominion Public Building, another building from the same era, is just to the east of the station, at the corner of Front and Bay Streets.

Other major buildings near Union Station are Telus Tower, Royal Bank Plaza, and Brookfield Place. Brookfield Place is home to the Allen Lambert Galleria, a six story high pedestrian thoroughfare, as well as the Hockey Hall of Fame, which holds the Stanley Cup.

Scotiabank Arena, Rogers Centre, Metro Toronto Convention Centre, and the CN Tower are all close by, and are visible from some parts of the station. Like Union Station, these structures were built on former Railway Lands. All of them can be accessed directly from Union Station via the Skywalk. The land around the CN Tower has been converted to a public park. Union Station will soon be linked via a Path bridge on the east side to the Backstage Condominium building at the corner of Esplanade and Yonge Street.

==Structure==
Toronto&#x27;s Union Station is Canada&#x27;s largest and most opulent railway station. The Montreal architecture firm of Ross and Macdonald designed the building in the Beaux-Arts style as a joint venture between the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, with help from CPR architect Hugh Jones and Toronto architect John M. Lyle. In 1975, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada cited its design as being of &quot;national architectural significance as one of the finest examples of Beaux-Arts railway station design in Canada&quot;.

The bilaterally symmetrical building comprises three connecting box masses facing Front Street West, with the main structure in the middle. Together, the three parts measure long and occupy the entire south side of the block between Bay Street in the east and York Street in the west.

The exterior Front Street façade is laid out in an ashlar pattern, constructed with smooth beige Indiana and Queenston limestone. The colonnaded loggia which faces Front Street features 22 equally spaced Roman Tuscan columns made from Bedford limestone, each high and weighing 75 tons. Fourteen three-storey bays, each with severely delineated fenestration, form the façade on either side of the central colonnade for a total of 28 bays. The structures at either end have an additional ten bays. Three rectangular windows fill each bay, lighting the interior hall with plenty of natural light. However, the building&#x27;s external profile is hard and flat, with a line of huge columns, heavy ornamentation and strong symmetry.

The recessed main entrance is framed by two sets of four columns, with relief wreaths carved into the entablature above the columns. These columns are composed of three separate segments on top of an incongruous octagonal plinth, implying an Ionic order or Corinthian order; however, the capital is sculpted in a Doric order. Consequently, these columns appear to be unfinished. The original plan for the columns is not known.

A wraparound dentil cornice and a recessed peaked hipped roof creates the illusion of a flat roof, just like a palazzo. On either side of the main entrance, a blind arch with an ornamental keystone contains a set of three steel-framed doors, along with a large arched window. Decorative friezes separate the arched window from the doors. When these entryway elements are combined, they create a processional experience through the entryway into the grand interior space. The flat-roof illusion, together with the axial symmetry, classical detailing in both structural and decorative elements, heavy ornamentation, and formal setting is typical of the Beaux-Arts style.

The station housed a gun range on the seventh floor from 1927 until 2008. The range was operated for &quot;Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway police to practice their shooting skills. It eventually opened to members of the public&quot;. It was known as the Canadian National Recreation Association (CNRA) handgun club. The city closed the range in 2008 as a symbolic gesture to its effort to reduce gun violence.

===Great Hall and Via Concourse===
The front entranceway opens on to the expansive Ticket Lobby, informally known as the &quot;Great Hall&quot;. This part of Union Station runs the entire length of the main section. It is long and high at its highest point. Like the outside facade, enduring materials such as bronze, limestone, marble, tiles, and translucent glass create a sense of enduring quality.

The entire space is lit with diffused natural light from clerestory windows refracted throughout the lobby. Each end of the Great Hall also features four-storey tall arched windows, based on those of Roman baths.

The two-storey-high vaulted ceiling, which is what makes it look from the front as though a second building were rising behind the colonnade, is made of coffered Guastavino tiles. The walls are faced with Zumbro stone from Missouri, and the floors are constructed of Tennessee marble laid in a herringbone pattern. Below the cornice surrounding the &quot;Great Hall&quot; are carved the names of many Canadian destinations, from the east coast to Vancouver, accessible by the Grand Trunk Railway or Canadian Pacific Railway at the time of the station&#x27;s construction. Many remain destinations on Via Rail routes.

While historically shared by many different services, the Great Hall is now occupied primarily by Via Rail, whose agents also provide services to Amtrak passengers. The hall is home to Via&#x27;s ticket and baggage desks, business class lounge, and several small displays, as well as the station&#x27;s grand clock, a Traveller&#x27;s Aid desk, and Via&#x27;s departure board.

===GO concourses and teamways===
Passengers can connect with GO Transit services through the York Concourse, which opened on April 27, 2015, west of Union Station. This new concourse supplemented the York South Concourse that provided access to platforms 24 to 27. The York and York South Concourses connect to the York East Teamway, as well as an entrance to a Path tunnel leading across Front Street, between York Street and University Avenue. The York West Teamway is connected to Union Station via the Skywalk.

Historically, the Bay Street Concourse was the hub of GO Transit operations for almost 40 years. The Bay Concourse was closed on August 16, 2015, for revitalization, and reopened on July 27, 2021. The concourse features 72 departure screens, 30 Presto devices, seven ticket vending machines and six self-service Presto reload machines. Both the Bay and York concourses give access to GO train platforms.

The Bay West Teamway provides access to platforms 4 to 13 and the Bay South Concourse. The Bay East Teamway provides indoor access to platforms 4 to 13 directly from the Union Station Bus Terminal.

, Metrolinx is constructing the new South Concourse. This will connect the south ends of the Bay, Via and York Concourses, and span between Bay and York Streets. It will also provide access to Union Square and Scotiabank Arena.

===Train shed===

Trains arrive and depart from the train shed, which contains 23 platforms (11 island platforms and one side platform) south of the Great Hall. On May 11, 2009, the last two platforms were opened, platforms 24/25 between tracks 12 and 13 and platforms 26/27 between tracks 13 and 14 on the south side of the train shed. Metrolinx was having platforms 24 to 27 and their three tracks demolished on the south side of the station in order to replace them with two new tracks and two new wider platforms to increase safety and capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/07/06&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The train shed was designed by A.R. Ketterson and built between 1929 and 1930. It is a variation of the Bush train shed invented by Lincoln Bush. A reconstruction of the train shed began in January 2010. The east and west sides of the shed, totalling approximately were renovated and restored with input from Parks Canada to help preserve its heritage character. This renovation came with plans to have a green roof installed, reducing the urban heat island effect and stormwater runoff; however, with the project being almost eight years behind and multiple times over budget, along with the fact that plant-watering logistics would clash with the planned overhead wiring for electrification, the addition of a green roof was cancelled. The central portion of the original train shed, totalling , was removed and replaced with a glass atrium. The structure floats above the tracks and allows daylight to reach the platforms.

Platform 3 is the northernmost platform at Union Station and is the only platform at the station serving just one track. It reopened for service on January 10, 2022, after a renovation of its heritage features. Allowing a lower, lighter shed roof in the age of steam, the smoke vents over tracks 1 and 2 are a preserved heritage feature of the platform 3 area; these were restored. The decorative, cast-iron columns along the platform were restored and reinstalled. Other structural renovations were done along the length of the platform. Once the north tower of the CIBC Square is completed, stair and elevator access will be reinstated between platform 3 and the Bay East Teamway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrolinx-2022/01/10&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The 23 platforms are numbered from 3 to 27, but there is no platform 1, 2, 23 or 24. The platforms were renumbered in 2008 for the benefit of operational staff in order to provide a correlation between platform numbers and track numbers. (Prior to the renumbering, the platform numbers had an A or B suffix that proved to be confusing for both customers and operational staff.) Tracks and platforms are each numbered from north to south with track 1 being beside platform 3 on the north side of the train shed. There is an island platform between all pairs of tracks except between tracks 1 and 2 and tracks 11 and 12. Odd numbered platforms are on the north side of a track while even numbered platforms are on the south side of a track. There is a formula to compute the platform number given the track number, with an exception for track 1:
* The number for the platform on the south side of a track equals two times the track number.
* The number for the platform on the north side of a track equals two times the track number minus one, except for track 1 where the platform number is set to 3 rather than 1.

Occasionally, freight trains from both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific networks pass through Union Station using two tracks on the south side of the train shed.

===West wing and SkyWalk===
Union Station&#x27;s west wing is west of the Great Hall. Metrolinx is headquartered in the west wing at 97 Front Street. Across from these offices is an official tourism information centre that provides maps, visitor guides, brochures and tourism specialists to provide help to city visitors.

A pathway known as the SkyWalk continues west from the west wing, overtop of York Street. The SkyWalk is considered part of the Path network, and connects Union to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre. It is also the location of the Union Pearson Express station.

==History==
===Predecessor stations===
The current Union Station&#x27;s history can be traced to 1858, when the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) opened Toronto&#x27;s first Union Station west of the present Union Station. The wooden structure was shared with the Northern Railway and the Great Western Railway. This structure was replaced by a second Union Station on the same site, opening in 1873. The Canadian Pacific Railway began using the facility in 1884 and it was completely rebuilt, opening in 1896.

The Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed the block south of Front Street West, immediately east of the second Union Station (bounded by Bay and York streets), but did not damage the station. The GTR acquired this land east of the second Union Station for a new passenger terminal and in 1905 both the GTR and the CPR decided to proceed with the design and construction of a third union station.

The decision to undertake the third union station was made against a backdrop of significant change in the Canadian railway industry. At the same time, the Government of Canada was encouraging the GTR to build a second transcontinental railway (what would become the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the National Transcontinental Railway) and the Canadian Northern Railway was undertaking an aggressive expansion across the prairies and into southern Ontario.

===Construction===

On July 13, 1906, the Toronto Terminals Railway (TTR) was incorporated to &quot;construct, provide, maintain and operate at the City of Toronto a union passenger station&quot;. The TTR was jointly owned by the GTR and the CPR who each held 50% of the TTR shares. The TTR supervised construction of the new station which began in 1914 and proceeded to 1920, having faced significant delays in the shortage of construction material and workers as a result of the First World War, as well as the GTR&#x27;s deteriorating financial position due to its ill-fated transcontinental GTPR railway project.

The resulting construction saw the elimination of Lorne Street located between Simcoe and Bay from Front to Esplanade with tracks leading west of the new station now in place.

Although the new station&#x27;s headhouse and east and west office wings (the station building visible from Front Street West) were completed in 1920, it did not open to the public for another seven years, until the system of approach tracks was designed and implemented by the TTR and its owners. During this time in 1923, the bankrupt GTR was fully nationalized by the Government of Canada and merged into the Canadian National Railways (CNR), which would assume the GTR&#x27;s 50% ownership of the TTR and thus the third Union Station.

===Opening and further construction===
Although the station was incomplete, its building was complete and the station was opened by Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, on August 6, 1927, in a ribbon-cutting ceremony, using a pair of gold scissors. In attendance were Prince George, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario William Donald Ross and his wife, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stanley Baldwin and Mrs. Baldwin, Premier of Ontario George Howard Ferguson, and other members of the government of Ontario and government of Canada. Prince Edward was the first person to step off of a train into Union Station; a mixed choir composed of soloists from the city&#x27;s churches sang the royal anthem, &quot;God Save the King&quot;, as the royal party walked through the concourse. Once he was in the Great Hall, the Prince of Wales quipped, &quot;you build your train stations like we build our cathedrals&quot;. He was then escorted to a nearby Canadian National Railway wicket and was presented with the first ticket issued at the station: one &quot;valid for all time&quot; and &quot;between all stations&quot;. He proceeded to the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s wicket, where he was given a first-class fare from Toronto to High River, Alberta, where his ranch was located. Prince George was given similar tickets.

Four days later, the track network was shifted from the second Union Station. To get to trains, passengers would walk from the south doors to the tracks located several hundred feet to the south while the new viaduct, concourse and train shed were under construction. Demolition of the second Union Station began almost immediately and was completed in 1928. The third Union Station project was not fully completed until 1930 when the train shed was completed; its construction was supervised by the TTR from 1925 to 1930.

The TTR also constructed a central heating plant at the corner of York and Fleet streets (now Lake Shore Boulevard West) to replace the original Toronto Hydro plant on Scott Street which had been expropriated by the TTR to build the approach track viaduct to the new station. It was fuelled by coal delivered by a CNR siding and was the largest such facility in Canada when it opened in 1929; it produced of steam per hour and annually to heat the station; the passenger cars in the train shed; CNR and CPR yard facilities in the area now occupied by the Gardiner Expressway, Rogers Centre and Scotiabank Arena; the CPR&#x27;s Royal York Hotel; the Dominion Public Building; the federal post office building adjacent to the station; and the CN/CP Telecommunications building on Front Street.

===Subway connection===

The first major change to Union Station took place in 1954 when the Toronto Transit Commission opened its Union subway station adjacent to Union Station but buried beneath Front Street West. This subway station acted as the southern terminus of its new subway line. The subway station included a direct tunnel connection to the lower level passenger concourse. This passageway was closed and replaced by the direct connection between the railway station and the subway station in 1979 when the subway station mezzanine was renovated and enlarged. In 1990, the TTC&#x27;s Harbourfront LRT project added an underground streetcar loop now used by the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar lines. TTC passengers using the Union subway and streetcar station may transfer between both modes without entering Union Station proper.

===Metro Centre redevelopment proposal===

During the early 1970s, Canada&#x27;s two major passenger railways, the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National, were reducing their services to the bare minimum mandated under the Canadian Transport Commission, largely as a result of unsustainable losses caused by increased competition from new, subsidized four-lane highways and airports.

The third Union Station&#x27;s future was looking bleak by 1972, when both railways sought to increase return on their underutilized waterfront rail classification yards which was being viewed as valuable real estate. Both CN and CP began to abandon their extensive waterfront rail classification yards south of the passenger station to make way for urban redevelopment. The Gardiner Expressway project was constructed over part of the railway property and CN had proposed constructing a telecommunication tower (what would become the CN Tower later that decade).

CN and CPR proposed a &quot;Metro Centre&quot; development on the south side of Front Street on the site of Union Station and proposed to demolish the structure (which was costing an increasing amount of property taxes but not bringing in revenue). The proposed Metro Centre development was strikingly similar to what occurred with New York City&#x27;s Penn Station and would have consisted of an underground fourth Union Station (the terminal trackage would have been buried), a convention centre, a telecommunications tower, along with complementary office and retail developments. Local opposition to the proposal was successful in having the city council&#x27;s decision to support the Metro Centre development overturned and Union Station was saved.

Although it was converted from coal to natural gas, the Central Heating Plant built in 1929 was decommissioned in the 1980s, and demolished in 1990. It is now site of The Ice condo towers.

In 1978, CN and CP transferred responsibility for their passenger rail services to Via Rail, a new federal Crown corporation; however, CN and CP retained their 50% ownership shares of the TTR.

===Growth and waterfront development===

The GO Transit commuter rail agency which was established on May 23, 1967, had been undergoing unprecedented expansion which was seeing Union Station see passenger levels that outstripped some of the busiest airports in the world. The consolidated TTR trackage included a flyover west of the station to permit freight trains to cross CN&#x27;s Oakville subdivision without blocking GO Transit&#x27;s commuter trains. The flyover was constructed in 1982–83 and also allowed GO trains destined for the CN Weston subdivision to cross over the tracks used by GO and Via trains using the CN Oakville subdivision. 

The CN Tower had revamped the vision of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront rail yards and proposals were made to construct what would later become SkyDome (1989) and Air Canada Centre (1999), resulting in further changes to the Union Station trackage. The Path pedestrian tunnel network was built to connect Union Station&#x27;s passengers with many of the downtown office towers and the SkyWalk was constructed over the terminal trackage west of the station to connect the Path with the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Rogers Centre.

===21st century revitalization===

In 2000, the City of Toronto purchased the station building from the TTR, while GO Transit purchased the railway corridor and the Union Station train shed. On July 24, 2003, the City of Toronto agreed to lease Union Station to Union Pearson AirLink Group, a subsidiary of SNC-Lavalin, for a term of 100 years.

A subsequent announcement on May 24, 2006, addressed several issues for commuters including: constructing a direct connection from the GO Concourse to the Path pedestrian tunnel system, a new eastbound platform for the Union TTC station, improved access to streetcars at Union TTC station, and improved capacity for inter-city railway passengers. These developments were part of a $100million initiative announced by the city and its transit authorities, along with the Government of Ontario and Government of Canada. On August 5, 2009, the Toronto City Council approved an update of this plan which was projected to cost $640million, with construction lasting from 2010 to 2014. Much of the work was undertaken by or managed by Carillion.


The work also involved a complete overhaul of the GO concourses, deepening them to create two storeys of space. The lower level (the food court section of which opened in January 2019) will provide retail space and room for pedestrian traffic flow, and the upper storey will be dedicated to passenger traffic onto the platforms. This will expand not only the current GO concourse in the east of the building, but also open up the western end; GO Transit&#x27;s presence in the building will nearly quadruple. Additional aesthetic points include glass roofs over the moat space around the north sides of the building, and a tall atrium over the central portions of the platforms. A new southern entrance, adjacent to the Air Canada Centre, opened in 2010.

The 2009 Ontario and Canada government budgets included financing to assist GO, Via and the city in redeveloping and restoring the station. Track has been upgraded with better signals and snow cleaning devices to reduce winter delays to train movement.

In 2016, it was realized that the renovated train shed roof was too low to allow electrification. The train shed roof is considered a heritage feature and cannot be removed. Remedies considered were raising the roof, or lowering the track level.

By early 2018, the cost had increased from $640million to an estimated $823.5million. Work that was to have been completed in 2015 was projected to be finished late 2018 and in late 2018 revised to 2019. In 2019 it was announced that the city&#x27;s portion of construction would be complete in 2019, but then Metrolinx would have to start its work, with a projected 2020 completion date.

In February 2019, charges were laid by Toronto Fire Services against contactor Bondfield Construction and the city for an over-crowding issue where doors had been blocked. In March 2019 it was reported that Vaughan-based contractor Bondfield Construction had applied for bankruptcy protection under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA).

===Heritage recognition===
Union Station became designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1975, and a Heritage Railway Station in 1989. In 1999, Union Station was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame as being significant in the course of railway history. The station is recognized as part of the Union Station Heritage Conservation District (Designated Part V) under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; enacted by Toronto City Council on July 27, 2006.

==Passenger services==

Union Station is the busiest public transportation structure of any kind in Canada, including air travel. It handles 65million passengers annually, with an average of 200,000 passengers each day. Approximately two-thirds of those passengers are GO train or GO bus commuters, while another 20million take the subway. The remainder are intercity travelers between other cities in Canada and the United States.

===National===

Toronto is Canada&#x27;s primary passenger train hub. Consequently, Union Station is by far Via Rail&#x27;s busiest and most-used station. Each year, 2.4million Via Rail passengers pass through Union Station, representing more than half of all Via Rail passengers carried systemwide. This heavy usage is partly due to Union Station&#x27;s position at the centre of Canada&#x27;s busiest inter-city rail service area, the &quot;Corridor&quot;, which stretches from Quebec City in the east to Windsor in the west.

Westbound Via Rail trains from Toronto connect directly to most major cities in Southwestern Ontario, including Kitchener, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. Additionally, westbound trains from Montreal pass through Toronto en route to Burlington. Northbound and eastbound Via Rail trains from Toronto primarily serve the heavily travelled Ottawa–Montreal-Toronto triangle. At Montreal, passengers can connect to trains heading to the Maritimes or north to the Laurentians.

Union Station is also the eastern terminus of &quot;The Canadian,&quot; Via Rail&#x27;s transcontinental service westbound to Vancouver via Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Edmonton.

===International===
In partnership with Via Rail, Amtrak runs the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; train from Toronto to New York City. The train uses an Amtrak consist but is operated by Via crews north of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Other major U.S. destinations along the route include Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.

Amtrak and Via Rail formerly operated the &quot;International Limited&quot; from Toronto to Chicago via the Sarnia–Port Huron border crossing, until it was cancelled in 2004. Both VIA Rail and Amtrak maintain service along the route on their respective sides of the border, but the trains do not cross the border.

===Provincial and suburban===
Union Station is the central terminal for GO Transit, which handled approximately 69.5million passengers in 2015.

*Barrie line to North York, Vaughan, King City, Aurora, Newmarket, East Gwillimbury, Bradford, and Barrie
*Kitchener line to York, Etobicoke, Mississauga, Brampton, Georgetown, Acton, Guelph and Kitchener
*Lakeshore East line to Scarborough, Pickering, Ajax, Whitby and Oshawa
*Lakeshore West line to Etobicoke, Mississauga, Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, St. Catharines and Niagara Falls
*Milton line to Etobicoke, Mississauga and Milton
*Richmond Hill line to North York and Richmond Hill
*Stouffville line to Scarborough, Markham and Stouffville

GO Transit&#x27;s Union Station Bus Terminal is located at CIBC Square, 81 Bay Street, on the south side of the terminal. The terminal currently serves GO Transit regional buses as well as Coach Canada, TOK Coachlines, and Ontario Northland long-distance bus services.

===Connecting services===
Union Station is connected to the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s Union Subway Station, which is part of Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway system. Two Toronto streetcar routes, 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina, can also be accessed underground without leaving Union Station. The streetcar platform was built in 1989 and is separate from the subway station platforms built in 1954. Altogether, twenty million TTC passengers pass through Union Station each year. The TTC station was renovated and expanded in 2015, with an additional platform to increase capacity.

Toronto Transit Commission bus routes 19 Bay, 72 Pape, 97 Yonge, 121 Esplanade–River, and night route 320 Yonge, use curbside stops on the streets outside.

===Airport link===

On June 6, 2015, the Union Pearson Express (UPX), a dedicated airport rail link service, started running between Union Station and Toronto Pearson International Airport, stopping only at Bloor and Weston GO stations. The opening of the line allowed Metrolinx to achieve its goal, announced in 2010, of operating an airport rail link from Union Station in time for the 2015 Pan American Games.

Trains on this line do not stop at the regular platforms used by GO and Via trains, but use a separate station located west of the main station building along the length of the main atrium of the SkyWalk between York Street and Lower Simcoe Street. The UP Express Union Station is a 5-minute walk from Union subway station.

Trains depart from the station&#x27;s single side platform every 15 minutes. Passengers access trains directly from an enclosed waiting area, and a glass wall with sliding doors separate trains from the platform and open to allow passengers to board directly from the waiting area without exposure to the elements. The floor of the waiting area is level with the train floor, which allows for step-free boarding.

The UP Express Union Station has a dedicated customer service counter, ticket vending machines and flight check-in kiosks. These kiosks permit check-ins for Air Canada and WestJet. Three stands in the waiting area offer Balzac&#x27;s coffee, souvenirs and Mill Street Brewery draft beer.

===Former operations===
====Ontario Northland====

*&quot;Northlander&quot; to Gravenhurst, Huntsville, North Bay, Cobalt and Cochrane
The &quot;Northlander&quot; provided a passenger train service between Union Station and Northeastern Ontario from 1976 until 2012. In March 2012, the Government of Ontario announced plans to discontinue this service, and the final day of operations was September 28, 2012.

====Amtrak====
*&quot;International&quot; to Port Huron, Flint, Battle Creek, Niles, and Chicago
The &quot;International&quot; (known until 1983 as the &quot;International Limited&quot;) provided a passenger train service between Union Station and Chicago Union Station from 1982 until 2004, when the cross-border service was discontinued and replaced by Via Rail&#x27;s Toronto-Sarnia service, and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Blue Water&quot; route from Port Huron to Chicago. The final day of operations was April 23, 2004.

<text>The Messerschmitt Me 264 was a long-range strategic bomber developed during World War II for the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as its main strategic bomber. The design was later selected as Messerschmitt&#x27;s competitor in the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;″s (the German Air Ministry) &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; (America Bomber) programme, for a strategic bomber capable of attacking New York City from bases in France or the Azores.

Three prototypes were built but production was abandoned to allow Messerschmitt to concentrate on fighter production and the Junkers Ju 390 was selected in its place. Development continued as a maritime reconnaissance aircraft instead.

==Development==
The origin of the Me 264 design came from Messerschmitt&#x27;s long-range reconnaissance aircraft project, the P.1061, of the late 1930s. A variant on the P.1061 was the P.1062 of which three prototypes were built, with only two &quot;engines&quot; to the P.1061&#x27;s four, but they were the more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 606 &quot;power systems&quot;, each comprising a pair of DB 601 inverted V-12 engines. These were also used in the long-range Messerschmitt Me 261, itself originating as the Messerschmitt P.1064 design of 1937. The DB 606&#x27;s later use in the Heinkel He 177A&#x27;s airframe design resulted in derision by &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring as &quot;welded-together engines&quot; in August 1942, due to badly designed engine installations. In early 1941, six P.1061 prototypes were ordered from Messerschmitt, under the designation Me 264. This was later reduced to three prototypes.

The progress of these projects was slow but after Germany had declared war on the United States four days after the Pearl Harbor attack by Imperial Japan, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) started the more serious &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; programme in the spring of 1942 for a very long range bomber, with the result that a larger, six-engine aircraft with a greater bomb load was called for. Proposals were put forward for the Junkers Ju 390, the Focke-Wulf Ta 400, a redesign of the Heinkel He 277 design (itself only receiving its RLM airframe number by February 1943 to give Heinkel an entry in the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; program later in 1943), and a design study for an extended-wingspan six-engine Messerschmitt Me 264B. The need for six engines was prompted by the inability of Germany&#x27;s aero-engine designers to create reliable powerplants of and greater, thwarting efforts to do the same with four engines instead. As the similarly six-engined Junkers Ju 390 could use components already in use for the Ju 290 this design was chosen. The Me 264 was not abandoned as the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy) separately demanded a long-range maritime patrol and attack aircraft to replace the converted Fw 200 &quot;Condor&quot; in this role. This was reinforced by an opinion given by then-&quot;Generalmajor&quot; Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz of the &quot;Heer&quot; (German Army) in May 1942, who had been recruited by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erhard Milch to give his opinion on the suitability of the Me 264 for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; mission; Gablenz echoed the &quot;Kriegsmarine&#x27;s&quot; later opinion. The two pending prototypes were ordered to be completed as development prototypes for the Me 264A ultra long-range reconnaissance aircraft.

==Design==
The Me 264 was an all-metal, high-wing, four-engine heavy bomber of classic construction. The fuselage was round in cross-section and had a cabin in a glazed nose, comprising a &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; with no separate windscreen section for the pilots, which was common for most later German bomber designs. A strikingly similar design was used for the B-29, of slightly earlier origin. The wing had a slightly swept leading edge and a straight trailing edge. The empennage had double tail fins. The undercarriage was a retractable tricycle gear with large-diameter wheels on the wing-mounted main gear.

The planned armament consisted of guns in remotely operated turrets and in positions on the sides of the fuselage. It carried very little armour and few guns as a means of increasing fuel capacity and range. The Me 264&#x27;s first prototype was originally fitted with four Junkers Jumo 211 inverted V12 engines using the new &quot;Kraftei&quot; (or &quot;power-egg&quot;) engine installation as standardized for the earlier Ju 88A &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;, but inadequate power from the Jumo 211 engines led to their replacement on the Me 264 V1 first prototype with four BMW 801G engines. To provide comfort on the proposed long-range missions, the Me 264 featured bunk beds and a small galley complete with hot plates.

==Operational history==
The first prototype, Me 264 V1, bearing a &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; (factory code) of RE+EN, was flown on 23 December 1942. It was powered at first by four Jumo 211J inline engines of each. In late 1943, these were changed to the BMW 801G radials which delivered . Trials showed numerous minor faults and handling was found to be difficult. One of the drawbacks was the very high wing loading of the Me 264 in fully loaded conditions at some . (Comparable contemporary aircraft had lower wing loadings: the B-29 had , the redesigned He 277 and the Ju 390 a much lower .) The relatively high wing loading caused poor climb performance, loss of manoeuvrability, stability and high take-off and landing speeds. In addition, the first prototype was not fitted with weapons or armour, the weight of which would have caused worse performance.

The second prototype, Me 264 V2, was completed with armour around the engines, crew and gun positions, but defensive weapons and other vital operational equipment were never fitted. The never-completed Me 264 V3 was to have been fully armed and armoured.

In 1943, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; withdrew their interest in the Me 264, in favour of the Ju 290 and the planned Ju 390. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; indicated a preference for the unbuilt Ta 400 and the Heinkel He 277 as &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; candidates in May 1943, based on their performance estimates. In October 1943, Milch officially cancelled development work on the Me 264, so that Messerschmitt could concentrate on other projects, including development and production of the Me 262 jet fighter-bomber. No further payments for development work on the Me 264 were made to Messerschmitt AG.

Late in 1943, the second prototype, Me 264 V2, was destroyed in a bombing attack. On 18 July 1944, the first prototype, which had entered service with &quot;Transportstaffel&quot; 5, was damaged during an Allied bombing raid and was not repaired. The third prototype, which was unfinished, was destroyed during the same raid.

In April 1944, the competing Junkers project was cancelled. Consequently, on 23 September 1944, work on the Me 264 project was officially cancelled. Messerschmitt proposed a six-engine version, known as the Me 264/6m or Me 364, which also remained unbuilt.

<doc id="455643" wikidata="Q7163723" url="?curid=455643" title="Pennsylvania Dutch English">
<text>Pennsylvania Dutch English is a dialect of English that has been influenced by the Pennsylvania Dutch language. It is largely spoken in South Central Pennsylvania, both by people who are monolingual in English and bilingual in Pennsylvania Dutch and English. The dialect has been dying out, as non-Amish younger Pennsylvania Germans tend to speak General American English. 

Very few non-Amish members of these people can speak the Pennsylvania German language, although most know some words and phrases. The World War II generation of the mid-20th century was the last generation in which Pennsylvania Dutch was widely spoken outside the Amish and Old Order Mennonite communities.

==Features of Pennsylvania German influence==

Pennsylvania Dutch English differs from standard English in various ways. Some of its hallmark features include:

* Widespread devoicing of obstruents, such as “round” being pronounced “rount” or “eggs” as “ecks”.
* The use of certain vowel variants in specific phonological contexts.
* The use of Pennsylvania German verb and noun stems in word construction.
* Specific intonation patterns for questions.
* Special placement of prepositional phrases in sentences (so that &quot;Throw some hay over the fence for the horse&quot; might be rendered &quot;Throw the horse over the fence some hay&quot;).
* The use of &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;not&quot; or &quot;say&quot; as question tags.
* The use of &quot;still&quot; as a habitual verbal marker.
* The use of the phrase &quot;what for&quot; to mean &quot;what kind of&quot;, as in &quot;What for drink do you have?&quot; (German = &quot;was für&quot;)
* Use of the word &quot;yet&quot; to mean &quot;still,&quot; such as &quot;do you work at the store yet?&quot; to mean &quot;do you still work at the store?&quot;
* Use of terms such as &quot;doncha know&quot; and &quot;so I do&quot; or &quot;so he does&quot; at the end of declaratory sentences.
* Use of the word &quot;awhile&quot; at the end of sentences proposing simultaneous actions (e.g. &quot;Go get the tea out of the pantry; I&#x27;ll start boiling the water awhile.&quot;).
* Omitting &quot;to be&quot; from the passive construction in an infinitive following &quot;needs&quot; or &quot;wants&quot; (e.g. &quot;the car needs cleaned&quot; instead of &quot;the car needs to be cleaned&quot;).

Other calques include:
Other idioms include &quot;Make wet?&quot; meaning &quot;Is it going to rain?&quot;, &quot;hurrieder&quot; meaning &quot;faster&quot;, and &quot;dippy eggs/ecks&quot; meaning &quot;over-easy or soft-boiled eggs&quot;.

<doc id="455645" wikidata="Q834090" url="?curid=455645" title="Ruyi Jingu Bang">
<text>Ruyi Jingu Bang (), or simply Ruyi Bang or Jingu Bang, is the poetic name of a magical staff wielded by the immortal monkey Sun Wukong in the 16th-century classic Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

Anthony Yu translated the name simply as &quot;The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod,&quot; while W.J.F. Jenner translates it as the &quot;As-You-Will Gold-Banded Cudgel.&quot;

==Origin and general description==

The staff first appears in the third chapter when the Monkey King goes to the underwater kingdom of Ao Guang (), the Dragon King of the East Sea, looking for a magic weapon to match his strength and skill. When all of the traditional magic weapons—swords, spears, and halberds weighing thousands of pounds each—fail to meet his standards, the dragon queen suggests to her husband that they give Sun a useless iron pillar taking up space in their treasury. She claims that the ancient shaft had started producing heavenly light days prior and suggests that the monkey is fated to own it. The novel never explains how the pillar was made, only that it was originally used by Yu the Great to measure the depths of the world flood during times immemorial.

The staff is initially described as a pillar of black iron twenty feet in height and the width of a barrel. It is only when Monkey lifts it and suggests that a smaller size would be more manageable that the staff complies with his wishes and shrinks. After this, it is only a little taller than him, and as thick as a rice bowl. This is when Sun sees that the weapon is banded with a gold ring on each end, as well as the inscription along the body reading &quot;The Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod. Weight: thirteen thousand five hundred catties&quot; (如意金箍棒重一萬三千五百斤). The inscription indicates that the staff follows the commands of its owner, shrinking or growing to his whim, make copies of itself, and that it is immensely heavy, weighing 17,550 lbs (7,960 kg).

When not in use, Monkey shrinks it down to the size of a needle and keeps it tucked inside his ear.

==Literary predecessor==

The oldest edition of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the 13th-century Kōzanji Version (高山寺) published during the late Song dynasty, diverges in many points from the final version published during the Ming. For instance, the episode where Monkey acquires the staff is completely different, as is the staff itself. Sun takes the monk Tang Sanzang to heaven to meet the supreme god Mahabrahma Deva. After the monk impresses the gods with his lecture on the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, Monkey is given a golden monk&#x27;s staff (among other items) as a magical weapon against the evils they will face on their journey to India. Sun later uses the staff in a battle with a white-clad woman who transforms into a tiger demon. He changes the staff into a titanic red-haired, blue-skinned Yaksha with a club, showing that the predecessor of the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod has more magical abilities.

A weapon that predates the Compliant Rod from the Ming version is mentioned in passing early on in the tale. Monkey mentions that the Queen Mother of the West had flogged him with an &quot;Iron Cudgel&quot; (鐵棒) on his left and right sides for stealing 10 peaches from her heavenly garden. He later borrows the cudgel to use in tandem with the monk&#x27;s staff to battle 9 dragons. The rings on the latter may have influenced the bands on the former.

==In popular culture==
* The staff influenced the weapon used by Son Goku (himself based on Sun Wukong), the main character of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise. It is named &quot;Nyoi Bo,&quot; the Japanese transliteration of &quot;Ruyi Bang&quot; (), and is commonly called &quot;Power Pole&quot; in English-language media. Like its original counterpart, the Nyoi Bo can grow to tall lengths, which Goku uses to his advantage for mobility and combat. However, he cannot duplicate it. The staff is given to him as a child by his adoptive grandfather, Son Gohan, a human who takes him in and teaches him martial arts.
* In &quot;Naruto&quot;, the &quot;Ruyi Jingu Bang&quot; was also the inspiration for the specialized transformation (Henge) of Monkey-King Enma, the personal summons of the 3rd (Sandaime) Hokage, Lord Hiruzen Sarutobi, into the &quot;Kongō Nyoi&quot; (Adament Nyoi). 
* In the Korean webtoon and anime &quot;The God of High School&quot;, the protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, who is Sun Wukong, wields Ruyi Jingu Bang.
* In the video game &quot;Warframe&quot;, one of the playable characters (warframes) is named Wukong and summons an extremely powerful staff as his ultimate ability. During usage, the staff varies in length and thickness. Wukong can also duplicate himself and use cloud form to travel faster (in reference to &quot;jindou yun&quot;, 筋斗雲).
* The sculpture &quot;Millennium Tree&quot; (2005) by Chinese-New Zealand artist Guy Ngan located in the Auckland Domain in New Zealand was inspired by Ruyi Jingu Bang.
* Taobao has a dispute resolution mechanism through which sellers can remove a limited number of malicious reviews per day which is named after the staff.

<doc id="455646" wikidata="Q11253" url="?curid=455646" title="Lower Manhattan">
<text>Lower Manhattan, also known as Downtown Manhattan or Downtown New York City, is the southernmost part of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The neighborhood is the historical birthplace of New York City and for its first 225 years was the entirety of the city. Lower Manhattan serves as the seat of government of both Manhattan and the entire City of New York. Because there are no municipally defined boundaries for the neighborhood, a precise population cannot be quoted, but several sources have suggested that it was one of the fastest-growing locations in New York City between 2010 and 2020, related to the influx of young adults and significant development of new housing units.

Despite various definitions of Lower Manhattan, they generally include all of Manhattan Island south of 14th Street, with the Bowling Green and the Battery near the southern end. Anchored by Wall Street and the Financial District in Lower Manhattan, New York City is the leading global center for finance and fintech. The Financial District houses Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and other major financial institutions. A center of culture and tourism, Lower Manhattan is home to many of New York City&#x27;s most iconic structures, including New York City Hall, the Woolworth Building, the Stonewall Inn, the Bull of Wall Street, and One World Trade Center, the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere.

==Geography and neighborhoods==
Lower Manhattan is delineated on the north by 14th Street, on the west by the Hudson River, on the east by the East River, and on the south by New York Harbor. Its northern border is designated by thoroughfares about a mile-and-a-half south of 14th Street and a mile north of Manhattan&#x27;s southern tip around Chambers Street near the Hudson River east of the entrances and overpass to the Brooklyn Bridge. Two other major arteries to Lower Manhattan are Canal Street, roughly half a mile north of Chambers Street, and 23rd Street, roughly half a mile north of 14th Street.

Lower Manhattan&#x27;s central business district forms the core of the area below Chambers Street and includes the Financial District, commonly known as Wall Street after the name of its primary artery, and the World Trade Center site. At the island&#x27;s southern tip is Battery Park, near the Bowling Green; City Hall is north of the Financial District. South of Chambers Street are Battery Park City and South Street Seaport. TriBeCa straddles Chambers Street on the west side; at the street&#x27;s east end is the giant Manhattan Municipal Building. North of Chambers Street and the Brooklyn Bridge and south of Canal Street is the Chinatown neighborhood, home to the largest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere. Many court buildings and other government offices are located in this area.

The Lower East Side neighborhood straddles Canal Street. North of Canal Street and south of 14th Street are SoHo, the Meatpacking District, the West Village, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, Nolita, and the East Village. Between 14th and 23rd Streets are lower Chelsea, Union Square, the Flatiron District, Gramercy, and Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village.

==History==
===Lenape and New Netherland===

The area that would eventually encompass modern-day New York City was inhabited by the Lenape people. These groups of culturally and linguistically identical Native Americans who spoke an Algonquian language now referred to as &quot;Unami&quot;.

European settlement began with the founding of a Dutch fur trading post in Lower Manhattan, later called New Amsterdam () in 1626. The first fort was built at The Battery to protect New Netherland.

In approximately 1626, construction of Fort Amsterdam began. The Dutch West Indies Company subsequently imported African slaves to serve as laborers; they helped to build the wall that defended the town against English and native attacks. Early directors included Willem Verhulst and Peter Minuit. Willem Kieft became a director in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft&#x27;s War against the Native Americans. The Pavonia Massacre, across the Hudson River in present-day Jersey City, New Jersey resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643. Following the massacre, Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch. The Dutch Republic sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft, leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29, 1645.

On May 27, 1647, Peter Stuyvesant was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival. The colony was granted self-government in 1652, and New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2, 1653. The first mayors (&quot;burgemeesters&quot;) of New Amsterdam, Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier, were appointed in that year.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In 1664, the English conquered the area and renamed it &quot;New York&quot; after the Duke of York and the city of York in Yorkshire.

At that time, people of African descent made up 20% of the population of the city, with European settlers numbering approximately 1,500, and people of African descent numbering 375 (with 300 of that 375 enslaved and 75 free). While it has been claimed that African slaves comprised 40% of the small population of the city at that time, this claim has not been substantiated. During the mid-1600s, farms of free blacks covered where Washington Square Park later developed.

The Dutch briefly regained the city in 1673, renaming the city &quot;New Orange&quot;, before permanently ceding the colony of New Netherland to the English for what is now Suriname in November 1674.

The new English rulers of the formerly Dutch New Amsterdam and New Netherland renamed the settlement back to New York. As the colony grew and prospered, sentiment also grew for greater autonomy. In the context of the Glorious Revolution in England, Jacob Leisler led Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689 to 1691, before being arrested and executed.

By 1700, the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200. By 1703, 42% of households in New York had slaves, a higher percentage than in Philadelphia or Boston.

The 1735 libel trial of John Peter Zenger in the city was a seminal influence on freedom of the press in North America. It would be a standard for the basic articles of freedom in the United States Declaration of Independence.

By the 1740s, with expansion of settlers, 20% of the population of New York were slaves, totaling about 2,500 people. After a series of fires in 1741, the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in a conspiracy with some poor whites. Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear, but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites, all of whom were convicted of arson and executed. City officials executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks.

In 1754, Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King&#x27;s College in Lower Manhattan.

The Stamp Act and other British measures fomented dissent, particularly among the Sons of Liberty, who maintained a long-running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over Liberty Poles from 1766 to 1776. The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies. After the major defeat of the Continental Army in the Battle of Long Island, General George Washington withdrew to Manhattan Island, but with the subsequent defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington the island was effectively left to the British. The city became a haven for loyalist refugees, becoming a British stronghold for the entire war. Consequently, the area also became the focal point for Washington&#x27;s espionage and intelligence-gathering throughout the war.

In 1771, Bear Market was established along the Hudson River shoreline on land donated by Trinity Church, and replaced by Washington Market in 1813.

New York City was greatly damaged twice by fires of suspicious origin during British military rule. The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war and a haven for Loyalist refugees. Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage. In addition, the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay, across the East River in Brooklyn. More Americans died from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war. British occupation lasted until November 25, 1783. George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day, as the last British forces left the city.

Starting in 1785, the Congress met in New York City under the Articles of Confederation. In 1789, New York City became the first national capital of the United States under the new United States Constitution. The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States, and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street. The first United States Supreme Court sat there. The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there. George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall. New York City remained the capital of the U.S. until 1790, when the role was transferred to Philadelphia.

===19th century===

New York grew as an economic center, first as a result of Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and, later, with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the North American interior. Immigration resumed after being slowed by wars in Europe, and a new street grid system, the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, expanded to encompass all of Manhattan. Early in the 19th century, the landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street.

In 1898, the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn (until then an independent city), Manhattan and outlying areas. The borough of Brooklyn incorporated the independent City of Brooklyn, recently joined to Manhattan by the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan. Municipal governments contained within the boroughs were abolished, and the county governmental functions, housed in Lower Manhattan after unification, were absorbed by the city or each borough.

===20th century===

Washington Market was located between Barclay and Hubert Streets, and from Greenwich Street to West Street. It was demolished in the 1960s and replaced by a new Independence Plaza, Washington Market Park, and other developments.

====Construction boom====
Lower Manhattan retains the most irregular street grid plans in the borough. Throughout the early decades of the 1900s, the area experienced a construction boom, with major towers such as 40 Wall Street, the American International Building, Woolworth Building, and 20 Exchange Place being erected. Many new water crossings into Lower Manhattan were built at this time, including the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903 and the Manhattan Bridge in 1909. The Holland Tunnel to New Jersey opened in 1927, while the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel to Brooklyn opened in 1950 and was the last major fixed crossing to be built to Lower Manhattan.

Despite these road connections opening, the economic center of New York City began to shift from Lower Manhattan to Midtown with the opening of many commuter rail terminals at the turn of the 20th century. The original Penn Station opened in 1910, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (now PATH) extension to 33rd Street was completed in 1910, and Grand Central Terminal opened in 1913.

On March 25, 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village took the lives of 146 garment workers, which would eventually lead to great advancements in the city&#x27;s fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, New York became a world center for industry, commerce, and communication. Interborough Rapid Transit, the first New York City Subway company, began operating in 1904. The area&#x27;s demographics stabilized, labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class, the city&#x27;s government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under Fiorello La Guardia, and his controversial parks commissioner, Robert Moses, ended the &#x27;blight&#x27; of many tenement areas, by demolishing slums, factories, and working-class neighborhoods through public works such as the High line, the West Side Highway and FDR Drive, built housing projects, expanded new parks, rebuilt streets, and zoning controls, especially in Lower Manhattan. The zoning changes were intended to displace the industrial workforce by removing zoning protection for industrial space and incentivizing upscale residential and clerical redevelopment. The port of New York, despite its physical suitability for berthing and its close proximity to Europe, began to deteriorate due to the city&#x27;s unwillingness to invest or modernise the port and the deindustrialization zoning policy. However a large number of small scale, dynamic, and highly specialized industries persisted despite the city&#x27;s efforts such as the garment industry which was closely tied to the fashion industry in Midtown, or the printing industry; linked with the publishing industry.

In the 1950s, a few new buildings were constructed in Lower Manhattan, including an 11-story building at 156 William Street in 1955. A 27-story office building at 20 Broad Street, a 12-story building at 80 Pine Street, a 26-story building at 123 William Street, and a few others were built in 1957. By the end of the decade, Lower Manhattan had become economically depressed, in comparison with Midtown Manhattan, which was booming with the continued march uptown. David Rockefeller spearheaded widespread urban renewal efforts in Lower Manhattan, beginning with constructing One Chase Manhattan Plaza, the new headquarters for his bank. He established the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association (DLMA) which drew up plans for broader revitalization of Lower Manhattan, with the development of a world trade center at the heart of these plans. The original DLMA plans called for the &quot;world trade center&quot; to be built along the East River, between Old Slip and Fulton Street. After negotiations with New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, the Port Authority decided to build the World Trade Center on a site along the Hudson River and the West Side Highway, rather than the East River site.

When building the World Trade Center, 1.2 million cubic yards (917,000 m3) of material was excavated from the site. Rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills, the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street, creating Battery Park City. The result was a 700-foot (210-m) extension into the river, running six blocks or , covering , providing a riverfront esplanade and over of parks.

Through much of its history, the area south of Chambers Street was mainly a commercial district, with a small population of residents—in 1960, it was home to about 4,000. Construction of Battery Park City, on landfill from construction of the World Trade Center, brought many new residents to the area. Gateway Plaza, the first Battery Park City development, was finished in 1983. The project&#x27;s centerpiece, the World Financial Center, consists of four luxury highrise towers. By the turn of the century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street. Around this time, Lower Manhattan reached its highest population of business tenants and full-time residents. These developments struggled to become fully occupied at desirable rents, with relatively high vacancy rates.

In 1993, the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association contributed to a city plan calling for the revitalization of Lower Manhattan. The plan included recommended zoning changes, tax incentives to encourage new tenants, and the conversion of commercial buildings into apartments. It also called for the creation of a business improvement district, called The Alliance for Downtown New York, to help spur the area&#x27;s renewal. Between 1995 and 2014, 15.8 million square feet of office space was converted to residential or hotel use. As a result, Lower Manhattan&#x27;s residential population rose from 14,000 to 60,000.

===21st century===

In the early 21st century, the Meatpacking District, once the sparsely populated province of after-hours BDSM clubs and transgender prostitutes, gained a reputation as New York City&#x27;s trendiest neighborhood.

====September 11 attacks====
During the September 11 attacks in 2001, two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center, and the towers collapsed. The 7 World Trade Center was not struck by a plane but uncontrolled fires that were caused by falling debris resulted in the building&#x27;s collapse; a first in the history of steel framed skyscrapers. The 3, 4, 5, and 6 World Trade Center buildings were damaged beyond repair or destroyed, and soon after demolished. The collapse of the Twin Towers also caused extensive damage to surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan. A total of 2,753 people, including those on the planes, were killed in New York. About 400,000 people, including rescue workers and residents of the area were exposed to toxic dust and debris; many developed serious respiratory illnesses, cancers, and other harms arising from the attack, and 3,496 died.

====Post-9/11 rebuilding====
Following September 11, Lower Manhattan lost much of its economy and office space but has since rebounded significantly. Private sector employment reached 233,000 at the end of 2016, the highest levels since the end of 2001. This was largely due to growth and diversification in the local workforce with gains in employment sectors like Technology, Advertising, Media and Information, as well as Hotel, Restaurants, Retailing, and Health care. As of 2016, Lower Manhattan&#x27;s business district is home to approximately 700 retail stores and 500 bars and restaurants.

The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has consummated plans to rebuild downtown Manhattan by adding new streets, buildings, and office space. The National September 11 Memorial at the site was opened to the public on September 11, 2011, while the National September 11 Museum was officially inaugurated by President Barack Obama on May 15, 2014. As of the time of its opening in November 2014, the new One World Trade Center, formerly known as the &quot;Freedom Tower&quot;, is the tallest skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere and the sixth-tallest in the world, at ; while other skyscrapers are under construction at the site.

The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park, formerly known as Liberty Plaza Park, began in the Financial District on September 17, 2011, receiving global attention and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide.

On October 29 and 30, 2012, Hurricane Sandy ravaged portions of Lower Manhattan with record-high storm surge from New York Harbor, severe flooding, and high winds, causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of Manhattanites and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems. The storm and its effects have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of Manhattan and the New York City metropolitan region to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future.

Lower Manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom, well above the overall birth rate in Manhattan, with the area south of Canal Street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010, 12% greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001. The Financial District alone has witnessed growth in its population to approximately 43,000 as of 2014, nearly double the 23,000 recorded at the 2000 Census.

There are currently 61,000 residents in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan south of Chambers Street and more than 62 percent of the population is between 18 and 44. Lower Manhattan is home to more young professionals than Greenpoint, the East Village, and Downtown Brooklyn and on par with Downtown Jersey City and Williamsburg.

In June 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Lower Manhattan&#x27;s dining scene was experiencing a renaissance. There are over 400 casual dining and more than 100 full-service dining restaurants in the area. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, based at 80 Maiden Lane in the Financial District and historically the largest alternative newspaper in the United States, announced in 2017 that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture.

Since 2010, a Lower Manhattan community known as Little Australia has emerged and is growing in the Nolita neighborhood.

===Historical sites===
Before the September 11 attacks, the Twin Towers were iconic of Lower Manhattan&#x27;s global significance as a financial center. The new office towers built since the attack (including One World Trade Center) have transformed the skyline of Lower Manhattan. The 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the former World Trade Center site has become a popular draw for visitors. New York City has been described as the gay capital of the world, and the epicenter of LGBT culture and its catalyst as a continuing cultural force in modern society has been the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Similarly, Chinatown, which was spawned just east of the original Five Points neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, was born in the 1850s and continues to be the epicenter of culture for the Chinese diaspora.

Lower Manhattan contains many more historical buildings and sites, including Castle Clinton, Bowling Green, the old United States Customs House (now the National Museum of the American Indian), Federal Hall National Memorial commemorating the site where George Washington was inaugurated as the first U.S. President, Fraunces Tavern, New York City Hall, the Museum of American Finance, the New York Stock Exchange Building, South Street Seaport, the Brooklyn Bridge, South Ferry (the embarkation point for the Staten Island Ferry), and Trinity Church. Lower Manhattan is home to some of New York City&#x27;s most spectacular skyscrapers, including the Woolworth Building, 40 Wall Street (also known as the Trump Building), 26 Wall Street (also known as the Standard Oil Building), and 70 Pine Street (also known as the American International Building).

In 1966, the commercial district of Radio Row on Cortlandt Street was demolished to make way for construction of the former World Trade Center.

==Culture==

Since the early-20th century, Lower Manhattan has been an important center for the arts and leisure activities. Greenwich Village was a locus of bohemian culture from the first decade of the century through the 1980s. Several of the city&#x27;s leading jazz clubs are still located in Greenwich Village, which was also one of the primary bases of the American folk music revival of the 1960s. Many art galleries were located in SoHo between the 1970s and early 1990s; today, the downtown Manhattan gallery scene is centered in Chelsea. From the 1960s onward, Lower Manhattan has been home to many alternative theater companies, constituting the heart of the Off-Off-Broadway community.

Punk rock and its musical derivatives emerged in the mid-1970s largely at two Lower Manhattan venues, CBGB on Bowery in the western edge of the East Village, and Max&#x27;s Kansas City on Park Avenue South. At the same time, the area&#x27;s surfeit of appropriated industrial lofts, played an integral role in the development and sustenance of the minimalist composition, free jazz, disco, and electronic dance music subcultures. The area&#x27;s many nightclubs and bars, though mostly shorn of the freewheeling iconoclasm, pioneering spirit, and do-it-yourself mentality that characterized the pre-gentrification era, still draw patrons from throughout the city and the surrounding region.

===Denotation of &quot;Downtown&quot;===
&quot;Downtown&quot; in the context of Manhattan, and of New York City generally, has different meanings to different people, especially depending on where in the city they reside. Residents of the island or of The Bronx generally speak of &quot;going&quot; &quot;downtown&quot; to refer to any southbound excursion to any Manhattan destination. A declaration that one is going to &quot;be&quot; &quot;downtown&quot; may indicate a plan to be anywhere south of 14th Street—the definition of downtown according to the city&#x27;s official tourism marketing organization—or even 23rd Street. The full phrase &quot;Downtown Manhattan&quot; may also refer more specifically to the area of Manhattan south of Canal Street. Within business-related contexts, many people use the term &quot;Downtown Manhattan&quot; to refer only to the Financial District and the corporate offices in the immediate vicinity. For instance, the Business Improvement District managed by the Alliance for Downtown New York defines Downtown as south of Murray Street (essentially South of New York City Hall), which includes the World Trade Center area and the Financial District. The phrase &quot;Lower Manhattan&quot; may apply to any of these definitions: the broader ones often if the speaker is discussing the area in relation to the rest of the city; more restrictive ones, again, if the focus is on business matters or on the colonial and early post-colonial history of the island.

As reflected in popular culture, &quot;Downtown&quot; in Manhattan has historically represented a place where one could &quot;forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, and go Downtown,&quot; as the lyrics of Petula Clark&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;Downtown&quot; celebrate (although Tony Hatch, the songwriter of the track, later clarified that he naively believed Times Square to be &quot;downtown&quot;, and was the actual inspiration for the hit single). The protagonist of Billy Joel&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; contrasts himself (a &quot;downtown man&quot;) with the purportedly staid uptown world. Likewise, the chorus of Neil Young&#x27;s 1995 single &quot;Downtown&quot; urges &quot;Let&#x27;s have a party, downtown all right.&quot;

==Economy==
Lower Manhattan is the third-largest business district in the United States, after Midtown Manhattan and the Chicago Loop. Anchored by Wall Street, New York City functions as the financial and fintech capital of the world and has been called the world&#x27;s most economically powerful city. Lower Manhattan is home to the New York Stock Exchange, at 11 Wall Street, and the corporate headquarters of NASDAQ, at 165 Broadway, representing the world&#x27;s largest and second largest stock exchanges, respectively, when measured both by overall average daily trading volume and by total market capitalization of their listed companies in 2013. Wall Street investment banking fees in 2012 totaled approximately US$40 billion.

Other large companies with headquarters in Lower Manhattan include (in alphabetical order):
* AIG, 175 Water Street
* Ambac Financial Group
* AOL, at 770 Broadway
* BARKER, 30 Broad Street
* Condé Nast, One World Trade Center, publisher of &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and other publications
* EmblemHealth and Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, at 55 Water Street HIP Health Plan of New York, which became a part of EmblemHealth, moved there with 2,000 employees in October 2004. It was the largest corporate relocation in downtown Manhattan following the September 11 attacks.
* Goldman Sachs, at 200 West Street
* Group M, 3 World Trade Center
* Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Brookfield Place, the parent company of Saks, Lord and Taylor and Gilt Groupe

* Verizon Communications, at 140 West Street

Prior to the September 11 attacks, One World Trade Center served as the headquarters of Cantor Fitzgerald. Prior to its dissolution, the headquarters of US Helicopter were in Lower Manhattan. When Hi Tech Expressions existed, its headquarters were in Lower Manhattan.

==Government and infrastructure==
===Subway===
The headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is located in 4 World Trade Center of the World Trade Center complex.

The city hall and related government infrastructure of the City of New York are located in Lower Manhattan, next to City Hall Park. The Jacob K. Javits Federal Building is located in Civic Center. It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation New York field office.

Many New York City Subway routes converge downtown. The largest hub, Fulton Center, was completed in 2014 after a $1.4 billion reconstruction project necessitated by the September 11, 2001, attacks, and involves six separate stations. This transit hub was expected to serve 300,000 daily riders as of late 2014. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub and PATH station opened in 2016. Ferry services are also concentrated downtown, including the Staten Island Ferry at the Whitehall Terminal, NYC Ferry at Pier 11/Wall Street (and Battery Park City Ferry Terminal starting in 2020), and service to Governors Island at the Battery Maritime Building.
===Vehicles===
Lower Manhattan is accessible by vehicle through several major thoroughfares. From New Jersey, Lower Manhattan is accessible through the Holland Tunnel from Interstate 78. From Queens, Long Island, and points east, it is accessible through the Queens–Midtown Tunnel from the Long Island Expressway. From Midtown and Upper Manhattan, it is accessible from the West Side Highway.

===Bus===
Many MTA express buses stop in lower Manhattan, the , and to Staten Island, the , and to Brooklyn, the , and to Queens, and the to The Bronx.

<text>Anas is a genus of dabbling ducks. It includes the pintails, most teals, and the mallard and its close relatives. It formerly included additional species but following the publication of a molecular phylogenetic study in 2009 the genus was split into four separate genera. The genus now contains 31 living species. The name &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin for &quot;duck&quot;.

==Systematics==
The genus &quot;Anas&quot; was introduced by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck. The genus formerly included additional species. In 2009 a large molecular phylogenetic study was published that compared mitochondrial DNA sequences from ducks, geese and swans in the family Anatidae. The results confirmed some of the conclusions of earlier smaller studies and indicated that the genus as then defined was non-monophyletic. Based on the results of this study, &quot;Anas&quot; was split into four proposed monophyletic genera with five species including the wigeons transferred to the resurrected genus &quot;Mareca&quot;, ten species including the shovelers and some teals transferred to the resurrected genus &quot;Spatula&quot; and the Baikal teal placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Sibirionetta&quot;.

===Species===
There are 31 extant species recognised in the genus:
Extinct Species
*Mariana mallard, &quot;Anas oustaleti&quot;
*Mascarene teal, &quot;Anas theodori&quot;
*Chatham Island Duck, &quot;Anas chathamica&quot;

Formerly placed in &quot;Anas&quot;:
*Bronze-winged duck, &quot;Speculanas specularis&quot;
*Crested duck, &quot;Lophonetta specularioides&quot;
*Baikal teal &quot;Sibirionetta formosa&quot;
*Salvadori&#x27;s teal, &quot;Salvadorina waigiuensis&quot;
*species in the genus &quot;Mareca&quot;, the wigeons (including the gadwall and the falcated duck)
*species in the genus &quot;Spatula&quot;, the shovelers and related teals

===Phylogeny===
Cladogram based on the analysis of Gonzalez and colleagues published in 2009.

===Fossil record===

A number of fossil species of &quot;Anas&quot; have been described. Their relationships are often undetermined:
* †&quot;Anas&quot; sp. (Late Miocene of China)
* †&quot;Anas&quot; sp. (mid-sized species from the Late Miocene of Rudabánya, Hungary)

Several prehistoric waterfowl supposedly part of the &quot;Anas&quot; assemblage are nowadays not placed in this genus anymore, at least not with certainty:
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; basaltica&quot; (Late Oligocene of &quot;Warnsdorf&quot;, Czech Republic) is apparently an indeterminate heron.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; blanchardi&quot;, &quot;&quot;A.&quot; consobrina&quot;, &quot;&quot;A.&quot; natator&quot; are now in &quot;Mionetta&quot;
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; creccoides&quot; (Early-mid Oligocene of Belgium), &quot;&quot;A.&quot; risgoviensis&quot; (Late Miocene of Bavaria, Germany) and &quot;&quot;A.&quot; skalicensis&quot; (Early Miocene of &quot;Skalitz&quot;, Czech Republic), though possibly anseriform, cannot be placed with any certainty among modern birds at all.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; albae&quot; (Late Miocene of Polgárdi, Hungary), &quot;&quot;A.&quot; eppelsheimensis&quot; (Early Pliocene of Eppelsheim, Germany), &quot;&quot;A.&quot; isarensis&quot; (Late Miocene of Aumeister, Germany) and &quot;&quot;A.&quot; luederitzensis&quot; (Kalahari Early Miocene of Lüderitzbucht, Namibia) are apparently Anatidae of unclear affiliations; the first might be a seaduck.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; integra&quot; and &quot;&quot;A.&quot; oligocaena&quot; are now in &quot;Dendrochen&quot;.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; lignitifila&quot; from the Late Miocene of Tuscana has been moved to its own genus, &quot;Bambolinetta&quot;, being a highly unusual marine waterfowl.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; robusta&quot; is now tentatively placed in &quot;Anserobranta&quot;.
* †&quot;&quot;Anas&quot; velox&quot; (Middle – Late? Miocene of C Europe) and &quot;&quot;A.&quot; meyerii&quot; (Middle Miocene of Öhningen, Germany; possibly the same species) do not seem to belong &quot;Anas&quot;, and they may be ancestral dabbling ducks.

Highly problematic, albeit in a theoretical sense, is the placement of the moa-nalos. These may be descended from a common ancestor of dabbling ducks such as the Pacific black duck, Laysan duck, and mallard. Phylogenetically, they may even form a clade within the traditional genus &quot;Anas&quot;. However, when compared to these species – which are representative of dabbling ducks in general – the moa-nalos are a radical departure from the Anseriforme bauplan. This illustrates that in a truly evolutionary sense, a strictly phylogenetic taxonomy may be difficult to apply.

<doc id="455649" wikidata="Q1438931" url="?curid=455649" title="Parksville, British Columbia">
<text>Parksville is a city on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. As of the 2021 Census, Parksville&#x27;s population was 13,642, representing a 9.5% increase over the 2016 Census.

Parksville is well known for its large, sandy beaches at Parksville Bay and Craig Bay. The city&#x27;s best-known annual event since 1982 is a sandcastle-building competition held from mid-July to mid-August, dubbed &quot;Parksville Beachfest&quot;. Beachfest is the only World Championship Sand Sculpting official qualification event in Canada.

Parksville is served by the coast-spanning Island Highway, the Island Rail Corridor, and a nearby airport.

==History==
Human habitation has occurred in the area for thousands of years. Prior to Euro-Canadian settlement, the area was inhabited by several Coast Salish indigenous groups: Qualicum, Snaw-naw-as (Nanoose), and Snuneymuxw peoples.

The Spanish were the first Europeans to explore the area in 1791, followed shortly by the fleet of George Vancouver of the British Royal Navy. On Spanish maps, the Englishman River was called &#x27;Rio de Grullas,&#x27; (River of Cranes, i.e. herons) at the site of modern-day San Pareil, while French Creek was named &#x27;Punta de Leonardo.&#x27;

The first European landholder in the Parksville area was John Hirst, who pre-empted 120 hectares (300 acres) of land on both sides of the Englishman River in 1873, although he never relocated there from Nanaimo. The River, as it was known, remained an outpost until the turn of the 20th century when a road was built from Nanaimo.

A post office soon followed in 1877, with mail distributed from the cabin of the first postmaster, Nelson Parks, for whom the city is named.

At that time, logging was a major industry and the extension of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo (E &amp; N) Railway in 1901, to McBride Junction spurred Parksville&#x27;s growth and the beginning of a tourism boom, mainly Vancouver Islanders who travelled to Parksville to enjoy the incredible beaches.

Motels, stores, resorts and campgrounds soon followed and the community continues to prosper today. The Village of Parksville was incorporated June 19, 1945. Parksville became a town on April 1, 1978, and a city on June 1, 1981.

==Geography==
The city lies along Highway 19A, northwest of Nanaimo, east of Port Alberni and kilometres southeast of Qualicum Beach. Highway 4A originates to the south of the city, before heading west to Errington and Coombs. The majority of Parksville&#x27;s land base lies between Englishman River and French Creek, although a substantial portion of the city lies east of Englishman River, along the western shores of Craig Bay.

===Climate===
Parksville has a &quot;Csb&quot; warm-summer mediterranean climate with July and August having less than 40mm of rain. 
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Parksville had a population of 13,642 living in 6,754 of its 7,105 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 12,453. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median household income in 2006 for Parksville was $55,524, which is below the British Columbia provincial average of $62,346.

The three largest types of occupations in Parksville are the service industry; the construction industry; and the business, financial, and administration industries. These are the largest sectors of the city&#x27;s economy largely due to the summer tourism industry, and a large influx of retirees moving into the area. There is also a fair amount of primary sector industry in the surrounding areas of Parksville, primarily fishing and forestry.

There is an industrial park located in the Southeast section of the city, known as the Orange Bridge Business District, which includes many tradesman shops.

;Tourism
Parksville has long been a tourist location primarily catering to people from across Vancouver Island as well as Greater Vancouver.

Parksville Beach (located at Community Park) and Rathtrevor Beach are two of the city&#x27;s main attractions.

==Education==
The City of Parksville is located within School District 69 Qualicum. Springwood Elementary, Oceanside Elementary and Ballenas Secondary School are all located within Parksville. School District 69 also operates a Continuing Education Centre, Collaborative Education Alternate Program and PASS/Woodwinds Alternate School in Parksville.

A regional campus of Vancouver Island University is located in Parksville.

== Culture, recreation, and leisure ==

=== Polar Bear Splash ===
Every year on January 1, residents gather at Parksville Community Park beach to plunge into the cold water to welcome in the new year.

=== Summer By the Sea Market ===
Each summer, Parksville holds a night market on Tuesdays. The market draws in visitors and helps to support local small businesses. In the past, the market has had up to 150 vendors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the market was relocated to the Parksville Community Centre and the number of vendors was reduced. As of 2022, it has returned to Craig Street.

=== Canada Day Parade ===
Parksville hosts an annual Canada Day celebration. In the morning there is a parade that runs along the Island Hwy. Residents and visitors gather along the road to watch the procession and then walk down to Parksville Community Park where there are vendors, including food trucks, live music performances, some carnival attractions, and fireworks.
