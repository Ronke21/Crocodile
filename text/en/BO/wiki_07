<text>HMS &quot;Manchester&quot; was a light cruiser built for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s, one of three ships in the &quot;Gloucester&quot; subclass. Completed in 1938, she was initially deployed with the East Indies Station and had a relatively short but active career. When World War II began in September 1939, the cruiser began escorting convoys in the Indian Ocean until she was ordered home two months later. In late December &quot;Manchester&quot; began conducting patrols in the Norwegian Sea enforcing the blockade of Germany. Beginning in April 1940 the ship played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign, mostly escorting convoys. She was assigned to anti-invasion duties in May–November in between refits.

In November the cruiser was tasked to escort a convoy through the Mediterranean and participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. &quot;Manchester&quot; was refitting during most of early 1941, but began patrolling the southern reaches of the Arctic Ocean in May. The cruiser was detached to escort a convoy to Malta in July and she was badly damaged by an aerial torpedo en route. Repairs were not completed until April 1942 and the ship spent the next several months working up and escorting convoys.

&quot;Manchester&quot; participated in Operation Pedestal, another Malta convoy, in mid-1942; she was torpedoed by two Italian motor torpedo boats and subsequently scuttled by her crew. Casualties were limited to 10 men killed by the torpedo and 1 who drowned as the crew abandoned ship. Most of the crew were interned by the Vichy French when they drifted ashore. After their return in November, the ship&#x27;s leadership was court martialled; the captain and four other officers were convicted for prematurely scuttling their ship.

==Design and description==
The Town-class light cruisers were designed as counters to the Japanese s built during the early 1930s and the last batch of three ships was enlarged to accommodate more fire-control equipment and thicker armour. The &quot;Gloucester&quot; group of ships were a little larger than the earlier ships of the class and received additional armour. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The cruisers had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by four Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one shaft using steam provided by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and were designed to give a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 28 March – 7 April 1938, &quot;Manchester&quot; achieved an average speed of from . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 800–815 officers and ratings.

The Town-class ships mounted twelve BL six-inch (152 mm) Mk XXIII guns in four triple-gun turrets, one superfiring pair each fore and aft of the superstructure. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of eight QF Mk XVI dual-purpose guns in twin mounts. Their light anti-aircraft armament consisted of a pair of quadruple mounts for the two-pounder () (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) anti-aircraft (AA) guns and two quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machine guns. The ships carried two above-water, triple mounts for torpedoes. The Towns lacked a full-length waterline armour belt, although the sides of the &quot;Gloucester&quot; group&#x27;s boiler and engine rooms and the sides of the magazines were protected by of armour. The top of the magazines and the machinery spaces were protected by of armour. The armour plates on the main-gun turrets had a thickness of 2–4 inches.

The cruisers were designed to handle three Supermarine Walrus amphibious reconnaissance aircraft, one on the fixed D1H catapult and the others in the two hangars abreast the forward funnel, but only two were ever carried in service. A pair of cranes were fitted to handle the aircraft and the ships&#x27; boats.

===Modifications===
When &quot;Manchester&quot; returned home in November 1939, she was refitted with degaussing equipment and probably had her aft high-angle director-control tower (DCT) fitted. During a brief refit in November 1940, the ship was probably equipped with a Type 286 search radar. During a longer refit in January–March 1941, &quot;Manchester&quot;″s hull was reinforced and her Vickers machine guns were exchanged for an ex-Army 40-millimeter Bofors AA gun atop &#x27;B&#x27; turret and five Oerlikon AA guns. A Type 284 gunnery radar was installed on the roof of the main armament DCT atop the bridge during this refit. Additional splinter plating to protect the secondary armament and torpedo tubes was probably added at this time, as was an ASDIC sonar system.

Two additional ex-Army Bofors guns reinforced the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft suite before she participated in Operation Substance in June 1941. &quot;Manchester&quot; was torpedoed during this convoy escort mission and while she was being repaired in the United States and Britain, she received three more Oerlikon guns for a total of eight weapons, six of which were positioned in the superstructure, one on the roof of &#x27;X&#x27; turret and one on the quarterdeck. Two more ex-Army Bofors guns were added amidships before the ship participated in Operation Pedestal in August 1942. When the repairs were completed in April 1942, her radar suite consisted of a Type 279 early-warning radar, the Type 284 system for her main armament, two Type 285 gunnery radars for the four-inch guns, a Type 273 surface-search radar to replace the Type 286 and probably a pair of Type 282 gunnery radars for the &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Manchester&quot;, the first ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 23 October 1935 from Hawthorn Leslie and Company. The ship was laid down at their Hebburn shipyard on 28 March 1936 and was launched on 12 April 1937 by the wife of Joseph Toole, the Lord Mayor of Manchester. She was commissioned on 4 August 1938 and departed for her first duty assignment with the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies on 24 September.

After arriving in the British Colony of Aden, Yemen, on 12 October, &quot;Manchester&quot; was met by the heavy cruiser , the station flagship, and the two ships proceeded to Bombay, British India, and then to Trincomalee, British Ceylon by the end of the month where they spent the next month working up. They spent the next month making port visits on the western coast of British India before returning to Ceylon for a maintenance period in Colombo&#x27;s dockyard. Ports along the Bay of Bengal were visited in February–March 1939, before the two cruisers arrived in Singapore in the British Straits Settlements on 13 March. They conducted exercises with the aircraft carrier , the heavy cruiser and the submarine depot ship off the eastern coast of Malaya for the next several weeks.

Visiting Port Blair in the Andaman Islands en route on 28 March, &quot;Manchester&quot; arrived at Trincomalee to prepare for a refit in Colombo. Rising tensions in Europe caused the refit to be delayed for a week and her refit was completed in early June. She began a tour of Indian Ocean ports on 6 June, supporting an aeronautical survey in Diego Garcia three days later with fuel and supplies before arriving in the British Protectorate of Zanzibar on 20 June. The ship began moving up the African coast until she rendezvoused with her sister ship , the new station flagship, at Kilindini Harbour in British Kenya on 14 July. The sisters sailed to Aden when they met the sloops and later that month to practice convoy escort tactics in light of the potential threat posed by Italian colonies on the Red Sea.

===Early war service===
&quot;Manchester&quot; had just returned from a patrol in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden when Britain declared war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939. Together with &quot;Gloucester&quot;, she sailed for Colombo after refuelling. On 25 September, the ship rendezvoused with the sloop to help escort an Indian troop convoy through the Red Sea. &quot;Manchester&quot; escorted an Anglo-French convoy there before rendezvousing with the ocean liner in the Gulf of Suez to escort her to Colombo. The cruiser was ordered home on 10 November and arrived at Malta eight days later, where Vice-Admiral Geoffrey Layton hoisted his flag as commander of the 18th Cruiser Squadron (CS). The ship arrived in HM Dockyard, Portsmouth on the 25th and was docked to have storm damage and some other defects repaired.

Her refit was completed on 22 December and she joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow two days later. Later that month, &quot;Manchester&quot; was attached to the Northern Patrol, where she was tasked to enforce the blockade of Germany, searching for German blockade runners and contraband material. On 21 February 1940 the ship helped to capture the German merchantman . She remained on this duty until early April, although the cruiser was in Scapa Flow when it was attacked by German aircraft on 16 March. &quot;Manchester&quot;″s gunners were unprepared for the attack and her shells were ineffectual.

===Norwegian campaign===

The 18th CS was relieved of its attachment to the Northern Patrol and was assigned to escort convoys to and from Norway. On 7 April &quot;Manchester&quot;, her half-sister , the anti-aircraft cruiser and four destroyers were escorting the 43 ships of Convoy ON-25 bound for Norway. After the Royal Air Force (RAF) reported German ships in the North Sea, the convoy was ordered to turn back and the two light cruisers were to rendezvous with the Home Fleet in the Norwegian Sea. Their orders were later modified to patrol the southern part of the sea. Late on the 8th, the Admiralty ordered the ships to rendezvous with the Home Fleet lest they be caught between the two groups of German ships believed to be at sea; this was accomplished early on the morning of 9 April.

Reinforced by their sisters and and seven destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, the 18th CS was ordered to attack the believed to be in Bergen, Norway, later that morning. That afternoon the RAF reported two cruisers in Bergen and the Admiralty cancelled the operation. The Luftwaffe had been tracking the squadron as it approached Bergen and bombers from KG 26 and KG 30 began attacking shortly afterwards. They sank the destroyer and near misses damaged &quot;Southampton&quot; and &quot;Glasgow&quot;. That night &quot;Manchester&quot;, &quot;Southampton&quot; and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla patrolled off Fedjeosen to observe German forces in Bergen and prevent any resupply. The only incident that night was when &quot;Manchester&quot; spotted a submarine crossing between the two cruisers on the surface; the ship attempted to ram, but only managed a glancing blow. The next morning, the ships were recalled and the cruisers arrived in Scapa Flow that evening to refuel and replenish ammunition.

On 12 April, Captain Herbert Packer assumed command and the ship departed Scapa to rendezvous with the escort for Convoy NP-1 which was loaded with two infantry brigades bound for Narvik, Norway. Prime Minister Winston Churchill decided to take advantage of the unopposed occupation of Namsos on the 14th and ordered that the 146th Infantry Brigade should arrive offshore at dusk on the 15th to reinforce the initial landing force. Layton chose to escort the troopships &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; and with &quot;Manchester&quot;, her half-sister , the anti-aircraft cruiser and three destroyers. The threat of air attack and poor port facilities at Namsos caused the Admiralty to change the destination, but the troops and most of their equipment completed unloading on the 19th. That day the Admiralty ordered most of the ships off Norway home to prepare for further operations so the cruiser headed for Rosyth, Scotland.

Later that day, &quot;Manchester&quot; was ordered back to the Namsos area to escort Convoy FP-1 back to Britain. On 22 April she returned to Rosyth to begin loading about half of the 15th Infantry Brigade, together with &quot;Birmingham&quot; and the heavy cruiser , to be ferried to Åndalsnes and Molde. &quot;Manchester&quot; disembarked her passengers at the latter town on the 25th and then joined &quot;Birmingham&quot; to cover three destroyers laying mines near Trondheim. The sisters returned to Scapa Flow on 28 April to refuel. Three days later they arrived at Åndalsnes to evacuate the remaining troops still ashore. &quot;Manchester&quot; was slightly damaged by splinters from near misses made by the Luftwaffe that were otherwise ineffectual.

On 10 May &quot;Manchester&quot; and &quot;Sheffield&quot; were ordered to sea to protect the crippled destroyer which was being towed home after having been torpedoed by an E-boat. The cruisers engaged Luftwaffe aircraft when they unsuccessfully attacked the next day and then were ordered to return to Rosyth in light of the submarine threat where she began a brief refit. On 26 May, the 18th CS, consisting of &quot;Manchester&quot;, &quot;Birmingham&quot; and &quot;Sheffield&quot;, was transferred to the Humber for anti-invasion duties. They returned to Rosyth on 10 June after the vulnerabilities of Immingham were realised. Layton was relieved by Vice-Admiral Frederick Edward-Collins on 15 June and the ships returned to Immingham on 1 July. Edward-Collins transferred his flag to &quot;Birmingham&quot; on 4 July after which &quot;Manchester&quot; sailed to Portsmouth to begin a brief refit. She arrived back in Scapa Flow on 22 August and Edward-Collins immediately returned his flag to the ship. Her stay there was brief as the squadron immediately sailed for Rosyth to resume anti-invasion duties. The squadron returned to Immingham on 3 September as fears of invasion rose. Edward-Collins was relieved by Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland on 12 November.

On 15 November the ship departed Scapa Flow to rendezvous with a convoy that conveying RAF personnel and equipment to Alexandria, Egypt. After their arrival in Gibraltar on 21 November, &quot;Manchester&quot; and &quot;Southampton&quot; loaded roughly 1,400 men and many tons of supplies and departed on the 25th, escorted by Force H. They were to be met by ships of the Mediterranean Fleet south of Sardinia, Italy, the whole affair codenamed Operation Collar. The Italians spotted the convoy and attempted to intercept it on 27 November in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The British concentrated their cruisers, even though the efficiency of &quot;Manchester&quot; and &quot;Southampton&quot; was reduced by their passengers, and engaged their Italian counterparts at long range with little effect. The Italians attempted to disengage, but the British pursued until they risked leaving the convoy unprotected. The subsequent aerial attacks by the (Royal Italian Airforce) failed to damage any British ships. During the battle, &quot;Manchester&quot; fired 912 shells from her main guns without making a single hit. But she was hit by the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto causing splinter damage. The ship arrived at Alexandria without further incident on 30 November. She passed through the Mediterranean at high speed without being spotted and arrived at Scapa Flow on 13 December. Holland transferred his flag to her half-sister on 8 January 1941. The cruiser began a lengthy refit at Jarrow on 11 January that lasted until 17 April.

===1941===
&quot;Manchester&quot; rejoined the 18th CS at Scapa Flow the following day and spent the rest of the month working up. On 18 May the cruiser and &quot;Birmingham&quot; were ordered to patrol the Iceland-Faroe Islands gap, but they played no part in the search for the as they were repositioned north of Iceland in case the German ships attempted to return to Germany through the Denmark Strait after the battlecruiser was sunk on 24 May. The ships returned to Scapa Flow on 3 June and Packer was relieved by Captain Harold Drew. &quot;Manchester&quot; sailed on 9 June to Hvalfjord, Iceland, to patrol the Denmark Strait for the rest of the month, returning to Scapa on 3 July.

The ship joined the escort force for Convoy WS-9C bound for Gibraltar on 12 July and arrived there eight days later where she loaded troops and supplies from the convoy to be conveyed to Malta in Operation Substance. The convoy came together on 23 July and the Italians determined that it was bound for Malta. The ships of the (Royal Italian Navy) were not prepared to attack so that was left to the bombers of the . During the first attack that morning &quot;Manchester&quot; was hit by an Italian aerial torpedo that struck abreast &#x27;X&#x27; turret. It blew a hole in the hull, disabled both portside propeller shafts, and allowed heavy flooding that caused a 12.5-degree list. The estimated of water also caused the ship to trim down at the stern by and filled the aft engine room which meant that only a single propeller shaft was operable. The detonation killed 3 officers and 23 ratings from &quot;Manchester&quot;″s crew and 5 officers and 7 other ranks from the embarked troops. The list was corrected less than three hours after the attack and the cruiser was ordered to return to Gibraltar, escorted by a destroyer. The two ships were unsuccessfully attacked by more Italian bombers later that day and reached their destination on the 26th.

Temporary repairs took until 15 September when the ship then sailed for the Philadelphia Navy Yard in the United States for permanent repairs. This was finished on 27 February 1942, after which she returned to Portsmouth, where final work was completed by the end of April. On her return to service she rejoined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow on 4 May, spending most of the rest of the month working up. &quot;Manchester&quot; covered a minelaying operation in the Denmark Strait on 29 May–1 June before returning to Scapa on 4 June. Two days later, King George VI visited the ship during his visit to Scapa. The cruiser spent most of the next two weeks exercising with the other ships of the Home Fleet. On 19 June, Vice-Admiral Stuart Bonham Carter, commander of the 18th CS, hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Manchester&quot;. On 30 June–2 July, the ship ferried supplies and reinforcements to Spitzbergen Island in the Arctic Ocean. Immediately thereafter, she helped to provide distant cover for Convoy PQ 17 for the next two days. Upon her return to Scapa, she became a private ship when Bonham Carter struck his flag.

===Operation Pedestal===
&quot;Manchester&quot; was transferred to the 10th CS in preparation for Operation Pedestal, another convoy to resupply the besieged island of Malta. She departed Greenock on 4 August, part of the escort for the aircraft carrier . They joined the main body of the convoy on the 7th off the coast of Portugal. The cruiser refuelled at Gibraltar and rejoined Force X, the convoy&#x27;s close escort, on 10 August. Later that day, &quot;Eagle&quot; was sunk by a German submarine, the first casualty of many suffered by the convoy. By the night of 13/14 August, Force X was passing through the mine-free channel close off the Tunisian coast. At 00:40 the convoy was attacked by a pair of German S-boats, but they were driven off, with one boat damaged by British fire. About 20 minutes later &quot;Manchester&quot; was attacked near Kelibia by a pair of Italian MS boats (MTBs), &quot;MS 16&quot; and &quot;MS 22&quot;, which each fired one torpedo, one of which struck the cruiser in the aft engine room, despite her efforts to evade the torpedoes, and jamming her rudder hard to starboard. The hit killed one officer and nine ratings and knocked out electrical power to the aft end of the ship. She slowed to a stop as both starboard propeller shafts were damaged and flooding of the aft engine room disabled both inner shafts. Only the port outer shaft was operable, but its turbine had temporarily lost steam due to the explosion.

The flooding quickly caused &quot;Manchester&quot; to take on an 11-degree list and both the main radio room and the four-inch magazine to fill with water. At about 01:40 Drew ordered &quot;Emergency Stations&quot; which was a standing order when not already at action stations that required all crewmen not required to operate or supply the anti-aircraft guns to proceed to their abandon ship positions. Transferring oil from the starboard fuel tanks to port and jettisoning the starboard torpedoes reduced the list to about 4.5 degrees by 02:45. Drew felt that the ship&#x27;s tactical situation was dire due to the threat of other motor torpedo boats as the ship&#x27;s working armament was limited to the four-inch guns and the anti-aircraft weapons. He also felt it imperative that she had to reach deep water by the island of Zembra by dawn (05:30) which he estimated would take about three hours of steaming. The initial damage reports included a two- to three-hour estimate of restoring steam power as the extent of the damage had not yet been fully assessed, although that was repaired much more quickly than the initial estimate. Focused on the tactical situation, Drew was unaware that steam had been restored to the port outer turbine, the rudder unjammed and electrical power had been restored to the steering gear at about 02:02 before he decided to abandon ship 45 minutes later. Earlier, the destroyer had stopped to render assistance at 01:54 and Drew had transferred 172 wounded and superfluous crewmen before she had to depart to rejoin the convoy.

About 02:30 Drew inquired about the necessary preparations for scuttling by her own crew with explosive charges during a conversation with his chief engineer. About 15 minutes later he addressed the crew informing them of his decision to scuttle the cruiser and to prepare to abandon ship. The order to scuttle was given at 02:50 and it was impossible to rescind when the chief engineer informed him that power had been restored to one turbine and the steering gear five minutes later. &quot;Manchester&quot; finally sank at 06:47. Drew ordered his crew to abandon ship at 03:45; one man drowned as he attempted to swim ashore, but the rest of his men survived. Most made it ashore, but an estimated 60 to 90 men were rescued by the destroyers and when they were dispatched at 07:13 to render assistance to the cruiser after &quot;Pathfinder&quot; met up the rest of the 10th CS. Two other men were rescued by an Italian MTB, but they were ultimately turned over to the French and joined the rest of the crew in the Laghouat prison camp.

===Aftermath===
The Admiralty convened a Board of Enquiry on 16 September to establish the facts of the cruiser&#x27;s loss using testimony provided by available witnesses. Rear-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Foreign), and the First Sea Lord, Admiral Dudley Pound reviewed the board&#x27;s findings and believed that Drew&#x27;s actions showed a lack of determination to fight his ship. Pound further believed that this disqualified Drew from ever again commanding a ship unless further inquiry proved otherwise. First Lord of the Admiralty A. V. Alexander concurred with Pound&#x27;s comments on 9 October.

The interned crew was released after French North Africa joined Free France and all had arrived back in Britain by 25 November. Drew was ordered to write a report on the loss of his ship five days later by the Admiralty and forwarded his report on 7 December. A week later the Admiralty ordered that a court martial be convened for the loss of &quot;Manchester&quot; under Article 92 of the Naval Discipline Act of 1866 and it began on 2 March 1943.

Drew&#x27;s written evidence focused on the tactical situation in which he found himself: adrift in a narrow passage between the coast of Tunisia and an off-shore minefield, with the turret ammunition hoists disabled and little four-inch ammunition available and a high expectation of further attacks by MTBs and aircraft if still near the coast by dawn. He believed that any such successful attack would have a high chance of causing &quot;Manchester&quot; to run aground and fall into enemy hands. The initial damage control report given to him after the torpedo hit estimated three hours to get steam power restored which allowed him only a narrow window to get clear of the coast. His evidence made little mention of &quot;Emergency Stations&quot; and his reasoning behind evacuating unwounded crewmen aboard &quot;Pathfinder&quot; before ascertaining the full extent of the damage.

After the modern Royal Navy&#x27;s longest-ever court martial, the court determined that &quot;Manchester&quot;″s damage was remarkably similar to that suffered on 23 July 1941 whilst under his command; that the cruiser was capable of steaming at on her port outer propeller shaft, that her main and secondary armament was largely intact, and that the initial list of 10–11 degrees had been considerably reduced via counter-flooding, jettisoning her torpedoes, and transfers of fuel oil. Drew was &quot;dismissed his ship&quot;, severely reprimanded, and was prohibited from further command at sea; four other officers and a petty officer were also punished.

A diving expedition visited the wreck at a depth of about in 2002 and footage taken by the divers was used in a TV documentary entitled &quot;Running the Gauntlet&quot; produced by Crispin Sadler. They discovered that the ship was largely intact, lying on her starboard side. Two of the ship&#x27;s survivors accompanied the expedition and reminisced about their experiences. Another diving expedition to view &quot;Manchester&quot; was undertaken in 2009.

<doc id="447673" wikidata="Q11483763" url="?curid=447673" title="Gibsons">
<text>Gibsons is a coastal community of 4,758 in southwestern British Columbia, Canada on the Sunshine Coast, where the southwest bank of Howe Sound meets the Strait of Georgia.

During its early history as a European-descended settlement, the town was a local centre for forestry and commercial fishing. However, changing economics and resource availability have led Gibsons to increasingly become a bedroom community to workers in Greater Vancouver (especially remote or hybrid workers). Due to its location in the Pacific Coastal Rainforest, adjacent the Salish Sea and the Coast Mountains, and its position as gateway to the rest of the Sunshine Coast, Gibsons is a regional tourist destination.

In 2009, the International Awards for Liveable Communities (LivCom) named Gibsons the most liveable community in the world with a population under 20,000.

Gibsons is perhaps best known in Canada as the setting of the popular and long-running CBC Television series &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, which aired from 1972 to 1990. The storefront &quot;Molly&#x27;s Reach&quot; (a former cafe now up for lease as of 2023), the restored tug &quot;Persephone&quot;, and a display about the series at the Sunshine Coast Museum and Archives are popular attractions. Other films that have used Gibsons as a location include &quot;Charlie St. Cloud&quot; (2010), starring Kim Basinger and Zac Efron (as a stand-in for Marblehead, Massachusetts); and &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1993), starring Max von Sydow and Ed Harris.

Gibsons, like the remainder of the Sunshine Coast, is inaccessible by road directly from the rest of the lower mainland, and is primarily accessed by a BC Ferries ferry from Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.

==History==
The land currently known as Gibsons is part of the traditional and ancestral lands of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw, which also includes parts of Greater Vancouver and the Squamish River watershed. Sḵwx̱wú7mesh oral history tells that the region around Gibsons was the birthplace of the Squamish people after what is called &quot;The Great Flood&quot;.

The European settlement town of Gibsons was established in 1886 by George Gibson and his sons. It was incorporated in 1929 as Gibson&#x27;s Landing, and in 1947 was renamed Gibsons at the residents&#x27; request. The town&#x27;s two main sections are:

* Lower Gibsons, the mostly residential seaside area that includes Gibsons Marina, Molly&#x27;s Reach, and Winegarden Park, with an auditorium that hosts live performances in the summer. It also has shops and restaurants catering mostly to vacationers.
* Upper Gibsons, along the Sunshine Coast Highway (BC Highway 101), with commercial areas including Sunnycrest Mall, the town&#x27;s two major supermarkets, a variety of fast food restaurants, the largest elementary school, and the high school.

Gibsons is the first town in British Columbia to accept styrofoam at its recycling facility, the Gibsons Recycling Depot. Its staff has travelled widely to promote styrofoam recycling; founder Buddy Boyd was invited to address an international Zero Waste conference in Florianopolis, Brazil.

==Economy==
The Sunshine Coast has seen a three-decade transition from a forestry- and fishing-based economy to a more diverse one with construction trades, business services, retail and tourism becoming prominent.

Between 2016 and 2021, its population grew 3.3% compared with BC&#x27;s overall growth rate of 7.6%. In 2021, the median resident age was 56.0 years, compared with the provincial median of 42.8 years.

==Climate==
Gibsons is in a temperate coastal climate, with mild, rainy winters and warm, dry summers. The region&#x27;s landscape is in a temperate rainforest.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Gibsons had a population of 4,758 living in 2,282 of its 2,482 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 4,605. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="447685" wikidata="Q232981" url="?curid=447685" title="Aelia Eudoxia">
<text>Aelia Eudoxia (; ; died 6 October 404) was Eastern Roman empress by marriage to the Roman emperor Arcadius. The marriage was arranged by Eutropius, one of the eunuch court officials, who was attempting to expand his influence. As Empress, she came into conflict with John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of Constantinople, who denounced imperial and clerical excess. She had five children, four of whom survived to adulthood, including her only son and future emperor , but she had two additional pregnancies that ended in either miscarriages or stillbirths and she died as a result of the latter one.

==Family==
She was a daughter of Flavius Bauto, a Romanised Frank who served as &quot;magister militum&quot; in the Western Roman army during the 380s. The &quot;History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian&quot; (1923) by J. B. Bury and the historical study &quot;Theodosian Empresses: Women and Imperial Dominion in Late Antiquity&quot; (1982) by Kenneth Holum consider her mother to be Roman and Eudoxia to be a &quot;semibarbara&quot;, half-barbarian. However, the primary sources are silent on her maternal ancestry, though she would have been Roman.

==Early life==
Aelia Eudoxia&#x27;s father was last mentioned as Roman Consul with Arcadius in 385 and was already deceased by 388. According to Zosimus, Eudoxia started her life in Constantinople as a household member of Promotus, magister militum of the Eastern Roman Empire. She is presumed to have been orphaned at the time of her arrival. Her entry into the household of Promotus may indicate a friendship of the two magisters or a political alliance.

Promotus died in 391 and, according to Zosimus, he was survived by his widow Marsa and two sons, Arcadius and his younger brother Honorius, who were raised alongside the sons and co-emperors of Theodosius I. Zosimus asserts that Eudoxia lived alongside one of the surviving sons in Constantinople and is assumed to have already been acquainted with Arcadius during his years as junior partner to his father. Eudoxia was educated by Pansophius, who was later promoted to bishop of Nicomedia in 402.

==Marriage==
On 17 January 395, Theodosius I died of oedema in Milan. Arcadius succeeded him in the Eastern Roman Empire and Honorius in the Western Roman Empire. Arcadius was effectively placed under the control of Rufinus, Praetorian prefect of the East. Rufinus reportedly intended to marry his daughter to Arcadius and establish his own relation to the Theodosian dynasty. Bury considers that &quot;once the Emperor&#x27;s father-in‑law he [Rufinus] might hope to become an Emperor himself.&quot;

However, Rufinus was distracted by a conflict with Stilicho, magister militum of the West. The wedding of Eudoxia to Arcadius was orchestrated by Eutropius, one of the eunuch officials serving in the Great Palace of Constantinople. Although one tale says that Eutropius presented Arcadius with a portrait of Eudoxia and expounded on her charms until Arcadius fell in love, in actuality the emperor would have already been familiar with Eudoxia for six or seven years, and his choice in empress would have been politically motivated.

The marriage took place on 27 April 395, without the knowledge or consent of Rufinus. For Eutropius it was an attempt to increase his own influence over the emperor and hopefully ensure the loyalty of the new empress to himself. Rufinus had been an enemy of Promotus and the surviving household of the magister militum, including Eudoxia, might have been eager to undermine him. Arcadius himself may have been motivated in asserting his own will over that of his regent. Zosimus reports that Arcadius was also influenced by the extraordinary beauty of his bride. Arcadius was approximately eighteen years old and Eudoxia may be presumed to be of an equivalent age.

==Empress==
In the decade between her marriage and her death, Eudoxia gave birth to five surviving children. A contemporary source known as pseudo-Martyrius also reports two stillbirths. &quot;Pseudo-Martyrius&quot; is hostile to Eudoxia and is likely to have been Cosmasa deacon baptized by John Chrysostomand who was keen to link the stillbirths to divine punishment for the two exiles of John. The writer, Zosimus, also alleged that her son Theodosius was widely rumored to be the result of her affair with a courtier (Zosimus is also generally hostile to Eudoxia and the accuracy of his tale therefore suspect).

Eudoxia and Gainas, the new magister militum, are considered to have played a part in the stripping of all offices and subsequent execution of Eutropius in 399who was attempting to expand his own influence and power at court. However the extent and nature of her involvement are disputed. Nevertheless, she seems to have increased her personal influence following the execution of Eutropius. She also involved herself in legal matters, such as when the general Arbazacius bribed her in order that he avoid trial for his conduct during his campaign against the Isaurians. On 9 January 400, Eudoxia was officially given the title of an &quot;augusta&quot;. She was then able to wear the purple paludamentum representing imperial rank and was depicted in Roman coinage. Official images of her in the manner similar to a male Augustus also circulated. Her brother-in-law Honorius later complained to Arcadius about them reaching his own court.

The extent of her influence at matters of court and state has been a matter of debate among historians. Philostorgius considers her to be more intelligent than her husband but comments on her &quot;barbarian arrogance&quot;. Zosimus considers her strong-willed but ultimately manipulated by eunuchs at court and the women of her environment. &quot;Barbarians and Bishops: Army, Church, and State in the Age of Arcadius and Chrysostom&quot; (1990) by J. W. H. G. Liebeschuetz considers her influence overestimated in primary sources while &quot;The Cambridge Ancient History XIII. The Late Empire A.D. 337–425&quot; (1998) reports her dominating the government between 400 and her death in 404.

In 403, Simplicius, Prefect of Constantinople, erected a statue dedicated to her on a column of porphyry and a base of marble. Arcadius renamed the town of Selymbria (Silivri) &quot;Eudoxiopolis&quot; after her, though this name did not survive.

==Church policy==
 Her role in the ecclesiastical affairs of her time is relatively well recorded. She became a patron to the faction of the Christian Church accepting the Nicene Creed and was reported by Socrates of Constantinople to have financed nighttime anti-Arian processions in Constantinople. She also presided in public celebrations over the arrival of new relics of Christian martyrs to the city and joined nightly vigils herself. She was consistently reported to act alone in religious matters; and her husband Arcadius generally remained absent from public events.

According to Mark the Deacon, Eudoxia welcomed Bishop Porphyry in 400, who promised her a son in return for her hospitality. Following the birth of Theodosius II, Eudoxia instructed Porphyry to bring a petition to the infant, which was &quot;ordained&quot; by the newborn. Eudoxia then sent head eunuch Amantius to find a &quot;zealous Christian&quot; to execute the new law and demolish pagan temples and intimidate the pagan populace of Gaza. Porphyry destroyed the temple of Marnas and constructed a basilica there in honor of the vow Eudoxia had made in her prayers for a son. Upon the completion of the basilica after Eudoxia&#x27;s death, it was named Eudoxiané in her memory.

A possible reason for Eudoxia&#x27;s presence in religious matters over her husband&#x27;s is that Eudoxia had adopted the role of patron of the Church previously belonging to the Augusti from Constantine I onwards. Her role brought her into conflict with John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of Constantinople, particularly after he protested over the fall from power and execution of Eutropius (his ally at court).

During his time as Archbishop, John adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings, which made him popular with the common people, but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy. His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular with these groups. He ordered absentee priests to return to the churches they were meant to be serving – without any payout.

At about the same time, Theophilus, the Patriarch of Alexandria, wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John&#x27;s appointment to Constantinople. Being an opponent of Origen&#x27;s teachings, he accused John of being too partial to the latter&#x27;s teachings. Theophilus had disciplined four Egyptian monks (known as &quot;the Tall Brothers&quot;) over their support of Origen&#x27;s teachings. They fled to and were welcomed by John. John made another enemy in Eudoxia, who assumed (perhaps with justification) that his denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at herself. An alliance was soon formed against him by Eudoxia, Theophilus and others. They held a synod in 403 (the Synod of the Oak) to charge John, in which his connection to Origen was used against him. It resulted in his deposition and banishment. He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately, as the people became &quot;tumultuous&quot; over his departure. There was also an earthquake the night of his arrest, which Eudoxia took for a sign of God&#x27;s anger, prompting her to ask Arcadius for John&#x27;s reinstatement.

Peace was short-lived. A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected near the city cathedral. John denounced the dedication ceremonies. He spoke against Eudoxia in harsh terms: &quot;Again Herodias raves; again she is troubled; she dances again; and again desires to receive John&#x27;s head in a charger,&quot; comparing himself to John the Baptist.

Once again John was banished, this time to the Caucasus in Armenia, and he died there in exile in 407. Eudoxia did not survive long. Her seventh and last pregnancy ended in either a miscarriage or, according to pseudo-Martyrius, a second stillbirth. She was left bleeding and died of an infection shortly thereafter.

She was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, in a porphyry sarcophagus that was described in the 10th century by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot;.

==Children==
Eudoxia and Arcadius had five known children. The main source about their births and deaths is the chronicle of Marcellinus Comes:

*Flacilla (born 17 June 397). Her birth was recorded by Marcellinus Comes. She predeceased her father. Only sibling not mentioned alive at his death in 408.
*Pulcheria (19 January 399 – 453). Married Marcian.
*Arcadia (3 April 400 – 444).
*Theodosius II (10 April 401 – 28 July 450).
*Marina (10 February 403 – 449).

If pseudo-Martyrius is to be believed, her two pregnancies (due late in 403 and late in 404, respectively) ended not in miscarriages, as previously supposed, but stillbirths, the second caused Eudoxia&#x27;s death from hemorrhaging and infection.

==Legacy==
Eudoxia is a featured figure on Judy Chicago&#x27;s installation piece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, being represented as one of the 999 names on the &quot;Heritage Floor.&quot; She is listed under the Theodora place setting.

<text>The United States census (plural censuses or census) is a census that is legally mandated by the Constitution of the United States. It takes place every ten years. The first census after the American Revolution was taken in 1790 under Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. There have been 24 federal censuses since that time. The census includes territories of the United States. The United States Census Bureau is responsible for conducting the census.

The most recent national census took place in 2020; the next census is scheduled for 2030. Since 2013, the Census Bureau began discussions on using technology to aid data collection starting with the 2020 census. In 2020, every household received an invitation to complete the census over the Internet, by phone or by paper questionnaire. For years between the decennial censuses, the Census Bureau issues estimates made using surveys and statistical models, in particular, the Population Estimates Program and American Community Survey.

Censuses between 1940 and 2000 (both included) also had a &quot;long form&quot; version, sent to only a subset of the households, with additional questions about socioeconomic and housing characteristics.

The United States census is distinct from the Census of Agriculture, which is no longer the responsibility of the Census Bureau. It is also distinct from local censuses conducted by some states or local jurisdictions.

== Legal basis ==
The U.S. census is mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the United States Constitution, which states: &quot;Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States... according to their respective Numbers... . The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years&quot;. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment amended Article I, Section 2 to include that the &quot;respective Numbers&quot; of the &quot;several States&quot; will be determined by &quot;counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.&quot; The United States Census Bureau (officially the Bureau of the Census, as defined in Title 13 U.S.C. § 11) is responsible for the United States census. The Bureau of the Census is part of the United States Department of Commerce.

Title 13 of the United States Code governs how the census is conducted and how its data are handled. Information is confidential as per . The census law, coupled with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title 18 of the United States Code, Sections 3551, 3559, and 3571), provides for penalties of up to $5,000 for not responding or for willfully providing false answers to any question.

==Procedure==

Decennial U.S. census figures are based on actual counts of persons dwelling in U.S. residential structures. They include citizens, non-citizen legal residents, non-citizen long-term visitors and undocumented immigrants. The Census Bureau bases its decision about whom to count on the concept of usual residence. Usual residence, a principle established by the Census Act of 1790, is defined as the place a person lives and sleeps most of the time. The Census Bureau uses special procedures to ensure that those without conventional housing are counted. Data from these operations are not as accurate as data obtained from traditional procedures.

In instances where the bureau is unsure of the number of residents at an address after a field visit, its population characteristics are inferred from its nearest similar neighbor (hot-deck imputation). This practice has effects across many areas, but is seen by some as controversial. The practice was ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Utah v. Evans&quot;.

Certain American citizens living overseas are specifically excluded from being counted in the census even though they may vote. Only Americans living abroad who are &quot;federal employees (military and civilian) and their dependents living overseas with them&quot; are counted. &quot;Private U.S. citizens living abroad who are not affiliated with the federal government (either as employees or their dependents) will not be included in the overseas counts. These overseas counts are used solely for reapportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives&quot;.

According to the Census Bureau, &quot;Census Day&quot; has been April 1 since 1930. Previously, from 1790 to 1820, the census counted the population as of the first Monday in August. It moved to June 1 in 1830, (June 2 in 1890), April 15 in 1910, and January 1 in 1920.

Because people are born, die, and move during the year, the census counts people where they were or expect to be living on this specific reference date in an attempt to get a coherent snapshot and avoid double counting. The actual census-taking begins before this date and extends for months thereafter. In 2020, the earliest responses were collected starting January 21 in remote parts of Alaska, and March 12 for most Americans.

== Applications ==

In addition to its primary purpose of reapportioning the House of Representatives, census data are used for a wide variety of applications, including:
* Apportionment of federal funding in a large number of programs, estimated at somewhere between $675 billion and $1.5 trillion per year.
* Infrastructure and transportation planning 
* Military and disaster response planning
* Economic analysis
* Commercial investment and marketing decisions
* Computer programs that can disambiguate place names based on which has the highest population
* General reference works

==Controversy==
The census has historically and up to the present been controversial due to its role in reapportioning political representation. In the 1850s, census planners suppressed information about slavery due to pressure from Southern lawmakers. The results of the 1920 census were ignored and no reapportionment took place, as rural lawmakers feared losing power to urban areas. In the 1940s, census officials were involved in organizing Japanese-American internment.

The census is controversial; up to one-third of all U.S. residents do not respond to repeated reminders. In recent censuses, the nonresponse rate has been less than 1% (it was about 0.4% in 2010), but during the 2020 census, as of September 11, many experts believed the nonresponse rate could reach double digits. By October 19, 2020, all states had topped a 99% response rate, with all but one state having a nonresponse rate below 0.1%.

The Census Bureau estimates that in 1970 over six percent of African Americans went uncounted, whereas only around two percent of European Americans went uncounted. Democrats often argue that modern sampling techniques should be used so that more accurate and complete data can be inferred. Republicans often argue against such sampling techniques, stating the U.S. Constitution requires an &quot;actual enumeration&quot; for apportionment of House seats, and that political appointees would be tempted to manipulate the sampling formulas.

Groups like the Prison Policy Initiative assert that the census practice of counting prisoners as residents of prisons, not their pre-incarceration addresses, leads to misleading information about racial demographics and population numbers.

=== 2020 ===

The 2020 census drew a number of controversies and legal challenges under the Trump administration due to President Donald Trump&#x27;s policies on illegal immigration, particularly those undocumented in the country. Prior to the publication of the census, the Commerce Department stated its intention to add a question asking responders about their immigration status, which many states and activists stated would cause illegal immigrants to not respond out of fear of prosecution and lead to undercounting, affecting state representation and federal funding. The Supreme Court case &quot;Department of Commerce v. New York&quot;, decided in June 2019, found the rationale to add the question was arbitrary and capricious and required the department to provide a better reasoning before inclusion. The department dropped the question by the form&#x27;s publication time. Following the decision, Trump issued an executive order directing the department to obtain citizenship data from other federal agencies rather than via the census. On July 21, 2020, Trump signed a presidential memorandum ordering the exclusion of illegal immigrants from the numbers in the 2020 census that are used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives.

The COVID-19 pandemic made the collection of the census results difficult, and the department had extended the deadline to complete collection to October 31 instead of July 31, 2020. On August 3, the department announced its Replan Schedule that would end collection early on September 30, aware this would leave them with incomplete data that they would have to estimate total numbers to complete. This move was again challenged in the courts. While lower courts had ruled for an injunction against the department from implementing the Replan Schedule, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the injunction in October 2020, allowing the census to end early.

Around the same time, Trump issued a memo to the Commerce Department on July 21, 2020, instructing them to use estimates of undocumented immigrants and subtract their numbers from the totals, claiming that he had the authority to make this determination on a Constitutional and past legal basis. Several legal challenges were filed, and a combined suit from 22 states and several non-governmental organizations were found against Trump, ruling that only Congress has the authority to interpret the manner of which people the census includes. Trump petitioned to the Supreme Court which has certified the case &quot;Trump v. New York&quot; for an expedited hearing in November, given the results are to be delivered to Congress by December 31, 2020. The Court issued a per curiam decision on December 18, 2020, which vacated the District Court&#x27;s ruling and remanded the case to that court with orders to dismiss it.

==History==
Censuses had been taken prior to the Constitution&#x27;s ratification; in the early 17th century, a census was taken in Virginia, and people were counted in almost all of the British colonies that became the United States. Between 1781 and 1786, the first &quot;actual enumeration&quot; was conducted separately in each state and compiled by John Kean for consideration at the Constitutional Convention in 1787.

Throughout the years, the country&#x27;s needs and interests became more complicated. This meant that statistics were needed to help people understand what was happening and have a basis for planning. The content of the decennial census changed accordingly. In 1810, the first inquiry on manufactures, quantity and value of products occurred; in 1840, inquiries on fisheries were added; and in 1850, the census included inquiries on social issues, such as taxation, churches, pauperism, and crime. The censuses also spread geographically, to new states and territories added to the Union, as well as to other areas under U.S. sovereignty or jurisdiction. There were so many more inquiries of all kinds in the census of 1880 that almost a full decade was needed to publish all the results. In response to this, the census was mechanized in 1890, with tabulating machines made by Herman Hollerith. This reduced the processing time to two and a half years.

For the first six censuses (1790–1840), enumerators recorded only the names of the heads of household and a general demographic accounting of the remaining members of the household. Beginning in 1850, all members of the household were named on the census. The first slave schedules were also completed in 1850, with the second (and last) in 1860. Censuses of the late 19th century also included agricultural and industrial schedules to gauge the productivity of the nation&#x27;s economy. Mortality schedules (taken between 1850 and 1880) captured a snapshot of life spans and causes of death throughout the country.

The first nine censuses (1790–1870) were conducted by U.S. Marshals before the Census Bureau was created. Appointed U.S. Marshals of each judicial district hired assistant marshals to conduct the actual enumeration. The census enumerators were typically from the village or neighborhood and often knew the residents. Before enabling self-identification on the censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau relied on local people to have some knowledge of residents. Racial classification was made by the census enumerator in these decades, rather than by the individual.

==Respondent confidentiality==
One purpose of the census is to divide the house seats by population. Furthermore, as with any Census Bureau survey, the data provides a beginning for the allocation of resources. In addition, collected data are used in aggregate for statistical purposes. Replies are obtained from individuals and establishments only to enable the compilation of such general statistics. The confidentiality of these replies is very important. By law, no one—neither the census takers nor any other Census Bureau employee—is permitted to reveal identifiable information about any person, household, or business.

By law (), individual decennial census records are sealed for 72 years. One explanation for this number is that it was chosen in 1952 as slightly higher than the average female life expectancy, 71.6. Another explanation (which disputes the life expectancy number) is that this number is a holdover from 1942, when a disagreement between the Census Bureau and the National Archives was resolved with 1870 as the boundary between confidential and public records. The individual census data most recently released to the public is the 1950 census, released on April 1, 2022. Aggregate census data are released when available.

===FBI data use===
Under the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), using primarily census records, compiled (1939–1941) the Custodial Detention Index (&quot;CDI&quot;) on citizens, enemy aliens, and foreign nationals, who might be dangerous. The Second War Powers Act of 1941 repealed the legal protection of confidential census data, which was not restored until 1947. This information facilitated the internment of Japanese-Americans, following the Japanese attack on the U.S. at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the internment of Italian- and German-Americans following the United States&#x27; entry into World War II.

In 1980, four FBI agents went to the Census Bureau&#x27;s Colorado Springs office with warrants to seize census documents, but were forced to leave with nothing. Courts upheld that no agency, including the FBI, has access to census data.

==Data analysis==
The census records data specific to individual respondents are not available to the public until 72 years after a given census was taken, but aggregate statistical data derived from the census are released as soon as they are available. Every census up to and including 1950 is currently available to the public and can be viewed on microfilm released by the National Archives and Records Administration, the official keeper of archived federal census records. Complete online census records can be accessed for no cost from National Archives facilities and many libraries, and a growing portion of the census is freely available from non-commercial online sources.

Census microdata for research purposes are available for all censuses from 1790 forward except for 1890 through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), and scanned copies of each of the decennial census questionnaires are available online from many websites. Computerized aggregate data describing the characteristics of small geographic areas for the entire period from 1790 to 2010 are available from the National Historical Geographic Information System.

===Regions and divisions===

The bureau recognizes four census regions within the United States and further organizes them into nine divisions. These regions are groupings of states that subdivide the United States for the presentation of data.

<text>Trevor Kavanagh (born 19 January 1943) is a retired British/Australian journalist who most recently wrote for &quot;The Sun&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Kavanagh was educated at Reigate Grammar School before leaving school at 17 to work for newspapers in Surrey and later Hereford.

In 1965, he emigrated to Australia, working on several newspapers. After a short stint back in the United Kingdom working for the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot;, Kavanagh returned to Australia to work for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in Sydney on the political desk.

==Career==
In 1978, he returned to the United Kingdom permanently, taking a job on the news desk of &quot;The Sun&quot;, and then as an industrial correspondent in 1980. He was appointed as the paper&#x27;s political editor in 1983.

In January 2004, Kavanagh claimed a huge scoop. An unnamed source telephoned Kavanagh with details of the Hutton Inquiry the night before it was officially published. Kavanagh was provided with accurate details of the report and published them ahead of the official release. He was however less accurate on 4 June 2009. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live he asserted that Gordon Brown would be out of office the next week. Shortly afterwards, he was named as the eighth most influential person in the British media – behind his proprietor Murdoch, but ahead of his editor, Rebekah Wade.

He covered his last UK general election as political editor in May 2005. In December 2005, it was announced that he was to become an associate editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; in January. His successor as political editor was his deputy, George Pascoe-Watson.

Kavanagh joined the board of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) in December 2015. In February 2017, the IPSO found that a column by Kavanagh published in &quot;The Sun&quot; about allegedly false refugee claims was factually inaccurate. The adjudication by IPSO described Kavanagh&#x27;s inaccuracies as creating &quot;a significantly misleading impression.&quot;

In August 2017, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a column by Kavanagh which questioned what actions British society should take to deal with &quot;The Muslim Problem&quot;. Kavanagh cited an opinion piece by Labour Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities Sarah Champion MP several days previously as a reason that it was &quot;now acceptable&quot; to describe Muslims as a &quot;specific rather than cultural problem&quot;. Sean O&#x27;Grady of &quot;The Independent&quot; stated that the column used language reminiscent of Nazi propaganda and Nazi phrases. A joint complaint was made to IPSO by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Tell MAMA and Faith Matters. A statement by the groups said &quot;The printing of the phrase &#x27;The Muslim Problem&#x27; – particularly with the capitalisation and italics for emphasis – in a national newspaper sets a dangerous precedent, and harks back to the use of the phrase &#x27;The Jewish Problem&#x27; in the last century.&quot; A cross-party group of over 100 MPs from the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens subsequently signed a letter to the editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; demanding action over the column. The letter stated the MPs &quot;were truly outraged by the hate and bigotry&quot; in Kavanagh&#x27;s column.

Kavanagh left the board of IPSO at the end of December 2017, two years into a three-year contract. Kavanagh retired from &quot;The Sun&quot; in July 2024 after the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

==Personal life==
Kavanagh is married and lives in London. He has two sons and three grandchildren. On TalkTV on 6 July 2022, he told Mike Graham that he held an Australian passport which he may use in the event Sadiq Khan becomes prime minister of the UK.

<doc id="447697" wikidata="Q489519" url="?curid=447697" title="Sitones">
<text>The Sitones were a Germanic people living somewhere in Northern Europe in the first century CE. They are mentioned only by Cornelius Tacitus in 97 CE in Germania. Tacitus considered them similar to Suiones (ancestors of modern Swedes) apart from one descriptor, namely that women were the ruling sex. Phonetical equivalent of ᚦ (þurisaz) may have been documented equivalent to either T or D, explaining sitones, suiones and suehans as local differences similar to viking age runestone carvings describing siþiuþu, suiþiuþu and suoþiauþu meaning Svitjod (Sweden).

Upon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in all other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is exercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from a state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage.

Speculations on the Sitones&#x27; background are numerous. According to one theory, the name is a partial misunderstanding of Sigtuna, one of the central locations in the Swedish kingdom, which much later had a Latin spelling &quot;Situne&quot;.

Another view is that the &quot;queen&quot; of the Sitones derives by linguistic confusion with an Old Norse word for &quot;woman&quot; from the name of the Kvens or Quains.

According to medievalist Kemp Malone (1925), Tacitus&#x27; characterization of both the Suiones and the Sitones is &quot;a work of art, not a piece of historical research&quot;, with the Sitones&#x27; submission to a woman as the logical culminating degeneracy after the Suiones&#x27; total submission to their king and surrendering of their weapons to a slave.

<doc id="447698" wikidata="Q354043" url="?curid=447698" title="Carroll Shelby">
<text>Carroll Hall Shelby (January 11, 1923 – May 10, 2012) was an American automotive designer, racing driver, and entrepreneur.

Shelby was involved with the AC Cobra and Mustang for Ford Motor Company. With driver Ken Miles, he developed the Ford GT40, the car that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1969. As of 2024, it remains the only American-built car to win at Le Mans. Their efforts were dramatized in the 2019 Oscar-winning film &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot; (titled &quot;Le Mans ″66&quot; in some European countries).

Shelby and co-driver Roy Salvadori won the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans driving an Aston Martin DBR1. He won the 1960 Sports Car Club of America United States Auto Club Road Racing Sports Car Championship by winning the round-one race at Riverside International Raceway in a Maserati Tipo 61 &quot;Birdcage&quot;, and winning round two at Continental Divide Raceways in a Chevrolet Scarab Mark II.

in 1962, he established Shelby American to manufacture and market performance vehicles. His autobiography, &quot;The Carroll Shelby Story&quot;, was published in 1967.

==Early life and career==
Carroll Shelby was born on January 11, 1923, to Warren Hall Shelby, a rural mail carrier, and his wife, Eloise Shelby (born Lawrence), in Leesburg, Texas. The younger Shelby suffered from heart valve leakage problems by age 7 and related complications throughout his life. From a young age, Shelby was fascinated with speed, which led to an interest in cars and airplanes. He moved to Dallas, Texas, at age 7 with his family, and around age 10, he rode his bicycle to dirt tracks nearby to watch races. At age 15, he was driving and taking care of his father&#x27;s Ford. Shelby honed his driving skills with his Willys automobile while attending Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas. He graduated in 1940.

He enrolled at The Georgia Institute of Technology in the Aeronautical Engineering program.

Shelby enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps on April 11, 1941, eight months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. He began pilot training that November at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He graduated with the rank of staff sergeant pilot in September 1942 at Ellington Field. After more training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in December 1942.

He served as a flight instructor and test pilot in the Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan and Curtiss-Wright AT-9 Jeep. He was posted to several other air bases in Texas, including Kelly Field, Cuero Field, Perrin Army Air Field, Ellington Field, and Childress Army Airfield. He trained bombardiers and navigators. He went on to fly the Douglas B-18 Bolo, the North American B-25 Mitchell, the Douglas A-26 Invader, and finally the Boeing B-29 Superfortress at Denver, Colorado.

Discharged after V-J Day. Shelby started a dump truck business, worked as an oil-well roughneck from 1948 to 1949, then started a poultry farm but went bankrupt in 1952.

==Driving career==
Shelby began his racing career as an amateur. In January 1952, Shelby raced his friend Ed Wilkin&#x27;s MG TC at the Grand Prairie Naval Air Station drag meet. Later in the year, he raced Charles Brown&#x27;s Cadillac-Allards at Caddo Mills, Texas. At the end of 1952, Shelby won four races, taking home only trophies, accepting no prize money.

In 1953, Shelby raced Brown&#x27;s Cad-Allard, then Roy Cherryhomes&#x27; Cad-Allard, winning eight or nine races.

The following year, he drove in the Mil Kilometros de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, sponsored by the Automobile Club of Argentina and the Sports Car Club of America. There he met John Wyer, Aston Martin&#x27;s team manager, who asked Shelby to drive their DBR3 at Sebring. During the race, the DBR3 broke an axle and did not finish.

In April 1954, Shelby traveled to Europe, where he raced a DBR3 for Wyer at Aintree, then at Le Mans. He and Graham Whitehead took fifth in an Aston Martin at the Thousand Kilometers at Monza on 27 June. He then drove in the 3-car factory team effort at Silverstone on 17 July with Peter Collins and Roy Salvadori; they took the three top places. 
In August, Shelby drove with Donald Healey and his team. In an Austin-Healey 100S and supercharged 100S, they set Class D National speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Shelby, Healey, Captain G.E.T. Eyston, Mortimer Morris Goodall, and Roy Jackson-Moore set about 70 records, with Shelby setting 17 on his own. Shelby was severely injured in a crash while racing an Austin-Healey in the Carrera Panamericana.

Amid eight months of operations, he continued to drive in 1955, winning about ten races and mounting a second-place showing at Sebring driving Allen Guiberson&#x27;s Ferrari Monza. He started driving Tony Paravano&#x27;s Ferraris in August.

In 1956, he won 30 more races with the Ferrari, started driving for John Edgar, and opened Carroll Shelby Sports Cars in Dallas. He drove in the Mount Washington Hillclimb Auto Race in a specially prepared Ferrari 375 GP roadster, to a record run of 10 minutes, 21.8 seconds. He also set records at Giants Despair Hillclimb, and raced at Brynfan Tyddyn. He was &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s driver of the year in 1956.

In September 1957, he raced John Edgar&#x27;s 4.5-liter Maserati at the Riverside International Raceway, where he was involved in a crash that caused injuries requiring 72 stitches and plastic surgery for broken bones in his nose and cheekbones. He returned in November, winning with the same car at the same course, against Masten Gregory and Dan Gurney. He repeated as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; driver of the year.

On 18 May 1958, Shelby joined John Wyer and the Aston Martin team in Europe and drove a DBR3 at the Belgian Sports Car Grand Prix. He then drove a DBR1 at the Nürburgring 1000 km with co-driver Salvadori. Shelby was teamed up with Salvadori at Le Mans, but Shelby came down with dysentery and was replaced by Stuart Lewis-Evans a few hours into the race. Shelby then drove a Maserati 250F for Mimo Dei&#x27;s Scuderia Centro Sud in 3 Grand Prix races to gain Formula 1 and open-wheel car experience, including the Portuguese Grand Prix. Shelby finished the year driving John Edgar&#x27;s 4.5L Maserati in the Tourist Trophy at Nassau.

Shelby and Salvadori started the 1959 sports car season by driving the DBR1/300 at Sebring in March. In June, Shelby drove Wolfgang Seidel&#x27;s Porsche in the Nürburgring 1000 km. The highlight of his racing career came in June 1959 when he co-drove an Aston Martin DBR1 (with Englishman Roy Salvadori) to victory in the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans. In September, Shelby drove with Jack Fairman in the Goodwood Tourist Trophy.

The 1959 Grand Prix season saw Shelby driving the Aston Martin DBR4 in the Dutch Grand Prix in May, followed by the British Grand Prix at Aintree in July. Shelby then drove in the Portuguese Grand Prix in August, followed by the Italian Grand Prix in September.

Shelby finished the 1959 racing season driving Casner Motor Racing Division&#x27;s Birdcage Maserati at the Nassau races in December. In January 1960, he drove Temple Buell&#x27;s Maserati 250F in the New Zealand Grand Prix, then Camoradi&#x27;s Porsche in the Cuban Gran Premio Libertad, then their 2.9-liter Birdcage Maserati at Sebring. He won the Grand Prix at Riverside driving one of &quot;Lucky&quot; Cassner&#x27;s Birdcage Maseratis, and then won the Castle Rock race in June, driving a Scarab. He finished the year driving Max Balchowsky&#x27;s &quot;Old Yeller II&quot; in the Road America, then a Birdcage Maserati in the Pacific Grand Prix and the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix, which was his last race.

Shelby later wrote that &quot;winning the Twenty-four Hours was probably the greatest thrill I ever got out of racing. I can think of plenty of other races that carry their quota of thrills for the winner, but when you win this one, it kind of gives you license to go out and tell people you&#x27;re good, and that often helps get some other deals together.&quot;

==As constructor==

One year after retiring from driving in October 1960 for health reasons, Shelby opened a high-performance driving school with Pete Brock: the Shelby School of High Performance Driving at the Riverside track.

He also opened the Shelby-American performance equipment and customization company in the Los Angeles area. Shelby&#x27;s visits to European limited-production car factories led him to believe that “America was missing a big bet, a winning bet&quot;: &quot;the design and production of an all-purpose, all-American sports or grand touring car that you could drive to market and also race during the weekend...&quot; Shelby&#x27;s starting point was putting a 300-brake horsepower V8 on an Austin Healey-type chassis, so that the combination weighed less than .

Shelby became interested in the potential of the AC Ace chassis, especially after Bristol Aeroplane Company stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the Ford Zephyr engine were declining in September 1961. Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit. Dave Evans of Ford Motor Company agreed to provide and V8 engines with transmissions also on credit. The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, was marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then AC Cobra, and eventually, the Ford Cobra. Production began in March 1962, with 75 cars sold by the end of the year. One hundred cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a engine. The 427 Cobra prototype was built in October 1964.

Shelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002. Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits. The result was the Shelby Daytona Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 World Sportscar Championship GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the Sports Car Club of America&#x27;s U.S. GT Championship. Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.

After success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford&#x27;s GT40 Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results. Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford&#x27;s engine. In 1966, the Mark II earned Ford the overall Constructors&#x27; title in the World Sportscar Championship with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans. Ford was also developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels. Shelby was brought in to finalize the development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966, which included the death of driver Ken Miles in August. The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 12 Hours of Sebring and finished in first place. It was prepared for Le Mans and another record-breaking finish. Driver Dan Gurney shook and sprayed champagne on the podium and started a tradition. The Mark IV was Shelby&#x27;s last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class eliminated Ford&#x27;s engines.

Shelby&#x27;s early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based Shelby GT350, starting in 1965, then the Shelby GT500, starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.

After parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other Big 3 American companies: Dodge (Chrysler) and Oldsmobile (General Motors).

In the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to the production of &quot;completion&quot; Cobras — cars that were allegedly built using &quot;leftover&quot; parts and frames. In the 1960s, the FIA required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for homologated classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of Vehicle Identification Numbers, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the &quot;leftover&quot; frames, and began selling cars that were supposedly finally &quot;completed&quot;. After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed &quot;continuation&quot; Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.

Shelby was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1991, the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992, and the Diecast Hall of Fame in 2009. He was also inducted into the SCCA Hall of Fame on March 2, 2013.

In 2003, Ford Motor Co. and Carroll Shelby resumed ties and he became technical advisor to the Ford GT project. In that same year, he formed Carroll Shelby International, Inc., based in Nevada.

==Partnership with Dodge==
Shelby began working with Dodge at the request of Chrysler Corporation chairman Lee Iacocca. Iacocca had previously been responsible for bringing Shelby to the Ford Mustang. After almost a decade of tuning work, Shelby was brought on board as the &quot;Performance Consultant&quot; on the Dodge Viper Technical Policy Committee made up of Chrysler&#x27;s executive Bob Lutz, Product Design chief Tom Gale, and Engineering Vice President François Castaing. Shelby&#x27;s wealth of experience helped make the Viper as light and powerful as possible.

The following cars were modified by Shelby and bore his name, but sold under the Dodge marque:
*1983–1984 Dodge Shelby Charger
*1985–1987 Dodge Charger Shelby
*1984–1986 Dodge Omni GLH
*1996 Dodge Viper RT/10 CS (50 units approved for production however only 19 were actually built: 18 1995/1996 RTs were built (16 white with blue stripes, 1 blue white stripes, 1 black with gold emblem on the hood and one 1997 GTS Shelby S/C (Street Competition) which was red with gold stripes.)

The following cars used Shelby-modified parts, but were not overseen by Carroll Shelby:
*1986 Dodge Daytona Turbo Z C/S
*1987–1988 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z
*1988–1991 Dodge Daytona C/S
*1989–1991 Dodge Daytona Shelby
*1988–1989 Dodge Lancer Shelby
*1989–1990 Dodge Shadow Competition
*1991–1992 Dodge Spirit R/T
*1992–1993 Dodge Daytona IROC R/T
*1999–2000 Dodge Durango S.P. 360

The following cars were limited production vehicles and modified at Shelby&#x27;s Whittier, California, plant, and then sold as Shelbys:
*1986 Shelby GLH-S (based on the Dodge Omni GLH) (500 produced)
*1987 Shelby GLH-S (based on the Dodge Charger Shelby) (1,000 produced)
*1987 Shelby Lancer (based on the Dodge Lancer) (800 produced, 400 with a Leather Interior/Automatic Trans. and 400 with a Cloth Interior/5 spd. Trans.)
*1987 Shelby CSX (based on the Dodge Shadow) (750 produced)
*1988 Shelby CSX-T (based on the Dodge Shadow) (1,000 produced)
*1989 Shelby Dakota (based on the Dodge Dakota) (1,500 produced)
*1989 Shelby CSX-VNT (based on the Dodge Shadow) (500 produced)

==Shelby Series 1==
Shelby unveiled the Series 1 roadster at the 1997 Los Angeles Auto Show, with the intention for it to be a modern day reinterpretation of the original Shelby AC Cobra. The Series 1 used Oldsmobile&#x27;s 4.0 L &quot;L47 Aurora&quot; V8, which was chosen because it was the selected engine by Indy for that year but was poorly supported by the ailing GM division. Shelby had already built an Aurora-engined sports prototype together with Racefab in 1997, in an attempt to continue his single-make Can-Am series.

The Series 1 is the only car ever produced by Carroll Shelby from a clean sheet of paper, and built from the ground up. All other Shelbys were re-engineered models produced by other manufacturers and then modified by Shelby.

Before manufacturing the Series 1, substantial expenses were accrued for the purpose of conducting tests and obtaining certification in order to comply with the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Shelby American built a total of 249 production Series 1 cars as model year 1999 cars.

During production, Venture Corporation purchased Shelby American, Inc. The purchase included the Series 1 model, but not the rights to produce the &quot;Continuation Series&quot; Shelby Cobras. In 2004, after a subsequent bankruptcy by Venture Corporation (unrelated to the acquisition of Shelby American), Carroll Shelby&#x27;s new company, Shelby Automobiles, Inc., purchased the Series 1 assets for pennies on the dollar. Included in the asset purchase were enough components to produce several more complete Series 1s.

Because the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1&#x27;s produced after that date were completed as &quot;component cars&quot; and delivered with no engine or transmission. Those &quot;component car&quot; models built in 2005 are identified with a seven-digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen-digit VIN.

The Series 1 was produced in both supercharged and normally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy-duty clutch. Performance is near &quot;supercar&quot; category with a 0 to 60 mph time at 4.1 seconds for the supercharged version. The Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away in a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as roadsters, with no convertible top.

==Ford-Shelby projects==

In 2004, a new Ford Shelby Cobra Concept was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s Cobras mixed with modern touches, it was based on the Ford GT chassis (reworked for front engine/rear wheel drive) and powered by a 6.4 L V10 engine that produced 605 hp (451 kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and won the &quot;Best In Show&quot; award at the Detroit International Auto Show.

A coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year in 2005, the Ford Shelby GR-1 concept car. While sporting a completely modern design, it took inspiration from the design of the 1960s Shelby Daytona. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT&#x27;s chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 were positive. The car was featured on the cover of &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Car Magazine&quot;. The Ford Shelby GR-1 was floated as a possibility of taking over the Ford GT&#x27;s production line after its production came to an end. Neither Shelby concept was built.

In 2005, Carroll Shelby built his very first modern Masterpiece CSM:00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6 and #01 V8 to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars. Its V6 produced 380 hp, making it faster than Ford&#x27;s 300 hp V8. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the 500 hp V8 instead. Shelby first built a V8 modern version look of the Eleanor. Carroll built only one at the Shelby Factory. Later WCC built 4 as kits. Few CS6 Shelbys were also built as kits; consequently, these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.

At the 2005 New York International Auto Show, Ford introduced the Shelby GT500, the first official collaboration between Shelby and Ford on a Mustang since 1971. It became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a supercharged and intercooled Modular 5.4L V8 engine, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the Ford GT, an Eaton M122 Roots-type supercharger and a power output rated by Ford at and of torque. It had a Tremec T-6060 6-speed manual transmission, reworked suspension geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and a retro solid rear axle. The GT500 started at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he provided Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to use wider rear tires (from 255 mm wide to 285 mm wide).

Shelby, in cooperation with the Hertz Corporation, produced 500 cars named &quot;Shelby GT-H&quot; in 2006, designed after the Shelby G.T.350H &quot;Rent-a-Racer&quot; from 1966 under a similar partnership. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT&#x27;s 4.6 L V8 engine to . The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated &quot;Hertz&quot; nameplate on both sides.

A consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance, and drivetrain upgrades and were available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.

Both Ford and Shelby American continue to use the Shelby name on high performance variants of the Mustang.

==Non-Ford projects==
In 1963 the Rootes Group, manufacturer of Sunbeam automobiles, wanted Shelby to upgrade their Alpine sports car to a more powerful version, using the Ford small-block V-8 engine, as he had done with the AC Cobra. Shelby did so and Rootes, pleased with the results, named the upgraded model the Tiger. In 1967 Chrysler bought Sunbeam and decided to use their own small-block engine in the vehicle. However, their engine would not fit and marketed the cars with Ford engines until the supply ran out and the model was discontinued.

In his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies that were making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars – ostensibly for copyright, trademark, and patent violations. Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.

Shelby American sued Superformance for producing its Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe—both designed by Shelby&#x27;s racing-school partner Pete Brock. The terms of the settlement have never been released to the public, but the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe. Nearly 150 had been built as of February 2007.

In 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles. This company specialized in recreating 1960s-style Shelby Mustangs. They purchased used Mustangs and installed updated versions of the Shelby 325-horsepower 302-cubic-inch V8 engine. They also use modern five-speed manual transmissions, brakes, steering, suspension, interiors, and entertainment systems. Because Shelby&#x27;s license was purchased, these cars have Shelby serial numbers.
In October 2007, Carroll Shelby ended his licensing agreement with Unique Performance after customers complained that vehicles had not been delivered. Unique Performance was subsequently raided by law enforcement for VIN irregularities and declared bankruptcy, which effectively ended the Shelby continuation &quot;Eleanor&quot; Mustang production. Shelby was in turn sued by victims of Unique Performance for his involvement in the criminal activity.

The 2000 remake of &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; movie highlighted the star car character &quot;Eleanor,&quot; a customized 1967 Mustang. Some custom car businesses began to reproduce &quot;Eleanor&quot;-looking cars with the trademarked name, causing Denice Halicki to again take legal action to protect the trademark and the copyrighted Eleanor&#x27;s image. In 2008, Halicki won a case against Shelby, who was also selling &quot;Eleanor&quot; using the trademark name and copyrighted image.
Gary Laughlin, a wealthy Texas oilman and amateur racer, and Shelby decided to build a dual-purpose car based on the Chevrolet Corvette chassis and European-style alloy coachwork. Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti, who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari&#x27;s Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The completed car, dubbed the Scaglietti Corvette, arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. GM&#x27;s Ed Cole, who had helped to procure the Corvette chassis, was chastised by GM management and told to drop the project. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Shelby declined to buy a car and it was promptly sold.

==Other projects==
Shelby licensed his name to many non-automotive products. His name and other trademarks associated with him are licensed to other companies by Carroll Shelby Licensing, a subsidiary of holding company Carroll Shelby International.

Shelby, a founder of the Terlingua International Chili Championship in Terlingua, Texas, leant his name to a chili fixings kit consisting of spices in several packets that used to come in a brown paper bag, but now comes in a box. On the side of the bag was a story from Shelby about cooking chili during his racing days. On the front of the bag was a depiction of a big western black hat, a trademark piece of clothing for Shelby. The product has since been bought by Reily Products who have discontinued the inclusion of a separate salt packet.

In 1967, Shelby marketed &quot;Carroll Shelby&#x27;s Pit-Stop ... a Real Man&#x27;s Deodorant&quot; that was promoted in car magazines.

Shelby was the initial partner of Dan Gurney in Gurney&#x27;s All American Racers.

Donzi Marine developed the Donzi Shelby 22 GT, a speedboat based on their Classic line of boats in collaboration with Shelby.

Shelby produced a line of eight-spoke alloy wheels for Saab automobiles in the early to mid-1980s. They were available in gold (Goldvane), hammered silver (Silvervane) finish, and a black hammered finish. These wheels were available through Saab dealers and could be fitted to Saab 99 and Saab 900 models manufactured through 1987.

Shelby supported a project with Rucker Performance Motorcycles to manufacture 12 Shelby motorcycles that were designed by William Rucker.

In 2008, Shelby was awarded the 2008 Automotive Executive of the Year Award.

Shelby established the Carroll Shelby Children&#x27;s Foundation to cover medical bills of children who have heart disease but are unable to pay for treatment.

In 2008, Shelby began funding scholarships for the automotive program at Northeast Texas Community College, the local community college in his hometown of Leesburg, which renamed the program for him. The Carroll Shelby Foundation continues to fund scholarships and the program.

==Memoir==
Shelby&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Carroll Shelby Story,&quot; was published in 1967 by Pocket Books. In 2019, the book was re-released by Graymalkin Media for the opening of &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, a 2019 American sports drama film. The memoir describes his days as a race car driver and the genesis of the Shelby Cobra.

==Personal life==

Shelby was married seven times; the first and last marriages lasted 15 years before divorce proceedings.

Shelby&#x27;s first wife was Jeanne Fields; they married on December 18, 1943. They had three children: Sharon Anne (born September 27, 1944), Michael Hall (born November 2, 1946), and Patrick Bert (born October 23, 1947). They divorced in February 1960.

Shelby later admitted to an extramarital affair with Jan Harrison, an actress. In 1962, Shelby married Harrison, but the marriage was annulled the same year. His third marriage, to a New Zealand woman, which he entered in order to get her into the United States, lasted only a few weeks before ending in divorce. His fourth marriage, to Sandra Brandstetter, lasted a couple of years before ending in divorce.

In 1989, after 28 years of being single, Carroll married Cynthia Psaros, a former actress, beauty queen, and daughter of a retired US Marine colonel fighter pilot. During this marriage, Carroll received his long-awaited heart transplant. Their marriage lasted a few years before ending in divorce. In the 1990s he married Helena &quot;Lena&quot; Dahl, a Swedish woman he had met in 1968. She died in a car accident in 1997. It was his only marriage that did not end in divorce, annulment, or separation.

Just four months after Dahl&#x27;s death, Shelby married his last wife, Cleo (nee Rendell-Roberts), a British former model who drove rally cars. She was 25 years his junior. They were in the process of divorce when he died in 2012.

Shelby received a heart transplant in 1990, and a kidney transplant in 1996.

Shelby died on May 10, 2012, at the age of 89. He had been suffering from a serious heart ailment for decades.

Shelby is portrayed by Matt Damon in &quot;Ford v. Ferrari&quot;, a 2019 film about the 1960s rivalry between Ford and Ferrari at the Le Mans auto race and Shelby&#x27;s friendship with race car driver Ken Miles.

&quot;Shelby American: The Carroll Shelby Story&quot; is a 2019 feature-length documentary about Shelby&#x27;s life and career.

Shelby features prominently in Bill Cosby&#x27;s comedic story &quot;200 M.P.H.&quot; (1968). Shelby (voiced by Cosby) convinces Cosby that, since he was an American, he should drive an &quot;American car&quot; – specifically, a custom-made Shelby Cobra that was guaranteed to go 200 mph, faster than any foreign sports car. The story takes up the entire second side of Cosby&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;200 M.P.H.&quot;

<text>Nigga (), also known as &quot;the N-word&quot; is a colloquial term in African-American Vernacular English that is considered vulgar in many contexts. It began as a dialect form of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, an ethnic slur against black people. As a result of reappropriation, today the word is used mostly by African-Americans in a largely non-pejorative sense as a slang term referring to another black person or to themselves, often in a neutral or friendly way. The word is commonly associated with hip hop culture and since the 1990s, with gangs (especially in popular culture). The word is more often applied to men, with more select terms being used for women in the culture.

In dialects of English that have non-rhotic speech (including standard British English), the hard-r &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;nigga&quot; are usually pronounced the same.

== Usage ==
The use of &quot;nigger&quot; non-pejoratively within the black community was documented in the 1912 novel &quot;The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man&quot; by African-American writer James Weldon Johnson, in which he recounted a scene in New York City around the turn of the century:
I noticed that among this class of colored men the word &quot;nigger&quot; was freely used in about the same sense as the word &quot;fellow,&quot; and sometimes as a term of almost endearment; but I soon learned that its use was positively and absolutely prohibited to white men.

There is conflicting popular opinion on whether there is any meaningful difference between &quot;nigga&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot; as a spoken term. Many people consider the terms to be equally pejorative, and the use of &quot;nigga&quot; both in and outside black communities remains controversial. H. Lewis Smith, author of &quot;Bury That Sucka: A Scandalous Love Affair with the N-word&quot;, believes that &quot;replacing the &#x27;er&#x27; with an &#x27;a&#x27; changes nothing other than the pronunciation&quot; and the African American Registry notes, &quot;Brother (Brotha) and Sister (Sistah or Sista) are terms of endearment. Nigger was and still is a word of disrespect.&quot; The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a civil rights group, condemns use of both &quot;nigga&quot; and &quot;nigger&quot;.

Many African-Americans only consider &quot;nigga&quot; offensive when used by people of other races, with some seeing its use outside a defined social group as an unwelcome cultural appropriation. Used by black people, the term may indicate &quot;solidarity or affection&quot;, similar to the usage of the words &quot;dude&quot;, &quot;homeboy&quot;, and &quot;bro&quot;. Some consider &quot;nigga&quot; non-offensive except when directed from a non-African-American towards an African-American. Yet others have derided this as hypocritical and harmful, enabling white racists to use the word and confusing the issue over &quot;nigger&quot;. Conversely, &quot;nigga&quot; has been used an example of cultural assimilation, whereby some members of other ethnicities (particularly younger people) will use the word in a positive way, similar to the previously mentioned &quot;dude, homeboy,&quot; and &quot;bro&quot;, although this usage remains very controversial. Members of other ethnicities will not use the word while around African-Americans, especially those they do not know. 

In practice, its use and meaning are heavily dependent on context, with non-offensive examples ranging from a greeting, to reprimand, to general reference, to a use synonymous with &quot;male person&quot;. , the word &quot;nigga&quot; was used more liberally by some younger members of all races and ethnicities in the United States. In addition to African-Americans, other ethnic groups have adopted the term as part of their vernacular, although this usage is very controversial.

== Cultural influence ==
The phrase &quot;nigga, please&quot;, used in the 1970s by comics such as Paul Mooney as &quot;a funny punctuation in jokes about Blacks&quot;, is now heard routinely in comedy routines by African-Americans. The growing use of the term is often attributed to its ubiquity in modern American hip hop music.

One of the earliest uses of the term in a popular song was in the lyrics of the 1983 song &quot;New York New York&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, although it had featured in some very early hip hop recordings such as &quot;Scoopy Rap&quot; and &quot;Family Rap&quot;, both from 1979. Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard uses the term 76 times in his &quot;Nigga Please&quot; album (not including repetitions in choruses).

Comedian Chris Rock&#x27;s 1996 routine &quot;Niggas vs. Black People&quot; distinguishes a &quot;nigga&quot;, which he defined as a &quot;low-expectation-havin&#x27; motherfucker&quot;, from a &quot;black person&quot;. In contrast, Tupac Shakur distinguished between &quot;nigger&quot; and &quot;nigga&quot;: &quot;Niggers was the ones on the rope, hanging off the thing; niggas is the ones with gold ropes, hanging out at clubs.&quot; Tupac, who has been credited with legitimizing the term, said his song &quot;N.I.G.G.A.&quot; stood for &quot;Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished&quot;.

In 2001, a public disagreement between Conrad Tillard (activist and minister then, Conrad Muhammad) and Russell Simmons (Def Jam co-founder) erupted about the portrayal in media of hip hop culture, especially that of rap music. Tillard argued that the use of &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;nigga&quot; by rappers is &quot;degrad[ing] the African-American community&quot; through its &quot;bombardment of ... negative images&quot;. He directly accused Simmons of &quot;condoning violence by refusing to condemn the frequent use of [these words] in rap lyrics&quot; in the lead up to both parties organizing gatherings to discuss hip hop culture. Rapper KRS-One publicly supported Tillard, but stated that &quot;if an artist feels he has to use the &#x27;n&#x27; or &#x27;b&#x27; words, that&#x27;s a poetic debate. What we&#x27;re saying is you cannot package the word muthaf---er to our children.&quot;[censoring quoted] Tillard&#x27;s own Campaign for Dignity Meeting in April was boycotted by Simmons, who also encouraged others to not attend, while Simmons organized the Hip Hop Summit in June, which Tillard attended. The disagreement has been referred to as a &quot;feud&quot;, and the two were successfully encouraged by Louis Farrakhan (head of the Nation of Islam) at Simmons&#x27; summit to bury the hatchet and show public unity.

The song &quot;R &amp; B&quot; from Devin the Dude&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Just Tryin&#x27; ta Live&quot; (2002) features a comedic conversation between Devin and &quot;a redneck&quot; (voiced by Devin) exploring a cultural divide and how it might be overcome by the liberal application of &quot;reefer and beer&quot;. The song culminates with Devin frustrated by the redneck failing to correctly pronounce &quot;nigga&quot;.

In the 2004 Coen brothers film &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;, the antagonist is Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall), an elderly church-going landlady with moral certainty living in the Baptist bible belt, who is introduced making a complaint to her local sheriff about her neighbour playing &quot;hippity hop music too loud&quot;. She qualifies her disdain by asking the sheriff rhetorically if he knows &quot;what they call colored folks in them songs?&quot; moving to quickly exclaim, &quot;Niggaz&quot; [or &quot;Niggers&quot;; sources have printed both spellings].

Some television shows use the word, either to create a realistic atmosphere or as a way of presenting social discussion, specifically ones relating to the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.

== Use in trademarks or brand names ==
Until a 2017 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Matal v. Tam&quot;, the Lanham Act did not permit registration of trademarks containing terms that may disparage persons or bring them into disrepute. Registration by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) of terms that are historically considered disparaging to groups of people has been allowed in some circumstances. Self-disparaging trademarks have been allowed in some cases where the applicant has shown that the mark as-used is not considered by the relevant group to be disparaging.

In 1995, two men from Houston filed a trademark application with the PTO for the words &quot;Naturally Intelligent God Gifted Africans&quot;, and its acronym. The application was rejected, as were numerous subsequent applications for variations of the word &quot;nigga&quot;. In 2005, comedian Damon Wayans twice attempted to trademark a brand name called Nigga, &quot;featuring clothing, books, music and general merchandise&quot;. The PTO refused Wayans&#x27; application, stating &quot;the very fact that debate is ongoing regarding in-[ethnic]-group usage, shows that a substantial composite of African-Americans find the term &#x27;nigga&#x27; to be offensive&quot;.

<text>The beach stone-curlew (Esacus magnirostris) also known as beach thick-knee is a large, ground-dwelling bird that occurs in Australasia, the islands of South-east Asia. At and , it is one of the world&#x27;s largest shorebirds. 

It is less strictly nocturnal than most stone-curlews, and can sometimes be seen foraging by daylight, moving slowly and deliberately, with occasional short runs. It tends to be wary and fly off into the distance ahead of the observer, employing slow, rather stiff wingbeats..

The beach stone-curlew is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In New South Wales it is listed as critically endangered.

== Distribution ==
The beach stone-curlew is a resident of undisturbed open beaches, exposed reefs, mangroves, and tidal sand or mudflats over a large range, including coastal eastern Australia as far south as far eastern Victoria, the northern Australian coast and nearby islands, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is uncommon over most of its range, and rare south of Cairns.

== Description ==
The beach stone-curlew is 54-56 cm (21-22 in) long. At a mean of in males and in females, it is the heaviest living member of the Charadriiformes outside of the gull and skua families. They have black and white face patterning, yellow eyes and a grey-brown upper body. 

== Ecology ==
Beach stone-curlew forage on low tide muddy sand for invertebrates, mostly crabs.

=== Breeding ===
The bird breeding season is September to November. The bird nests in sand, laying one egg per season just above the high tide line on the open beach, where it is vulnerable to predation and human disturbance. The egg is vulnerable to Both parents care of the young until they reach 7-12 months of age.

=== Call ===
As an alarm, the bird will make a chwip-chwip to ward creatures away from their territory.

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Africa&quot;, &quot;Bambara&quot; means &quot;believer&quot; or &quot;infidel&quot;; the group acquired the name because it resisted Islam after the religion was introduced in 1854 by Tukulor conqueror El Hadj Umar Tall.

==History==
The Bamana originated as a royal section of the Mandinka people. Both Manding and Bambara are part of the Mandé ethno-linguistic group, whose divergence is dated to at least about 7,000 years ago, and branches of which are associated with sites near Tichitt (now subsumed by the Sahara in southern Mauritania), where urban centers began to emerge by as early as 2500 BC. By 250 BC, a Mandé subgroup, the Bozo, founded the city of Djenne. Between 300 AD and 1100 AD, the Soninke Mandé dominated the Western Mali, leading the Ghana Empire. When the Nilo-Saharan Songhai Empire dissolved after 1600 AD, many Mandé-speaking groups along the upper Niger river basin turned inward. The Bamana appeared again in this milieu with the rise of a Bamana Empire in the 1740s, when the Mali Empire started to crumble around 1559.

While there is little consensus among modern historians and ethnologists as to the origins or meaning of the ethno-linguistic term, references to the name &quot;Bambara&quot; can be found from the early 18th century. In addition to its general use as a reference to an ethno-linguistic group, &quot;Bambara&quot; was also used to identify captive Africans who originated in the interior of Africa perhaps from the upper Senegal-Niger region and transported to the Americas via ports on the Senegambian coast. As early as 1730 at the slave-trading post of Gorée, the term &quot;Bambara&quot; referred simply to slaves who were already in the service of the local elites or French.

Growing from farming communities in Ouassoulou, between Sikasso and Ivory Coast, Bamana-age co-fraternities (called &quot;Ton&quot;s) began to develop a state structure which became the Bambara Empire and later Mali Empire. In stark contrast to their Muslim neighbors, the Bamana state practised and formalised traditional polytheistic religion, though Muslim communities remained locally powerful, if excluded from the central state at Ségou.

The Bamana became the dominant cultural community in western Mali. The Bambara language, mutually intelligible with the Manding and Dyula languages, has become the principal inter-ethnic language in Mali and one of the official languages of the state alongside French.

==Culture==

===Caste===

Traditionally, Mandé society is hierarchal or caste-based, with nobility and vassals. Bamana political order created a small free nobility, set in the midst of endogamous caste and ethnic variation. Both castes and ethnic groups performed vocational roles in the Bamana state, and this differentiation increased with time.

The Maraka merchants developed towns focused first on desert side trade, and latter on large-scale agricultural production using captured slaves. The Jula specialised in long-distance trade, as did Fula communities within the state, who added this to cattle herding. The Bozo ethnicity were created largely out of war captives, and turned by the state to fishing and ferrying communities.

In addition to this, the Bamana maintained internal castes, like other Mandé peoples, with griots, priests, metalworkers, and other specialist vocations remaining endogamous and living in designated areas.

Formerly, like most other African societies, they also held slaves (called &quot;Jonw&quot;/&quot;Jong(o)&quot;), often war prisoners from lands surrounding their territory. With time, and the collapse of the Bamana state, these caste differences have eroded, though vocations have strong family and ethnic correlations.

===Religion===
Most Bamana today adhere to Islam, but many still practise the traditional rituals, especially in honoring ancestors. This form of syncretic Islam remains rare, even allowing for conversions that in many cases happened in the mid to late 19th century.

===Social structure===
Bamana share many aspects of broader Mandé social structure. Society is patrilineal and patriarchal. Mandé culture is known for its strong fraternal orders and sororities (&quot;Ton&quot;) and the history of the Bambara Empire strengthened and preserved these orders. The first state was born as a refashioning of hunting and youth &quot;Ton&quot;s into a warrior caste.

As conquests of their neighbors were successful, the state created the &quot;Jonton&quot; (&quot;Jon&quot; = slave/kjell-slave), or slave warrior caste, replenished by warriors captured in battle. While slaves were excluded from inheritance, the Jonton leaders forged a strong corporate identity. Their raids fed the Segu economy with goods and slaves for trade, and bonded agricultural laborers who were resettled by the state.

===Ton societies===
Bonnet ritual [[MHNT]]
The Bamana have continued in many places their tradition of caste and age group inauguration societies, known as the Tons. While this is common to most Mandé societies, the Ton tradition is especially strong in Bamana history. Tons can be by sex (initiation rites for young men and women), age (the earlier young men&#x27;s &quot;Soli&quot; ton living separately from the community and providing farm labor prior to taking wives), or vocation (the farming Chi Wara Ton or the hunters Donzo Ton). While these societies continue as ways of socialising and passing on traditions, their power and importance faded in the 20th century.

==Art==
The Bamana people adapted many artistic traditions. Artworks were created both for religious use and to define cultural and religious difference. Bamana artistic traditions include pottery, sculpture, weaving, iron figures, and masks. While the tourist and art market is the main destination of modern Bamana artworks, most artistic traditions had been part of sacred vocations, created as a display of religious beliefs and used in ritual.

Bamana forms of art include the &quot;n’tomo&quot; mask and the Tyi Warra. The &quot;n’tomo&quot; mask was used by dancers at male initiation ceremonies. The Tyi Warra (or &quot;ciwara&quot;) headdress was used at harvest time by young men chosen from the farmers association. Other Bamana statues include fertility statues, meant to be kept with the wife at all times to ensure fertility, and statues created for vocational groups such as hunters and farmers, often used as offering places by other groups after prosperous farming seasons or successful hunting parties.

<doc id="447719" wikidata="Q218280" url="?curid=447719" title="Maurice Gamelin">
<text>Maurice Gustave Gamelin (; 20 September 1872 – 18 April 1958) was a French general. He is remembered for his disastrous command (until 17 May 1940) of the French military during the Battle of France in World War II and his steadfast defence of republican values.

The Commander-in-chief of the French Armed Forces at the start of World War II, Gamelin was viewed as a man with significant intellectual ability. He was respected, even in Germany, for his intelligence and &quot;subtle mind&quot;, though he was viewed by some German generals as stiff and predictable. Despite this, and his competent service in World War I, his command of the French armies during the critical days of May 1940 proved to be disastrous. Historian and journalist William L. Shirer presented the view that Gamelin used World War I methods to fight World War II, but with less vigor and slower response.

Gamelin served with distinction under Joseph Joffre in World War I. He is often credited with being responsible for devising the outline of the French counter-attack in 1914 which led to victory during the First Battle of the Marne. In 1933 Gamelin rose to command the French Army and oversaw a modernisation and mechanisation programme, including the completion of the Maginot Line defences.

Édouard Daladier supported Gamelin throughout his career, owing to Gamelin&#x27;s refusal to allow politics to play a part in military planning and promotion, and his commitment to the republican model of government; this was not a trivial matter at a time when Communists on the left and Royalists and Fascists on the right were openly advocating regime change in France.

== Early years ==
Maurice Gamelin was born in Paris on 20 September 1872. Gamelin&#x27;s father, Zéphyrin, fought in the Battle of Solferino in 1859. From an early age Gamelin showed potential as a soldier, growing up in a generation seeking revenge on Germany for the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine at the end of the Franco-Prussian War.

== Military career ==
Gamelin volunteered for service on 19 October 1891 before entering the military academy at Saint-Cyr on 31 October. In 1893, he graduated first in his class.

He began in the French tirailleurs with the 3rd Regiment based in Tunisia. He then joined the topographic brigade. When Gamelin came back to Paris in 1897, he entered the prestigious &quot;École Supérieure de Guerre&quot; and finished second of his class of about eighty of the best future officers in the French Army. Charles Lanrezac, then second-in-command of the &quot;École Supérieure de Guerre&quot;, and later a general in the early days of World War I, noted Gamelin as an intelligent, cultivated, and industrious young officer, bound to earn higher functions in the future. Gamelin joined the staff of the 15th Army Corps before commanding a company of the 15th battalion of the &quot;Chasseurs Alpins&quot; in 1904. He received the applause of his superiors for his diligence at manœuvre.

He published &quot;Philosophical Study on the Art of War&quot; in 1906, which critics praised, predicting he would become an important military thinker in the near future. He then became an attaché to General Joseph Joffre (a future Marshal of France, as he led the French forces during World War I). This position had been obtained with the help of Ferdinand Foch (also a future Marshal of France, as he led the Allied Forces to victory on the Western Front in 1918). These positions provided Gamelin with a solid knowledge of strategic and tactical warfare.

In 1911, Gamelin was given command of the 11th battalion of the Chasseurs Alpins in Annecy. However, in March 1914 he joined Joffre&#x27;s general staff (1914–18 called &quot;Grand Quartier Général&quot;). Early in the war, Gamelin helped draft the plans that led to the victory at the Battle of the Marne. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and fought in Alsace on the Linge and later on the Somme. He became colonel in April 1916, and with good results on the battlefield was further promoted within eight months to the rank of brigadier general. He commanded the French 11th Infantry Division from April 1917 until the end of the war. In the region of Noyon, he showed sophisticated tactical skills by gaining ground without losing lives needlessly (which had been atypical earlier in the war, see &quot;Attaque à outrance&quot;).

From 1919 to 1924, Gamelin was the head of the French military mission in Brazil. He then commanded the French Army in the Levant, now Syria and Lebanon. He was the commander of the 30th Military Region in Nancy from 1919 to 1931, when he was named head of the general staff of the French Army. In 1932 he knew the Reichswehr mobilization plan was to at least treble their force, but lacked intelligence on the armament plan, the militia plan, or the Manstein Plan. He prepared France&#x27;s military until the beginning of World War II, although challenged by restricted funding (→ Great Depression in France) and by the political inertia regarding German re-armament and later the Third Reich, which was intensified after the end of the Allied occupation of the Rhineland and its remilitarisation. The foundation stone of France&#x27;s diplomacy was the alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. The French alliances in Eastern Europe were the defensive alliances signed with Poland in 1921, Czechoslovakia in 1924, Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927. At the time, the alliances were signed, the French occupied the Rhineland, which formed a natural defensive barrier with its hilly countryside and the wide Rhine river; beyond the Rhineland was the wide open North German plain. With the Rhineland occupied, the French were in a strong position to launch an offensive onto the north German plain. In 1928, the French agreed to end their occupation of the Rhine in June 1930, which was five years earlier than the Treaty of Versailles called for. Without the &quot;collateral&quot; of the Rhineland, France was less able to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which the Germans always made clear they did not accept, and in a tacit admission that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarised in the near-future, in 1929 the French decided to build the Maginot line along the Franco-German and Franco-Luxembourg borders. The defensive stance implied by the construction of the Maginot line contradicted with the promises of an offensive into western Germany should any of France&#x27;s Eastern European allies be attacked by the &quot;Reich&quot;.

Following the Rome accords signed by Pierre Laval and Benito Mussolini, Gamelin arrived in Rome in June 1935 to sign a convention with Marshal Pietro Badoglio, the chief of the Italian general staff. The convention called for an Italian corps of the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; to be stationed in the Belfort area in the event of an attack by Germany on France and for a French corps to go to north-eastern Italy to join the Italian forces on the Brenner Pass on the Austrian-Italian border. Gamelin saw the Rome convention as a possible means for French forces to reach France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe via Italy, and as a way to concentrate forces against Germany by transferring forces from the Franco-Italian border and from the border of French protectorate of Tunisia with the Italian colony of Libya. The Abyssinia crisis of 1935-1936 shattered Gamelin&#x27;s hopes for a Franco-Italian alliance as Britain insisted on having the League of Nations impose sanctions on Italy. Faced with a choice between Italy and Britain, Gamelin advised the government to chose Britain, saying that the help of Italy would be &quot;valuable&quot; to France, but the help of Britain would be &quot;essential&quot;. The French reluctantly joined the sanctions on Italy, which strained Franco-Italian relations through the French delegation in Geneva was able to prevent the League from imposing oil sanctions by threatening a veto. Badoglio, whom Gamelin was friendly with, sent him a series of telegrams saying he was still committed to an alliance with France and promised that he would resign rather than wage war on France.

When the &quot;Front populaire&quot; won the 1936 elections, Gamelin insisted upon a &quot;correct&quot; response to the election, saying that the Army was apolitical and was to respect the will of the voters, a policy that required considerable courage to enforce in the view of the right-wing views of much of the officer corps. The new premier, Léon Blum, had spoken of his wish to push military spending down to the lowest possible point, and the prospect of Blum becoming premier was greeted with a barely veiled dismay in the officer corps. Gamelin was very strict in applying his policy that officers were not to express their opinions of the new government. Gamelin&#x27;s policy of keeping the military out of politics was especially appreciated by the politicians in Paris as his predecessor, Maxime Weygand, a fiery right-wing Catholic had spoken on matters well outside of his purview. For an example, Weygand had suggested that France was being &quot;rotted out&quot; because too many schoolteachers were Socialists, and argued that the military should take charge of the education system to provide a &quot;proper patriotic education&quot; for the youth of France. By contrast Gamelin stated he as a soldier that he had no opinion about the education system. At his first meeting with Blum on 10 June 1936 at the Hôtel Matignon, Gamelin expressed his willingness to serve the new government while also arguing for greater defense spending. In private, Gamelin disliked Blum whom he called a &quot;bogus or sham intellectual&quot; while Blum said of Gamelin that he was &quot;intelligent, but limited. Despite expectations, Gamelin had an excellent working relationship with Édouard Daladier who served as the Defense minister under Blum. Gamelin submitted to Daladier a four year plan for military modernisation that was budgeted at 9 billion francs, which Daladier rejected it out of hand as too far low and added an extra 5 billion francs. In what was described as a highly &quot;emotional&quot; interview with Blum, Daladier was able to impress upon the premier the need to accept greater defense spending despite what he had promised during the election, and to accept the 14 billion franc plan.

The Remilitarisation of the Rhineland on 7 March 1936 allowed Germany to fortify the Franco-German border, which put an end to any realistic hope of a French offensive into western Germany as the Germans started to build what they called the West Wall and what was known in the English-speaking world as the Siegfried line. The remilitarisation of the Rhineland led to Gamelin to place increasingly emphasis on maintaining the French alliances in Eastern Europe as he argued that France could not mount an offensive while Germany could, thus requiring allies in Eastern Europe to distract the &quot;Reich&quot;. Gamelin argued that Germany&#x27;s population outnumbered the population of France, but if France&#x27;s eastern allies were included, the Allies would have a numerical superiority, leading him to argue that France needed a tighter alliance with Poland and must rebuild relations with Italy. For the same reason, Gamelin argued that on strategical grounds that France needed Italy as an ally, and argued that the ill will caused by the Abyssinia crisis should not be an issue in future Franco-Italian relations. A major issue for France was that Germany&#x27;s population was three times as larger, making France very dependent upon soldiers recruited in the Maghreb region to even the odds. In the First World War, 172,000 Algerians had fought for France, and a similar number was expected to be raised for another world war. To move troops from the Maghreb in turn required command of the western Mediterranean Sea, which could be challenged by the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; of Fascist Italy, whose foreign policy was becoming increasingly pro-German and anti-French. Admiral François Darlan advocated a naval construction programme designed to make the French Mediterranean Fleet the dominant fleet in that sea in order to end any possibility of the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; cutting the sea-lanes to Algeria. Gamelin was opposed to Darlan&#x27;s plans, arguing that it was better to seek a diplomatic rapprochement with Italy designed to win make Italy into a French ally rather than engage in a costly naval arms races with the Italians, which he noted would take away francs from the French Army. Daladier and Blum ignored Gamelin&#x27;s advice and embraced Darlan&#x27;s plans for a stronger Mediterranean fleet.

The Maginot line covered France&#x27;s borders with Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, but did not cover the Franco-Belgian border as Belgium was a French ally when the construction on the line started in 1930. The French general staff had always planned to move forces into Belgium in the event of war as it was widely expected that Germany would try to outflank the Maginot line by invading Belgium, as had the &quot;Reich&quot; had tried to outflank a series of forts in eastern France by invading Belgium in 1914. Gamelin had continued this tradition by planning for a &quot;forward defense&quot; in Belgium in the event of war. On 14 October 1936, King Leopold III declared his country&#x27;s neutrality and renounced the alliance with France. The end of the Franco-Belgian alliance was the end of Franco-Belgian staff talks, which complicated Gamelin&#x27;s efforts to plan for the expected German offensive into Belgium. The Popular Front government had just approved of a major programme to modernise the French Army by committing 14 billion francs, and Gamelin did not wish to antagonise Blum by asking for billions of more francs to extend the Maginot line along the Franco-Belgian border as he knew that Blum in his heart deeply disliked military spending.

Despite the end of the Franco-Belgian alliance, Gamelin was still committed to a &quot;forward defense&quot; in Belgium as the best way to defend France. Daladier personally favored extending the Maginot line along the Belgian border to create a &quot;fortress France&quot;, but the cost of doing so was daunting, namely 15 billion francs on top of the 7 billion francs that had already been spent building the Maginot line. The water-logged, low-lying lands between Cassel and Dunkerque would have been extremely expensive to extend the Maginot line into and likewise the same was true of the heavily industrialised area around Lille. Because of the nature of the land on the Franco-Belgian border, it would have been more expensive to extend the Maginot line along the Franco-Belgian than it was to build it along the Franco-German border despite the greater length of the Franco-German frontiers. Besides for the cost, Gamelin argued it would be cheaper and better to spend the money on modern tanks and artillery for a &quot;forward defense&quot; in Belgium. In his plans for a &quot;forward defense&quot;, Gamelin expected the main German blow to come on the flat, open plains of Belgium and saw the Ardennes forest as an area of secondary importance. In 1937, Gamelin wrote the &quot;experience of past wars&quot; showed &quot;the Ardennes has never favored [military] operations&quot;. The French defenses along the Meuse river area consisted of a series of blockhouses spread out over the countryside, and Gamelin assigned only second-class divisions to defend the Ardennes area.

In the winter of 1938–1939, Gamelin came into increasing conflict with the Foreign Minister, Georges Bonnet, who wanted to renounce the alliance with Poland. Gamelin insisted that the alliance with Poland brought France strategical benefits and contra Bonnet urged Daladier to &quot;restructure&quot; the Polish alliance to move Poland closer to France. Led by the Secretary-General at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, Alexis St. Leger, a number of French diplomats in direct defiance of Bonnet wanted to create an alliance designed to deter Germany from war that would consist of France, Great Britain, Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey. Daladier privately thought that the German claim to the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk) was a strong one, and the only reason why he backed the Polish position that there be no change in the status of the Free City was his desire to &quot;restructure&quot; the Franco-Polish alliance to bring it into part of a broader alliance system. The Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Józef Beck, was a man whom French decision-makers greatly disliked and distrusted, as Beck had the reputation of an opportunist who drove very hard bargains. Gamelin did not intend to launch an offensive into western Germany should the &quot;Reich&quot; invade Poland, but he encouraged Daladier&#x27;s line of standing by Poland during the Danzig crisis against Bonnet as he maintained that France needed the Polish alliance.

The same demographic weaknesses that made France dependent upon Algerian soldiers also made France dependent upon help from the United Kingdom in order to face the Wehrmacht on more even terms. Gamelin was very strongly opposed to the British limited liability doctrine, which governed British rearmament. The limited liability doctrine gave first priority in terms of defense funding to the Royal Air Force (RAF), second to the Royal Navy and third to the British Army. Gamelin stated that the British offer in late 1938 to send to France 2 British Army divisions along with 10 squadrons of RAF fighters was totally inadequate and would force the French Army to do the vast bulk of the fighting in a conflict with the &quot;Reich&quot;. Gamelin wrote to Daladier on 3 December 1938 that main issue was : &quot;whether France wishes to remain a great power, indeed whether or not she wants to succumb sooner or later to the Nazi yoke.&quot; Gamelin predicated that another war with Germany was inevitable and he planned to wage an &quot;extended war of attrition on which will hinge the whole world&#x27;s fate&quot;. To win against the &quot;Reich&quot;, Gamelin argued that he needed Britain to make what the British called the &quot;continental commitment&quot; (i.e. sent a large expeditionary force to France).&quot; The introduction of peacetime conscription in the United Kingdom along with a doubling in the size of the Territorial Army (the British reserves) in April 1939 offered up the prospect of the United Kingdom sending 33 divisions to France. The War Secretary, Leslie Hore-Belisha, tended to equate quantity with quality, and failed to understand that the long years of neglect caused by the limited liability doctrine left the British Army short of equipment and trainers for the proposed 33 division force. In his talks with Lord Gort, the chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in the spring and summer of 1939, Gamelin was far more concerned about what help the British Army could offer France in 1939 instead of waiting for 1941 when the &quot;big Belisha army&quot; was expected to be ready to be sent to France. Gamelin pressed Gort to send to France all of the forces in the United Kingdom, namely 5 divisions of British regulars plus four divisions from the Territorial Army. In his talks with Gamelin, Gort was acutely embarrassed by the relatively small number of British Army divisions to be committed against Germany as compared to the French Army, and as a result Gort was deferential to Gamelin whose forces under his command vastly outnumberd his own. 
Much of the French &quot;guerre de longue durée&quot; (&quot;war of the long duration&quot;) was based on the assumption that France would have a strong Eastern European ally, preferably the Soviet Union, to divert German forces east. After the German-Soviet non-aggression pact on 23 August 1939 shattered that assumption, and Gamelin fell back to an alternative eastern strategy of reviving the Salonika front. Gamelin gave orders for the &quot;Armée du Levant&quot; based in Syria to prepare to embark from Beirut to Thessaloniki on 25 August 1939 to open up an alternative eastern front in the Balkans. At the outbreak of the war in September 1939, Gamelin was considered one of the best commanding generals in Europe, and was respected even among the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

=== Role in the Second World War ===
When war was declared in 1939, Gamelin was France&#x27;s commander in chief, with his headquarters at the Château de Vincennes, a facility completely devoid of telephonic or any other electronic links to his commanders in the field: a massive oversight in the face of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s subsequent swift and flexible ‘Blitzkrieg’ tactics. France saw little action during the Phoney War, apart from a few French divisions crossing the German border in the Saar Offensive, who advanced a mere . They stopped even before reaching Germany&#x27;s unfinished Siegfried Line. According to General Siegfried Westphal, a German staff officer on the Western Front, if France had attacked in September 1939 German forces could not have held out for more than one or two weeks. Gamelin ordered his troops back behind the Maginot Line, but only after telling France&#x27;s ally, Poland, that France had broken the Siegfried Line and that help was on its way . Before the war, he had expected the Polish Army to hold out against Germany for six months. Gamelin&#x27;s long-term strategy was to wait until France had fully rearmed and for the British and French armies to build up their forces, even though this would mean waiting until 1941 . He prohibited any bombing of the industrial areas of the Ruhr, in case the Germans retaliated. A major problem for Gamelin was the weakness of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;air&quot;, most of whose fighter aircraft was known to be obsolete, which left France very exposed to Luftwaffe bombing attacks. Compounding the issue was that the Royal Air Force was known to have much more technologically sophisticated fighters capable of taking on the Luftwaffe, but the British assumed that the United Kingdom alone would be the object of a Luftwaffe strategical bombing offensive. In the fall of 1939, the RAF committed four squadrons of fighters and four squadrons of bombers to France, which remained under the direct control of the Air Ministry in London as even Lord Gort, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force had no say in the management of the RAF forces in France. The French mobilisation had called up many essential workers, which disrupted vital French industries in the first weeks of the campaign.

Gamelin was initially keen to open up a second front in the Balkans, and made extensive preparations to move the &quot;Armée du Levant&quot; to Greece in the first weeks of September 1939. However, at a meeting at the Supreme Allied Council on 22 September 1939, the French plan for a revived Salonika front met with fierce opposition from the British. Italy had unexpectedly declared neutrality instead of entering the war on the Axis side as widely assumed, and the British ministers at the Supreme Allied Council led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain argued an expedition to the Balkans (an area that Italy had designs upon) might lead to Italy entering the war after all. Gamelin also reserved himself on the new Salonika front for much the same reason, that he still had hopes of keeping Italy neutral. However, Maxime Weygand, the commander of the &quot;Armée du Levant&quot; for reasons that had much to do with his ego as strategy, insisted on pressing for a new Salonika front in the winter of 1939–1940, saying that he could land 4 or 5 divisions in Greece, which become the nucleus of a force of 15 divisions. Weygand won over Daladier to his viewpoint, and in November 1939 Daladier ordered Charles Corbin, the French ambassador in London, to start pressing for a landing in Thessaloniki. Gamelin was strongly opposed to the Daladier-Weygand plan for an expedition to the Balkans, which he called an unlimited commitment that would take divisions from the Western Front. Daladier, who very wanted to execute Weygand&#x27;s plans for a new Salonika front, complained in December 1939 that Gamelin&#x27;s advice &quot;resembled sand running through your fingers&quot;.

The case against &quot;la guerre de longue durée&quot; strategy was weakened in January 1940 by the reports from the &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; that the Wehrmacht had mustered 200 divisions compared to the 100 Anglo-French divisions stationed behind the Maginot line. Gamelin was forced to abandon plans to raise an additional 13 divisions owing to manpower shortages as he could not conscript so many men without crippling French war industry. At the same time, the effectiveness of the Anglo-French blockade of Germany was undercut by German-Soviet trade as the Soviet Union was self-sufficient in almost all of the natural resources needed to sustain a modern industrial economy, and by importing raw materials from the Soviet Union, the &quot;Reich&quot; was essentially blockade-proof. Admiral Darlan in particular started to press for France to take action, saying &quot;la guerre de longue durée&quot; strategy was not working. In the corridors of power, Darlan argued that France should under the pretext of aiding Finland in the Winter War cut Germany off from its supply of high-grade Swedish iron ore. Gamelin provided an opening about asking for a study from Darlan about how best to aid Finland, and instead received a memo saying that France needed to strike before Germany signed another economic agreement with the Soviet Union by cutting Germany from the Swedish iron ore. Darlan called for a joint Army-Navy expedition to seize the Petsamo province of Finland recently occupied by the Red Army even though it would almost mean war with the Soviet Union out of the hope of provoking German response, which would allow French forces to occupy northern Sweden, and hence deprive the &quot;Reich&quot; of its most important source of iron, which was the crucial element needed to manufacture steel. Gamelin was opposed to Darlan&#x27;s Scandinavian expedition, arguing that the best place for French manpower was in the defense of France, but by this point Daladier was clearly annoyed by what he perceived as Gamelin&#x27;s passive stance of waiting behind the Maginot line. Over Gamelin&#x27;s protests, Daladier accepted the Scandinavian expedition championed by Darlan. In January 1940, Daladier ordered Gamelin and Darlan to start preparing for three possible operations against the Soviet Union to be executed simultaneously, namely a naval campaign against Soviet tankers in the Black Sea, sponsoring an anti-Soviet revolt in the Caucasus where 90% of Soviet oil was produced; and the &quot;Baku project&quot; of bombing the Soviet oil fields in Baku and in the Caspian Sea. After being initially opposed to the &quot;Baku project&quot; of bombing the oil fields of Soviet Azerbaijan, Gamelin came around to support it in March 1940.

Gamelin&#x27;s vision for France&#x27;s defence was based upon a static defence along the Franco-German border, which was reinforced by the Maginot Line. However, the Line did not extend along the Belgian frontier. During the winter of 1939–40, which was one of the coldest of the 20th century, work on the extension of the Line along the Belgian frontier was slow and not of the same quality as the original defences. Gamelin, along with many other members of the French High Command, saw the Ardennes as impenetrable and chose to defend it with only ten reserve divisions and few fortifications. Much of the French army was posted further northwest along the Belgian frontier. According to General Hasso von Manteuffel, a German Panzer commander, France had more and better tanks than Germany, but chose to disperse them.

Gamelin had never assumed a purely defensive strategy relying on the Maginot Line as popularly depicted, and he always favored a forward defense in Belgium. French strategists predicted a German drive across northern Belgium, as in 1914. Gamelin favoured an aggressive advance northward to meet the attacking German forces in Belgium and the Netherlands, as far removed from French territory as possible. This strategy, known as the Dyle Plan, fitted with Belgian defensive plans and also with British objectives. Gamelin committed much of the motorised forces of the French Army and the entire British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to this strategy. Such a strategy also meant that most of the French Army would leave its defensive positions in northern France, which were prepared a year ago, to be committed to joining battle on an unknown Belgian defensive line.

Despite reports of the build-up of German forces, and even knowing the date of the planned German attack, Gamelin did nothing until May 1940, stating that he would &quot;await events&quot;. Then, when the Germans attacked, Gamelin insisted on moving 40 of his best divisions, including the BEF, northwards to conform to the Dyle Plan.

In the first few days of the Battle of Belgium, many Allied aircraft were attacked while still on the ground. The rest of the air support was concentrated on the French advance, rather than attacking the exposed column supplying the German advance. Quickly, the French and the British became fearful of being outflanked and they withdrew from the defensive lines drawn up across Belgium. They did not pull back fast enough to prevent them being outflanked by the German Panzer divisions.
The German wing that attacked further south was able to cross the River Meuse faster than anticipated, aided by heavy Luftwaffe aerial bombardment. Although almost all the crossings over the Meuse were destroyed by the French, one weir north of Sedan had been left intact and was only lightly defended. It was thus quickly captured and exploited by the Germans. Meanwhile, French guns were ordered to limit their firing in case they ran out of ammunition. German Colonel-General Heinz Guderian disregarded his orders, and attacked aggressively on this front. In response, Gamelin withdrew forces in this area so that they could defend Paris, thinking this was the Germans&#x27; objective, rather than the coast.

Believing that he had been betrayed rather than blaming his own strategy, Gamelin then sacked 20 of his front line commanders.

Further north, the German forces led by Major-General Erwin Rommel kept advancing quickly as well, also against orders. General Guderian&#x27;s 19th Panzer Corps south of Rommel reached the English Channel to the west of the Allied forces and attacked up the coast, enveloping the French and British forces that had been sent into Belgium. The French and English forces had retreated south but were cut off from escape by the German encirclement. In moving from France to Belgium and then back to France, a substantial amount of the Allied armour was lost due to German air attacks and mechanical failure. The French and British could no longer launch a counterattack spearheaded by tanks and thus break out of the encirclement. The speed of this advance, German air supremacy, and the inability of the British and French to counter-attack undermined the overall Allied position to such a degree that Britain abandoned the conflict on the continent. 338,226 men (including 120,000 French soldiers) withdrew across the English Channel during the Dunkirk evacuation. A second British Expeditionary Force, due to land in Normandy in mid-June, was cancelled.

The Dutch surrendered within five days of being attacked, the Belgians in 18 days (&quot;campagne des 18 jours&quot;), and the French were left with only a rump of their former army to defend their nation. Gamelin was removed from his post on 18 May 1940 by Paul Reynaud, who had replaced Édouard Daladier as Prime Minister in March. The 67-year-old Gamelin was replaced by the 73-year-old Maxime Weygand, who crucially delayed planned counter-attacks before eventually launching them.

=== After the Fall of France ===

Gamelin was both preceded and succeeded as Général d&#x27;armée by Maxime Weygand. The Vichy regime tried Gamelin for treason along with other important political and military figures of the Third Republic (Édouard Daladier, Guy La Chambre, Léon Blum, and Robert Jacomet) in the Riom Trial. Gamelin refused to answer the charges against him, instead maintaining silence, and the entire proceeding collapsed. Imprisoned by the Vichy regime in Fort du Portalet in the Pyrenees, he was later deported by the Germans to the Itter Castle in North Tyrol with a few other French high officials. He was freed from the castle after the Battle for Castle Itter. After the war, he published his memoirs, titled &quot;Servir&quot; (meaning &quot;to serve&quot;).

Gamelin died in Paris in April 1958 at the age of 85.

<text>Bemba, &quot;ChiBemba&quot; (also &quot;Cibemba, Ichibemba, Icibemba&quot; and &quot;Chiwemba&quot;), is a Bantu language spoken primarily in north-eastern Zambia by the Bemba people and as a lingua franca by about 18 related ethnic groups.

==History==

Bemba is one of the spoken languages in Zambia, spoken by many people who live in urban areas, and is one of Zambia&#x27;s seven recognized regional languages. Zambia&#x27;s first president, Kenneth Kaunda, though Malawian by descent, was raised in a Bemba-speaking community, and two of the four Zambian presidents since have been Bemba-speakers. The third president, Levy Mwanawasa, was a Lenje/Lamba, Lamba people from the Copperbelt Province and Lenje from central province, Lenjes belong to the Bantu Botatwe (“three people”) ethnic grouping that comprises the Tonga-Lenje-Ila peoples. The Fourth President, Rupiah Bwezani Banda was a Chewa from the Eastern Province. In the years after the MMD took power in 1991, it was accused numerous times of promoting Bemba over other regional languages in the country. Although the lingua franca of the Zambian capital Lusaka is a dialect of Bantu Botatwe.

==Dialects==

Bemba has several dialects, many being varieties of Bemba spoken by other tribes which have historically fallen under Bemba influence. They include Chishinga, Lomotwa, Ngoma, Nwesi, 
Lala, Luunda, Mukulu, Ng’umbo, and Unga, which is spoken by Twa pygmies and sometimes considered a separate language (Nurse 2003). The Twa of Bangweulu speak another dialect of Bemba.

==Phonology and orthography==



The orthographical system in common use, originally introduced by Edward Steere, is quite phonetic. Its letters, with their approximate phonetic values, are given below.

It has become increasingly common to use &#x27;c&#x27; in place of &#x27;ch&#x27;. In common with other Bantu languages, as affixes are added, combinations of vowels may contract and consonants may change. For example, &#x27;aa&#x27; changes to a long &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;ae&#x27; and &#x27;ai&#x27; change to &#x27;e&#x27;, and &#x27;ao&#x27; and &#x27;au&#x27; change to &#x27;o&#x27; (in other cases, a &#x27;y&#x27; is often used to separate other combinations of vowels). The nasal &#x27;n&#x27; changes to &#x27;m&#x27; before &#x27;b&#x27; or &#x27;p&#x27;, and is pronounced ŋ before &#x27;k&#x27; or &#x27;g&#x27;; after &#x27;n&#x27;, &#x27;l&#x27; changes to &#x27;d&#x27;. These rules will all be implicit in the tables given below.

Like many Bantu languages, Bemba is tonal, with two tones. However, tone has limited effect on meaning as the number of words that would otherwise be confused is small. Stress tends to fall on the prefix, when it exists, and can lead to subtle differences of meaning (see the verb forms below).

==Grammar==

Many of the main features of Bemba grammar are fairly typical of Bantu languages: it is agglutinative, depends mainly on prefixes, has a system of several noun classes, a large set of verbal aspects and tenses, very few actual adjectives, and, like English, has a word order that is subject-verb-object. Most of the classification here is taken from that given by Schoeffer, Sheane and Cornwallis.

===Nouns===
Bemba nouns are divided into several partially-semantic classes. They are indicated by their prefixes and are generally similar but not always identical to the &quot;concord prefixes&quot;, attached to verbs they govern, adjectives qualifying them, and pronouns standing for them. By one convention, based on the plural, they are arranged as follows (most alternate forms are caused by phonetic considerations):

The prefixes in class 9 essentially indicate case: &#x27;ku-&#x27; corresponds to &#x27;to&#x27; or &#x27;from&#x27;, &#x27;mu-&#x27; to &#x27;in&#x27;, &#x27;into&#x27;, or &#x27;out of&#x27;, and &#x27;pa-&#x27; to &#x27;at&#x27;.

===Adjectives===

As is common in Bantu languages, adjectives follow the words they qualify, and take the adjectival concord prefixes, but there are not many of them in the strictest sense. Adverbs, relative clauses, or &#x27;descriptors&#x27;, often fulfil their function instead. Descriptors are placed after the noun, with the particle &#x27;-a&#x27;, and the relevant pronoun prefix between them: &quot;chintu cha nomba&quot;, &#x27;new thing&#x27;.

===Numerals===

The numbers from 1 to 10 are:

The numerals 1-5 take adjectival concord prefixes (except for class 1 singular: &quot;muntu umo,&quot; &#x27;one person&#x27;). The numerals 6-10 are left unchanged. &#x27;Ikumi&#x27; has the plural &#x27;makumi&#x27;, which can be used as a noun with &#x27;na&#x27; (and, with) to form all numbers up to 99: for example, &quot;makumi yatatu na pabula&quot;, &#x27;thirty nine&#x27;. 100 is &#x27;mwanda&#x27;, with plural &#x27;myanda&#x27;.

===Pronouns===

The class-independent personal pronouns are: &#x27;ine&#x27; (1st person sg.), &#x27;iwe&#x27; (2nd person sg.), &#x27;ifwe&#x27; (1st person pl.), &#x27;imwe&#x27; (2nd person pl.). These are absolute, in the sense that they stand alone, and cannot appear as subjects or objects as they are. There are separate possessive pronouns, and the third person pronouns depend on class. There are also demonstrative pronouns, divided both by class and into three kinds by deixis (&#x27;this one, that one, and that one over there&#x27;), and relative pronouns are formed from these.

===Verbs===

Verbs have simple forms, usually ending in &#x27;-a&#x27; (everything before the &#x27;a&#x27; being the &#x27;stem&#x27;, &#x27;root&#x27; or &#x27;radical&#x27;), and are agglutinated according to person, number and class of subject and object, tense, mood, voice, aspect and whether they are affirmative or negative. Further, their stems change to indicate various other shades of meaning. The following rules can all be combined in a mostly straightforward manner, Bemba being agglutinative and not inflective, but there are still some exceptions.

====Subject and object prefixes====

The subject and object prefixes for the personal pronouns are given below. 
These can vary slightly according to mood, and the subject prefixes change for negative verbs. Where they are different, object prefixes are given in brackets.

The subject prefix is placed first, and then the object prefix. When the subject or object is a specific noun in a given class, the verbal concord prefix of this class is used, and the negative form adds the prefix &#x27;ta-&#x27; before this.

====Tenses and Aspects====

The classification given here is that presented by Schoeffer. 

Some of these require a modified stem, changing final &#x27;a&#x27; to &#x27;ile&#x27; if the preceding vowel is &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;i&#x27; or &#x27;u&#x27;, and to &#x27;ele&#x27; if it is &#x27;e&#x27; or &#x27;o&#x27;, or, if the last consonant is nasal, changing the &#x27;a&#x27; to &#x27;ine&#x27; or &#x27;ene&#x27; accordingly. There are irregularities in several verbs.

The tense prefixes are given below. They come after the subject and object prefixes, and before the verb stem, except for the recent, completed or historic past in &#x27;na-&#x27;, which appears at the very beginning. Stress is marked with an acute (´) accent.

====Moods====

The moods correspond closely to the Bantu norms.

=====Imperative=====
The simple singular imperative is identical to the &#x27;dictionary&#x27; form of the verb consisting of the stem and the suffix &#x27;-a&#x27;, changing to an &#x27;-e&#x27; if an object prefix is used - there is no subject prefix. The simple plural imperative changes &#x27;-a&#x27; to &#x27;-eni&#x27;. Prefixing &#x27;aku-&#x27; or &#x27;uka-&#x27;, adds a sense of instruction to resume or continue an action. An emphatic form can be given by using the subject pronoun prefix (generally of class 1) and following this by the prefix &#x27;-inda-&#x27;.

=====Subjunctive=====

The subjunctive is used hypothetically, as an indirect imperative, in exhortations, and in subordinate clauses, similarly but not identically to the subjunctive of many European languages. The common feature is a change of the final &#x27;-a&#x27; of the verb to &#x27;-e&#x27;. Its forms are given below. Here V stands for the verb stem, and P for any pronoun prefixes. The usual phonological rules apply.

The infinitive, strictly a verbal noun, has two forms. The simple form has prefix &#x27;ku-&#x27; added to the simple form, as mentioned above, and the habitual infinitive has prefix &#x27;kula-&#x27;.

====Voices====

The passive is formed by placing the suffix &#x27;-w-&#x27; before the last vowel of the verb, but it is not frequently used. A &#x27;neutral&#x27; voice can be formed by using &#x27;-ik-&#x27; instead if the preceding vowel is a, i or u, and &#x27;-ek-&#x27; if the preceding vowel is e or o. This form is differs in meaning from the passive in that it emphasises the state resulting from an action rather than the action itself (cf. English &#x27;the pot is broken&#x27;, as opposed to &#x27;the ball is kicked&#x27;).

====Negation====

Generally, the indicative prefixes &#x27;ta-&#x27; to the subject prefix except for the first person singular which changes to &#x27;nshi&#x27; or &#x27;shi&#x27;. Generally, the subjunctive adds &#x27;i&#x27; after the pronoun prefixes and in most cases changes a final &#x27;e&#x27; to &#x27;a&#x27;. The infinitive occasionally uses the negative &#x27;te&#x27;. However, the precise rules are more complex, and the forms depend more finely on tense, aspect and mood. When the negative is used with the imperfect &#x27;le&#x27;, it is often in the sense of action not yet done, and is referred to by Schoeffer as a separate &#x27;deferred tense&#x27;.

====Other forms====

There are several other verb forms which change the stem by adding an extra syllable before the final &#x27;a&#x27;. These are given below.

There are also several compound tenses, many using the copula &#x27;kuli&#x27; and &#x27;kuba&#x27;.

===Conjunctions===

These are used to introduce coordinating or subordinate clauses, similarly to their use in English.

==Basic phrases==

*ee - yes
*awe - no
*Uli shani? - how are you (informal)
*Muli shani? - how are you (formal)
*Shaleenipo - goodbye
*Ishina lyandi ni... - My name is...
*umuntu - person
*umunandi - friend
*umwana - child
*iciBemba - the Bemba language
*na - and, with
*nga - like, as
*suma (adj.) - good/beautiful
*onse (adj.) - all
*uluceelo (adj) - morning
* Natotela - Thank you
* Saana - A lot
* Natotela saana - Thanks a lot

== Literature ==
There is a sizeable amount of literature in Bemba. There are narratives, poems and plays. Some of the notable writers in Bemba include Stephen Mpashi, Chongo Kasonkomona, Chishimba, Paul Mushindo, Bwalya Chilangwa, Mwila Launshi and Kambole. 

A lot of the novels and narratives in Bemba were written between the period 1950 and 1980. Recently, very few creative works are published in Zambia mainly due to two reasons: the readership is generally poor and secondly, because of the first reason, publishers tend to hesitate to publish creative works in Bemba, especially novels of substantial length, for financial reasons due to the likely low levels of readership and thus profit. Instead, there are many short stories and novellas in Bemba literature.

Despite these hiccups, such as poor readership and lack of publishing, the quality of the works that are published in Bemba is often high. Moreover, there seem to be many talented writers who would like to write in this language but could not because of the reasons that have been given above and others that are related.

In terms of literary criticism, a lot of the works in Bemba have not been reviewed and critiqued. This is because there are very few literary critics in Bemba, though the interest is slowly growing. Some of these include Lutato and Shadreck Kondala, among others. Classic Bemba books include &quot;Uwauma Nafyala&quot;, &quot;Pano Calo&quot; and &quot;Imilimo ya bena Kale&quot;.

== Sample text ==
&quot;Abantu bonse bafyalwa abalubuka nokulingana mu mucinshi nensambu. Balikwata amano nokutontonkanya, eico bafwile ukulacita ifintu ku banabo mu mutima wa bwananyina.&quot;

Translation

<text>Witi Tame Ihimaera-Smiler (; born 7 February 1944) is a New Zealand author. Raised in the small town of Waituhi, he decided to become a writer as a teenager after being convinced that Māori people were ignored or mischaracterised in literature. He was the first Māori writer to publish a collection of short stories, with &quot;Pounamu, Pounamu&quot; (1972), and the first to publish a novel, with &quot;Tangi&quot; (1973). After his early works, he took a ten-year break from writing, during which he focused on editing an anthology of Māori writing in English.

From the late 1980s onwards, Ihimaera wrote prolifically. In his novels, plays, short stories and opera librettos, he examines contemporary Māori culture, legends and history, and the impacts of colonisation in New Zealand. He has said that &quot;Māori culture is the taonga, the treasure vault from which I source my inspiration&quot;. His 1987 novel &quot;The Whale Rider&quot; is his best-known work, read widely by children and adults both in New Zealand and overseas. It was adapted into the critically acclaimed 2002 film &quot;Whale Rider&quot; directed by Niki Caro. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot; (1996) was about a married man coming to terms with his homosexuality. In later works he has dealt with historical events such as the campaign of non-violent resistance at Parihaka in the late nineteenth century.

Ihimaera is an influential figure in New Zealand literature, and over his long career has won numerous awards and fellowships, including multiple awards for both fiction and non-fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards spanning the period 1973 to 2016, the Robert Burns Fellowship (1975), the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship (1993), and a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement (2017). Until 2010 he was the Professor of English and Distinguished Creative Fellow in Māori Literature at the University of Auckland. He has since published two volumes of his memoirs: &quot;Māori Boy: A Memoir of Childhood&quot; (2014) and &quot;Native Son: The Writer&#x27;s Memoir&quot; (2019).

==Early life and education==
Ihimaera was born in Gisborne, a city in the east of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island and is of Māori descent. His iwi (tribe) is Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki. He has affiliations to Ngāi Tūhoe, Te Whānau-ā-Apanui, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāi Tāmanuhiri, Rongowhakaata, Ngāti Porou, and Whakatōhea. He also has Scottish ancestry through both parents. His family marae is Te Rongopai Marae in Waituhi, and he grew up in Waituhi—many of his stories are set in a fictional recreation of the town. He began writing at a young age, and in later life recounted writing stories on the wall of his childhood bedroom.

He attended Te Karaka District High School for three years and the Church College of New Zealand in Temple View, Hamilton, for one year, after which he completed his final year of schooling at Gisborne Boys&#x27; High School. He has said that he became interested in becoming a writer when he was fifteen and realised that Māori did not feature in the books he read. His schoolteacher then instructed his class to read the short story &quot;The Whare&quot; by Pākehā writer Douglas Stewart, about a young man who encounters a Māori settlement. He found the story &quot;so poisonous&quot; that he threw the book out of the window and was caned for doing so. Writing about the incident in his 2014 memoir &quot;Māori Boy&quot;, he said:

After high school, Ihimaera attended the University of Auckland for three years, from 1963 to 1966, but did not complete his degree, and returned to Gisborne where he became a cadet journalist for the &quot;Gisborne Herald&quot;. He subsequently became a postman, moved to Wellington and started studying part-time at Victoria University of Wellington, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1971. He met librarian and student Jane Cleghorn at university, and they married in 1970.

==Career==
===Early career: 1960s and 1970s===
Ihimaera began writing seriously in 1969, around the age of 25, and had his first short story &quot;The Liar&quot; accepted for publication by the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; magazine in May 1970. Six of his stories were read by George Henare on Radio New Zealand in 1969. Ihimaera&#x27;s first book, &quot;Pounamu Pounamu&quot; (1972), was a collection of short stories, which was awarded third prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards in 1973. Ihimaera has said it was rejected by three publishers before being accepted by the fourth. His first two novels were published in quick succession: &quot;Tangi&quot; (1973), which won first prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards in 1974, and &quot;Whanau&quot; (1974), which told the story of a day in the life of a Māori village. He was the first Māori writer to publish a collection of short stories and the first to publish a novel.

Norman Kirk, then the prime minister of New Zealand, read &quot;Pounamu Pounamu&quot; and arranged for Ihimaera to be employed as a writer at the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1973. During his career he wrote a non-fiction booklet called &quot;Māori&quot; (1975), later adapted into a short film of the same name in 1981, although he felt the final film was a propaganda exercise that bore little resemblance to his written work. He subsequently worked as a diplomat with posts in Canberra, New York City, and Washington, D.C. In 1975 he was the recipient of the Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago, and in 1982 he received a Victoria University of Wellington writing fellowship.

Beginning in 1975, Ihimaera stopped his own creative writing for a ten-year period, due to his belief that it was &quot;tragically out of date&quot; and a wish not to have it seen as the &quot;definitive portrayal of the world of the Maori&quot;. He instead began working on the anthology &quot;Into the World of Light&quot; (1982), together with co-editor Don Long. The anthology collected the work of 39 Māori writers. In Ihimaera and Long&#x27;s introduction, they said that Māori oral tradition formed the context for Māori literature, and observed that the apparent lack of Māori writing in the mid-20th century was due to publishers&#x27; reluctance to publish books by Māori writers because of a belief that Māori &quot;don&#x27;t read books&quot;. The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; described the collected works as being &quot;of a uniformly high standard&quot;, and Graham Wiremu writing in the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; called the anthology &quot;prodigious and powerful&quot;.

===Return to writing: 1980s and 1990s===
When Ihimaera began writing again, he wrote &quot;The Matriarch&quot; (1986) which examined the impacts of European colonisation on Māori, and which again received first prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards. Not long after publication, it came to light that Ihimaera had used passages from the entry on Māori land in &quot;An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand&quot; (1966), written by Keith Sorrenson, without acknowledgement. Ihimaera apologised to Sorrenson at the time. Mark Williams later noted that the consequences for Ihimaera were minor, and he became a professor in the year of the book&#x27;s publication. He also wrote a libretto for an opera by Ross Harris, based on his second novel &quot;Whanau&quot;, and &quot;Dear Miss Mansfield&quot; (1989), a rewriting of Katherine Mansfield&#x27;s short stories from a Māori perspective, in response to celebrations of 100 years since her birth. The collection was well-received overseas but criticised by New Zealand reviewers for a perceived lack of respect for Mansfield.

In a three-week period Ihimaera wrote his best-known work &quot;The Whale Rider&quot; (1987), the story of a young girl becoming a leader of her people. It has been reprinted many times, read by both adults and children and was adapted into the critically acclaimed film of the same name in 2002. It won the Nielsen BookData New Zealand Booksellers&#x27; Choice Award in 2003. It was published and read internationally; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as a &quot;luminous joining of myth and contemporary culture&quot;.

In 1989, he left his job as a diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the following year he became a lecturer in the English department at the University of Auckland. He later became Professor of English and Distinguished Creative Fellow in Māori Literature, until 2010. He was awarded a Scholarship in Letters in 1991. In 1993 he received the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Fellowship which allowed him to work in Menton, France, for a period, where he wrote his next two novels: &quot;Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies&quot; (1994) and &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot; (1996). &quot;Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies&quot; was awarded the prize for Fiction at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards in 1995. It was described in &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; as &quot;a rollicking good yarn about Maori rural life in the 1950s&quot;, and Ihimaera himself has said he was intending to write a Māori Western. The novel was adapted into the 2016 film &quot;Mahana&quot; by Lee Tamahori (released as &quot;The Patriarch&quot; outside of New Zealand).

In 1996, he published &quot;Nights in the Gardens of Spain&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel about a man coming out. Like Ihimaera, the main character was married with two daughters, but unlike Ihimaera the main character was Pākehā (European). Ihimaera had accepted his sexuality in 1984 and began the work, but out of sensitivity to his daughters, did not finish or publish it then. The novel was described by scholar Roger Robinson as featuring &quot;conflict, growth and reconciliation, with subplots heroic, political and tragic&quot;. Robinson said it was &quot;no small achievement to take this material off the grubby walls of public toilets, free it from sleaze, write it with vivid passion and through it affirm and celebrate a way of life of which most of us know almost nothing&quot;. In a review for &quot;The Dominion Post&quot;, Gavin McLean described it as Ihimaera&#x27;s best book to date, and noted that much of the book&#x27;s impact came from the intensity of the main character&#x27;s relationship with his parents and his &quot;desperate need to do better by his children&quot;; &quot;Unlike characters in many similar novels, coming out does not mean discarding all one&#x27;s past.&quot; In 2010, it was adapted into the film &quot;Kawa&quot; by director Katie Wolfe. The central character was changed from Pākehā to Māori businessman Kawa, played by Calvin Tuteao. In an article in &quot;The Sunday Star Times&quot;, Ihimaera was quoted as saying the change &quot;was quite a shock to me because I had always tried to hide, to say &#x27;this is a book that could be about &quot;everyman&quot;, this is not a specific story&#x27;. So [the film] is now actually nearer to the truth than I would like to admit.&quot; After the publication of the novel, Ihimaera and his wife remained married, but no longer lived together.

A decade after his anthology &quot;Into the World of Light&quot; (1982), Ihimaera edited the five-volume bilingual anthology of Māori writing, &quot;Te Ao Marama&quot; (&quot;the world of light&quot;), published between 1992 and 1996. It represented the most comprehensive collection of writing by Māori writers that had been published at that time. In 1997 he published &quot;The Dream Swimmer&quot;, a sequel to his 1986 novel &quot;The Matriarch&quot;. That same year, &quot;Mataora, The Living Face: Contemporary Māori Artists&quot;, which he co-edited with Sandy Adsett and Cliff Whiting, received the Montana Award for Illustrative Arts at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards. His poem &quot;O numi tutelar&quot; was recited at the dawn opening of the British Museum&#x27;s long-awaited &#x27;Maori&#x27; Exhibition in 1998.

===Later career: 2000 onwards===

In the early 2000s Ihimaera published &quot;Woman Far Walking&quot; (2000), a play from the perspective of an elder Māori woman who has witnessed key historic events and who Ihimaera describes as the personification of the Treaty of Waitangi. He also published &quot;The Uncle&#x27;s Story&quot; (2000), a love story about two generations of gay Māori men, children&#x27;s picture book &quot;The Little Kowhai Tree&quot; (2002) (illustrated by Henry Campbell), and the novel &quot;Sky Dancer&quot; (2003), featuring Māori myths with contemporary characters. &quot;Sky Dancer&quot; was shortlisted for Best Book in the South Pacific &amp; South East Asian Region of the 2004 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. In 2004, he published &quot;Whanau II&quot;, which featured the characters of his second novel &quot;Whanau&quot; (1974), and which was subsequently published in London under the title &quot;Band of Angels&quot; (2005). His novella &quot;The Halcyon Summer&quot; was published in &quot;Nine New Zealand Novellas&quot; (2005), edited by Peter Simpson. &quot;The Rope of Man&quot; was published in 2005, which featured both a revised version of his first novel &quot;Tangi&quot; (1973) and a new sequel &quot;The Return&quot;. His short story collection &quot;Ask at the Posts of the House&quot; (2007) was longlisted for the Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award, and one of the novellas included in that collection was adapted into the 2013 film &quot;White Lies&quot;. In 2003, and again in 2009, Penguin New Zealand published &quot;His Best Stories&quot;, a collection of twenty-four stories selected by Ihimaera.

In 2009, Ihimaera published &quot;The Trowenna Sea&quot;, a novel about the early history of Tasmania. At the time, he planned to write a trilogy. Shortly after publication, book reviewer Jolisa Gracewood detected short passages from other writers, especially from historical sources, used without acknowledgement. Ihimaera apologised for not acknowledging the passages, said the omission was inadvertent and negligent, and pointed to many pages of other sources that he had acknowledged. The University of Auckland investigated the incident and ruled that Ihimaera&#x27;s actions did not constitute misconduct in research, as the actions did not appear to be deliberate and Ihimaera had apologised. Gracewood subsequently found additional passages that had been copied without explanation, and the book&#x27;s publisher Penguin Books removed the book from public sale. Ihimaera purchased the remaining stock himself. A revised edition, with fuller acknowledgements, originally planned for 2010, was subsequently cancelled, with no reasons given for the decision. Some literary commentators, such as Vincent O&#x27;Sullivan, C.K. Stead and Mark Williams, criticised the university&#x27;s response to the incident. Keith Sorrenson said that the events suggested Ihimaera had &quot;learnt nothing&quot; from his earlier plagiarism of Sorrenson&#x27;s work in &quot;The Matriarch&quot; (1986).

His twelfth novel, &quot;The Parihaka Woman&quot; (2011), featured elements of the opera &quot;Fidelio&quot; and the history of Parihaka and the campaign of non-violent resistance. Michael O&#x27;Leary, writing in the online edition of &quot;Landfall&quot;, called it an &quot;intriguing and significant, if somewhat flawed, work&quot;; he praised the novel&#x27;s efforts to tackle the horrific events at Parihaka in the late nineteenth century, and the demonstration of the rich cultural life of Māori in that period, but also noted some issues in the detail of Ihimaera&#x27;s use of Māori lore and in historical accuracies. Reviewers for the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot;, &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; were more negative, and all noted Ihimaera&#x27;s use of an amateur historian as narrator; they noted that this device allowed him to add numerous citations and references, and avoid any further accusations of plagiarism, but detracted from the quality of the writing. It was followed by the short-story collection &quot;The Thrill of Falling&quot; (2012), in which Ihimaera explored a range of genres including contemporary comedy and science fiction.

&quot;Māori Boy: A Memoir of Childhood&quot; (2014) was the first instalment of Ihimaera&#x27;s memoirs and recorded experiences from his childhood up till his teenage years. It received the award for General Non-Fiction at the 2016 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. The second instalment, &quot;Native Son: A Writer&#x27;s Memoir&quot; was published in 2019, and covers his early adult years in the 1960s and 1970s and how he became a published writer. After finishing &quot;Native Son&quot;, he decided to take a four-year break from writing, but ended up instead writing &quot;Navigating the Stars: Māori Creation Myths&quot; (2020), a modern re-telling of traditional Maori legends. 

In 2019, the play &quot;Witi&#x27;s Wāhine&quot; premiered at Te Tairāwhiti Arts Festival. Written by playwright Nancy Brunning, who died in the same year, the play is a tribute to female characters in Ihimaera&#x27;s works. Ihimaera wrote the script for a stage show adaptation of &quot;Navigating the Stars&quot;, produced by theatre company Taki Rua, which was performed at the Soundshell in the Wellington Botanic Garden in early 2021. In 2022, &quot;Pounamu Pounamu&quot; was re-issued by Penguin Random House with a new introduction by Ihimaera. In 2023, he edited an anthology of non-fiction Māori writing, &quot;Ngā Kupu Wero&quot;.

===Legacy===

Ihimaera has been recognised as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s leading indigenous writers&quot;. Literary scholar and Professor Emeritus at the University of Otago Alistair Fox in &quot;The Ship of Dreams: Masculinity in Contemporary New Zealand Fiction&quot; (2008) devotes four of the eleven chapters in the book to the writings of Ihimaera, indicating his importance within the context of New Zealand literature. Fox describes his epic novel &quot;The Matriarch&quot; as &quot;one of the major and most telling &#x27;monuments&#x27; of New Zealand&#x27;s cultural history in the late twentieth century as far as the situation of Māori in this postcolonial society is concerned&quot;, noting that Ihimaera &quot;has remained at the forefront of Māori arts and letters to an unprecedented degree, with an impressive output across a range of genres&quot;.

As part of the Auckland Arts Festival 2011, musician Charlotte Yates directed and produced the stage project &quot;Ihimaera&quot;, featuring Ihimaera&#x27;s lyrics about his life and works, and with performances by New Zealand musicians including Victoria Girling-Butcher, Paul Ubana Jones, Ruia Aperahama and Horomona Horo. Yates had previously created similar projects as tributes to New Zealand poets James K. Baxter and Hone Tuwhare, and chose Ihimaera for her third project because he was &quot;a writer with a huge body of work that I can give to a number of musicians for them to put their heart and soul to&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
In the 1986 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Ihimaera was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Service Medal for public services. In the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to literature. In 2009, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, he declined redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

In 2004, Ihimaera received an honorary doctorate from Victoria University of Wellington. In the same year, he undertook a residency in world literature at George Washington University, funded by Fulbright New Zealand. In 2009 he was one of five recipients of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Laureate Award, for which he received 50,000. In the same year he received the prestigious Māori arts award Te Tohutiketike a Te Waka Toi at the 2009 Creative New Zealand Te Waka Toi Awards. The award is made to artists who are &quot;exemplary in their chosen field of artistic endeavour&quot;. On receiving the award, Ihimaera said it was a recognition of his iwi: &quot;Without them, I would have nothing to write about and there would be no Ihimaera. So this award is for all those ancestors who have made us all the people we are. It is also for the generations to come, to show them that even when you aren&#x27;t looking, destiny has a job for you to do.&quot;

In 2017, Ihimaera was awarded a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement. The selection panel described him &quot;as one of New Zealand&#x27;s most important post-colonial writers, who has consistently proved to be an outstanding storyteller, celebrated as a voice for Māoritanga and a literary leader&quot;. In the same year, he was appointed a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; on Bastille Day by the French government for his &quot;pivotal role in bringing Maori storytelling to the forefront and enabling its international recognition as a taonga from New Zealand&quot;. In 2024, he was elected as a Royal Society of Literature International Writer.

<text>The Nashville warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla) is a small songbird in the New World warbler family, found in North and Central America. It breeds in parts of the northern and western United States and southern Canada, and migrates to winter in southern California and Texas, Mexico, and the north of Central America. It has a gray head and a green back, and its underparts are yellow and white.
== Description ==
The Nashville warbler is a small warbler. Both male and female Nashville warblers have a gray head fading into a greenish back and wings, a white belly and a yellow throat and breast. They have a complete white eye ring, no wing bars, and a thin pointed black bill. Adult males have a rusty brown patch on their crown, which is usually hard to see and often covered by gray feathers. Males will raise it slightly when agitated. Females and immature birds have a duller olive-grey head, and less bold yellow on their throat. The Nashville warbler is closely related to Virginia&#x27;s warbler, Lucy&#x27;s warbler, and the Colima warbler, the four sharing generally similar plumage.

* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Call==
The song of the nominate subspecies consists of a rapid &#x27;. Males sing from open perches on the nesting territory. The call sounds like a high &#x27;. Western birds of the race &quot;ridgwayi&quot; have a slightly lower-pitched, richer song, and a sharper call note.

== Taxonomy ==
The Nashville warbler was originally described as &quot;Sylvia ruficapilla&quot; by Alexander Wilson in 1811, using a name which had already been used by John Latham, but not in a valid description according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Possibly unintentionally, Wilson spelled its name as &quot;Sylvia rubricapilla&quot; in a later volume in 1812, and this spelling was once commonly used. The genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; is now restricted to Old World species of the family Sylviidae, unrelated to species such as the Nashville warbler, that are classified in the New World warbler family Parulidae. Until recently, most taxonomies have put this species in the genus &quot;Vermivora&quot;. However, this species forms a clade with several related species classed in &quot;Vermivora&quot;, such as the Tennessee warbler and Lucy&#x27;s warbler, which are more closely related to the flame-throated warbler and crescent-chested warbler than to other species of &quot;Vermivora&quot;. They were classified in the genus &quot;Oreothlypis&quot; along with the flame-throated and crescent-chested warblers, although the new genus &quot;Leiothlypis&quot; was initially proposed for the Nashville warbler and allies, excluding the latter two species.

Two subspecies exist, with discrete breeding ranges. The nominate subspecies, &quot;L. r. ruficapilla&quot;, breeds in northeastern North America. The other subspecies, &quot;L. r. ridgwayi&quot;, known as the Calaveras warbler, nests in western North America. The latter differs from the former in its relatively duller plumage and more persistent tail movements.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Nashville warblers breed in two distinct areas, one in Canada and the northeastern United States, and another in the western United States. The northeastern part of its range extends from Côte-Nord and Cape Breton Island in eastern Canada to central Alberta. For the most part, it only breeds between about 52 and 45.5 degrees north, but it is also found less commonly in the Appalachians of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Although named after Nashville, Tennessee, the Nashville warbler only visits that area during migration. They migrate to southernmost Texas and California, mid-Mexico, and the northernmost parts of Central America (Guatemala and El Salvador) in winter. In their breeding range, they prefer open mixed woods and bog habitats.

== Behavior ==

Nashville warblers forage by gleaning in the lower parts of trees and shrubs, frequently flicking their tails. In winter, they join together into loose flocks, and sometimes join mixed-species feeding flocks. These birds mainly eat insects, but will supplement this diet with berries and nectar in the winter.

Nashville warblers conceal their nests on the ground under shrubs. Nests are open cups built out of bark strips, leaves, and moss, and are lined with fine materials such as feathers or hairs. Typically, four or five eggs are laid in a clutch, and incubated for 11–12 days. Only the female incubates the eggs, though the male brings her food. On hatching, the young have no feathers apart from some brown down, and their eyes are closed. Juveniles fledge and leave the nest 11 days after hatching.

There is a single record of hybridization with the Tennessee warbler.

<text>Unified Silla, or Late Silla, is the name often applied to the historical period of the Korean kingdom of Silla after its conquest of Goguryeo in 668 AD, which marked the end of the Three Kingdoms period. In the 7th century, a Silla–Tang alliance conquered Baekje in the Baekje–Tang War. Following the Goguryeo–Tang War and Silla–Tang War in the 7th century, Silla annexed the southern part of Goguryeo, unifying the central and southern regions of the Korean peninsula.

Unified Silla existed during the Northern and Southern States period at a time when Balhae controlled the north of the peninsula. Unified Silla lasted for 267 years until it fell to Goryeo in 935 during the reign of King Gyeongsun.

==Terminology==
The people of the Unified Silla period considered themselves to be of a kingdom of unified Koreans, which they called , (Modern Hangul: , ) meaning the unity of three kingdoms (the three kingdoms being Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje). The term was used by general Kim Yu-sin, credited with leading many of the military campaigns to unify the Korean peninsula under Silla, in a letter he wrote to King Munmu as he lay dying. King Munmu is considered to have been the first ruler of the Unified Silla period, and subsequent kings continued to hold the perception of a unified Silla, as evidenced by King Sinmun&#x27;s installment of &quot;nine counties&quot; () and &quot;nine legions&quot; (). In the ancient Sinosphere, the number nine connoted great things, and ancient China was composed of nine counties as well, so the term &quot;九州&quot; was used as a synonym for the entirety of China, as well as for &quot;all under heaven&quot; (). In addition, Silla gave noble ranks to the nobles of Goguryeo and Baekje as a token of unification.

North Korean historians criticize the idea of &quot;Unified Silla&quot; as from their perspective, Goryeo was the first state to unify the Korean people as Silla failed to conquer parts of Goguryeo and Balhae in the northeast of the Korean peninsula. Because of this, North Korean historians use the term &quot;Late Silla&quot; () where South Korean historians would use &quot;Unified Silla&quot;.

==History==

In 660, King Munmu ordered his armies to attack Baekje. General Kim Yu-sin, aided by Tang forces, defeated General Gyebaek and conquered Baekje. In 661, he moved on Goguryeo but was repelled. Silla then fought against the Tang dynasty for nearly a decade.

During its heyday, the country contested with Balhae, a Goguryeo–Mohe kingdom, to the north for supremacy in the region. Throughout its existence, Unified Silla was plagued by intrigue and political turmoil in its newly conquered northern territory, caused by the rebel groups and factions in Baekje and Goguryeo, which eventually led to the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.

Gyeongju remained the capital of Silla throughout the whole existence of the dynasty, which demonstrates the power of the governmental system employed in Silla. By using the “Bone Clan Class” system, a small group of powerful people (the &#x27;bone clan&#x27;) was able to rule over a large number of subjects. To maintain this rule over a large number of people for an extensive period of time, it was important for the government to keep the unity of the bone-rank system and hold the governed subjects in a low social status.

Despite its political instability, Unified Silla was a prosperous country, and its metropolitan capital of Seorabeol (present-day Gyeongju) was the fourth-largest city in the world at the time. Through close ties maintained with the Tang dynasty, Buddhism and Confucianism became the principal philosophical ideologies of the elite as well as the mainstays of the period&#x27;s architecture and fine arts. Its last king, Gyeongsun, ruled over the state in name only and submitted to Wang Geon of the emerging Goryeo in 935, bringing the Silla dynasty to an end.

==Government==
===Regional administration===
==Culture==
Unified Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River.

Unified Silla was a golden age of art and culture, as evidenced by the Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and Emille Bell. Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism, including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.

Unified Silla and the Tang maintained close ties. This was evidenced by the continual importation of Chinese culture. Many Korean monks went to China to learn about Buddhism. The monk Hyecho went to India to study Buddhism and wrote an account of his travels. Different new sects of Buddhism were introduced by these traveling monks who had studied abroad such as Seon and Pure Land Buddhism.

Unified Silla conducted a census of all towns&#x27; size and population, as well as horses, cows and special products and recorded the data in &quot;Minjeongmunseo&quot; (민정문서). The reporting was done by the leader of each town.

A national Confucian college was established in 682 and around 750 it was renamed the National Confucian University. The university was restricted to the elite aristocracy. However, in Silla society, because the bone-rank system was used for the election of officials rather than the imperial examination process that was used in Confucianism, the National Confucian University did not have great appeal to the nobility class of Silla.

Silla was very scientifically and technologically advanced for the time. There was an emphasis put on astrology especially as it was closely tied to agriculture. This allowed them to accurately record events such as solar eclipses and lunar eclipses.

===Woodblock printing===
Woodblock printing was used to disseminate Buddhist sutras and Confucian works. During a refurbishment of the &quot;Pagoda That Casts No Shadows&quot;, an ancient print of a Buddhist sutra was discovered. The print is dated to 751 CE and is one of the oldest discovered printed material in the world.

<text>An air embolism, also known as a gas embolism, is a blood vessel blockage caused by one or more bubbles of air or other gas in the circulatory system. Air can be introduced into the circulation during surgical procedures, lung over-expansion injury, decompression, and a few other causes. In flora, air embolisms may also occur in the xylem of vascular plants, especially when suffering from water stress.

Divers can develop &quot;arterial&quot; gas embolisms as a consequence of lung over-expansion injuries. Breathing gas introduced into the venous system of the lungs due to pulmonary barotrauma will not be trapped in the alveolar capillaries, and will consequently be circulated to the rest of the body through the systemic arteries, with a high risk of embolism. Inert gas bubbles arising from decompression are generally formed in the &quot;venous&quot; side of the systemic circulation, where inert gas concentrations are highest, these bubbles are generally trapped in the capillaries of the lungs where they will usually be eliminated without causing symptoms. If they are shunted to the systemic circulation through a patent foramen ovale they can travel to and lodge in the brain where they can cause stroke, the coronary capillaries where they can cause myocardial ischaemia or other tissues, where the consequences are usually less critical. The first aid treatment is to administer oxygen at the highest practicable concentration, treat for shock and transport to a hospital where therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are the definitive treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==

===In surgery===
Symptoms include:
* Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure)
* Shortness of breath

===In divers===
Symptoms of arterial gas embolism include:
* Loss of consciousness
* Cessation of breathing
* Vertigo
* Convulsions
* Tremors
* Loss of coordination
* Loss of control of bodily functions
* Numbness
* Paralysis
* Extreme fatigue
* Weakness in the extremities
* Areas of abnormal sensation
* Visual abnormalities
* Hearing abnormalities
* Personality changes
* Cognitive impairment
* Nausea or vomiting
* Bloody sputum
* Symptoms of other consequences of lung overexpansion such as pneumothorax, subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema may also be present.

==Causes==

===Interventional procedures===
Interventional radiology procedures, cardiac, and neurosurgical procedures can predispose to air embolism. Besides, increasing use of pump injectors for contrast delivery, and percutaneous intervention to the lungs also increases the risk of air embolism.

===Decompression illness===

Gas embolism is a diving disorder experienced by underwater divers who breathe gases at ambient pressure, and can happen in two distinct ways:
* Pulmonary barotrauma: Air bubbles can enter the bloodstream as a result of gross trauma to the lining of the lung following a rapid ascent while holding the breath; the air held within the lung expands to the point where the tissues tear (pulmonary barotrauma). This is easy to do as the lungs give little warning through pain until they do burst. The diver will usually arrive at the surface in pain and distress and may froth or spit blood. A pulmonary barotrauma is usually obvious and may present quite differently from decompression sickness.
* Decompression sickness: Inert gas bubbles form in the bloodstream if the gas dissolved in the blood under pressure during the dive is not allowed sufficient time to be eliminated in solution on ascent. The symptoms may be subtle and not immediately noticeable, and may develop for some time after surfacing.

===Ventilator induced pulmonary barotrauma===
Trauma to the lung can also cause an air embolism. This may happen after a patient is placed on a ventilator and air is forced into an injured vein or artery, causing sudden death. Breath-holding while ascending from scuba diving may also force lung air into pulmonary arteries or veins in a similar manner, due to the pressure difference.

===Direct injection===
Air can be injected directly into a vein or artery accidentally during clinical procedures. Misuse of a syringe to meticulously remove air from the vascular tubing of a hemodialysis circuit can allow air into the vascular system. Venous air embolism is a rare complication of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures requiring catheterization of a vein or artery. If a significant embolism occurs, the cardiovascular, pulmonary, or central nervous system may be affected. Interventions to remove or mitigate the embolism may include procedures to reduce bubble size, or withdrawal of air from the right atrium.

The lethal dose for humans is considered theoretically between 3 and 5 ml per kg. It is estimated that 300-500 ml of gas introduced at a rate of 100 ml per sec would prove fatal.

==Mechanism==

Air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists favoring entry of gas. Because the circulatory pressure in most arteries and veins is greater than atmospheric pressure, an air embolus does not often happen when a blood vessel is injured. In the veins above the heart, such as in the head and neck, the venous pressure may be less than atmospheric and an injury may let air in. This is one reason why surgeons must be particularly careful when operating on the brain, and why the head of the bed is tilted down when inserting or removing a central venous catheter from the jugular or subclavian veins. 

When air enters the veins, it travels to the right side of the heart, and then to the lungs. This can cause the vessels of the lung to constrict, raising the pressure in the right side of the heart. If the pressure rises high enough in a patient who is one of the 20% to 30% of the population with a patent foramen ovale, the gas bubble can then travel to the left side of the heart, and on to the brain or coronary arteries. Such bubbles are responsible for the most serious of gas embolic symptoms.

Venous or pulmonary air embolism occurs when air enters the systemic veins and is transported to the right side of the heart and from there into the pulmonary arteries, where it may lodge, blocking or reducing blood flow. Gas in the venous circulation can cause cardiac problems by obstructing the pulmonary circulation or forming an air-lock which raises central venous pressure and reduces pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures. Experiments on animals show that the amount of gas necessary for this to happen is quite variable. Human case reports suggest that injecting more than 100 mL of air into the venous system at rates greater than 100 mL/s can be fatal. Very large and symptomatic amounts of venous air emboli may also occur in rapid decompression in severe diving or decompression accidents, where they may interfere with circulation in the lungs and result in respiratory distress and hypoxia.

Gas embolism in a systemic artery, termed &quot;arterial gas embolism&quot; (&quot;AGE&quot;), is a more serious matter than in a vein, because a gas bubble in an artery may directly stop blood flow to an area fed by the artery. The symptoms of &#x27;AGE&#x27; depend on the area of blood flow, and may be those of stroke for a cerebral arterial gas embolism (CAGE) or heart attack if the heart is affected. The amount of arterial gas embolism that causes symptoms depends on location — 2 mL of air in the cerebral circulation can be fatal, while 0.5 mL of air into a coronary artery can cause cardiac arrest.

===Prevention and screening===
If a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is suspected, an examination by echocardiography may be performed to diagnose the defect. In this test, very fine bubbles are introduced into a patient&#x27;s vein by agitating saline in a syringe to produce the bubbles, then injecting them into an arm vein. A few seconds later, these bubbles may be clearly seen in the ultrasound image, as they travel through the patient&#x27;s right atrium and ventricle. At this time, bubbles may be observed directly crossing a septal defect, or else a patent foramen ovale may be opened temporarily by asking the patient to perform the Valsalva maneuver while the bubbles are crossing through the right heart – an action which will open the foramen flap and show bubbles passing into the left heart. Such bubbles are too small to cause harm in the test, but such a diagnosis may alert the patient to possible problems which may occur from larger bubbles, formed during activities like underwater diving, where bubbles may grow during decompression. A PFO test may be recommended for divers intending to expose themselves to relatively high decompression stress in deep technical diving.

==Diagnosis==
As a general rule, any diver who has breathed gas under pressure at any depth who surfaces unconscious, loses consciousness soon after surfacing, or displays neurological symptoms within about 10 minutes of surfacing should be assumed to be experiencing arterial gas embolism.

Symptoms of arterial gas embolism may be present but masked by environmental effects such as hypothermia, or pain from other obvious causes. Neurological examination is recommended when there is suspicion of lung overexpansion injury. Symptoms of decompression sickness may be very similar to, and confused with, symptoms of arterial gas embolism, however, treatment is basically the same. Discrimination between gas embolism and decompression sickness may be difficult for injured divers, and both may occur simultaneously. Dive history may eliminate decompression sickness in many cases, and the presence of symptoms of other lung overexpansion injury would raise the probability of gas embolism.

==Treatment==
A large bubble of air in the heart (as can follow certain traumas in which air freely gains access to large veins) will present with a constant &quot;machinery&quot; murmur. It is important to promptly place the patient in Trendelenburg position (head down) and on their left side (left lateral decubitus position). The Trendelendburg position keeps a left-ventricular air bubble away from the coronary artery ostia (which are near the aortic valve) so that air bubbles do not enter and cause a myocardial infarction by blocking the coronary arteries. Left lateral decubitus positioning helps to trap air in the non-dependent segment of the right ventricle (where it is more likely to remain instead of progressing into the pulmonary artery and occluding it). The left lateral decubitus position also prevents the air from passing through a potentially patent foramen ovale (present in as many as 30% of adults) and entering the left ventricle, from which it could then embolise to distal arteries (potentially causing occlusive symptoms such as stroke).

Administration of high percentage oxygen is recommended for both venous and arterial air embolism. This is intended to counteract ischaemia and accelerate bubble size reduction.

For venous air embolism the Trendelenburg or left lateral positioning of a patient with an air-lock obstruction of the right ventricle may move the air bubble in the ventricle and allow blood flow under the bubble.

Hyperbaric therapy with 100% oxygen is recommended for patients presenting clinical features of arterial air embolism, as it accelerates removal of nitrogen from the bubbles by solution and improves tissue oxygenation. This is recommended particularly for cases of cardiopulmonary or neurological involvement. Early treatment has greatest benefits, but it can be effective as late as 30 hours after the injury.

===Treatment of divers===

Oxygen first aid treatment is useful for suspected gas embolism casualties or divers who have made fast ascents or missed decompression stops. Most fully closed-circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and could be used as an alternative to pure open-circuit oxygen resuscitators. However pure oxygen from an oxygen cylinder through a Non-rebreather mask is the optimal way to deliver oxygen to a decompression illness patient.

Recompression is the most effective, though slow, treatment of gas embolism in divers. Normally this is carried out in a recompression chamber. As pressure increases, the solubility of a gas increases, which reduces bubble size by accelerating absorption of the gas into the surrounding blood and tissues. Additionally, the volumes of the gas bubbles decrease in inverse proportion to the ambient pressure as described by Boyle&#x27;s law. In the hyperbaric chamber the patient may breathe 100% oxygen, at ambient pressures up to a depth equivalent of 18 msw. Under hyperbaric conditions, oxygen diffuses into the bubbles, displacing the nitrogen from the bubble and into solution in the blood. Oxygen bubbles are more easily tolerated. Diffusion of oxygen into the blood and tissues under hyperbaric conditions supports areas of the body which are deprived of blood flow when arteries are blocked by gas bubbles. This helps to reduce ischemic injury. The effects of hyperbaric oxygen also counteract the damage that can occur with reperfusion of previously ischemic areas; this damage is mediated by leukocytes (a type of white blood cell).

===Complications===
High incidence of relapse after hyperbaric oxygen treatment due to delayed cerebral edema.

==Epidemiology==
In terms of the epidemiology of air embolisms one finds that the &quot;intraoperative&quot; period to have the highest incidence. For example, VAE (vascular air embolism) in neurological cases ranges up to 80%, and OBGYN surgeries incidence can climb to 97% for VAE. In divers the incidence rate is 7/100,000 per dive.

== In society and culture ==
Direct injection air embolism was one of the methods used by Belgian murderer Ivo Poppe to kill some of his victims (the other method being valium).

William Davis, formerly a nurse in Texas, was convicted in October 2021 of murdering four and injuring two patients by injecting air into their arterial lines following heart surgery. During opening arguments for sentencing, prosecutors told the court that they would present evidence of an additional three murders and three attempted murders.

Dorothy L. Sayers made use of direct injection air embolism as a murder method in her 1927 Lord Peter Wimsey mystery novel &quot;Unnatural Death&quot; (published in the US in 1928 as &quot;The Dawson Pedigree&quot;), although her description was subsequently criticised as implausible on account of the injection site and volume.

Air embolism was the method used by an insane nurse to euthanize seven terminally ill patients in the episode &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; of the TV series &quot;Shadow Chasers&quot;.

Near the end of young adult novel &quot;Catching Fire&quot;, as well as its film adaptation, protagonist Katniss Everdeen grabs a syringe and fills it with air, with the intention of killing Peeta Mellark quickly via air embolism.

==In plants==
Air embolisms generally occur in the xylem of vascular plants because a fall in hydraulic pressure results in cavitation. Falling hydraulic pressure occurs as a result of water stress or physical damage.

A number of physiological adaptations serve to prevent cavitation and to recover from it. The cavitation may be prevented from spreading by the narrow pores in the walls between vessel elements. The plant xylem sap may be able to detour around the cavitation through interconnections. Water loss may be reduced by closing off leaf stomata to reduce transpiration, or some plants produce positive xylem pressure from the roots. When xylem pressure increases, the cavitation gases may redissolve.

<doc id="447742" wikidata="Q56421" url="?curid=447742" title="Hopi language">
<text>Hopi (Hopi: ) is a Uto-Aztecan language spoken by the Hopi people (a Puebloan group) of northeastern Arizona, United States.

The use of Hopi has gradually declined over the course of the 20th century. In 1990, it was estimated that more than 5,000 people could speak Hopi as a native language (approximately 75% of the population), but only 40 of them were monolingual in Hopi. The 1998 language survey of 200 Hopi people showed that 100% of Hopi elders (60 years or older) were fluent, but fluency in adults (40–59) was only 84%, 50% in young adults (20–39), and 5% in children (2–19).

Despite the apparent decline, Hopi and Navajo both are supported by bilingual education programs in Arizona, and children acquire the Native American languages as their first language. More recently, Hopi language programs for children on the reservation have been implemented.

== Teaching and language revitalization efforts ==

Many Hopi children are being raised in the language. A comprehensive Hopi-English dictionary edited by Emory Sekaquaptewa and others has been published, and a group, the Hopi Literacy Project, has focused its attention on promoting the language. As of 2013, &quot;a pilot language revitalization project, the Hopi Lavayi Nest Model Program, for families with children birth through 5,&quot; is being planned for the village of Sipaulovi.

In 2004, Mesa Media, a nonprofit organization, was created to help revitalize the language.

Since 2019, more recent Hopi language revitalization programs have been reported, involving language immersion for children.

== Language variation ==

Benjamin Whorf identifies four varieties (dialects) of Hopi:
* &quot;First Mesa&quot; (or Whorf&#x27;s &quot;Polacca&quot;)
* &quot;Mishongnovi&quot; (or Whorf&#x27;s &quot;Toreva&quot;)
* &quot;Shipaulovi&quot; (or Whorf&#x27;s &quot;Sipaulovi&quot;)
* &quot;Third Mesa&quot; (or Whorf&#x27;s &quot;Oraibi&quot;)

First Mesa is spoken on First Mesa (which is the eastern mesa) in Polacca village in Walpi pueblo and in other neighboring communities. A community of Arizona Tewa live on First Mesa, and its members speak Tewa, in addition to a variety of Hopi and English and Spanish.

Mishongnovi is spoken on Second Mesa (which is the central mesa) in Mishongnovi village. Mishongnovi has few speakers compared to First and Third Mesa dialects. Shipaulovi is also spoken on Second Mesa in Shipaulovi village, which is close to Mishongnovi village. Whorf notes that other villages on Second Mesa are of unknown dialectal affiliation.

An introductory textbook () has been written by a Shongopavi speaker. Shongopavi is another village on the Second Mesa, but its relation to other dialects has not been analyzed. The Third Mesa dialect is spoken on Third Mesa (which is the western mesa) at Oraibi village and in neighboring communities, as well as in Moenkopi village, which lies off Third Mesa and at a distance west of it.

The first published analysis of the Hopi language is Benjamin Whorf&#x27;s study of Mishongnovi Hopi. His work was based primarily on a single off-reservation informant, but it was later checked by other reservation speakers. In his study, he states that Mishongnovi is the most archaic and phonemically complex of the dialects. The Third Mesa dialect preserves some older relics that have been lost in Mishongnovi.

 reports that Third Mesa speakers of younger generations have lost the labialization feature of &quot;w&quot; on the different subject subordinator &quot;-qw&quot; after the vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;u&quot; where they have &quot;-q&quot; instead. This loss of labialization is also found on the simultaneity marker where younger speakers have &quot;-kyang&quot; against older &quot;-kyangw&quot;. In words with &quot;kw&quot; or &quot;ngw&quot; in the syllable coda, the labialization is also lost:
: (younger) vs. (older) &quot;he started out&quot;
: (younger) vs. (older) &quot;he will drink&quot;
: (younger) vs. (older) &quot;he got frozen&quot;

== Language contact ==
Hopi is part of the Pueblo linguistic area (a Sprachbund) along with members of the Tanoan family, the Keresan languages, Zuni, and Navajo.

Hopi speakers have traditionally used Hopi as the language of communication with Zuni. They have also been in close contact with a Tanoan language for over 300 years since the Arizona Tewa, who speak Tewa, moved from the Galisteo Basin following the Pueblo Revolt to reside on First Mesa. The Arizona Tewa have traditionally acted as translators for the Hopi-speaking Tewa, Hopi, Navajo, Spanish, and English.

The Hopi had cursory contact with Spanish beginning with the explorers in 1540. In 1629 a small group of Franciscan missionaries started arriving in Hopi territory, building a church the following year. They remained there until 1680 when the Pueblo Revolt occurred and the Hopi expelled the Spanish from the region. Both the practices of the Spanish when there, and the stories of negative experiences of Puebloan refugees from the Rio Grande region, contributed to a Hopi attitude where acculturation was resisted or rejected.

A number of studies have focused on loanwords borrowed into Hopi from other languages.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

There are six basic vowels in Hopi:

 descends from Proto-Uto-Aztecan *o, while Hopi descends from *u.

=== Consonants ===

Hopi dialects differ in their number of consonants. Below are two separate inventories of the Third Mesa and Mishongnovi dialects. The Third Mesa inventory has orthographic symbols and IPA transcriptions of those symbols when the IPA symbol differs from the orthographic symbol.

As seen above, the Mishongnovi dialect has a larger number of consonants when compared with the Third Mesa dialect. The additional consonants are a series of preaspirated stops and a series of voiceless sonorants.

There is idiolectal free variation with the voiced labial fricative represented with , which varies between labiodental and bilabial . Before a consonant (word-medially) and at the end of words, it is not voiced although its realization is dependent upon dialect; Third Mesa speakers have while Mishongnovi speakers have .

The alveolar sibilants and are apical. In some Third Mesa speakers, they are palatalized to and , which can sound similar to and of English. In Mishongnovi, is palatalized when at the beginning of syllables and non-palatalized elsewhere.

Hopi has a number of stop contrasts at the velar place of articulation that occur before the low vowel . Elsewhere, the contrasts are neutralized. The velar in environments of neutralization is called &quot;neutral&quot; &quot;k&quot; by . Before the front vowels and , it is palatalized with a fronted articulation and following palatal glide . Thus, and are and , respectively. Before the non-front vowels and , it is a typical velar: is and is . Before the front rounded vowel , it has a backed articulation: is . Before , there is a phonemic contrast with fronted velar with following palatal glide and the backed velar. Complicating this pattern are words borrowed from Spanish that have a velar followed by a low vowel. With the addition of these loanwords, a third velar contrast has been introduced into Hopi. Words with this borrowed velar are &quot;neutral&quot; and typically velar in articulation. Thus, there is a distinction between and in native words both of which are distinct from in loanwords.

The precise phonetics of these &quot;k&quot; consonants is unclear due to vague descriptions in the literature. suggests that the fronted articulation represented by is distinguished more by presence of the palatal glide than by the difference in the articulatory position of the dorsal contact. He also mentions that the backed sound represented by is &quot;not-so-far-back&quot;. This suggests that this sound is post-velar and not quite uvular. describes the fronted sound and the sound from Spanish loanwords as palatal while the backed ones are velar. describes the fronted form as palatal with palatal glide before some vowels, The form from Spanish loanwords as &quot;ordinary k&quot;, and the backed form as velar. Whorf&#x27;s letter to Clyde Kluckhohn in describes the backed velar as being like Arabic or Nootka , which suggests a uvular articulation. Whorf&#x27;s phonemicization of Mishongnovi posits the fronted version occurring before all vowels but (with a fronted allophone before , , and ); the backed form occurring before non-high vowels (, , and ); and the form from Spanish loanwords before .

Similarly to the velar stops, Hopi has a fronted dorsal nasal and a backed dorsal nasal represented as and , respectively. The fronted nasal is palatal . The backed nasal is described as velar in Third Mesa speech and thus forms a &quot;neutral&quot; series with &quot;neutral&quot; &quot;k&quot;. In Mishongnovi speech, Whorf describes the backed nasal as having the more rear articulation of the backed dorsal: .

The retroflex sound represented with varies between a retroflex fricative () and a flap , although the fricative realization is much more common. In Mishongnovi, this sound is only weakly fricative. In syllable coda position, it is devoiced to a voiceless fricative .

The preaspirated stops and voiceless sonorants of Mishongnovi only occur in syllable coda position. However, they do contrast with plain stops and voiced sonorants in this position. Whorf notes that the preaspirated stops also contrast with a similar sequence of + stop.

=== Syllable structure ===

The most common syllable clusters are CV and CVC.

The CVCC cluster is very rare due to limited number of CC combinations in the language. This also makes it unusual to find the intrasyllabic clusters C-C and CC-C.

=== Stress ===

The stress pattern in Hopi follows a simple rule that applies to nearly all words.
* In words with one or two vowels, the first vowel is stressed.
* Where there are more than two vowels, the first vowel is stressed if it is long or it is directly followed by two consonants. Otherwise, the second vowel is stressed.

Some exceptions to this rule are &quot;car&quot;, &quot;spill&quot; and &quot;running&quot;. We would expect the second vowel to be stressed but in fact the first one is stressed in these examples.

=== Tone ===
The Third Mesa dialect of Hopi has developed tone on long vowels, diphthongs, and vowel + sonorant sequences. This dialect has either falling tones or level tones.

The falling tone (high-low) in the Third Mesa dialect corresponds to either a vowel + preaspirated consonant, a vowel + voiceless sonorant, or a vowel + &quot;h&quot; sequence in the Second Mesa dialect recorded by Whorf.

== Orthography ==

Hopi is written using the Latin alphabet.

The vowel letters correspond to the phonemes of Hopi as follows, and long vowels are written double.

Consonants are written:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

Falling accent is marked with a grave : &#x27;birds&#x27;.

To distinguish certain consonants written as digraphs from similar looking phonemes meeting across syllable boundaries, a period is used: (&#x27;eagle&#x27;) but (&#x27;to follow tracks&#x27;).

The Deseret alphabet, an alphabetical system developed by Mormon scholars in modern-day Utah, was used for academic notation of the language in a handwritten English–Hopi dictionary made in 1860 that was rediscovered in 2014.

== Morphology ==

=== Suffixes ===

Hopi uses suffixes for a variety of purposes. Some examples are:

Hopi also has free postpositions:

Nouns are marked as oblique by either the suffixes &quot;-t&quot; for simple nouns or &quot;-y&quot; for dual nouns (those referring to exactly two individuals), possessed nouns or plural nouns.

Some examples are shown below:

Verbs are also marked by suffixes but these are not used in a regular pattern. For example, the suffixes &quot;-lawu&quot; and &quot;-ta&quot; are both used to make a simple verb into a durative one (implying the action is ongoing and not yet complete) but it is hard to predict which suffix applies to which verbs. Second language learners of Hopi usually simply learn this by rote.

There are some gender specific terms in Hopi:

=== Morphological processes ===
* Elision – when the stress-shift would cause a clipped vowel not in the first syllable to have a low stress, that vowel is elided.
* Lenition – initial &quot;p&quot; becomes &quot;v&quot; when it becomes internal to a word or when the word is preceded by another word used as an adjectival or an incorporated verbal modifier.
* Reduplication – stem-initial CV, stem-final CV and word-final V are reduplicated.

== Syntax ==
=== Word order ===
The simplest type of sentence in Hopi is simply a subject and a predicate: &#x27;Maana wuupa&#x27; (the girl is tall).

However, many Hopi sentences also include an object, which is inserted between the subject and the verb. Thus, Hopi is a subject–object–verb language.

=== Case ===
Nouns are marked as subject or oblique, as shown above.

Pronouns are also marked as either nominative or oblique. For example, the singular subject pronoun &quot;you&quot; in Hopi is , and the form for the singular object pronoun is .

Demonstratives are marked by case in Hopi, shown first in their nominative form and then in their oblique form:

* – this
* – it
* – that
* – these
* – them
* – those

=== Number ===
Hopi has plural verbs. Dual noun subjects take the dual suffix &quot;-vit&quot; but singular verbs. Hopi does not have dual pronouns; instead, the plural pronouns may be used with singular verbs for a dual meaning. Noun and verb plurality is indicated, among other devices, by partial reduplication, marked in the gloss below with a tilde (~).

== Metalinguistics ==

Benjamin Lee Whorf, a well-known linguist and still one of the foremost authorities on the relationships obtaining between southwestern and Central American languages, used Hopi to exemplify his argument that one&#x27;s worldview is affected by one&#x27;s language and vice versa. Among Whorf&#x27;s best-known claims was that Hopi had &quot;no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call &#x27;time.&#x27;&quot; Whorf&#x27;s statement has been misunderstood to mean that Hopi has no concept of duration or succession of time, but in fact, he meant only that the Hopi have no conception of time as an object or a substance that may be divided and subdivided. Furthermore, according to John A. Lucy, many of Whorf&#x27;s critics have failed to read his writings accurately, preferring instead to proffer uncharitable caricatures of his arguments. The existence of temporal concepts in the Hopi language was extensively documented by Ekkehart Malotki; other linguists and philosophers are also skeptical of Whorf&#x27;s broader argument and his findings on Hopi have been disputed or rejected by some.

<text>Michael Joseph (died 27 June 1497), better known as Michael An Gof, was one of the leaders of the Cornish rebellion of 1497, along with Thomas Flamank.

==Background==

The rebels marched on London to protest against King Henry VII&#x27;s levy of a tax to pay for an invasion of Scotland in response to the Scots&#x27; support of the pretender Perkin Warbeck. The Cornish believed that this was a northern affair and had nothing to do with them; they also believed that the tax was the work of the King&#x27;s corrupt counsellors and marched to London to bring this to the King&#x27;s attention.

==March on London==
A blacksmith (An Gof) named Michael Joseph lived at St Keverne on the Lizard peninsula. He is described as &quot;a notable prating fellow who by thrusting himself forward on every occasion, and being loudest in every complaint against the government, acquired an authority among these simple people, and was ready to lead them to any desperate enterprise&quot;.

Michael Joseph was chosen by the people of St. Keverne to challenge the tax. When he and his followers reached Bodmin, they were joined by Thomas Flamank, a local lawyer. Flamank argued that it was the business of the barons of the north to defend the Scottish border, and that the tax was illegal. He suggested that the Cornishmen should march on London and present a petition to the king setting forth their grievances against the advisers responsible for the king&#x27;s action.

Under the leadership of Flamank and Joseph, about 6,000 Cornishmen assembled at Bodmin and set out. The army attracted support in provisions and recruits along the way and by the time it reached Devon numbered some 15,000 strong. Up until then the march had been relatively peaceable, but when they reached Taunton in Somerset, Provost Perrin, an officer and commissioner who was collecting the tax, was killed.

They hoped to gain support from people in Kent – the focus of Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450 – but despite heading to Cade&#x27;s former rallying site at Blackheath they gained little backing.

The Cornish rebels were defeated by the King&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Deptford Bridge on 17 June 1497 on a site adjacent to the River Ravensbourne. Michael fled to Greenwich after the battle, but was captured and sent to the Tower of London.

As one of the leaders, Michael An Gof was executed with Flamank on 27 June 1497. A 16th-century source relates that they suffered the highest penalty for traitors: to be hanged, drawn and quartered. But an even earlier authority states that they were hanged until dead before being beheaded and quartered. Their heads were displayed on London Bridge and their quarters at other locations. While being pulled on a hurdle toward his execution, An Gof is reported to have said that he would have &quot;a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal&quot;.

In 1997, the 500th anniversary of the rebellion, a commemorative march (&quot;Keskerdh Kernow 500&quot;) was held, retracing the route of the original march from St. Keverne (An Gof&#x27;s home town in Cornwall) to London. A statue depicting An Gof and Flamank was unveiled in St Keverne and a commemorative plaque was unveiled on the wall of Greenwich Park facing Blackheath common. Russell Pascoe composed &#x27;The Martyrdom of An Gof&#x27; for the end of the march, which was performed at The Barbican in June 1997.

== Other uses ==
The name &quot;An Gof&quot; is from the Cornish for &quot;the blacksmith&quot;. It is the origin of the British surname Angove. Cognates include &quot;Gow&quot; and &quot;Gowan&quot; and the Irish/Scottish McGowan.

The Holyer An Gof trophy is an annual award for the best publication on Cornwall, and part of the Cornish Gorsedd (Gorsedh Kernow).

An Gof&#x27;s name was later used by a Cornish nationalist extremist organisation. 

An Gof was the name of a rock group who performed a song on the album &quot;Keltia Rok&quot; in 1987.

<doc id="447747" wikidata="Q787047" url="?curid=447747" title="Yellow-breasted chat">
<text>The yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens) is a large songbird found in America, and is the only member of the family Icteriidae. It was once a member of the New World warbler family Parulidae, but in 2017, the American Ornithological Society moved it to its own family. Its placement is not definitively resolved.

== Taxonomy ==
The yellow-breasted chat was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus virens&quot;, and specified the type locality as &quot;America&quot;. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;green&quot;. The locality has been restricted to South Carolina. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;yellow brested chat&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Icteria&quot; that was introduced in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. It is also the only species placed in the family Icteriidae that was introduced (as Icterieae) in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird.

The yellow-breasted chat was formerly considered the largest member of the family Parulidae, but following taxonomic studies, it was moved to the monotypic family Icteriidae in 2017. Although Icteriidae is a distinct family from the New World blackbirds (Icteridae), which have a very similar name, taxonomic studies support them as being the closest living relatives of one another, and in a 2019 study Carl Oliveros and colleagues actually classified the yellow-breasted chat as a member of Icteridae. In addition, the former grouping of the yellow-breasted chat as a warbler was not too far off because phylogenomic studies have placed Parulidae as sister to a clade that includes Icteridae. Those results make it reasonable to view Parulidae the sister group to the clade comprising Icteridae and Icteriidae, as in Oliveros et al.

The cladogram below shows the relationship of the yellow-breasted chat to the other families. It is based on the molecular phylogenetic study by Carl Oliveros and collaborators that was published in 2019. The species numbers are taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
==Description==
When considered part of the family Parulidae (New World warblers), the yellow-breasted chat was the largest species of parulid. In fact, it can often weigh more than twice as much as other parulid species.

This species has a total length of and a wingspan of . Body mass can range from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the elongated tail is , the relatively long, heavy bill is , and the tarsus is . These birds have olive upper parts with white bellies and bright-yellow throats and breasts. Other signature features of yellow-breasted chats are their large, white eye rings, and blackish legs. When seen, this species is unlikely to be mistaken for any other bird.

The song is an odd, variable mixture of cackles, clucks, whistles, and hoots. Their calls are harsh &quot;chak&quot;&#x27;s. Unlike most warblers, this species has been known to mimic the calls of other birds. Thus, less experienced field birdwatchers sometimes overlook chats after mistaking their song for species such as grey catbirds and brown thrashers, which share similar habitat preferences and skulking habits, though are generally much more abundant. During the breeding season, chats are at their most conspicuous, as they usually sing from exposed locations and even fly in the open while gurgling their songs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow-breasted chat is found throughout North America. It breeds from the southern plains of Canada to central Mexico, and mainly migrates to Mexico and Central America for the winter, although some may overwinter in coastal areas farther north. This species occurs in areas where dense shrubbery is common. Today, its habitat often consists of abandoned farmland and other rural areas where overgrown vegetation proliferates.

==Behaviour==

The yellow-breasted chat is a shy, skulking species of bird, often being heard but not seen.

===Breeding===
The breeding habitat is dense, brushy vegetation or hedgerows. The nest is a bulky cup made of grasses, leaves, strips of bark, and stems of weeds, and lined with finer grasses, wiry plant stems, pine needles, and sometimes roots and hair. The nest is placed in thick shrub and often only about above the ground. The clutch is three to five creamy-white eggs with reddish-brown blotches or speckles. These are incubated by the female and hatch in 11 to 12 days. Both parents tend the young, which fledge in 8 to 11 days. Chats are apparently vigilant guards of their nests, as parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds is not as frequent as with other cup-nest builders. They are not as monogamous, though, as other warblers. In one study in central Kentucky, DNA fingerprinting revealed that 17% of 29 yellow-breasted chat nestlings were not sired by the male of the social pair and three of nine broods contained at least one extra-pair nestling.

===Food and feeding===
Yellow-breasted chats are omnivorous birds, and forage in dense vegetation. Mostly, this species feeds on insects and berries, including blackberries and wild grapes. Insects up to moderate sizes, including grasshoppers, bugs, beetles, weevils, bees, wasps, tent caterpillars, ants, moths, and mayflies, are typically preyed upon and are gleaned from dense vegetation. Other invertebrates, including spiders, are occasionally eaten, as well. Uniquely for a passerine of its size, the chat occasionally grips food with its feet before it eats.

==Status==
Yellow-breasted chats are declining in eastern North America due to habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and urban development. This species, though less vulnerable than other cup nesters, is still sometimes victim to brood parasitism from brown-headed cowbirds that have taken advantage of the fragmentation of eastern forests to expand their range during the last century. The species still occurs over a wide range, though, and is considered to be of least concern globally.

<text>John Joseph Farrell (April 1, 1901 – June 14, 1988) was an American professional golfer, best known for winning the U.S. Open in 1928. Over the course of his career, he won 22 PGA Tour events.

==Early life==
Born in White Plains, New York, Farrell started as a caddie and turned professional in 1922.

==Professional career==
At the 1928 U.S. Open, held at Olympia Fields Country Club near Chicago, Farrell tied with amateur Bobby Jones, then a two-time champion, after the regulation 72 holes and won the 36-hole playoff by one stroke. Farrell was voted the 1927 and 1928 Best Golf Professional in the United States, after a winning streak of six consecutive tournaments, on his road to a total of 22 career PGA Tour wins. He played for the United States in the first three Ryder Cups: 1927, 1929, and 1931.

Farrell was the head professional at the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in New York from 1919 to 1930. In 1931, Farrell played in his third Ryder Cup and also met and married Catherine Hush. In 1934, Farrell accepted the head professional job at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey.

In 1948, the AP&#x27;s Frank Eck reported that there had been, to that point, eight rounds as low as 62 posted in competitive golf, and that Farrell had been the first to do so, in the late 1920s, at the La Gorce Country Club course in Miami Beach.

==Personal life==
Farrell was married to Catherine. They had five children: Johnny, Jimmy, Billy, Peggy, and Cathy. The Farrell family dedicated itself to golf, becoming Golf Family of the Year in 1966. Billy Farrell played professional golf and is best known for being the first ever to hit the par-5 17th hole at Baltusrol&#x27;s Lower Course in two shots, which he did during the 1967 U.S. Open.

Farrell died in Boynton Beach, Florida after a stroke at age 87.

== Awards and honors ==
Farrell was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2023 and was inducted in 2024.

<doc id="447760" wikidata="Q1785483" url="?curid=447760" title="Contrapuntal motion">
<text>In music theory, contrapuntal motion is the general movement of two or more melodic lines with respect to each other. In traditional four-part harmony, it is important that lines maintain their independence, an effect which can be achieved by the judicious use of the four types of contrapuntal motion: parallel motion, similar motion, contrary motion, and oblique motion.

==Parallel motion ==

Parallel motion is motion in the same direction, keeping the same interval between them. For example :
Parallel motion at an interval of a perfect fifth is known as parallel or consecutive fifths, and at an interval of an octave is known as parallel or consecutive octaves. Perfect intervals, i.e. the (perfect) unison, fifth and octave, are generally avoided in traditional counterpoint because they offer the lines so little independence from each other.

In first-species counterpoint, it is recommended to limit parallel thirds or sixths to three consecutive uses of a given intervallic size. 

Chords between which all factors or voices move in parallel motion are called &quot;parallel chords&quot;. This motion is called planing.

==Similar motion==
Similar motion is motion in the same direction, but with the interval between them changing. In other words, both lines move up, or both lines move down, but the interval between them is different in the first chord and the second chord. For example :

An important example of similar motion is in horn fifths.

==Contrary motion==
Contrary motion is motion in opposite directions. That is, when one of the lines moves up, the other line moves down (that is, in inversion). If the voices always move by the same intervals (in opposite directions) they are said to be in strict contrary motion. 

The following example shows two voices in contrary motion :
Contrary motion is important to maintain the independence of the melodic movement in contrapuntal writing as it creates the most independence between voices.

==Oblique motion==
Oblique motion is motion of one melodic line while the other remains at the same pitch. For example :
If extended for enough time, the note that stays on the same pitch can be called a drone.

Similar and oblique motion provide less independence than contrary motion, but more than parallel motion.

<doc id="447762" wikidata="Q497911" url="?curid=447762" title="Seong of Baekje">
<text>Seong (504? – 554) (r. 523–554) was the 26th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. He was a son of Muryeong of Baekje and is best known for making Buddhism the state religion, moving the national capital to Sabi (present-day Buyeo County), and reclaiming the center of the Korean Peninsula. His demise eventually came at the hands of an ally who betrayed him. The name Seong translates as &#x27;The Holy.&#x27;

==Foreign relations and Buddhism==
Seong was known as a great patron of Buddhism in Korea, and built many temples and welcomed priests bringing Buddhist texts directly from India. In 528, Baekje officially adopted Buddhism as its state religion. He maintained his country&#x27;s diplomatic ties with Liang dynasty China as well as early Japan.

He sent missions to Liang in 534 and 541, on the second occasion requesting artisans as well as various Buddhist works and a teacher. According to Chinese records, all these requests were granted. A subsequent mission was sent in 549, only to find the Liang capital in the hands of the rebel Hou Jing, who threw them in prison for lamenting the fall of the capital.

He is credited with having sent a mission including Norisachigye (노리사치계, 怒利斯致契, ?-?) in 538 to Japan that brought an image of Shakyamuni and several sutras to the Japanese court. This has traditionally been considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan. An account of this is given in &quot;Gangōji Garan Engi&quot;.

He attended a Buddhist conference at Ara Gaya (安羅會議) in 529.
Sabi Conferences (泗沘會議) were held in 541 and 544 at Sabi capital.

==Move of the capital==
In 538, he moved the capital from Ungjin (present-day Gongju) further south to Sabi (present-day Buyeo County), on the Geum River. Unlike the earlier move of the capital from the present-day Seoul region to Ungjin, forced by the military pressure of Goguryeo, the move to Sabi was directed by the king to strengthen royal power, aided by the political support of the Sa clan based in Sabi.

He completely reorganized the administration of the country to strengthen central control, to counteract the political power of the noble clans. He changed the name of the country to Nambuyeo, to emphasize the ancient connection to Buyeo.

==Battle among the Three Kingdoms==
Baekje had maintained a century-long alliance with its neighbor Silla, to balance the threat of the northern kingdom Goguryeo. With the aid of Silla and the Gaya confederacy, Seong led a long campaign to regain the Han River valley, the former heartland of Baekje which had been lost to Goguryeo in 475. Baekje regained its original capital in 551. The campaign culminated in 553 with victories in a series of costly assaults on Goguryeo fortifications.

However, under a secret agreement with Goguryeo, Silla troops, arriving on the pretense of offering assistance, attacked the exhausted Baekje army and took possession of the entire Han River valley. Incensed by this betrayal, the following year Seong launched a retaliatory strike against Silla&#x27;s western border. This attack was led by the crown prince (subsequent king Wideok) and joined by the Gaya confederacy. But Seong and 30,000 Baekje troops were killed in the disastrous battle. This defeat led to significant erosion of royal power.

==Legacy==
According to the Shogeishō(聖冏抄), a compilation of the ancient historical records and traditions about the Japanese Prince Regent Shotoku Taishi, Guze Kannon is a statue that is the representation of King Seong, which was carved under the order of the subsequent King Wideok of Baekje. It was written by a Japanese monk Shogei (1341–1420), the 7th Patriarchs of the Jodo sect. The statue which had originally come from Baekje to Japan and has been preserved at the Japanese temple Hōryū-ji. The American scholar of Asian cultures Ernest Fenollosa describes the Guze Kannon he uncovered at Hōryū-ji along with the Tamamushi Shrine as &quot;two great monuments of sixth-century Corean Art&quot;. It is referred to by the authors of The Cambridge History of Japan as one of the &quot;great works of Asuka art created by foreign priests and preserved as Japanese national treasures&quot;.
His third son, Imseongtaeja (琳聖太子), left for Japan, via Taiwan, after his father was killed. Imseongtaeja is credited for playing a key role in the formation of the early Japanese state. Because of date discrepancies most scholars now say he must have been son of Wideok of Baekje.

<doc id="447765" wikidata="Q968679" url="?curid=447765" title="Terza rima">
<text>Terza rima (, , ; ) is a rhyming verse form, in which the poem, or each poem-section, consists of tercets (three-line stanzas) with an interlocking three-line rhyme scheme: The last word of the second line in one tercet provides the rhyme for the first and third lines in the tercet that follows (ABA BCB CDC). The poem or poem-section may have any number of lines (not divisible by 3), but it ends with either a single line or a couplet, which repeats the rhyme of the middle line of the previous tercet (YZY Z or YZY ZZ).

&quot;Terza rima&quot; was invented early in the fourteenth century by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri for his narrative poem the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, which he set in hendecasyllabic lines. In English, poets often use iambic pentameter. &quot;Terza rima&quot; is a challenging form for a poet, and it did not become common in the century following its invention. The form is especially challenging in languages that are inherently less rich in rhymes than Italian.

&quot;Terza rima&quot; can give to the verse the effect of rhymes surging the narrative forward. It can also give a sense of continuity to the verse — the rhymes are woven together, and a reading of a canto cannot be stopped without the sense of something (the rhyme scheme) broken or unfinished. The rhymes of &quot;terza rima&quot; add the effect of echo and expectation — as a line is read there is the sense it will soon be followed by a rhyme that will complete the rhyme scheme. &quot;Terza rima&quot; can lend a sense of strength and solidity to the story or the poem — each tercet, though brief, has enough length to contain a complete thought or expression, that can be considered independently. Tercets are like the building blocks of the poem or canto, and the interwoven rhyme serves as the cement that binds them together.

==History==

The first use of &quot;terza rima&quot; is in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, completed in 1320. In creating the form, Dante may have been influenced by the &quot;sirventes&quot;, a lyric poetry form used by the Provençal troubadours. Inspired by Dante, other Italian poets, including Petrarch and Boccaccio, began using the form.

==English-language translations and poems==

Translators and poets that write in English and use &quot;terza rima&quot; are often interested in exploring modifications and variations of the rhyme. The first occurrence of Dante’s &quot;terza rima&quot; rhyme scheme in English is found in parts II and III of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s short poem &quot;Complaint to His Lady&quot;. &quot;Terza rima&quot; has been used by Thomas Wyatt, John Milton, Lord Byron (in &quot;The Prophecy of Dante&quot;) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (in his &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; and &quot;The Triumph of Life&quot;). Thomas Hardy also used the form in &quot;Friends Beyond&quot; to interlink the characters and continue the flow of the poem.

20th-century poets who have employed variations of the form include W. H. Auden (&quot;The Sea and the Mirror&quot;), T. S. Eliot (&quot;Little Gidding&quot;), Robert Frost (&quot;Acquainted with the Night&quot;), Elizabeth Jennings, Philip Larkin, Archibald MacLeish (&quot;The Conquistador&quot;, winner of the Pulitzer Prize 1932), James Merrill, Jacqueline Osherow, Sylvia Plath (&quot;The Sow&quot;), Adrienne Rich (&quot;Terza Rima&quot;), Gjertrud Schnackenberg, Clark Ashton Smith, Derek Walcott, Richard Wilbur and William Carlos Williams (&quot;The Yachts&quot;). A 21st-century example that adhere&#x27;s closely to Dante&#x27;s &quot;terza rima&quot; is David Ives&#x27; &quot;The Phobia Clinic&quot;, which the author describes as a &quot;philosophical horror novelette in verse using Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; as its model&quot;. Edward Lowbury&#x27;s adaptation of the form to six-syllable lines has been named &quot;piccola terza rima&quot;.

English versions of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; are often set in iambic pentameter. Examples of English translations in the &quot;terza rima&quot; form include Robert Pinsky&#x27;s version of the first book, &quot;Inferno&quot;, and Laurence Binyon&#x27;s, Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27;s and Peter Dale&#x27;s versions of the entire work.

<text>Hans Jacobs (30 April 1907 in Hamburg – 24 October 1994) was a German sailplane designer and pioneer. He had been taught sailplane design by Alexander Lippisch, designer of many gliders during the 1920s and the 1930s. As the head of the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight) at Darmstadt in the years before World War II, he was responsible for a number of highly successful designs, including the DFS Rhönsperber, DFS Rhönadler, DFS Habicht, DFS Weihe, DFS Kranich, and the DFS 230 assault glider. Hans also designed a glider-seaplane, the &quot;Sea Eagle&quot;, test flown by Hanna Reitsch. In 1936, Hans developed self-operating dive brakes, on the upper and lower surface of each wing, for gliders. He designed the DFS 230 used in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael.

The DFS Olympia Meise was selected in 1939 as the glider for the 1940 Summer Olympics, but the games were cancelled. The design was taken up after the war and produced in large numbers in the UK by Elliotts of Newbury, in France by Nord Aviation, in the Netherlands and in Switzerland.

When the prohibition on German aviation under the Allied occupation ended in 1951, Jacobs designed and marketed a significantly different, updated version of the Kranich.

In 1932 Jacobs authored a seminal work on sailplane design, &quot;Werkstattpraxis für den Bau von Gleit- und Segelflugzeugen (&quot;Workshop Practice for the Construction of Gliders and Sailplanes&quot;)&quot;. Updated in several editions, this &quot;became and remains the standard work&quot; on the construction of wooden gliders. In July 2016 the Vintage Sailplane Association published an English translation of this work.

<doc id="447771" wikidata="Q326193" url="?curid=447771" title="Stutthof concentration camp">
<text>Stutthof (&quot;KZ Stutthof&quot;) was a Nazi concentration camp established by Nazi Germany in a secluded, marshy, and wooded area near the village of Stutthof (now Sztutowo) 34 km (21 mi) east of the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) in the territory of the German-annexed Free City of Danzig. The camp was set up around existing structures after the invasion of Poland in World War II and initially used for the imprisonment of Polish leaders and intelligentsia. The actual barracks were built the following year by prisoners. Most of the infrastructure of the concentration camp was either destroyed or dismantled shortly after the war. In 1962, the former concentration camp with its remaining structures was turned into a memorial museum.

Stutthof was the first German concentration camp set up outside German borders in World War II, in operation from 2 September 1939. It was also the last camp liberated by the Allies, on 9 May 1945. It is estimated that between 63,000 and 65,000 prisoners of Stutthof concentration camp and its subcamps died as a result of murder, starvation, epidemics, extreme labour conditions, brutal and forced evacuations, and a lack of medical attention. Some 28,000 of those who died were Jews. In total, as many as 110,000 people were deported to the camp in the course of its existence. About 24,600 were transferred from Stutthof to other locations.

== Camp ==
The camp was established in connection with the ethnic cleansing project that included the liquidation of Polish elites (members of the intelligentsia, religious and political leaders) in the Danzig area and Western Prussia.

Even before the war began, the German Selbstschutz in Pomerania created lists of people to be arrested, and the Nazi authorities were secretly reviewing suitable places to set up concentration camps in their area.

Originally, Stutthof was a civilian internment camp under the Danzig police chief, before its subsequent massive expansion. In November 1941, it became a &quot;labor education&quot; camp (like Dachau), administered by the German Security Police. Finally, in January 1942, Stutthof became a regular concentration camp.

The original camp (known as the old camp) was surrounded by the barbed-wire fence. It comprised eight barracks for the inmates and a &quot;Kommandantur&quot; for the SS guards, totaling . In 1943, the camp was enlarged and a new camp was constructed alongside the earlier one. It was also surrounded by electrified barbed-wire fence and contained thirty new barracks, raising the total area to . A crematorium and gas chamber were added in 1943, just in time to start mass executions when Stutthof was included in the &quot;Final Solution&quot; in June 1944. Mobile gas wagons were also used to complement the maximum capacity of the gas chamber (150 people per execution) when needed.

=== Staff ===
The camp staff consisted of German &quot;SS&quot; guards and, after 1943, the Ukrainian auxiliaries brought in by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Fritz Katzmann, the Higher SS and Police Leader of the area.

In 1942 the first German female &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Aufseherinnen&quot; guards arrived at Stutthof along with female prisoners. A total of 295 women guards worked as staff in the Stutthof complex of camps.

Among the notable female guard personnel were: Elisabeth Becker, Erna Beilhardt, Ella Bergmann, Ella Blank, Gerda Bork, Herta Bothe, Erna Boettcher, Hermine Boettcher-Brueckner, Steffi Brillowski, Charlotte Graf, Charlotte Gregor, Charlotte Klein, Gerda Steinhoff, Ewa Paradies, and Jenny-Wanda Barkmann. Thirty-four female guards including Becker, Bothe, Steinhoff, Paradies, and Barkmann were identified later as having committed crimes against humanity. The &quot;SS&quot; in Stutthof began conscripting women from Danzig and the surrounding cities in June 1944, to train as camp guards because of their severe shortage after the women&#x27;s subcamp of Stutthof called Bromberg-Ost (Konzentrationslager Bromberg-Ost) was set up in the city of Bydgoszcz.

Several Norwegian Waffen SS volunteers worked as guards or as instructors for prisoners from Nordic countries, according to senior researcher at the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities, Terje Emberland.

===Prisoners===

The first 150 inmates, imprisoned on 2 September 1939, were selected among Poles and Jews arrested in Danzig immediately after the outbreak of war. The inmate population rose to 6,000 in the following two weeks, on 15 September 1939. Until 1942, nearly all of the prisoners were Polish. The number of inmates increased considerably in 1944, with Jews forming a significant proportion of the newcomers. The first contingent of 2,500 Jewish prisoners arrived from Auschwitz in July 1944. In total, 23,566 Jews (including 21,817 women) were transferred to Stutthof from Auschwitz, and 25,053 (including 16,123 women) from camps in the Baltic states. When the Soviet army began its advance through German-occupied Estonia in July and August 1944, the camp staff of Klooga concentration camp evacuated the majority of the inmates by sea and sent them to Stutthof. Other sources say that the camp staff shot most remaining inmates in a mass murder.

Stutthof&#x27;s registered inmates included citizens of 28 countries, and besides Jews and Poles – Germans, Czechs, Dutch, Belgians, French, Norwegians, Finns, Danes, Lithuanians, Latvians, Belarusians, Russians, and others. There were also those classed and condemned as &quot;vagrants who travel around after the manner of the gypsies&quot;, a category that included Romani, Sinti and Yenish people.

Among 110,000 prisoners were Jews from all over Europe, members of the Polish underground, Polish civilians deported from Warsaw during the Warsaw Uprising, Lithuanian and Latvian intelligentsia, Latvian resistance fighters, psychiatric patients, Soviet prisoners of war, and Communists (as an example of Communist deportations to Stutthof, see the Danish Horserød camp). One prominent inmate and survivor of the Stutthof concentration camp was a member of parliament for the Communist Party of Denmark Martin Nielsen, who detailed his deportation to, experience in and ensuing death march from the camp in his book &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Report from Stutthof&#x27;). It is believed that inmates sent for immediate execution were not registered.

=== Conditions ===

Conditions in the camp were extremely harsh; tens of thousands of prisoners succumbed to starvation and disease. Many died in typhus epidemics that swept the camp in the winter of 1942 and again in 1944; those whom the SS guards judged too weak or sick to work were gassed in the camp&#x27;s small gas chamber. The first executions were carried out on 11 January and 22 March 1940 – 89 Polish activists and government officials were shot. Gassing with Zyklon B began in June 1944. 4,000 prisoners, including Jewish women and children, were killed in a gas chamber before the evacuation of the camp. Another method of execution practiced in Stutthof was lethal injection of phenol. Prisoners were also drowned in mud or clubbed to death. A Yenish survivor recalls that his mother, having given birth in the KZ, was made to witness her newborn being cast into the incinerator. Between 63,000 and 65,000 people died in the camp.

A range of German organisations and individuals used Stutthof prisoners as forced laborers. Many prisoners worked in SS-owned businesses such as DAW (, literally the &#x27;German Equipment Works&#x27;), the heavily guarded armaments factory located inside the camp next to prisoner barracks. Other inmates labored in local brickyards, in private industrial enterprises, in agriculture, or in the camp&#x27;s own workshops. In 1944, as forced labor by concentration camp prisoners became increasingly important in armaments production, a Focke-Wulf aircraft factory was constructed at Stutthof. Eventually, the Stutthof camp system became a network of forced-labor camps. The &quot;Holocaust Encyclopedia&quot; estimates that (less officially) some 105 Stutthof subcamps were established throughout northern and central Poland. The major subcamps were in Toruń (Thorn) and in Elbląg (Elbing).

=== Alleged human soap production ===


There was a controversy regarding whether corpses from Stutthof were used in the production of soap made from human corpses at the lab of Professor Rudolf Spanner.

Historian Joachim Neander argued that, contrary to some claims made in previous years, what the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) calls the &quot;chemical substance which was essentially soap&quot; was the byproduct of Spanner&#x27;s bone maceration processes done to create anatomical models at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, where he worked and which was not part of the Stutthof camp. The corpses used for this were not &quot;harvested&quot; bodies, and the byproduct of Spanner&#x27;s work at the Danzig institute was collected. This was conflated with the separate debunked rumours of industrial production of human soap in concentration camps, which circulated during the war, and thereafter used as proof of this during the Nuremberg trials. 

Polish historians and employees at the IPN, Monika Tomkiewicz and Piotr Semków, reached similar conclusions. Semków states that the presence of human fat tissue has been confirmed in the samples of soapy grease (claimed to be &quot;unfinished soap&quot;) from Danzig presented during the trials through analysis performed by the IPN and Gdańsk University of Technology in 2011 and 2006, respectively, but his and Tomkiewicz research concluded that this was a byproduct stemming from Spanner&#x27;s work in bone maceration at the institute unrelated to the Stutthof camp. Spanner was unlikely to have &quot;really occupied himself with the production of usable soap from human fat&quot;, and that any soap production in his laboratory was likely marginal. It was also added that Spanner was arrested twice after the war but released after each time after explaining how he had conducted the maceration and injection process of his models and was declared &quot;clean&quot; by the denazification program in 1948, officially exonerated, and resumed his academic career.

== Sub-camps ==
The main German concentration camp in Stutthof had as many as 40 sub-camps during World War II. In total, the sub-camps held 110,000 prisoners from 25 countries. The sub-camps of Stutthof included:

== Commandants ==

The camp had two commanders:
* SS-Sturmbannführer Max Pauly, September 1939 – August 1942
* SS-Sturmbannführer Paul-Werner Hoppe, August 1942 – January 1945

== Death march ==

The evacuation of prisoners from the Stutthof camp system began on 25 January 1945. When the final evacuation began, there were nearly 50,000 prisoners, most of them Jews, in the Stutthof camp system. The prisoners were marched in the direction of Lauenburg in eastern Germany. Cut off by advancing Soviet forces, the Germans forced the surviving prisoners to march back to Stutthof.

In late April 1945, the remaining prisoners were removed from Stutthof by sea, since the camp was completely encircled by Soviet forces. Again, hundreds of prisoners were forced into the sea and shot. Over 4,000 were sent by small boat to Germany, some to the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, and some to camps along the Baltic coast.

On 5 May 1945, a barge full of starving prisoners was towed into harbour at Klintholm Havn in Denmark where 351 of the 370 on board were saved. Shortly before the German surrender, some prisoners were transferred to Malmö, Sweden, and released into the care of that neutral country. It has been estimated that around half of the evacuated prisoners, over 25,000, died during the evacuation from Stutthof and its subcamps.

Soviet forces liberated Stutthof on 9 May 1945, rescuing about 100 prisoners who had managed to hide.

== Stutthof trials ==

The well known Nuremberg Trials were only concerned with concentration camps as evidence for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Third Reich leadership. Several lesser known trials followed against the staff of various concentration camps. Poland held four trials in Gdańsk against former guards and &quot;kapos&quot; of Stutthof, charging them with crimes of war and crimes against humanity.

The first trial was held from 25 April to 31 May 1946, against 30 ex-officials and prisoner-guards of the camp. The Soviet/Polish Special Criminal Court found all of them guilty of the charges. Eleven defendants including the former commander, Johann Pauls, were sentenced to death. The rest were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

The second trial was held from 8 October to 31 October 1947, before a Polish Special Criminal Court. The arraigned 24 ex-officials and guards of the Stutthof concentration camp were judged and found guilty. Ten were sentenced to death.

The third trial was held from 5 November to 10 November 1947, before a Polish Special Criminal Court. Arraigned were 20 ex-officials and guards judged; 19 then found guilty, with one acquitted.

The fourth and final trial was also held before a Polish Special Criminal Court, from 19 November to 29 November 1947. Twenty-seven ex-officials and guards were arraigned and judged; 26 were found guilty, and one was acquitted.

An additional trial was attempted in November 2018, when Johann Rehbogen was accused of being an accessory to murder. There was no evidence to link him to specific killings, and though he admitted to serving at the camp, he said that he was unaware that people were being murdered there. He was charged as a juvenile, as he was under 21 at the time of the offense. Images in the news broadcasts concealed his face for legal reasons. Being tried at the age of 94, court proceedings were limited to no more than two hours per day and two non-consecutive days per week. In February 2019 the trial of a defendant matching this description (whom Reuters reported could not be named for legal reasons) was halted after a medical report was issued stating that the defendant was unfit to stand trial, the trial already having been suspended since the previous December.

Another Nazi camp guard, Bruno Dey from Hamburg, was charged in October 2019 with contributing to the killings of 5,230 prisoners at Stutthof camp between 1944 and 1945. He was tried in a juvenile court due having been about 17 at that time. On 23 July 2020, he was given a two-year suspended sentence by the court in Hamburg.

In July 2021, a 96-year-old German secretary, Irmgard Furchner, who had been part of KZ Stutthof was arrested to be tried for war crimes. On 28 September 2021, Frau Furchner left her home in Hamburg and failed to show for her hearing. She was captured on 30 September 2021 and the hearing was rescheduled for 19 October 2021. 

Josef Salomonovic, who arrived at Stutthof in June 1944 from Auschwitz just before his sixth birthday, was the only survivor to give evidence in person at the Furchner trial. He described Stutthof, where his father was murdered by phenol injection, as the worst of the several camps through which he and his family had passed. Asia Shindelman, who arrived in Stutthof in July 1944 aged 16, testified from the United States via video link to prisoners being thrown by guards into electrified fences.

On 20 December 2022 Furchner, then 97, was convicted of being an accessory to murder of more than 10,000 people at Stutthof concentration camp during World War II. A two-year suspended sentence in line with that requested by prosecutors was handed down by the Itzehoe state court in northern Germany. On 20 August 2024, the German Federal Court of Justice upheld Furchner&#x27;s conviction.

<text>Inspired by Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz project, the German formation Jazzkantine was founded in 1993 in Braunschweig. Their first album &quot;Jazzkantine&quot; won them the &quot;Echo Award&quot; in 1996, the most important German music prize.

The music of &quot;Jazzkantine&quot; is a cross-over between jazz funk and hip hop music: German rap over music and beats heavily influenced by jazz standards, often interpreted in a very funky way. This genre is also known as jazz rap.

In 1998, they played at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

In 1999, they started a collaboration with the ballet ensemble of Braunschweig, resulting in the successful &quot;Tanzzkantine&quot; project.

<text>The masculine first name Gregory or Grégory derives from the Latin name &quot;Gregorius&quot;, which came from the late Greek name &quot;Γρηγόριος&quot; (Grēgórios) meaning &quot;watchful, alert&quot; (derived from &quot;ἐγείρω&quot; &quot;egeiro&quot; meaning &quot;to awaken, arouse&quot;). (See also the egrḗgoroi or Watcher angels in Second Book of Enoch).

Through folk etymology, the name also became associated with Latin &quot;grex&quot; (stem &quot;greg–&quot;) meaning &quot;flock&quot; or &quot;herd&quot;. This association with a shepherd who diligently guides his flock contributed to the name&#x27;s popularity among monks and popes.

Sixteen popes and two antipopes have used the name Gregorius, starting with Pope Gregory I (Gregory the Great). It is tied with Benedict as the second-most popular name for popes, after John. 

Although the name was uncommon in the early 20th century, after the popularity of the actor Gregory Peck it became one of the ten most common male names in the United States in the 1950s and has remained popular since.

==Name days==
The Roman Catholic Church traditionally held the feast of Saint Gregory (the Great) on March 12, but changed it to September 3 in 1969. March 12 remains the name day for Gregory in most countries.

Gregory the Theologian (also known as Gregory of Nazianzus) is one of the Three Hierarchs (Ancient Greek: Οἱ Τρεῖς Ἱεράρχαι; Greek: Οι Τρεις Ιεράρχες). The other two are Basil the Great, also known as Basil of Caesarea and John Chrysostom.
All three have separate feast days in January: Basil on January 1, Gregory on January 25, and Chrysostom on January 27.

<text>Half-caste is a term used for individuals of multiracial descent. The word &quot;&quot; is borrowed from the Portuguese or Spanish word &quot;casta&quot;, meaning race. Terms such as &quot;half-caste&quot;, &quot;caste&quot;, &quot;quarter-caste&quot; and &quot;mix-breed&quot; were used by colonial officials in the British Empire during their classification of indigenous populations, and in Australia used during the Australian government&#x27;s pursuit of a policy of assimilation. In Latin America, the equivalent term for half-castes was &quot;Cholo&quot; and &quot;Zambo&quot;. Some people now consider the term offensive.

==Use by region==
===Australia===

In Australia, the term &quot;half-caste&quot;, along with any other proportional representation of Aboriginality (such as &quot;part-aborigine&quot;, &quot;full-blood&quot;, &quot;quarter-caste&quot;, &quot;octoroon&quot;, &quot;mulatto&quot;, or &quot;hybrid&quot;) are defunct descriptors that are highly offensive. Its use is Aboriginal peoples of Australia mostly in historical documents, as it is associated with assimilationist policies of the past. Such terms were widely used in the 19th- and early-20th-century Australian laws to refer to the offspring of European and Aboriginal parents. For example, the &quot;Aborigines Protection Act 1886&quot; mentioned half-castes habitually associating with or living with an &quot;Aborigine&quot; (another term no longer favoured), while the Aborigines Amendments between 1934 and 1937 refer to it in various terms, including as a person with less than quadroon blood.

Following the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, Attorney-General Alfred Deakin ruled that references to &quot;aboriginal natives&quot; in the Australian Constitution did not include half-caste individuals. This definition was carried forward into the first federal welfare legislation, such as the Deakin government&#x27;s &quot;Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act 1908&quot; and the Fisher government&#x27;s &quot;Maternity Allowance Act 1912&quot;, which made half-castes eligible to receive old-age pensions and maternity allowances but excluded individuals &quot;who are Asiatic, or are aboriginal natives of Australia, Papua or the Pacific Islands&quot;.

The term was not merely a term of legal convenience; it became a term of common cultural discourse. Christian missionary John Harper, investigating the possibility of establishing of a Christian mission at Batemans Bay, New South Wales, wrote that half-castes and anyone with any Aboriginal connections were considered &quot;degraded as to divine things, almost on a level with a brute, in a state of moral unfitness for heaven&quot;.

The term &quot;Half-Caste Act&quot; was given to Acts of Parliament passed in Victoria and Western Australia allowing the seizure of half-caste children and forcible removal from their parents. This was theoretically to provide them with better homes than those afforded by typical Aboriginal people, where they could grow up to work as domestic servants and for social engineering. The removed children are now known as the Stolen Generations. Other Australian Parliament acts on half-castes and Aboriginal people enacted between 1909 and 1943 were often called &quot;Welfare Acts&quot;, but they deprived these people of basic civil, political, and economic rights, and made it illegal to enter public places such as pubs and government institutions, marry, or meet relatives.

===British Central Africa===

In British Central Africa, now part of modern-day Malawi and Zimbabwe, people of multiracial descent were referred to as half-castes. These unions were considered socially improper, with mixed couples being segregated and shunned by society at large, and colonial courts passing legislation against mixed marriages.

===Burma===

In Burma, a half-caste (or &quot;Kabya&quot;) was anyone with mixed ethnicity from Burmese and British, or Burmese and Indian. During the period of colonial rule, half-caste people were ostracised and criticised in Burmese literary and political media. For example, a local publication in 1938 published the following:

Similarly, Pu Gale in 1939 wrote &quot;Kabya Pyatthana&quot; (literally: The Half-Caste Problem), censured Burmese women for enabling half-caste phenomenon, with the claim, &quot;a Burmese woman’s degenerative intercourse with an Indian threatened a spiraling destruction of Burmese society.&quot; Such criticism was not limited to a few isolated instances, or just against Burmese girls (&quot;thet khit thami&quot;), Indians and British husbands. Starting in early 1930s through 1950s, there was an explosion of publications, newspaper articles and cartoons with such social censorship. Included in the criticism were Chinese-Burmese half-castes.

Prior to the explosion in censorship of half-castes in early-20th-century Burma, Thant claims inter-cultural couples such as Burmese-Indian marriages were encouraged by the local population. The situation began to change as colonial developments, allocation of land, rice mills and socio-economic privileges were given to European colonial officials and to Indians who migrated to Burma thanks to economic incentives passed by the Raj. In the late 19th century, the colonial administration viewed intermarriage as a socio-cultural problem. The colonial administration issued circulars prohibiting European officials from conjugal liaisons with Burmese women. In Burma, as in other colonies in Southeast Asia, intimate relations between native women and European men, and the half-caste progeny of such unions were considered harmful to the white minority rule founded upon carefully maintained racial hierarchies.

===China===
While the term &quot;half-caste&quot; tends to evoke the understanding of it referring to the offspring of two persons of two different pure bloods or near pure bloods, in other languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, the words &quot;half-caste&quot; and &quot;mixed ethnicity&quot; or &quot;multi-ethnic&quot; are the same word, &quot;hun-xue&quot; (混血).

===Fiji===

Fijian people of mixed descent were called half-caste, &quot;kailoma&quot; or &quot;vasu&quot;. European and Indian immigrants started migrating to Fiji and intermarrying during the period of colonial rule. The colonial government viewed this as a &quot;race problem&quot;, as it created a privileged underclass of semi-Europeans who lived on the social fringes in the colonial ordering of Fiji. This legacy continues to affect the ethnic and racial discourse in Fiji.

&quot;Kailomas&quot; or &quot;vasus&quot; were children born to a Fijian native and European or indentured laborers brought in by the colonial government to work on sugarcane plantations over a century ago. Over the generations, these half-caste people experienced social shunning and poor treatment from the colonial government, which became determined in herding citizens into separate, tidy, racial boxes, which led to the separation of Fijian mixed-bloods from their natural families.

===Indian subcontinent===
Historically, the inter-marriage between men and women of different Indian castes was condemned to prevent half-castes, called Pratiloma and Anuloma.

===Malaysia===
&quot;Half-caste&quot; in Malaysia referred to Eurasians and other people of mixed descents. They were also commonly referred to as hybrids, and in certain sociological literature the term hybridity is common.

With Malaysia experiencing a wave of immigrations from China, the Middle East, India, and southeast Asia, and a wave of different colonial powers (Portuguese, Dutch, English), many other terms have been used for half-castes. Some of these include &quot;cap-ceng&quot;, &quot;half-breed&quot;, &quot;mesticos&quot;. These terms are considered pejorative.

Half-castes of Malaya and other European colonies in Asia have been part of non-fiction and fictional works. Brigitte Glaser notes that the half-caste characters in literary works of the 18th through 20th century were predominantly structured with prejudice, as degenerate, low, inferior, deviant or barbaric. Ashcroft in his review considers the literary work structure as consistent with morals and values of colonial era where the European colonial powers considered people from different ethnic groups as unequal by birth in their abilities, character and potential, where laws were enacted that made sexual relations and marriage between ethnic groups as illegal.

===New Zealand===
The term &quot;half-caste&quot; to classify people based on their birth and ancestry became popular in New Zealand from the early 19th century. Terms such as &quot;Anglo-New Zealander&quot; suggested by John Polack in 1838, &quot;Utu Pihikete&quot; and &quot;Huipaiana&quot; were alternatively but less used.

===South Africa===

Sociological literature on South Africa, including the pre-colonial, colonial and apartheid eras, refers to half-caste as anyone born from admixing of White and people of color. An alternate, less common term, for half-caste was &quot;Mestizzo&quot; (conceptually similar to Mestizo in Latin American colonies).

&quot;Griqua&quot; (Afrikaans: &quot;Griekwa&quot;) is another term for half-caste people from intermixing in South Africa and Namibia.

People of mixed descent, the half-caste, were considered inferior and slaves by birth in the 19th-century hierarchically arranged, closed colonial social stratification system of South Africa. This was the case even if the father or mother of half-caste person was a European.

Also, during the apartheid eras, Indians were treated as the upper middle class that was virtually superior to half-caste Coloureds.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, the term when used primarily applies to those of mixed Black and White parentage, although can extend to those of differing heritages as well.

Sociologist Peter J. Aspinall argues that the term was coined by 19th-century British colonial administrations, and eventually started to be used as a descriptor of multiracial Britons in the 20th century who had partial white ancestry. From the 1920s to 1960s, Aspinall argues it was &quot;used in Britain as a derogatory racial category associated with the moral condemnation of &#x27;miscegenation.

The National Union of Journalists has stated that the term half-caste is considered offensive today. The union&#x27;s guidelines for race reporting instructs journalists to &quot;avoid words that, although common in the past, are now considered offensive&quot;. NHS Editorial guidance states documents should &quot;Avoid offensive and stereotyping words such as coloured, half-caste and so forth&quot;.

==Half-caste in other colonial empires==
The term &quot;half-caste&quot; was common in British colonies, however it was not exclusive to the British Empire. Other colonial empires such as Spain devised terms for mixed-race children. The Spanish colonies devised a complex system of castas, consisting of mulattos, mestizos, and many other descriptors. French colonies used terms such as Métis, while the Portuguese used the term &quot;mestiço&quot;. French colonies in the Caribbean referred to half-caste people as &quot;Chabine&quot; (female) and &quot;Chabin&quot; (male). Before the American Civil War, the term &quot;mestee&quot; was commonly applied in the United States to certain people of mixed descent.

Other terms in use in colonial era for half-castes included creole, casco, cafuso, caburet, cattalo, citrange, griffe, half blood, half-bred, half-breed, high yellow, hinny, hybrid, ladino, liger, mamaluco, mixblood, mixed-blood, mongrel, mule, mustee, octoroon, plumcot, quadroon, quintroon, sambo, tangelo, xibaro. The difference between these terms of various European colonies usually was the race, ethnicity or caste of the father and the mother.

Ann Laura Stoler has published a series of reviews of half-caste people and ethnic intermixing during the colonial era of human history. She states that colonial control was predicated on identifying who was white and who was native, which children could become citizens of the empire while who remained the subjects of the empire, who had hereditary rights of a progeny and who did not. This was debated by colonial administrators, then triggered regulations by the authorities. At the start of colonial empires, mostly males from Europe and then males of indentured laborers from India, China and southeast Asia went on these distant trips; in these early times, intermixing was accepted, approved and encouraged. Over time, differences were emphasised, and the colonial authorities proceeded to restrict, then disapprove and finally forbid sexual relationships between groups of people to maintain so-called purity of blood and limit inheritable rights.

<doc id="447779" wikidata="Q2995015" url="?curid=447779" title="Education in Singapore">
<text>Education in Singapore is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE). It controls the development and administration of state schools receiving taxpayers&#x27; funding, but also has an advisory and supervisory role in respect of private schools. For both private and state schools, there are variations in the extent of autonomy in their curriculum, scope of taxpayers&#x27; aid and funding, tuition burden on the students, and admission policy.

Education spending usually makes up about 20 per cent of the annual national budget, which subsidises state education and government-assisted private education for Singaporean citizens and funds the Edusave programme. Non-citizens bear significantly higher costs of educating their children in Singapore government and government-aided schools. In 2000, the Compulsory Education Act codified compulsory education for children of primary school age (excepting those with disabilities), and made it a criminal offence for parents to fail to enroll their children in school and ensure their regular attendance. Exemptions are allowed for homeschooling or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.

The main language of instruction in Singapore is English, which was officially designated the first language within the local education system in 1987. English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach primary school. Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as secondary schools under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP), encourage a richer use of the mother tongue and may occasionally teach subjects in Mandarin Chinese.

Singapore&#x27;s education system has been consistently ranked as one of the highest in the world by the OECD. It is believed that this comes from the style of teaching that is implemented in Singapore. Teachers focus on making sure that each of their students thoroughly move through the syllabus before moving on. By doing this teachers in Singapore teach a much more narrow but deeper type of instruction. Furthermore, it has been described as &quot;world-leading&quot; and in 2010 was among those picked out for commendation by the Conservative former UK Education Secretary Michael Gove. According to PISA, an influential worldwide study on educational systems, Singapore has the highest performance in international education and tops in global rankings. In 2020, Singaporean students made up half of the perfect scorers in the International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations worldwide.

==History==
===Pre-independence===
Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles founded the Singapore Institution (now known as Raffles Institution) in 1823, thereby starting education in Singapore under the British rule. Later, three main types of schools appeared in Singapore: Malay schools, Chinese and Tamil (together) schools, and English schools. Malay schools were provided free for all students by the British, while English schools, which used English as the main medium of instruction, were set up by missionaries and charged school fees. Chinese and Tamil schools largely taught their respective mother tongues. Students from Chinese schools in particular were extremely attuned to developments in China, especially in the rise of Chinese nationalism.

During World War II, many students in Singapore dropped out of school, causing a huge backlog of students after the war. In 1947, the Ten Years Programme for Education Policy in the Colony of Singapore was formulated. This called for a universal education system that would prepare for self-governance. During the 1950s and 1960s, when Singapore started to develop its own economy, Singapore adapted a &quot;survival-driven education&quot; system to provide a skilled workforce for Singapore&#x27;s industrialisation programme as well as to lower unemployment. Apart from being an economic necessity, education also helped to integrate the new nation together. The bilingualism policy in schools was officially introduced in 1960, making English the official language for both national integration and utilitarian purposes. Universal education for children of all races and background started to take shape, and more children started to attend schools. However, the quality of schools set up during this time varied considerably. The first Junior College was opened in 1969.

===Post-independence===
Education has always represented an area of focus for Singapore since its independence in 1965. Its emphasis on education partly reflects Singapore&#x27;s virtual lack of natural resources and Singapore&#x27;s need to develop its human resource and manpower capability in its continuing quest to build a knowledge-based economy.

In the 1980s, Singapore&#x27;s economy started to prosper, and the focus of Singapore&#x27;s education system shifted from quantity to quality. More differentiation for pupils with different academic abilities were implemented, such as revamping vocational education under the new Institute of Technology and splitting of the Normal stream in secondary schools into Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams. The Gifted Education Programme was also set up to cater to more academically inclined students.
In 1997, the Singapore education system started to change into an ability-driven one after then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong outlined his &quot;Thinking Schools, Learning Nations&quot; vision. Under this policy, more emphasis was given to national education, creative thinking, collaborative learning as well as ICT literacy. Schools became more diverse and were given greater autonomy in deciding their own curriculum and developing their own niche areas. Differences between the various academic streams became blurred. The Ministry of Education also officially acknowledged that &quot;excellence&quot; will not be measured solely in terms of academics; a mountain range of excellence – with many peaks&quot;.

In recent years, the goal of the education sector, particularly tertiary education, has moved beyond simply building local manpower capabilities, and is actively being developed by the Singapore government as a source of revenue. The government&#x27;s plan, which was initiated in 2002, is to make Singapore a &quot;Global Schoolhouse&quot;, attracting revenue-generating international students. In 2002, the education sector accounted for 3.6% of Singapore&#x27;s economy. The government&#x27;s aim was to grow this sector to 5% of Singapore&#x27;s economy over the subsequent decade.

==School grades==
The school year is divided into four terms. The first begins at the beginning of January and ends in Week 2 of March; the second begins in Week 3 of March and ends in the end of May; the third begins in July and ends in the first week of September, and the final term begins on the 2nd or 3rd week of September and ends in mid-November.
==Kindergartens==
Kindergartens in Singapore provide up to three years of pre-school for children ages three to six. The three years are commonly called &quot;Nursery&quot;, &quot;Kindergarten 1&quot; (K1) and &quot;Kindergarten 2&quot; (K2), respectively.

Kindergartens provide an environment for children to learn how to interact with others, and to prepare them for formal education at Primary school. Activities include learning language – written and oral – and numbers, development of personal and social skills, games, music, and outdoor play. Children learn two languages, English and their official Mother Tongue (Mandarin, Malay, or Tamil). Many private or church-based kindergartens might not offer Malay and/or Tamil, so non-Chinese pupils might also learn some Standard Mandarin in these kindergartens.

The kindergartens are run by the private sector, including community foundations, religious bodies, and civic or business groups. There are more than 200 kindergartens registered with Early Childhood Development Agency. Kindergartens are also run by child care centres as well as international schools.

The People&#x27;s Action Party, which has governed Singapore since 1957, runs over 370 kindergartens through its charitable arm, the PAP Community Foundation.

==Primary education==
Primary education, normally starting at age seven, is a four-year &quot;foundation stage&quot; (Primary 1 to 4) and a two-year &quot;orientation stage&quot; (Primary 5 to 6). Primary education is compulsory under the Compulsory Education Act since 2003. Exemptions are made for pupils who are homeschooling, attending a full-time religious institution or those with special needs who are unable to attend mainstream schools. However, parents have to meet the requirements set out by the Ministry of Education before these exemptions are granted. Students have to take a test at Primary 4 to determine whether they could remain homeschooled. Primary education is free for all Singapore citizens in schools under the purview of the Ministry of Education, though there is a monthly miscellaneous fee of up to SGD 13 per student. From 2020 it was announced that there would be a cap of 25–30% for Permanent Resident children entering into 10 primary schools which had PR admissions close to 25 to 30 per cent. This was to keep the concentration of PR children low and allow more interaction between citizens and PRs.

The &quot;foundation stage&quot; is the first stage of formal schooling. The four years, from primary 1 to 4, provide a foundation in English, mother tongue (which includes Standard Mandarin, Malay, Tamil or a Non-Tamil Indian Language (NTIL), such as Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali), Mathematics and Science. Other subjects include Civics and Moral Education, arts and crafts, music, health education, social studies, and physical education, which are taught throughout Primary 1 to 6. Science is taught from Primary 3 (age 9) onwards.

English is taught as a first language in primary school, with the Ministry of Education choosing to do so as English is the lingua franca of international business, science and technology. Therefore, a strong foundation in the English Language is considered an essential skill to develop. Bilingualism is considered a cornerstone of Singapore&#x27;s education system, and all students are required to choose a second, Mother Tongue Language (Chinese Language, Malay Language or Tamil Language) on enrolment into Primary school, to ensure that students can in future, tap the opportunities that can be found in the global environment. Exemptions are available for students whose native language is not an available Mother Tongue language (such as Nepali). With more Primary 1 students coming from households where English is the dominant language spoken at home, the Ministry of Education has continued to refine the teaching of Mother Tongue Languages, with greater emphasis on listening and speaking skills.

All pupils advance to the orientation stage after Primary 4, where they are streamed according to the pupil&#x27;s ability. The streaming system has been adjusted: previously, pupils were divided at Primary 5 to the EM1, EM2 and EM3 (English and Mother Tongue at 1st, 2nd and 3rd language respectively) streams, but since 2008 they are streamed according to subject under a scheme known as &quot;Subject-based banding&quot;. Students take subjects at different levels based on their scores in the respective subjects at the end of Primary 4. The Mother Tongue subjects are offered at the higher, standard or foundation levels; Science and Maths can be taken at the standard or foundation levels.

After six years of Primary education, students will have to sit for the national Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Students will then choose the secondary school of their choice based on their results at this examination; they will then be assigned to a secondary school based on merit and their choice. Students are also admitted into a secondary school under a separate &quot;Direct School Admission&quot; scheme, whereby secondary schools are able to choose a certain number of students based on their special talents before these students take the PSLE. Students admitted under this scheme cannot select their schools based on their PSLE results.

===Gifted Education Programme===

The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) was set up by the Ministry of Education in 1984 to cater to the intellectually gifted students. This programme aims to develop gifted children to their top potential and it places a special emphasis on higher-order thinking and creative thought. There are currently 9 primary schools offering the Gifted Education Programme: Anglo-Chinese School, Catholic High School, Henry Park Primary School, Nan Hua Primary School, Nanyang Primary School, Rosyth School, Tao Nan School, St. Hilda&#x27;s Primary School and Raffles Girls&#x27; Primary School. The Secondary School Gifted Education Programme was discontinued at the end of 2008 as more students take the Integrated Programme (IP); this has been replaced by a &quot;School-Based Gifted Education&quot; programme.

Pupils enter the programme through a series of tests at Primary 3, which will identify the top 1% of the student population. In the programme, pupils are offered special enrichment programmes to cater for their needs. However, GEP students are still required to take the national Primary School Leaving Examination like other mainstream students.

==Secondary education==


Based on results of the PSLE, students are placed into three different secondary education tracks or streams: &quot;Express&quot;, &quot;Normal (Academic)&quot;, or &quot;Normal (Technical)&quot; till 2023. From 2024, students will be divided into G1, G2 and G3, according to the Subject-Based Banding scheme. Singaporean citizens are forbidden to attend international schools on the island without Ministry of Education permission.

&quot;Express&quot; is a four-year course leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O Level examination. The difference between these two courses is that in the &quot;Special&quot; stream, students take &#x27;Higher Mother Tongue&#x27; (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of &#x27;Mother Tongue&#x27;. A pass (D7 or higher) in the Higher Mother Tongue &#x27;O&#x27; Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students will have to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their &#x27;O&#x27; Levels to take the &#x27;A&#x27; Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE&#x27;s requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme). Mother Tongue teachers conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, even if the student&#x27;s Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5, a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered better, if they meet set benchmarks. The Ministry of Education Language Centre (MOELC) provides free language education for most additional languages that other schools may not cover, and provides the bulk of such education, admitting several thousand students each year.

&quot;Normal (Academic)&quot; is a four-year course leading up to the Normal (Academic) level (N(A)-level) exam, with the possibility of a fifth year leading up to the GCE O-level exam. The Normal (Academic) course is geared towards preparing students for the O-level exam in the fifth year, subject to good performance in the N(A)-level exam in the fourth year, and students take academic subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal (Academic) course would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N(A)-level exam.

&quot;Normal (Technical)&quot; is a four-year course leading up to the Normal (Technical) level (N(T)-level) exam. In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) after the N(T)-level exam in the fourth year.

With the exception of schools offering the Integrated Programme, which leads to either an International Baccalaureate Diploma or to an A-level exam, most students are streamed into a wide range of course combinations at the end of their second year, bringing the total number of subjects they have to sit at O-level to between six and ten, with English, Mother Tongue or Higher Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, one Science and one Humanities Elective being compulsory. Several new subjects such as Computing and Theatre Studies and Drama are being introduced in tandem with the Ministry of Education&#x27;s revised curriculum.

===Co-Curricular activities===

Unlike in primary or post-secondary levels, participating in a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is required in secondary school, meaning that all pupils participate in at least one CCA. CCAs offered at the secondary level are usually categorised as Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Clubs &amp; Societies and Physical Sports. There are many CCAs offered at the secondary school level; however, different schools may choose to offer different CCAs. Students may choose to participate in more than 1 CCA.

Participation in CCAs is graded together with other non-academic achievements throughout a student&#x27;s secondary school education in a scoring system known as LEAPS 2.0. (LEAPS 1.0 was abolished and the cohort of 2016 taking the &#x27;O&#x27; level examination would be last to use this system). Points accumulated in the areas of leadership, achievement, participation and service (under LEAPS 2.0) will determine a student&#x27;s CCA grade. Students may get up to a maximum of two bonus points for entry into a junior college depending on their CCA grades.
LEAPS 2.0 is about leadership, achievement, participation and service. The method of calculating the 2 bonus points is very different, with LEAPS 2.0 making it harder to achieve the 2 bonus points.

=== Special Assistance Plan (SAP) ===
The Special Assistance Plan (SAP) () is a special programme established in 1979 that caters to academically strong students who excel in both their mother tongue as well as English. It allows students to undertake English language and Chinese language at first language standard with a widened exposure to the Chinese culture and values. The programme is offered in designated schools that are recognised for its preservation of strong Chinese cultural heritage and academic excellence. Currently, there are a total of 15 primary schools and 11 high schools being accorded SAP status.

Before the educational reforms in the 2000s, students had to achieve a PSLE aggregate score in the top 10% of their cohort, with an A grade for both mother tongue and English, to be entitled to enter an SAP school under the Special academic stream. Currently, students are entitled up to 3 additional bonus points when applying for SAP secondary schools with their Higher Chinese Paper Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results. Since its founding, there have only been SAP schools for students studying the Chinese language.

===Integrated Programme===


The Integrated Programme, also known as the &quot;Through-Train Programme&quot; (), is a scheme which allows secondary students in Singapore to bypass &quot;O&quot; levels (except for those taking Higher Mother Tongue) and take A levels, International Baccalaureate Diploma or an equivalent examination directly at the age of 18 after six years of secondary education.

The programme allows for more time to be allocated to enrichment activities. By bypassing the GCE O level examinations, students are given more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broadly-based education. In addition, students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects between Year 1 – 4 as compared to their non-IP counterparts. Generally, only the top performers from Express stream are eligible to be part of the IP programme. This will ensure that the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at their own pace by first completing a 4-year O level course before going on to a 2-year A level education.

As a result, Integrated Programme schools allow their students to skip the O levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year 5/JC1. The Integrated Programme with the revised Singapore-Cambridge GCE A levels or the IB Diploma as a terminal qualification has become an increasingly popular alternative to the standard secondary education pathway. This is because it is perceived as having moved away from the usually heavy emphasis on the sciences, a phenomenon resulting from the post-independence need for quick and basic technical and industrial education; to subjects in the arts and humanities. Such programmes are more project-based and students are expected to be independent learners.

The first batch of IP students sat for the revised GCE A Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations in 2007.

=== Specialised Independent Schools (SIS) ===
Specialised Independent Schools offer specialised education with different focuses. There are currently four specialised schools in Singapore.

* NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, focuses on Mathematics, Science, Technology and Engineering.
* School of Science and Technology, Singapore, focuses on applied learning in Science, Technology, Aesthetics, Engineering and Mathematics.
* School of the Arts, Singapore, focuses on Visual, Literary and Performing Arts.
* Singapore Sports School, focuses on Sports and Athletics.

===Admission to post-secondary institutions===
Upon completion of the 4- or 5-year secondary school education, students (excluding IP students) will participate in the annual O level exam, the results of which determine which post-secondary institutions they may apply for. The O Level subject grades range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst).

Pre-university centres include junior colleges for a two-year course leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A Level or the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or the Millennia Institute for a three-year course leading up to the A Level. Pre-university centres accept students on merit, with a greater emphasis on academics than applied education.

Admission to a two-year pre-university course at junior colleges after graduating from secondary school is determined by the L1R5 (English + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the &#x27;first language&#x27; level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. Students scoring 20 points and below may be admitted for either a Science or Arts course.

For admission to a three-year pre-university course at the Millennia Institute, the L1R4 (English + 4 relevant subjects) scoring system is used, and students are required to score below 20 points to be admitted. Students may opt for any of the science, arts or commerce streams when pursuing the three-year pre-university course.

Students who wish to pursue specialised education go on to polytechnics or arts institutions where they receive a diploma upon successful completion of their courses. Polytechnics accept students on merit, with a greater emphasis on applied education than academics.

Admission to a three-year polytechnic course after graduating from secondary school is determined by the ELR2B2 (English language + 2 relevant subjects + 2 best subjects) scoring system. The candidate adds the numerical grades for five different subjects: English language, two relevant subjects related to the course of choice in polytechnic, and two other subjects of any kind. Students scoring 26 points and below may be admitted for a polytechnic course.

In 2017, about 47% of the annual school cohort was given a place in polytechnic, about 28% of the annual school cohort was given a place in JC/MI. About 38% of the Joint Application Exercise cohort was admitted to JC/MI in 2020, this figure does not account for Integrated Programme students who are directly admitted to JC1. About 45% of the Joint Application Exercise cohort applying to polytechnic qualified for JC in 2020. About 44% of O level students entered JC in 2022.

MI had around 700 students in 2023, spread over its 3 levels of MI1 to MI3. About 14,000 students were given a place in ITE in 2017.

In 2023 about 80% of the A level and IB population enrolled in a place in a local university, up from about 75% in 2015. In 2016 about 70% of the JC population secured a place in a local university. From 2019 to 2021 about 40% to slightly over 50% of MI students qualified for local university. In 2023 about 33% of polytechnic students entered local university. The polytechnic GPA required to qualify for local university requires more consistent performance to obtain than qualifying A level grades.

The Ministry of Education intends to raise the lifetime cohort participation rate in local universities to 60% by 2025 from the 50% rate in 2023. In 2022 about 47% of the O level batch (secondary 4 express and secondary 5 NA) students entered NUS/NTU.

==Special education==
Deaf students who must use sign language to communicate may enroll in any mainstream primary school, effective 2018. Previously they were required to enroll at two special schools. Secondary deaf students who do not need to use sign language to communicate may enroll at Saint Anthony&#x27;s Canossian Secondary School and Outram Secondary School, while Beatty Secondary School enrolls secondary students who must use sign language to communicate.

A British woman established the Oral School for the Deaf in 1953, and in 1954 the Chinese Sign School for the Deaf was established by a married couple. The Canossian School for the Deaf was established by Italian women afterward. The Canossian school later changed its name to Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired. Historically the sole secondary school for deaf and partially deaf children was Mount Vernon Secondary School (MVSS). Singapore School for the Deaf opened in 1963.

In 1991 the deaf students were enrolled at Upper Serangoon Secondary School (USSS) as Mount Vernon closed. In 1996 Boon Lay Secondary School began taking deaf students. In 2016/2017 responsibility for the must use sign language students moved from Balestier Hill Secondary School and Boon Lay to Beatty. The Government of Singapore decided that it was best to concentrate deaf students who must sign to communicate at one school as only about 15 secondary students were in that category. SSD closed in 2017.

=== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ===
Before 2014, Singapore was one of only two countries in ASEAN that was not a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which mandates that persons with disabilities should be guaranteed the right to inclusive education.

Previously, &quot;any child who is unable to attend any national primary school due to any physical or intellectual disability&quot; was exempted from compulsory education, a policy changed in 2016 to make education compulsory for those with special needs from 2019. Another option is the special education schools built largely by the Ministry of Education and run by social service agencies. These schools receive more than 80% of their funding from the Ministry of Education, but have long waiting lists, according to Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim. The Singapore government has asserted that only &quot;a very small number of children do not attend school each year&quot;, giving a figure of 8 students as compared to a primary school intake of roughly 43,000, and that requiring all special needs children to attend school would &quot;impose unduly harsh requirements on their parents.&quot; This practice has been described as a &quot;form of discrimination&quot; by Sylvia Lim.

The Convention was ratified in July 2013, and made effective on 18 August the same year.

==Junior colleges and centralised institutes==
The pre-university centres of Singapore such as Junior Colleges and Centralized institute are designed for students who wish to pursue a local university degree after two to three years of pre-university education.

There are 19 Junior Colleges (JCs) and a Centralised Institute (CI), the Millennia Institute (MI, established 2004), with the National Junior College (NJC, established 1969) being the oldest and Eunoia Junior College (EJC, established 2017) the newest.

===Junior colleges===

Junior colleges (JCs) in Singapore were initially designed to offer an accelerated alternative to the traditional three-year programme, but the two-year programme has since become the norm for students pursuing university education.

JCs accept students based on their GCE &quot;O&quot; Level results; an L1R5 score of 20 points or less must be attained for a student to gain admission. JCs provide a 2-year course leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level (A level) examination or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.

===Centralised Institutes===

The Centralised Institutes accept students based on their GCE O level results. Their L1R4 score must be 20 points or below in order to be admitted. A Centralised Institute provides a three-year course leading up to the GCE A level examination. There were originally four Centralized Institutes: Outram Institute, Townsville Institute, Jurong Institute and Seletar Institute. Townsville Institute and Seletar Institute stopped accepting new students after the 1995 school year and closed down after the last batch of students graduated in 1997.

There currently remains only one Centralised Institute in Singapore, the Millennia Institute, which was formed following the merger of Jurong and Outram Institutes. Additionally, only Centralised Institutes offer the Commerce Stream offering subjects such as Principles of Accounting and Management of Business. The standard of teaching and curriculum is identical to that of the Junior Colleges.

==Polytechnics==

The first polytechnic in Singapore, Singapore Polytechnic, was established in 1954. Ngee Ann Polytechnic, has roots that go back to 1963. Two other polytechnics, Temasek Polytechnic and Nanyang Polytechnic were established in the 1990s. The most recent, Republic Polytechnic was established in 2003.

Polytechnics in Singapore provide 3-year diploma courses. They accept students based on their GCE O Level, GCE N(A) Level, Institute of Technical Education (ITE) or GCE A level results.

Polytechnics offer a wide range of courses in various fields, including engineering, business studies, accountancy, tourism and hospitality management, mass communications, digital media and biotechnology. There are also specialised courses such as marine engineering, nautical studies, nursing, and optometry. They provide a more industry-oriented education as an alternative to junior colleges for post-secondary studies. About 40% of each Secondary 4 cohort would enroll in Polytechnics. Notable alumni from Polytechnics in Singapore include former NUS President Dr Shih Choon Fong and CEO of Creative Technology Sim Wong Hoo.

Most graduates of polytechnics continue to pursue further tertiary education at overseas and local universities. Those with good grades are given exemptions for university modules completed in Polytechnic, notably universities in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

==Institute of Technical Education==
Initially, vocational education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was looked down upon as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as vocational education was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational education was regarded low quality and typically out of step with the changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to realise that there are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country&#x27;s economic and financial development. Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore&#x27;s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. Vocational schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended to revolutionise vocational education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of vocational skills being translated to a 21st-century knowledge-based economy.

The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) is a vocational school that accepts students based on their GCE &quot;O&quot; level or GCE &quot;N&quot; level results and they provide two-year courses leading to a locally recognised &quot;National ITE Certificate&quot;. There are three ITE colleges in Singapore. Only a few ITE graduates will be able to continue their education at polytechnics and arts institutions which then, if possible goes on to a university. ITE colleges offer apprenticeships for the skilled trades and diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. The ITE is highly recognised vocational institution in producing highly skilled graduates that are in demand by employers. Salaries for ITE graduates, who receive a National ITE Certificate (NITEC) or a diploma have also become quite high. ITE provides apprenticeships, professional certificates, licences and diplomas in business administration, accountancy, woodworking, metalworking, carpentry, drafting, shipbuilding and repairing, transportation and engineering science. As of 2014, 87% of ITE graduates are hired in their fields within six months of graduation, leading more students to see vocational education as a strong alternative besides the traditional route of going to university.

ITE provides five main levels of certification:
* Higher National ITE Certificate (Higher Nitec)
* National ITE Certificate (Nitec)
* Work Learn Technical Diploma (WLTD) (From 2017)
* Specialist Nitec (Marine) 
* Technical Engineer Diploma (TED) (from 2007)

==University of the Arts Singapore==

In March 2021, Minister for Education Lawrence Wong announced that Singapore’s first arts university would be established in an alliance between the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts, in a system akin to the University of the Arts, London. University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) was established in 2023 as a collegiate university with both colleges under the umbrella university and has been given degree-awarding powers independent of their previous foreign partners, where the long-distance degrees were issued through foreign universities. Singaporean citizens and permanent residents enrolled in the approved degree programmes at the university of the arts will pay subsidised fees like those at autonomous universities.

The seventh local university in Singapore, it is the only publicly-funded private university other than the now-defunct SIM University in Singapore and also the only university of the arts with degree-conferring powers. It has two constituent colleges, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and the LASALLE College of the Arts.

Constituent colleges:
* Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts
* LASALLE College of the Arts

==Universities==
===Autonomous Universities===
Singapore has six autonomous universities, namely the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Management University, Singapore University of Technology &amp; Design, Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore University of Social Sciences.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have over 30,000 students each and provide a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes including doctoral degrees. Both are established research universities with thousands of research staff and graduate students. As of 2022, both universities are ranked among the Top 20 in the world by QS World University Rankings and Top 40 globally by THE World University Rankings.

A third university, Singapore Management University (SMU), opened in 2000, is home to more than 7,000 students and comprises six Schools offering undergraduate, graduate, and PhD programmes in Business Management, Accountancy, Economics, Information Systems Management, Law and the Social Sciences. The University has an Office of Research, a number of institutes and centres of excellence, and provides public and customised programmes for working professionals through its Office of Executive and Professional Education.

The government has planned the fourth autonomous university, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), to meet the rising demand for university education. SUTD started its operations in April 2012. Its permanent campus at Changi was opened in early 2015.

A fifth autonomous university Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) was announced in 2009. The institution started in 2010 and is intended to provide an upgrading pathway for polytechnic and arts institution graduates.

In 2017, Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) was declared as the country&#x27;s sixth autonomous public university. The university was previously established in 2005 as SIM University by the SIM Group. Thereafter, it underwent restructuring and is currently under the ambit of the Ministry of Education.

===Private Education Institutions===
Foreign universities that have set up campuses or centres of excellence in Singapore include INSEAD, ESSEC, S P Jain School of Global Management, DigiPen Institute of Technology LSBF Singapore Campus, Technische Universität München, Sorbonne-Assas International Law School, Curtin Singapore and James Cook University Singapore.

Other foreign universities offer external degree programmes (EDPs) through private education institutions such as Singapore Institute of Management, Management Development Institute of Singapore and PSB Academy. Universities such as the University of London, RMIT University, Southern Cross University, Queen Margaret University &amp; Cardiff Metropolitan University have established such external degree programmes in Singapore to provide local and foreign (in particular, Asian) students the opportunity to obtain a Western university education at a fraction of the cost it would take to study in Canada, the UK, the USA or Australia.

==International and private schools==
Because of its large expatriate community, Singapore is host to many international schools, currently numbering 80, across predominantly four main curricula groups: British, IB, American and Indian. Over half of these (44) are either UK curriculum based (specifically the curriculum of England and Wales), or a blend of UK (until 16 with the I/GCSE) and the International Baccalaureate (for post-16 study). The IB Diploma programme has gained global popularity in recent years, and Singapore has been susceptible to its charms. There are now 26 schools in Singapore offering the IB Diploma, and 10 schools offering what is seen by many as its alternative, the A Level.

Singapore has not seen the international school growth as some of its city rivals, like Dubai, although 2020 sees the spark of competition with the arrival of Brighton College, The Perse School, One World International School (Mountbatten), Invictus International Centrium, and North London Collegiate School. COVID-19 issues aside, this will be welcome relief to parents (although not necessarily schools) where waiting lists for the top schools have, historically, been long - often measured in years. This has especially been the case in the country&#x27;s &quot;top&quot; international schools, although given there are no independent inspections, being seen to be a top-tier school has been driven largely by reputation and word of mouth, that is what parents think are the &quot;best&quot; international schools, become the best schools as these are able to take on the best students - even if the majority of schools claim to be non-selective.

International schools serve a largely expatriate audience, as much by necessity as choice given international and private schools in Singapore generally are not allowed to admit Singapore students without permission from the Ministry of Education.

However, on 29 April 2004 the Ministry of Education permitted three new international schools to be set up without permission being needed to admit Singapore students. These schools must follow the compulsory policies set by the Ministry such as playing the national anthem and taking the pledge every morning, as well as following the nation&#x27;s policies on bilingualism. These schools – Anglo-Chinese School (International), Hwa Chong International School and SJI International School – are private schools run by the boards of other locally renowned institutions. The school fees are 15 to 20 per cent lower than those of foreign international schools. Their intake includes students from countries such as Malaysia, India, Indonesia, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Philippines, Vietnam, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

Established under the Private Education Act, the Committee for Private Education (CPE, also formerly the Council for Private Education) is a statutory board empowered with the legislative power to regulate the private education sector. In addition to its role as the sectoral regulator of private education institutions, the CPE facilitates capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry.

On 20 May 2010, the CPE has registered the first batch of private education institutions (PEIs) under the Enhanced Registration Framework (ERF). Following the launch of the new private education regulatory regime on 21 December 2009, all PEIs within the regulatory scope of the Private Education Act are required to register with the CPE under the ERF. Under the Enhanced Registration Framework, private institutions must meet requirements relating to their managers, teachers, courses and examination boards. Out of 308 which applied, less than a third were given the stamp of approval and students are relieved that their school has made the mark. Only 63 ERF applications have been evaluated by the CPE, of which 36 PEIs like MDIS, EASB, SDH Institute, SAA Global Education, Coleman College, STEi Institute etc. have been registered for a period of four years ERF, and 26 PEIs have been registered for one year. The registration period awarded to a PEI is dependent on its degree of compliance with the Private Education Regulations.

In addition to the international day school, Singapore&#x27;s Japanese population is served by a weekend education programme, the Japanese Supplementary School Singapore (JSS; シンガポール日本語補習授業校 &quot;Shingapōru Nihongo Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;).

== Madrasahs ==

In Singapore, madrasahs are full-time, religious institutions that offer a pedagogical mix of Islamic religious education and secular education in their curricula. There are currently six madrasahs in Singapore offering primary to tertiary education, namely, Aljunied Al-Islamiah, Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiah, Al-Maarif Al-Islamiah, Alsagoff Al-Arabiah, Al-Arabiah Al-Islamiah, and Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah. Four of them are co-educational, while the other two offer madrasah education exclusively to girls.

Madrasah students take a range of Islamic religious subjects in addition to mainstream curriculum subjects and sit for the PSLE and GCE &#x27;O&#x27; Levels like their peers. They can often be easily identified by their distinctive traditional Malay uniform, including the &quot;songkok&quot; for boys and &quot;tudung&quot; for girls, in stark contrast to national schools that prohibit such religious headgear. Madrasahs are deeply rooted in Singapore&#x27;s history, and prior to Singapore&#x27;s independence, had enjoyed a &quot;golden period&quot; in becoming the centre of Islamic education in the region by producing and attracting many of the prominent Islamic religious scholars. But by the turn of the 21st century, madrasahs were subjected to numerous discussions on the national platform as to their purpose and relevance in contemporary society. There was also a new expectation from the Malay-Muslim community that madrasahs should provide not only religious education, but also academic skills like mathematics, science and English. Madrasahs were forced to adapt and implement sweeping reforms, especially in response to government policies such as the Compulsory Education Act. Today, madrasahs have improved significantly—but challenges pertaining to their funding, curricula and teaching methodologies remain largely unsolved till today.

==Private tuition==
Private tuition is a lucrative industry in Singapore, since many parents send their children for private tuition after school. A straw poll by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; newspaper in 2008 found that out of 100 students interviewed, only 3 students did not have any form of tuition. In 2010, the &quot;Shin Min Daily News&quot; estimated that there were around 540 tuition centres offering private tuition in Singapore. Due to their high demand, tuition centres are able to charge high fees for their services; they have an annual turnover of SGD$110.6 million in 2005. However, this industry is largely unregulated, though tuition centres are required to be registered with the Ministry of Education. There is no such requirement for individual private tutors.

Despite its pervasiveness, private tuition remains a controversial subject in Singapore. Students generally attend tuition classes to improve their weak academic performance. Some parents send their children to such tuition because they are worried that their child would lag behind in class because their classmates have individual tuition themselves, or because they are worried that the teacher does not completely cover the syllabus required for national examinations. Teachers and schools allegedly encouraged weaker students to receive private tuition as well, though the Ministry of Education&#x27;s official stance is that &quot;Teachers should not recommend tuition to students or parents as a form of learning support&quot;. Some students who are doing well academically have had requested to have private tuition to further improve on their grades.

On the other hand, some have criticised the over-reliance on private tuition, saying that students may not pay attention during lessons as they are able to fall back on their tuition classes later. Students may also be unable to find answers on their own, having relied on their tutors for answers during their school years. Some tuition centres reportedly do schoolwork on their students&#x27; behalf. Others have also criticised private tuition for taking up too much of students&#x27; free time. Due to the high cost of tuition, there are concerns that low-income families were unable to send their children for such classes. However, the government has partially subsidised private tuition at certain community bodies for children from low-income families.

The official government stance on private tuition is that &quot;it understands parents want the best for their children and that it is their decision whether to engage tutors&quot;.

==Education policies==

===Meritocracy===
Meritocracy is a fundamental ideology in Singapore and a fundamental principle in the education system which aims to identify and groom bright young students for positions of leadership. The system places a great emphasis on academic performance in grading students and granting their admission to special programmes and universities, though this has raised concerns about breeding elitism. Academic grades are considered as objective measures of the students&#x27; ability and effort, irrespective of their social background. Having good academic credentials is seen as the most important factor for the students&#x27; career prospects in the job market, and their future economic status.

Curricula are therefore closely tied to examinable topics, and the competitiveness of the system has led to a proliferation of &quot;ten-year series&quot;, which are compilation books of past examination papers that students use to prepare for examinations.

===Bilingualism (Mother Tongue)===

Bilingualism, or &quot;mother tongue policy&quot;, is a cornerstone of the Singapore education system. While English is the first language and the medium of instruction in schools, most students are required to take a &quot;Mother Tongue&quot; subject, which could be one of the three official languages: Standard Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. A non-Tamil Indian may choose to offer Tamil or a non-official language such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi or Urdu. However, Chinese students from a non-Mandarin background, such as Cantonese speakers, must learn Mandarin, and students with Indonesian background must learn Malay. Non-Chinese, Malay or Indian students may choose to learn either one of these languages (Usually the Japanese, Koreans and Southeast Asians who are not from Malay or Indonesian origin will choose Chinese). Mother Tongue is a compulsory examinable subject at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and the GCE &quot;N&quot;, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;A&quot; level examinations. Students are required to achieve a certain level of proficiency in what the government considers their mother tongue as a pre-requisite for admission to local universities. Students returning from overseas may be exempted from this policy.

The bilingual policy was first adopted in 1966. One of its primary objectives is to promote English as the common (and neutral) language among the diverse ethnic groups in Singapore. The designation of English as the &quot;first language&quot; is also intended to facilitate Singapore&#x27;s integration into the world economy.

In recognition of Singapore&#x27;s linguistic and cultural pluralism, another stated objective of the bilingual policy is to educate students with their &quot;mother tongues&quot; so that they can learn about their culture, identify with their ethnic roots, and to preserve cultural traits and Asian values. Within the Chinese population, Mandarin is promoted as a common language and other Chinese dialects are discouraged, to better integrate the community. In 1979, the Speak Mandarin Campaign was launched to further advance this goal.

===Financial assistance===
Education policy in Singapore is designed to ensure that no child is disadvantaged because of their financial background. Therefore, school fees in public schools are heavily subsidised. There is no school fee for 6 years of compulsory education in primary school although students still need to pay standard miscellaneous fees of $6.50 per month. Moreover, schools may optionally charge second-tier miscellaneous fees of up to the maximum of $6.50 per month.

The Ministry of Education established the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to provide financial assistance for education to low income families with gross household income of SGD$2,500 or a per capita income of less than SGD$625.00. Students eligible for FAS receive a full waiver of miscellaneous fees, and partial subsidy on national examination fees. They may also enjoy full or partial fee subsidy if they are in Independent Schools.

Each year, the Edusave Merit Bursary (EMB) is given out to about 40,000 students, who are from lower-middle and low-income families and have good academic performance in their schools. Individual schools also have an &quot;Opportunity Fund&quot; to provide for their own needy students. In addition to these, there are many other assistance schemes from either the government or welfare organisations to help students cope with finances during their studies.

Heavy subsidies are given to full-time tertiary students in the form of tuition grants ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per year, depending on their nationality and course of study. For Singapore citizens, the grant is given unconditionally and automatically. Foreign applicants, including permanent residents, are required to work in a Singapore firm for three years upon graduation.

=== SkillsFuture ===
There are four key objectives of the SkillsFuture initiative:

#Helping individuals make well-informed choices in education, training and careers.
#Developing an integrated, high-quality system of education and training that responds to constantly evolving industry needs.
#Promoting employer recognition and career development based on skills and mastery.
#Fostering a culture that supports and celebrates lifelong learning.

The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme allows vocational graduates to be placed in jobs that allow them to receive a salary while engaging in structured on-the-job training. As of 2016, there were a total of 40 Earn and Learn Programmes in Singapore.

==International comparisons==

Singapore students took first place in the 1995, 1999 and 2003 TIMSS Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. They used Singapore Math Primary Mathematics series. The national textbooks have been adapted into a series which has been successfully marketed in North America as a rival to Saxon math and an alternative to controversial reform mathematics curricula, which many parents complained moved too far away from the sort of traditional basic skills instruction exemplified by Singapore&#x27;s national curriculum.
==Assessment==
Critics of the education system argue that the education in Singapore is too specialised, rigid, and elitist. Often, these criticisms state that there is little emphasis on creative thinking. Those defending the current education system point out that Singaporean students have regularly ranked near the top when competing in international science and mathematics competitions and assessments. Critics, however, argue this is more an indication of the institution&#x27;s use of rote learning to prepare for competition or examination than of students&#x27; critical thinking skills.

In response to such concerns the Ministry of Education has recently discussed a greater focus on creative and critical thinking, and on learning for lifelong skills rather than simply teaching students to excel in examinations. Although some efforts of these sorts have been made, many Singaporean children continue to face high pressure by parents and teachers to do well in studies.

Supporters of the system assert that the provision of differentiated curricula according to streams since the late 1970s has allowed students with different abilities and learning styles to develop and sustain an interest in their studies. This ability-driven education has since been a key feature behind Singapore&#x27;s success in education, and was responsible for bringing drop-out rates down sharply.

In recent years, while streaming still exists, various refinements to the policy have been made. There is now greater flexibility for students to cross over different streams or take subjects in other streams, which alleviates somewhat the stigma attached to being in any single stream. Furthermore, the government is now starting to experiment with ability-banding in other ways – such as subject-based banding in Secondary Schools instead of banding by overall academic performance.

<text>Félix Savón Fabre (born 22 September 1967) is a Cuban former amateur boxer who competed from 1980 to 2000. Considered one of the all-time greatest amateurs, he became three-time Olympic gold medalist, and the World Champion six times in a row, all in the heavyweight division. In 1988, when he was favored by many to win the gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Cuban government boycotted the event. Savón is particularly known for having rejected numerous multimillion-dollar offers to defect and leave Cuba permanently to fight Mike Tyson as a professional.

==Early life==
He was born in San Vicente, in Guantánamo Province, Cuba. His ring debut occurred in 1980, in Guantánamo.

Savón&#x27;s inspiration to become a boxer was his renowned countryman, three-time Olympic champion Teófilo Stevenson (he later was perceived by the Western media as Stevenson&#x27;s successor)

==Career==
During his career, in which he did not turn professional, he managed a career record of 362–21, with the majority of his losses avenged. The only boxers, who got away with knockout victories over Savón unavenged were Soviet Usman Arsaliyev and North Korean Li Dal-Chen, whom he met only once.

He won his first important titles in 1985. At 19 he beat America&#x27;s Michael Bentt on his way to win the 1987 Pan Am games. Besides winning the Cuban heavyweight title (which he would win each year until his retirement, except 1999 and 2000 when he lost to Odlanier Solís, who he would lose to twice and defeat once in their three meetings), he also won the Junior World Championships in 1985.

This set off his career, in which he would win six World Championships; his victory at the 1997 tournament was the result of the disqualification of an opponent, future professional world champion Ruslan Chagaev (whom Savón had previously beaten), who beat Savón in the final, but was later stripped of the gold medal for having two professional fights prior to the championships. Chagaev was reinstated as an amateur the following year when these fights were declared exhibitions, but did not regain the gold medal.
In 1998 during the Heavyweight final of the Goodwill Games from New York, Savón had an amazing knockout over U.S. Amateur Champion DaVarryl Williamson. At the 1999 tournament, he was to fight American Michael Bennett in the final, but the whole Cuban team retired from the competition to protest the result of another Cuban boxer in the tournament whom they considered had been &quot;robbed&quot; by the judges, meaning that Bennett won the final on default. In their bout at the 2000 Summer Olympics Bennett would lose 23–8 to Savón.

Savón won three Olympic gold medals, a feat shared with only two other boxers, László Papp and compatriot Teófilo Stevenson. He could have been a four-time Olympic gold medalist, had the Cuban government allowed its team to participate in the 1988 Seoul, South Korea.

Savón&#x27;s critics said that he is a puncher instead of a boxer who is not satisfied with a decision, risking losses by going after knockouts even when he is far ahead on points. Roosevelt Sanders, a U.S. boxing coach, said Savon would have been immediately ranked between 5th and 10th in the world&#x27;s professional boxing heavyweight division if he turned pro after the 1990 Goodwill Games. &quot;Cuba, since 1974 has been the king of amateur boxing in the world&quot;, he said. &quot;That is why the media of other countries keep asking why we don&#x27;t box professionally. Professionalism will abolish humanism and society.&quot; Savon said amateur athletes are revered in Cuba. &quot;Athletes are the most important thing in Cuba since Castro took over. We practice sports from the age of 8.&quot;

===Retirement===
Savón announced his retirement from the ring, but helped train Cuba&#x27;s fighters for the 2004 Athens Olympics.
After winning his third Olympic gold at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Savón announced his retirement at age 33.

==Later life==
In February of the following year with Fidel Castro also present, Savón had the song &quot;You Love Us&quot; dedicated to him by the Manic Street Preachers, who became the first western rock band to play in Cuba.

In 2018, Savón was arrested amid accusations that he had raped an underage boy.

<doc id="447790" wikidata="Q1740429" url="?curid=447790" title="Flag of South Vietnam">
<text>The flag of South Vietnam was first introduced on 2 June 1948, later served as the national flag of the State of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam from 5 June 1948 to 30 April 1975. The design consists of a yellow background with three red horizontal stripes through the middle. It is used to represent the &quot;Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag&quot; by Overseas Vietnamese.

The flag was designed by Lê Văn Đệ in 1948. The flag consists of a yellow field and three horizontal red stripes, and can be explained as emblematic of the common blood running through northern, central, and southern Vietnam.

Although South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam) ceased to exist in 1975, the flag is still represented among private citizens in other countries by some Vietnamese emigrés, particularly in North America and Australia of refugee-descent. Since June 2002, several American governmental bodies adopted resolutions recognizing the former flag as &quot;Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag.&quot;

== History ==
=== Nguyễn dynasty ===

During the reign of Emperor Gia Long (1802–1820), the yellow flag was also used as the symbol of the Empire of Vietnam. This was continued as the emperor&#x27;s flag when the court of Huế became a French protectorate. Later the flag added a red bend on two sides.

After the deportation and exile of the emperors Thành Thái and Duy Tân by the French colonialists, the new pro-French emperor Khải Định introduced new imperial flag as a yellow flag with single horizontal band of red, following the Imperial Order of the Dragon of Annam. Formally known as the &quot;&quot;, the flag was the official flag of the Nguyễn court.

In 1945 with the French ousted by Japan, Prime Minister Trần Trọng Kim of the newly restored Empire of Vietnam adopted another variant of the yellow flag. It included three red bands, but the middle band was broken to form the . Derived from the trigrams, Quẻ Ly is the third of the Bát Quái (the Eight Trigrams – Ba gua): Càn (乾), Đoài (兌), Ly (離), Chấn (震), Tốn (巽), Khảm (坎), Cấn (艮), Khôn (坤). It was chosen to symbolize the sun, fire, light, and civilization. And most importantly, it represents the southern lands under the &quot;Later Heaven&quot; order, that is Vietnam. This flag was used briefly from June to August 1945 when Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated.

=== Provisional Central Government of Vietnam and the State of Vietnam ===
On 2 June 1948, the prime minister of the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam, Brigadier General Nguyễn Văn Xuân, signed the decree with the specifications for the Vietnamese national flag as follows: &quot;The national emblem is a flag of yellow background, the height of which is equal to two-thirds of its width. In the middle of the flag and along its entire width, there are three horizontal red bands. Each band has a height equal to one-fifteenth of the width. These three red bands are separated from one another by a space of the band&#x27;s height.&quot;

The new national flag was raised for the first time on 5 June 1948 on a boat named &quot;Dumont d&#x27;Urville&quot; outside of Hạ Long Bay during the signing of the Halong Bay Agreements (&quot;Accords de la baie d’Along&quot;) by High Commissioner Emile Bollaert and Nguyễn Văn Xuân.

A detailed design of the flag appeared on the newspaper on 3 June 1948, and again on the next day (with correction to the flag ratio). The residents of Hanoi were requested to display the flag at their home on 5 June 1948 to celebrate the Hạ Long Bay event.

When the former emperor Bảo Đại was made chief of state in 1949, this design was adopted as the flag of the State of Vietnam.

The three red bands have the divination sign of &quot;Quẻ Càn&quot;, the first of the Eight Trigrams mentioned above. Quẻ Càn represents heaven. Based on the traditional worldview of the Vietnamese people, Quẻ Càn also denotes the South (as of the &quot;Earlier Heaven&quot; order), the Vietnamese Nation, Vietnamese people, and the people&#x27;s power. Another interpretation places the three red bands as symbols of the three regions of Vietnam: North, Central, and South.

=== Republic of Vietnam and later ===

With the foundation of the republic in 1955, the flag was adopted by the successor state, the Republic of Vietnam (more commonly known as South Vietnam). It was the national flag for the entire duration of that state&#x27;s existence (1955–1975) from the First Republic to the Second Republic. With the capitulation of Saigon on 30 April 1975, the Republic of Vietnam came to an end and the flag ceased to exist as a state symbol. Afterwards, it has been adopted by many in the Vietnamese diaspora to symbolically distance themselves from the Communist government and continues to be used either as an alternative symbol for ethnic unity or as a protest tool against the current government.

In modern Vietnam, even though it is not directly mentioned, the display and usage of the South Vietnamese flag is criminalized under the representation of &quot;Making, storing, spreading information, materials, items for the purpose of opposing the State of Socialist Republic of Vietnam&quot; () alongside other potential convictions related to the violations of national security and anti-State as defined by the country&#x27;s Criminal Code, practically prohibiting the display of the so-called yellow flag beyond reasonable educational purposes and occasions.

==Political significance==

The flag of the former South Vietnam is popular with the case of Vietnamese Americans, Vietnamese Australians, and other Vietnamese around the world who fled Vietnam after the war, who call it the &quot;Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag&quot;, and they started the movement to struggle for recognitions for their political identity.

In the United States, few Vietnamese immigrants of that time period use the current flag of Vietnam, which many of them consider offensive. Instead, they prefer to use the flag of South Vietnam in its place. The same is true for Vietnamese Canadians in Canada, Vietnamese Germans in western Germany, for Vietnamese in the Netherlands, France, Norway and the United Kingdom, and for Vietnamese Australians in Australia for that time period as well.

===Official recognition===
*In 1965, the South Vietnamese flag&#x27;s design was incorporated into the Vietnam Service Medal which was created by President Lyndon Johnson and designed by Thomas Hudson Jones and Mercedes Lee.
*In 2003, the Virginian state government rejected a bill that would have recognized the South Vietnamese flag.
* From 2002 onward, the lobbying efforts of Vietnamese Americans resulted in the state governments of Virginia, Hawaii, Georgia, Colorado, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Michigan recognizing it as the symbol of the Vietnamese American Community. Also, at least 15 counties and 85 cities in 20 states have also adopted similar resolutions.
* In early 2008, Jason Kenney, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, posted an announcement on his website, declaring that the Canadian government recognized the flag of the Republic of Vietnam as the symbol of the Vietnamese-Canadian community. Further, he declared that &quot;attempts to disparage [the flag] are a deeply troubling attack on one of Canada&#x27;s ethnic communities and on the principles of multiculturalism.&quot; In May 2008, he made a speech at an Army of the Republic of Vietnam rally, lending support to the program.
* From 2015 onward in Australia, the City Councils of Maribyrnong, Greater Dandenong, Yarra, Fairfield, Port Adelaide Enfield, and Brimbank, respectively, have passed motions recognizing the &quot;Cờ Vàng&quot; Vietnamese Heritage Flag.

=== Controversies ===

* When a Vietnamese-American videotape store owner displayed the current flag of Vietnam and a photo of Ho Chi Minh in front of his store in Westminster, California in 1999, a month-long protest against it climaxed when 15,000 people held a candlelight vigil one night, sparking the Hi-Tek incident (Hi-Tek was the name of the store).
* A faux pas by the United States Postal Service in using the current Vietnamese flag in a brochure to represent the Vietnamese American community that it serves caused outrage among Vietnamese Americans and resulted in an apology.
* In 2004, many Vietnamese American students at the California State University, Fullerton threatened to walk out at their graduation ceremony when the university chose to use the current flag of Vietnam to represent its Vietnamese students. The Vietnamese-American students demanded that the university use the former flag of South Vietnam instead. This resulted in the university scrapping all foreign flags for the ceremony.
* In 2006, Vietnamese-American students at the University of Texas at Arlington protested against the use of the Vietnamese flag in the Hall of Flags in Nedderman Hall and the exclusion of the South Vietnamese flag at a cultural diversity show during International Week. After weeks of protests, the university decided to scrap all flags from the display.
*During World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney, tensions flared between the 800 Vietnamese pilgrims who used the flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the 2300 Vietnamese Australian pilgrims who used the Republic of Vietnam flag.
*In 2008, many protested against &quot;Nguoi Viet Daily News&quot;, a Vietnamese-language newspaper in Orange County, California, for publishing a photograph of an art installation depicting a foot spa bearing the colours of the flag.
*In October 2014, the Vietnamese Student Association chapter at the University of Arizona discovered that the university had removed the South Vietnamese flag from the campus bookstore&#x27;s Flag Display (which includes flags from all over the world to celebrate the diversity found among students). Afterwards, the VSA chapter launched an online petition in protest of the decision. The university then responded and explained that the removal was due to a misunderstanding amongst the staff. It then apologized and promised to reinstall the flag afterwards.
*Some theories claim the flag was first introduced by Emperor Thành Thái via an imperial decree in 1890. Some views even claimed this flag (called The Yellow Flag for short) is the first true &quot;national flag&quot; of the Vietnamese people for it reflects the aspiration and hope of the people, not just the emperors, for independence and unification of the Viet nation. However, Flags of the World opposed these claims, arguing that no such flag showed up in images from Thành Thái&#x27;s era, and associated claims on the Internet are not credible. Phạm Quang Tuấn, professor of Chemical Engineering from University of New South Wales, traced the claim – that the yellow flag with three red stripes had originated during Thành Thái&#x27;s reign – back, at the earliest, to Nguyễn Đình Sài, a former member of the anti-communist organization Việt Tân, who had written the article &quot;Quốc Kỳ Việt Nam: Nguồn Gốc và Lẽ Chính Thống&quot; (&quot;The National Flag of Viet Nam: Its Origin and Legitimacy&quot;) in September 2004. To back up his claim, Nguyền Đình Sài cited a webpage from &quot;Worldstatesmen&quot; website by Ben Cahoon, an American researcher affiliated with University of Connecticut. However, Nguyễn Đình Sài admitted Cahoon &quot;did not name any specific documents&quot; for Cahoon&#x27;s claim that the yellow flag with three red stripes was used between 1890 and 1920.
*During the 6 January United States Capitol attack, many South Vietnamese flags were seen in the crowd of rioters. There were mixed reactions among Vietnamese Americans in Southern California. Forty-five Vietnamese American community advocates, politicians, and business leaders signed a statement condemning the use of the South Vietnamese flag in this context, and various Vietnamese American government officials also wrote statements opposing such use.
* During a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match in Melbourne between Australia and Vietnam, Vietnamese broadcasters delayed showing the match by ten minutes due to several Vietnamese Australians waving South Vietnamese flags in support of Australia. However, local security did try to prevent the flags from going into the stands. A similar issue would occur when Vietnam also delayed broadcasting a qualifying match against Japan that year when South Vietnamese flags were found in the crowd. 
* In 2023, Vietnam took issue with an Australian coin featuring the flag in its design to honour Australians who fought in the Vietnam War.
* Vietnamese-Australian singer Hanni, member of NewJeans, faced backlash from Vietnamese fans in February 2023 due to the allegations that some of her family members support the flag. Hanni has never publicly expressed any political opinions herself.
* Fans criticized multiple Vietnamese celebrities for performing overseas at events where the flag appeared in the background in the past.

==Specifications==
A 2 June 1948 ordinance defined the construction of the flag in the following way: The national emblem is a flag of yellow background, the height of which is equal to two-thirds of its width. In the middle of the flag and along its entire width, there are three horizontal red bands. Each band has a height equal to one-fifteenth of the width. These three red bands are separated from one another by a space of the band&#x27;s height. Hence it is blazoned as &quot;Or, three bars Gules.&quot;

<doc id="447792" wikidata="Q1170621" url="?curid=447792" title="Civilization and Its Discontents">
<text>Civilization and Its Discontents is a book by Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. It was written in 1929 and first published in German in 1930 as &quot;Das Unbehagen in der Kultur&quot; (&quot;The Uneasiness in Civilization&quot;). 
Exploring what Freud saw as a clash between the desire for individuality and the expectations of society, the book is considered one of Freud&#x27;s most important and widely read works, and was described in 1989 by historian Peter Gay as one of the most influential and studied books in the field of modern psychology.

==Overview==
In &quot;Civilization and Its Discontents&quot;, Freud theorized the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual; his theory is grounded in the notion that humans have certain characteristic instincts that are immutable. The primary tension originates from an individual attempting to find instinctive freedom, and civilization&#x27;s contrary demand for conformity and repression of instincts. Freud states that when any situation that is desired by the pleasure principle is prolonged, it creates a feeling of mild resentment as it clashes with the reality principle.

Primitive instincts—for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification—are harmful to the collective wellbeing of a human community. Laws that prohibit violence, murder, rape and adultery were developed over the course of history as a result of recognition of their harm, implementing severe punishments if their rules are broken. This process, argued Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that gives rise to perpetual feelings of discontent among individuals, justifying neither the individual nor civilization.

==Synopsis==
Freud begins this work by taking up a possible source of religious feeling that his previous book, &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot;, overlooked: the &quot;oceanic feeling&quot; of wholeness, limitlessness, and eternity. Freud himself cannot experience this feeling of dissolution, but notes there exist different pathological and healthy states (e.g. love) where the boundary between ego and object is lost, blurred, or distorted. Freud categorizes the oceanic feeling as being a regression into an earlier state of consciousness—before the ego had differentiated itself from the world of objects. The need for this religious feeling, he writes, arises out of &quot;the infant&#x27;s helplessness and the longing for the father,&quot; as there is no greater infantile need than a father&#x27;s protection. Freud &quot;imagine[s] that the oceanic feeling became connected with religion later on&quot; in cultural practices.

The second chapter delves into how religion is one coping strategy that arises out of a need for the individual to distance himself from all of the suffering in the world. The ego of the child forms over the oceanic feeling when it grasps that there are negative aspects of reality from which it would prefer to distance itself. But at the same time as the ego is hoping to avoid displeasure, it is also building itself so that it may be better able to act towards securing happiness, and these are the twin aims of the pleasure principle when the ego realizes that it must also deal with &#x27;reality&#x27;. Freud claims that the &#x27;purpose of life is simply the programme of the pleasure principle&#x27; and the rest of the chapter is an exploration of various styles of adaptation that humans use to secure happiness from the world while also trying to limit their exposure to suffering or avoid it altogether. Freud points out three main sources of displeasure that we attempt to master: our own painful and mortal existence, the cruel and destructive aspects of the natural world, and the suffering endemic to the reality that we must live with other human beings in a society. Freud regards this last source of displeasure as &quot;perhaps more painful to us than any other&quot;, and the remainder of this book will extrapolate on the conflict between the individual&#x27;s instinct for seeking gratification and the reality of societal life.

The third chapter of the book addresses a fundamental paradox of civilization: it is a tool we have created to protect ourselves from unhappiness, and yet it is our largest source of unhappiness. People become neurotic because they cannot tolerate the frustration which society imposes in the service of its cultural ideals. Freud points out that advances in science and technology have been, at best, a mixed blessing for human happiness. He asks what society is for if not to satisfy the pleasure principle, but concedes that as well as pursuing happiness, civilization must also compromise happiness in order to fulfill its primary goal of bringing individuals into peaceful relationship with one another, which it does by making them subject to a higher, communal authority. Civilization is built out of wish-fulfillments of the human ideals of control, beauty, hygiene, order, and especially for the exercise of humanity&#x27;s highest intellectual functions. Freud draws a key analogy between the development of civilization and libidinal development in the individual, which allows Freud to speak of civilization in his own terms: there is anal eroticism that develops into a need for order and cleanliness, a sublimation of instincts into useful actions, alongside a more repressive renunciation of instinct. This final point Freud sees as the most important character of civilization, and if it is not compensated for, then “one can be certain that serious disorders will ensue.&quot;. The structure of civilization serves to circumvent the natural processes and feelings of human development and eroticism. It is no wonder then, that this repression could lead to discontent among civilians.

In the fourth chapter, Freud attempts a conjecture on the developmental history of civilization, which he supposes coincided with man learning to stand upright. This stage is followed by Freud&#x27;s hypothesis from &quot;Totem and Taboo&quot; that human culture is bound up in an ancient Oedipal drama of brothers banding together to kill their father, and then creating a culture of rules to mediate ambivalent instinctual desires. Gradually, love of a single sexual object becomes diffused and distributed towards all of one&#x27;s culture and humanity in the form of a diluted &#x27;aim-inhibited affection&#x27;. Freud discounts the idea that this passive and non-judgmental affection for all is the pinnacle of human love and purpose. Freud notes that while love is essential for bringing people together in a civilization, at the same time society creates laws, restrictions, and taboos to try to suppress this same instinct, and Freud wonders if there may not be more than sexual desire within the term &#x27;libido&#x27;.

&quot;Psycho-analytic work has shown us that it is precisely these frustrations of sexual life which people known as neurotics cannot tolerate&quot;. So Freud begins the fifth section of this work, which explores the reasons why love cannot be the answer, and concludes that there exists a genuine and irreducible aggressive drive within all human beings. And while the love instinct (eros) can be commandeered by society to bind its members together, the aggressive instinct runs counter to this tendency and must either be repressed or be directed against a rival culture. Thus, Freud acknowledges there is irrevocable ill-will within the hearts of man, and that civilization primarily exists to curb and restrain these impulses.

In the sixth chapter, Freud reviews the development of his concept of libido to explain why it must now be separated into two distinct instincts: the object-instinct of eros and the ego-instinct of thanatos. This &#x27;new&#x27; concept of the death drive actually has a long developmental history in Freud&#x27;s writings, including his investigations into narcissism and sadomasochism. Freud admits it may be difficult to accept his view of human nature as being predisposed towards death and destruction, but he reasons that the suppression of this instinct is the true cause behind civilization&#x27;s need for restrictions. Life and civilization, then, are born and develop out of an eternal struggle between these two interpersonal forces of love and hate.

Freud begins the seventh chapter by clearly explaining how the repression of the death instinct gives rise to neurosis in the individual: the natural aggressiveness of the human child is suppressed by society (and its local representative, the father-figure) and turned inward, introjected, directed back against the ego. These aggressive energies develop into the super-ego as conscience, which punishes the ego both for transgressions committed (remorse) but also for sins it has only fantasized about (guilt). All individuals must submit themselves to forming these feelings of guilt, for their aggressive instincts must be repressed if they hope to share in the love which civilized society has appropriated for its members. Guilt and the neurotic repression of instinct are simply the price we pay in order to live together harmoniously in families and communities.

The guilty conscience is the price paid by the individual to belong to civilized society, but often this guilt is left unconscious and is experienced as anxiety or &#x27;discontent&#x27;. Freud also considers that in addition to the individual super-ego, there may exist a &#x27;cultural super-ego&#x27; that sets itself up as a conscience for society, and that his recommendation for it is the same as his recommendation for many of his neurotic patients: that it must lower its demands on the frail ego. Freud concludes this book by expanding on his distinction between eros and thanatos: &quot;When an instinctual trend undergoes repression, its libidinal elements are turned into symptoms, and its aggressive components into a sense of guilt&quot;, and he ponders on how the eternal battle between these heavenly powers will play out in mankind.

==Historical context==
This work should be understood in the context of contemporary events: World War I undoubtedly influenced Freud and his central observation about the tension between the individual and civilization, as could be seen in his 1915 work &quot;Thoughts for the Times on War and Death&quot;. In a nation still recovering from a particularly brutal war, Freud developed thoughts published two years earlier in &quot;The Future of an Illusion&quot; (1927), wherein he criticized organized religion as a collective neurosis. 

Freud, an avowed atheist, argued that religion has tamed asocial instincts and created a sense of community around a shared set of beliefs, thus helping a civilization. Yet at the same time, organized religion exacts an enormous psychological cost on the individual by making him or her perpetually subordinate to the primal father figure embodied by God. To that same point, Freud&#x27;s view of men as power-hungry aggressors was also undoubtedly shaped by his experience in Europe during the Great War and its aftermath.

<text>The Eskimo Nebula (NGC 2392), also known as the Clown Face Nebula, Lion Nebula, or Caldwell 39, is a bipolar double-shell planetary nebula (PN). It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1787. The formation resembles a person&#x27;s head surrounded by a parka hood. It is surrounded by gas that composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star. The visible inner filaments are ejected by a strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual, light-year-long filaments.

NGC 2392 lies about 6500 light-years away, and is visible with a small telescope in the constellation of Gemini.

At the center of NGC 2392, there is an O-type star (designated HD 59088) with a spectral type of O(H)6f.

== Historic data ==

The nebula was discovered by William Herschel on January 17, 1787, in Slough, England. He described it as &quot;A star 9th magnitude with a pretty bright middle, nebulosity equally dispersed all around. A very remarkable phenomenon.&quot; NGC 2392 WH IV-45 is included in the Astronomical League&#x27;s Herschel 400 observing program.

On 9 January 1982 it was occulted by the Moon during a Total Lunar Eclipse (the January 1982 lunar eclipse) over Greenland, the Arctic, the extreme northeast of North America, the northern half of Europe, North and Northeast Asia. This event was seen by several observers in England. The occultation during total eclipse will happen again during the January 2066 lunar eclipse over the northern half of Asia and the Northwest Pacific.
== Naming controversy ==
On 11 August 2020, the IAU Working Group on Star Names (WGSN), NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), and SIMBAD Astronomical Database (CDS) discontinued use of three nicknames that were perceived as offensive – &quot;Eskimo Nebula&quot;, &quot;Clown Face Nebula&quot;, and &quot;Clownface Nebula&quot; – and strongly recommended the nebula be referred to by its NGC designation in further publications.

<text>Europe first, also known as Germany first, was the key element of the grand strategy agreed upon by the United States and the United Kingdom during World War II after the United States joined the war in December 1941. According to this policy, the United States and the United Kingdom would use the preponderance of their resources to subdue Nazi Germany in Europe first. Simultaneously, they would fight a holding action against Japan in the Pacific, using fewer resources. After the defeat of Germany—considered the greatest threat to the UK and the Soviet Union—all Allied forces could be concentrated against Japan.

At the December 1941 Arcadia Conference between President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Washington, shortly after the United States entered the War, the decision for the &quot;Europe First&quot; strategy was affirmed. However, U.S. statistics show that the United States devoted more resources in the early part of the war to stopping the advance of Japan, and not until 1944 was a clear preponderance of U.S. resources allocated toward the defeat of Germany.

==Grand strategy==
Germany was the United Kingdom&#x27;s primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940, which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of Western Europe, leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany&#x27;s threatened invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain, and by its marked inferiority in naval power. At the same time, war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the U.S. was not yet at war, it met with the UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies. In the March 29, 1941 report of the ABC-1 conference, the Americans and British agreed that their strategic objectives were: (1) &quot;The early defeat of Germany as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European area;&quot; and (2) &quot;A strategic defensive in the Far East.&quot;

Thus, the Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of &quot;Europe first&quot; (or &quot;Germany first&quot;) in carrying out military operations in World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might crush the Soviet Union, and would then become an unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United States by Japan&#x27;s attack on the US at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, did not result in a change in U.S. policy. Churchill hastened to Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to ensure that the Americans didn&#x27;t have second thoughts about Europe First. In 1941, Roosevelt appointed John Gilbert Winant ambassador to Britain, and Winant remained in that post until he resigned in March 1946. In a 2010 book, &quot;Citizens of London: The Americans Who Stood with Britain in Its Darkest, Finest Hour&quot;, author Lynne Olson described Winant as dramatically changing the U.S. stance as ambassador when succeeding pro-appeasement ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. In the spring of 1941, W. Averell Harriman served President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a special envoy to Europe and helped coordinate the Lend-Lease program. The two countries reaffirmed that, &quot;notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime enemy and her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow.&quot;

==United States==

The Europe first strategy, in conjunction with a &quot;holding action&quot; against Japan in the Pacific, had originally been proposed to Roosevelt by the U.S. military in 1940. When Germany declared war on the United States on December 11, 1941, the United States faced a decision about how to allocate resources between these two separate theaters of war. On the one hand, Japan had attacked the United States directly at Pearl Harbor, and the Japanese Navy threatened United States territory in a way that Germany, with a limited surface fleet, was not in a position to do. On the other hand, Germany was considered the stronger and more dangerous threat to Europe; and Germany&#x27;s geographical proximity to the UK and the Soviet Union was a much greater threat to their survival.

Prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, American planners foresaw the possibility of a two-front war. Chief of Naval Operations Harold Rainsford Stark authored the Plan Dog memo, which advocated concentrating on victory in Europe while staying on the defensive in the Pacific. However, the U.S. reassurance to the UK notwithstanding, the U.S.&#x27;s immediate concern was with Japan. As the Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall later said, &quot;we had a fair understanding of what we had best do rather than the necessity of engaging in prolonged conversations... This understanding, which included a recognition that Germany was the main enemy and that the major effort would be made initially in Europe, was obviously not applicable in the present situation. Of first importance now was the necessity to check the Japanese.&quot; Nonetheless, Marshall and other U.S. generals advocated the invasion of northern Europe in 1943, which the British rejected. After Churchill pressed for a landing in French North Africa in 1942, Marshall suggested instead to Roosevelt that the U.S. abandon the Germany-first strategy and take the offensive in the Pacific. Roosevelt &quot;disapproved&quot; the proposal saying it would do nothing to help Russia. With Roosevelt&#x27;s support, and Marshall unable to persuade the British to change their minds, in July 1942 Operation Torch was scheduled for later that year.

The Europe First strategy remained in effect throughout the war but the terms &quot;holding action&quot; and &quot;limited offensive&quot; in the Pacific were subject to interpretation and modification by U.S. senior military commanders and at allied leaders conferences. The strategic situation in the Pacific and related logistical requirements dominated the United States&#x27; actions after its entry into the war and led to an initial focus on the Pacific. Even in the later stages of the war, there was intense competition for resources as operations in both regions were scaled up.

==Opposition==
The &quot;Europe First&quot; strategy was not well received by factions of the US military, driving a wedge between the Navy and the Army. While USN Fleet Admiral Ernest King was a strong believer in &quot;Europe First&quot;, contrary to British perceptions, his natural aggression did not permit him to leave resources idle in the Atlantic that could be utilized in the Pacific, especially when &quot;it was doubtful when—if ever—the British would consent to a cross-Channel operation&quot;. King once complained that the Pacific deserved 30% of Allied resources but was getting only 15%, perhaps partly because the two men did not get along, the combined influence of King and General Douglas MacArthur increased the allocation of resources to the Pacific War.

General Hastings Ismay, chief of staff to Winston Churchill, described King as:
tough as nails and carried himself as stiffly as a poker. He was blunt and stand-offish, almost to the point of rudeness. At the start, he was intolerant and suspicious of all things British, especially the Royal Navy; but he was almost equally intolerant and suspicious of the American Army. War against Japan was the problem to which he had devoted the study of a lifetime, and he resented the idea of American resources being used for any other purpose than to destroy Japanese. He mistrusted Churchill&#x27;s powers of advocacy, and was apprehensive that he would wheedle President Roosevelt into neglecting the war in the Pacific.

At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, King was accused by Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, of favoring the Pacific war, and the argument became heated. The combative US general Joseph Stilwell wrote: &quot;Brooke got nasty, and King got good and sore. King almost climbed over the table at Brooke. God, he was mad. I wished he had socked him.&quot;

The American people favored early action against Japan. In one of the few public opinion polls taken during the war, in February 1943, 53% of Americans said that Japan was the &quot;chief enemy&quot; compared to 34% choosing Germany. A later poll showed that 82% of Americans believed that the Japanese were more &quot;cruel at heart&quot; than Germans. As a consequence of the immediate threat and the need to contain Japan&#x27;s advance across the Pacific, American resources allocated to the defeat of Japan initially exceeded those allocated to Europe. In the first six months the U.S. was in the war, the U.S. army deployed more than 300,000 soldiers overseas to the Pacific while less than 100,000 were sent to Europe. The U.S.&#x27;s first major offensive during World War II was in the Pacific: Guadalcanal in August 1942. Concurrently, Australian forces attacked and pushed back the Japanese in the Kokoda Track Campaign in New Guinea.

==Analysis==

Three U.S. Army divisions were deployed to Australia and New Zealand in February and March 1942 at the request of Churchill so that divisions from those countries could remain on operations in the Middle East. Through this sizeable deployment to the Pacific, the U.S. aided the Europe First strategy by defending Australia and New Zealand and thus enabling experienced troops from those countries to remain deployed against German forces. Nonetheless, the inability of the two allies to mount an invasion of German-controlled northern Europe in 1943 permitted the U.S. to maintain more military forces arrayed against Japan than Germany during the first two years the U.S. was in the war. As late as December 1943, the balance was nearly even. Against Japan, the U.S. had deployed 1,873,023 men, 7,857 aircraft, and 713 warships. Against Germany the totals were 1,810,367 men, 8,807 airplanes, and 515 warships. In early 1944, the military buildup of American forces for the invasion of France shifted the balance of American resources toward the European theater and made Europe First a reality. However, despite the majority of American resources going into Europe in 1944, the U.S. still had sufficient resources to mount several major military operations in the Pacific that year: Saipan (June 1944); Guam (July 1944); Peleliu (September 1944); and the liberation of the Philippines at Leyte in October 1944.

In 1944 and 1945, the balance of U.S. resources shifted heavily toward Europe as the Europe First strategy became a reality rather than just a stated objective. At war&#x27;s end in Europe, the U.S. Army had 47 divisions in Europe and 21 divisions, plus 6 Marine Corps divisions, in the Pacific. 78% of Army and Army Air Force manpower was deployed against Germany versus 22% deployed in the Pacific. The plan to invade Japan envisioned that 15 of the European divisions (and the Eighth Air Force) would be transferred to the Pacific.

The uncritical view that &quot;Europe First&quot; dictated the allocation of resources throughout the war has caused many scholars to underestimate the resources required to defeat Japan. For example, historian H. P. Willmott stated that the United States &quot;allocated little more than one-quarter of her total war effort to the struggle against Japan.&quot; That may be an underestimate which does not take into account that, according to official U.S. statistics, 70% of the U.S. Navy and all the Marine Corps were deployed in the Pacific as well as the 22% of the Army deployed to the Pacific at the time of Germany&#x27;s surrender in May 1945.

<text>The Stingray Nebula (Hen 3-1357) is the youngest-known planetary nebula, having appeared in the 1980s. The nebula is located in the direction of the southern constellation Ara (the Altar), and is located away. Although it is some 130 times the size of the Solar System, the Stingray Nebula is only about one tenth the size of most other known planetary nebulae. The central star of the nebula is the fast-evolving star SAO 244567. Until the early 1970s, it was observed on Earth as a preplanetary nebula in which the gas had not yet become hot and ionized.

The image of the nebula shows how the older outer shells of gas are acting as a collimator for the more recent gas outflow from the central star—an important observation, as this process has not been well understood.

==History==

Prior to the discovery of the nebula, its central star was known as He 3-1357, which Karl Gordon Henize classified as an A- or B-type Hα emission-line star in 1976. It was observed in 1971 to be post-asymptotic giant branch B1 or B2 supergiant. Planetary nebula emission lines were identified in this star in 1989 by the International Ultraviolet Explorer. As the nebula would be newly formed and very small, ground-based observations were not able to resolve it; so Bobrowsky observed it with the Hubble Space Telescope, discovering the nebula, which he named the &quot;Stingray Nebula&quot;.

In 1993, M. Parthasarathy &quot;et al.&quot; looked at the history of measurements of the brightness of the central star, and concluded that it was fading in the optical region of the spectrum. It was given its variable star designation, V839 Arae, in 1997.
In 1995 the central planetary nebula nucleus was observed as a DA white dwarf, having seemingly faded by a factor of three between 1987 and 1995. The white dwarf has an estimated mass of and luminosity of and has an observed companion star separated by 0.3 arcsecond. The mass of the nebula is estimated as .

In 1998 Bobrowsky et al. described how the Hubble Space Telescope observations revealed a 17th-magnitude companion to the Stingray&#x27;s 15th-magnitude central star.

The central star is unusual in that it has brightened and faded over a period of 20 years. Its temperature went up by 40,000 °C. An explanation for this is that it has undergone a helium flash.

In January 2021, NASA discovered that the nebula had been fading since the 1990s, when it reached its peak brightness. Previously photoionized, the positive ions of the nebula have been recombining with the electrons. In a NASA statement a team member, Martín A. Guerrero of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía in Granada, Spain, said: &quot;This is very, very dramatic, and very weird. What we&#x27;re witnessing is a nebula&#x27;s evolution in real time. In a span of years, we see variations in the nebula. We have not seen that before with the clarity we get with this view.&quot;

<text>Alexander Archer Vandegrift (March 13, 1887 – May 8, 1973) was a United States Marine Corps four-star general. During World War II, he commanded the 1st Marine Division to victory in its first ground offensive of the war, the Battle of Guadalcanal. For his actions from August 7 to December 9, 1942, during the Solomon Islands campaign, he received the Medal of Honor. Vandegrift later served as the 18th Commandant of the Marine Corps. He was the first four-star general on active duty in the Marine Corps.

==Early life==
Alexander Archer Vandegrift was born on March 13, 1887, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where his father was an architect and contractor. Vandegrift was of Dutch ancestry, all of which had been in North America since the 1600s. It was once facetiously remarked that he &quot;never had a Catholic ancestor.&quot; The young Vandegrift, known as &quot;Archer&quot; in his boyhood, had an interest in the military both from reading military history novels and from stories of ancestors who fought in various wars. He graduated from Charlottesville High School. During his childhood, he was a big fan of G.A. Henty novels and history. In particular, he read a lot about the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Waterloo and described himself as a &quot;big fan&quot; of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington and Horatio Nelson.

He attended the University of Virginia from 1906 to 1908.

==Early military career==
He then received his commission in the U.S. Marine Corps through a week-long competitive examination in 1908.

He became a second lieutenant on January 22, 1909.

At the Marine Corps Schools in 1909, he wrote a prophetic article, &quot;Aviation, the Cavalry of the Future.&quot; As commandant, he was appointed to the Hogaboom Board, named for Major General Hogaboom, the chairman, which began the Martine&#x27; development of vertical envelopment, the use of helicopters for air assault. During his early years, as a second lieutenant, General Vandegrift was also very nearly dismissed from the Marine Corps for disciplinary infractions and negative evaluations. In his first Marine Corps evaluation, dated June 30, 1909, Vandegrift received an overall rating of &quot;Not Good&quot; with these remarks from the Commander of the Marine Officers School:
In Vandegrift&#x27;s next evaluation, in December 1909, he received a &quot;Good and Tolerable&quot; rating. The next was rated as &quot;Excellent&quot; upon reporting to the Marine Corps Barracks, Navy Yard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1910.

==Banana Wars==
Following instruction at the Marine Officers&#x27; School at Port Royal, South Carolina, his first tour of duty was at the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1912, he went to foreign shore duty in the Caribbean, first to Cuba and then to Nicaragua, where he participated in the bombardment, assault, and capture of Coyotepe Fortress. In 1914, he participated in the engagement and occupation of Veracruz, Mexico.

In December 1914, after his promotion to first lieutenant, he attended the Advance Base Course at the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia. Upon completion of training, he sailed for Haiti with the 1st Marines Regiment and participated in action against Cacos bandits at Le Trou and Fort Capois, Haiti.

In August 1916, he was promoted to captain and became a member of the Haitian Constabulary at Port-au-Prince, where he remained until he was detached to the United States in December 1918. He returned to Haiti again in July 1919, to serve with the &quot;Gendarmerie d&#x27;Haiti&quot; as an Inspector of Constabulary. He was promoted to major in June 1920.

===1920s–1930s===

Major Vandegrift returned to the U.S. in April 1923 and was assigned to the Marine Barracks, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He completed the Field Officers&#x27; Course, Marine Corps Schools, in May 1926. He was then transferred to the Marine Corps Base San Diego, California, as assistant chief of staff.

In February 1927, he sailed for China, where he served as operations and training officer of the 3rd Marines with headquarters at Tianjin. He was ordered to Washington, D.C., in September 1928, where he became assistant chief coordinator, Bureau of the Budget.

After his duty in Washington, he joined the Marine Barracks, Quantico, where he became assistant chief of staff, G-1 Section, Fleet Marine Force (FMF). During that assignment, in June 1934, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

Ordered to China in June 1935, Lieutenant Colonel Vandegrift served successively as executive officer and commanding officer of the Marine detachment at the American embassy in Beiping. Promoted to colonel in September 1936, Vandegrift reported to Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), Washington, D.C., in June 1937, where he became Military Secretary to the Major General Commandant. In March 1940, he was appointed Assistant to the Major General Commandant, and the following month, he was promoted to brigadier general.

==World War II==

Brigadier General Vandegrift was ordered to the 1st Marine Division in November 1941. Shortly before the U.S. entered World War II, he had become on December 7, the assistant commander of the First Marine Division.

In March and April 1942, Vandegrift was promoted to major general and assumed command of the First Marine Division. In May, the First Marine Division and the South Pacific Amphibious Force sailed for the South Pacific Area. The First Marine Division was the first Marine Corps division that ever left the shores of the United States. On August 7, Vandegrift led the First Marine Division in the first large-scale operation against the Japanese, in the Solomon Islands. He was awarded the Navy Cross &quot;for extraordinary heroism and distinguished devotion to duty as Commanding General of the First Marine Division and all ground troops action with enemy Japanese forces during the attack on the Solomon Islands 7 August 1942.&quot; (attack on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu); He was later awarded the Medal of Honor &quot;for outstanding and heroic accomplishment above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of the First Marine Division in operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands during the period 7 August to 9 December 1942.&quot; He had commanded the initial landings and the subsequent occupation ... that &quot;resulted in securing a valuable base for further operations of our forces against the enemy.&quot; Vandegrift was presented the Medal of Honor on February 5, 1943, from President Franklin Roosevelt during a ceremony in the White House.

In July 1943, Vandegrift commanded the 1st Marine Amphibious Corps in the landing at Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville, in the northern Solomon Islands, on November 1, 1943. Upon establishing the initial beachhead, he relinquished command and returned to Washington, D.C., as commandant-designate.

===Commandant of Marine Corps===

On January 1, 1944, as a lieutenant general, he was sworn in as the 18th commandant of the Marine Corps. On April 4, 1945, he was appointed general, with date of rank from March 21, 1945, the first Marine officer on active duty to attain four-star rank.

During his tenure as commandant, the Marine Corps faced institutional threats from U.S. Army efforts to absorb the mission of the Marines. The U.S. Navy was sympathetic to the Marine Corps&#x27;s predicament but was ready to accept the diminishment of the Corps in exchange for keeping naval aviation from consolidation with the U.S. Air Force. The post-war discussions on the restructuring of the American defense establishment opened the door to diminishing the mission and role of the Marine Corps in the new defense structure. Proponents of such cuts included President Harry Truman and General Dwight Eisenhower. In that power struggle, the Marine Corps aligned itself with U.S. Congress in warning against the encroachment on civilian oversight within the Army proposals.

To clinch the support of Congress, Commandant Vandegrift delivered the famous &quot;Bended Knee Speech&quot; on May 6, 1946, to the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs and ended it thus:
For outstanding service as Commandant of the Marine Corps from January 1, 1944, to June 30, 1946, General Vandegrift was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. He was relieved as Commandant on December 31, 1947, but was not formally retired and placed on the retired list until April 1, 1949.

==Later life==
Together with Robert B. Asprey, General Vandegrift co-authored a book chronicling his experiences in World War II. The book is titled &quot;Once a Marine: The Memoirs of General A. A. Vandegrift Commandant of the U.S. Marines in WW II&quot;, and was published in 1964.

General Vandegrift died on May 8, 1973, at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, after a long illness. His interment was on May 10, 1973, at the Arlington National Cemetery.

==Dates of rank==
==Military awards==
Vandegrift received the following decorations and awards: 


===Medal of Honor citation===
Vandegrift&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation reads as follows:

The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

:For outstanding and heroic accomplishment above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer of the 1st Marine Division in operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands during the period from 7 August to 9 December 1942. With the adverse factors of weather, terrain, and disease making his task a difficult and hazardous undertaking, and with his command eventually including sea, land, and air forces of Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Maj. Gen. Vandegrift achieved marked success in commanding the initial landings of the U. S. forces in the Solomon Islands and in their subsequent occupation. His tenacity, courage, and resourcefulness prevailed against a strong, determined, and experienced enemy, and the gallant fighting spirit of the men under his inspiring leadership enabled them to withstand aerial, land, and sea bombardment, to surmount all obstacles, and leave a disorganized and ravaged enemy. This dangerous but vital mission, accomplished at the constant risk of his life, resulted in securing a valuable base for further operations of our forces against the enemy, and its successful completion reflects great credit upon Maj. Gen. Vandegrift, his command, and the U.S. Naval Service.

/S/ Franklin D. Roosevelt

<doc id="447808" wikidata="Q2046297" url="?curid=447808" title="Sumitra">
<text>Sumitra (, IAST: Sumitrā) is a princess of Kashi and the queen of Kosala in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Sumitra is the second queen consort of Dasharatha, the king of Kosala, who ruled from Ayodhya. Regarded to be a wise and dedicated women, she is the mother of the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna.

== Etymology ==
The name Sumitra is of Sanskrit origin, and could be divided into &quot;Su&quot; meaning good, and &quot;Mitra,&quot; meaning friend&quot;.&quot; Thus&quot;,&quot; her name means &#x27;a good friend&#x27; or &#x27;one with a friendly nature&#x27;. She is known in other languages as Tamil: சுமித்திரை (), Burmese: Thumitra, Malay: Samutra, Khmer &quot; and &quot; &quot;Samutthra Thewi&quot;).

== Legend ==
=== Birth ===
While Valmiki is silent on her parentage, later texts variously described her as a princess of Kashi or of Magadha, and belonging to the Haiheya clan. She is called the daughter of Magadha, as per Kalidasa’s &quot;Raghuvamsham&quot;. Kalidasa wrote,
=== Marriage and children ===
Sumitra was married to king Dasharatha as his second queen consort. In the &quot;Balakanda&quot; chapter of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Sumitra first appears.

Sumitra performs the asvamedha yagna alongside Dasharatha and his two other wives in hopes of blessings for children. At the sacrifice conducted by Rishyasringa to obtain sons for the childless Dasharatha, a divine being emerged from the flames with a golden vessel filled with divine &quot;payasam&quot; (a milk delicacy) prepared by the gods. Dasharatha offers half of this divine food to Kausalya, a quarter to Sumitra (i.e., literally &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), an eighth to Kaikeyi (i.e., again, &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), and then, upon reflection, gives the final eighth to Sumitra again.

Consequently, Kausalya gives birth to the prince Rama and Kaikeyi to Bharata. Having received two portions, Sumitra became the mother of twins, Lakshmana and Satrughna.

Her elder son Lakshmana married Urmila, daughter of Janaka, King of Mithila and her younger son Shatrughan, married Shrutakirti, daughter of Janaka&#x27;s brother Kushadhvaja.

=== Rama&#x27;s exile ===
Sumitra is known to encourage her son Lakshmana to go into exile with Rama. Sumitra is described to have found a lot of happiness around her son Lakshmana, with the latter being described as the &#x27;enhancer of her joy&#x27; and is also known as Saumitra ().

Despite this, she sends her son in his brother&#x27;s service. Before his departure, Sumitra tells Lakshmana, &quot;Ram is your elder brother, and the future king. Do not neglect your duty. Serve and guard him, and show your devotion, at all times.&quot;

== Assessment ==
Neither the principal queen nor the favoured wife, Sumitra was single-minded in her devotion to her husband and to the senior queen, Kausalya. Considered as the wisest of Dasharatha&#x27;s three wives, she supported Lakshmana&#x27;s decision to accompany Rama, to serve him during his exile, and comforted Kausalya after the departure of her son.

In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Sumitra is faultless and charming and skilled in her employment of words. Sumitra&#x27;s husband, Dasharatha deems her worthy and is fearful of losing the respect in her eyes. He says,
== Literature ==
After the exile of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, the benevolent Sumitra consoles Queen Kausalya with her persuasive words: 

During Rama&#x27;s consecration, Sumitra offers her blessings to the prince:

<text>Anomalopidae (lanterneye fishes or flashlight fishes) are a family of fish distinguished by bioluminescent organs located underneath their eyes, for which they are named. These light organs contain luminous bacteria and can be &quot;shut off&quot; by the fish using either a dark lid or by being drawn into a pouch. They are used to communicate, attract prey, and evade predators.

Flashlight fish are found in tropical ocean waters across the world. They are typically about in size, although some species can reach twice this length. They are nocturnal, feeding at night on small crustaceans. Some species move to shallow waters near coral reefs at night, but otherwise, they are exclusively deep water fish. This tends to make their collection difficult, and as such they are a poorly understood group.

Anomalopidae were originally divided into 5 distinct species: &quot;Anomalops katoptron&quot; and &quot;Photoblepharon palpebratus&quot;, widely distributed in the central and western Pacific Ocean; &quot;P. steinitzi&quot; from the Red Sea and Comoro Islands; &quot;Kryptophanaron alfredi&quot; from the Caribbean; and &quot;K. harveyi&quot; from Baja California. In 2019 the genus &quot;Photoblepharon&quot; was reduced to only 2 species: &quot;P. palpebratum&quot; from the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean and &quot;P. steinitzi&quot; from the Red Sea, Oman, and western Indian Ocean. Other genera include &quot;Parmops&quot; and &quot;Phthanophaneron.&quot;

<text>IC 418, also known as the Spirograph Nebula, is a planetary nebula located in the constellation of Lepus about 3,600 ly away from Earth. It spans 0.3 light-years across. The central star of the planetary nebula, HD 35914, is an O-type star with a spectral type of O7fp. The nebula formed a few thousand years ago during the star&#x27;s last stages of its red giant phase. Material from the star’s outer layers was ejected from the star into the surrounding space. The nebula’s glow is caused by the central star’s ultraviolet radiation interacting with the gas.

The nebula gets its colors from the different chemical elements inside the nebula. The red color is nitrogen (the coldest gas in the nebula), the green is hydrogen and the traces of blue are the ionized oxygen gas (the hottest gas in the nebula due to its proximity to the central star).

==Naming==
The name derives from the intricate pattern of the nebula, which resembles a pattern which can be created using the Spirograph, a toy that produces geometric patterns (specifically, hypotrochoids and epitrochoids) on paper. The origin of the Spirograph pattern is unknown.

<text>Robert Smith (c. 16 October 1689 – 2 February 1768) was an English mathematician.

==Life==

Smith was probably born at Lea near Gainsborough, the son of John Smith, the rector of Gate Burton, Lincolnshire and his wife Hannah Cotes. After attending Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, Gainsborough (now Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s High School) he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1708, and becoming minor fellow in 1714, major fellow in 1715 and senior fellow in 1739, was chosen Master in 1742, in succession to Richard Bentley. From 1716 to 1760 he was Plumian Professor of Astronomy, and he died in the Master&#x27;s Lodge at Trinity.

In February 1719 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Besides editing two works by his cousin, Roger Cotes, who was his predecessor in the Plumian chair, he published &quot;A Compleat System of Opticks&quot; in 1738, which gained him the sobriquet of Old Focus, and &quot;Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds&quot; in 1749.

Smith never married but lived with his unmarried sister Elzimar (1683–1758) in the lodge at Trinity College. Although he is often portrayed as a rather reclusive character, John Byrom&#x27;s journal shows that in the 1720s and 1730s Smith could be quite sociable. Yet ill health, particularly gout, took its toll and severely inhibited his academic work and social activities. He died at the lodge on 2 February 1768, and on 8 February he was buried in Trinity College Chapel, the funeral oration being delivered by Thomas Zouch.

According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Smith helped to spread Isaac Newton&#x27;s ideas in Europe and &quot;Newton&#x27;s successes in optics and mechanics dominated Smith&#x27;s scientific career&quot;.

==The Smith Fund==
In his will Smith left £3500 South Sea stock to the University of Cambridge. The net income on the fund is annually divided equally between the Smith&#x27;s Prize and the stipend of the Plumian Professor.

<doc id="447817" wikidata="Q149584" url="?curid=447817" title="Organizational theory">
<text>Organizational theory refers to a series of interrelated concepts that involve the sociological study of the structures and operations of formal social organizations. Organizational theory also seeks to explain how interrelated units of organization either connect or do not connect with each other. Organizational theory also concerns understanding how groups of individuals behave, which may differ from the behavior of an individual. The behavior organizational theory often focuses on is goal-directed. Organizational theory covers both intra-organizational and inter-organizational fields of study.

In the early 20th century, theories of organizations initially took a rational perspective but have since become more diverse. In a rational organization system, there are two significant parts: Specificity of Goals and Formalization. The &quot;division of labor&quot; is the specialization of individual labor roles, associated with increasing output and trade. Modernization theorist Frank Dobbin wrote that &quot;modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst of an extraordinary progression towards more efficiency.&quot; Max Weber&#x27;s conception of bureaucracy is characterized by the presence of impersonal positions that are earned and not inherited, rule-governed decision-making, professionalism, chain of command, defined responsibility, and bounded authority. Contingency theory holds that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of various environmental and internal constraints, and that the ability to navigate this requisite variety may depend upon the development of a range of response mechanisms.

Dwight Waldo in 1978 wrote that &quot;[o]rganization theory is characterized by vogues, heterogeneity, claims and counterclaims.&quot; Organization theory cannot be described as an orderly progression of ideas or a unified body of knowledge in which each development builds carefully on and extends the one before it. Rather, developments in theory and descriptions for practice show disagreement about the purposes and uses of a theory of organization, the issues to which it should address itself (such as supervisory style and organizational culture), and the concepts and variables that should enter into such a theory. Suggestions to view organizations as a series of logical relationships between its participants have found its way into the theoretical relationships between diverging organizational theories as well, as explains the interdisciplinary nature of the field. 

==Background==
===Rise of organizations===
In 1820, about 20% of the United States population depended on a wage income. That percentage increased to 90% by 1950. Generally, by 1950, farmers and craftsmen were the only people not dependent on working for someone else. Prior to that time, most people were able to survive by hunting and farming their own food, making their own supplies, and remaining almost fully self-sufficient. As transportation became more efficient and technologies developed, self-sufficiency became an economically poor choice. As in the Lowell textile mills, various machines and processes were developed for each step of the production process, thus making mass production a cheaper and faster alternative to individual production. In addition, as the population grew and transportation improved, the pre-organizational system struggled to support the needs of the market. These conditions made for a wage-dependent population that sought out jobs in growing organizations, leading to a shift away from individual and family production.

In addition to a shift to wage dependence, externalities from industrialization also created a perfect opportunity for the rise of organizations. Various negative effects such as pollution, workplace accidents, crowded cities, and unemployment became rising concerns. Rather than small groups such as families and churches being able to control these problems as they had in the past, new organizations and systems were required. These organizations were less personal, more distant, and more centralized, but what they lacked in locality they made up for in efficiency.

Along with wage dependency and externalities, the growth of industry also played a large role in the development of organizations. Markets that were quickly growing needed workers urgently, so a need developed for organizational structures to guide and support those new workers. Some of the first New England factories initially relied on the daughters of farmers; later, as the economy changed, they began to gain workers from the former farming classes, and finally, from European immigrants. Many Europeans left their homes for the promises of US industry, and about 60% of those immigrants stayed in the country. They became a permanent class of workers in the economy, which allowed factories to increase production and produce more than they had before. With this large growth came the need for organizations and for leadership that was not previously needed in small businesses and firms.

Overall, the historical and social context in which organizations arose in the United States allowed not only for the development of organizations, but also for their spread and growth. Wage dependency, externalities, and growth of industries all played into the change from individual, family, and small-group production and regulation to large organizations and structure.

=== Developments in theory ===
As people implemented organizations over time, many researchers have experimented as to which organizational theory fits them best. The theories of organizations include bureaucracy, rationalization (scientific management), and the division of labor. Each theory provides distinct advantages and disadvantages when applied.

The classical perspective emerges from the Industrial Revolution in the private sector and the need for improved public administration in the public sector. Both efforts center on theories of efficiency. Classical works have seasoned and have been elaborated upon in depth. There are at least two subtopics under the classical perspective: the scientific management and bureaucracy theory.

A number of sociologists and psychologists made major contributions to the study of the neoclassical perspective, which is also known as the human relations school of thought. The human relations movement was a movement which had the primary concerns of concentrating on topics such as morale, leadership. This perspective began in the 1920s with the Hawthorne studies, which gave emphasis to &quot;affective and socio-psychological aspects of human behavior in organizations.&quot; The study, taking place at the &quot;Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company between 1927 and 1932,&quot; would make Elton Mayo and his colleagues the most important contributors to the neoclassical perspective.

There was a wave of scholarly attention to organizational theory in the 1950s, which from some viewpoints held the field to still be in its infancy. A 1959 symposium held by the Foundation for Research on Human Behavior in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was published as &quot;Modern Organization Theory&quot;. Among a group of eminent organizational theorists active during this decade were E. Wight Bakke, Chris Argyris, James G. March, Rensis Likert, Jacob Marschak, Anatol Rapoport, and William Foote Whyte.

== Weberian bureaucracy ==

The scholar most closely associated with a theory of bureaucracy is Max Weber. In &quot;Economy and Society&quot;, his seminal book published in 1922, Weber describes its features. Bureaucracy, as characterized in Weber&#x27;s terminology of ideal types, is marked by the presence of positions that are earned and not inherited. Rules govern decision-making. Those in positions of authority demonstrate professionalism. There is a chain of command and position-defined responsibility. Authority is bounded.

Weber begins his discussion of bureaucracy by introducing the concept of &quot;jurisdictional areas&quot;: institutions governed by a specific set of rules or laws. In a jurisdictional area, regular activities are assigned as official duties. The authority to assign duties is governed by a set of rules. Duties are fulfilled continuously by qualified individuals. These elements make up a bureaucratic agency in the case of the state and bureaucratic enterprises in the private sector.

There are several additional features that make up a Weberian bureaucracy:
*It is possible to find the utilization of hierarchical subordination in all bureaucratic structures. This means that higher-level offices supervise lower-level offices.
*In bureaucracies, personal possessions are kept separate from the monies of the agency or the enterprise.
*People who work within a bureaucracy are usually trained in the appropriate field of specialization.
*Bureaucratic officials are expected to contribute their full working capacity to the organization.
*Positions within a bureaucratic organization must follow a specific set of general rules.

Weber argued that in a bureaucracy, taking on a position or office signifies an assumption of specific duties necessary for the smooth running of the organization. This conception is distinct from historical working relationships in which a worker served a specific ruler, not an institution.

The hierarchical nature of bureaucracies allows employees to demonstrate achieved social status. When an officeholder is elected instead of appointed, that person is no longer a purely bureaucratic figure. He derives his power &quot;from below&quot; instead of &quot;from above.&quot; When a high-ranking officer selects officials, they are more likely to be chosen for reasons related to the benefit of the superior than the competency of the new hire. When high-skilled employees are necessary for the bureaucracy and public opinion shapes decision-making, competent officers are more likely to be selected.

According to Weber, if &#x27;tenure for life&#x27; is legally guaranteed, an office becomes perceived as less prestigious than a position that can be replaced at any time. If &#x27;tenure for life&#x27; or a &#x27;right to the office&#x27; develops, there is a decrease in career opportunities for ambitious new hires and overall technical efficiency becomes less guaranteed. In a bureaucracy, salaries are provided to officials. The amount is determined on the basis of rank and helps to signify the desirability of a position. Bureaucratic positions also exist as part of stable career tracks that reward office-holders for seniority.

Weber argues that the development of a &quot;money economy&quot; is the &quot;normal precondition for the unchanged survival, if not the establishment, of pure bureaucratic administrations.&quot; Since bureaucracy requires sustained revenues from taxation or private profits in order to be maintained, a money economy is the most rational way to ensure its continued existence.

Weber posits that officials in a bureaucracy have a property right to their office and attempt at exploitation by a superior means the abandonment of bureaucratic principles. He articulates that providing a status incentive to inferior officers helps them to maintain self-respect and fully participate in hierarchical frameworks. Michel Crozier reexamined Weber&#x27;s theory in 1964 and determined that bureaucracy is flawed because hierarchy causes officers to engage in selfish power struggles that damage the efficiency of the organization.

===Summary of characteristics of Weberian bureaucracy===
Weber identified the following components of bureaucracy as essential:

* Official jurisdiction in all areas is ordered by rules or laws already implemented.
* There is an office hierarchy; a system of super- and sub-ordination in which higher offices supervise lower ones.
* The management of the modern office is based upon written rules, which are preserved in their original form.
* Office management requires training and specialization.
* When the office is developed/established it requires the full working capacity of individuals.
* Rules are stable and can be learned. Knowledge of these rules can be viewed as expertise within the bureaucracy (these allow for the management of society).

When a bureaucracy is implemented, it can provide accountability, responsibility, control, and consistency. The hiring of employees will be an impersonal and equal system. Although the classical perspective encourages efficiency, it is often criticized as ignoring human needs. Also, it rarely takes into consideration human error or the variability of work performances (since each worker is different).

In the case of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, NASA managers overlooked the possibility of human error. (See also: Three Mile Island accident.)

=== Efficiency and teleological arguments ===
Weber believed that a bureaucracy consists of six specific characteristics: hierarchy of command, impersonality, written rules of conduct, advancement based on achievement, specialized division of labor, and efficiency. This ultimate characteristic of Weberian bureaucracy, which states that bureaucracies are very efficient, is controversial and by no means accepted by all sociologists. There are certainly both positive and negative consequences to bureaucracy and strong arguments for both the efficiency and inefficiency of bureaucracies.

While Max Weber&#x27;s work was published in the late 1800s and early 1900s, before his death in 1920, his work is still referenced today in the field of sociology. Weber&#x27;s theory of bureaucracy claims that it is extremely efficient, and even goes as far as to claim that bureaucracy is the most efficient form of organization. Weber claimed that bureaucracies are necessary to ensure the continued functioning of society, which has become drastically more modern and complex in the past century. Furthermore, he claimed that without the structured organization of bureaucracy, our complex society would be much worse off, because society would act in an inefficient and wasteful way. He saw bureaucracies as organizations driven towards certain goals, which they could carry out efficiently. In addition, within an organization that operates under bureaucratic standards, the members will be better off due to the heavy regulation and detailed structure. Not only does bureaucracy make it much more difficult for arbitrary and unfair personal favors to be carried out, it also means that promotions and hiring will generally be done completely by merit.

Weber regarded bureaucracies as goal-driven, efficient organizations. But he also acknowledged their limitations. Weber recognized that there are constraints within the bureaucratic system. First of all, he noted that bureaucracies are ruled by very few people with considerable unregulated power. A consequence is oligarchy, whereby a limited number of officials gain political and economic power. Furthermore, Weber considered further bureaucratization to be an &quot;inescapable fate&quot; because it is thought to be superior to and more efficient than other forms of organization. Weber&#x27;s analysis led him to believe that bureaucracies are too inherently limiting of individual human freedom. He feared that people would begin to be too controlled by bureaucracies. In his view, the strict methods of administration and legitimate forms of authority associated with bureaucracy act to eliminate human freedom.

Weber tended to offer a teleological argument with regard to bureaucracy. Weber&#x27;s idea of bureaucracy is considered teleological to the extent that he posits that bureaucracies aim to achieve specific goals. Weber claimed that bureaucracies are goal-oriented organizations that use their efficiency and rational principles to reach their goals. A teleological analysis of businesses leads to the inclusion of all involved stakeholders in decision-making. The teleological view of Weberian bureaucracy postulates that all actors in an organization have various ends or goals, and attempt to find the most efficient way to achieve these goals.

===Criticism===

&quot;There is dangerous risk of oversimplification in making Weber seem cold and heartless to such a degree that an efficiently-run Nazi death camp might appear admirable.&quot; In reality, Weber believed that by using human logic in his system, organizations could achieve improvement of human condition in various workplaces.

Another critique of Weber&#x27;s theory is the argument of efficiency. Highest efficiency, in theory, can be attained through pure work with no regard for the workers (for example, long hours with little pay), which is why oversimplification can be dangerous. If we were to take one characteristic focusing on efficiency, it would seem like Weber is promoting unhealthy work conditions, when in fact, he wanted the complete opposite. Taking all of the characteristics that to Weber are hallmarks of bureaucracy, he recognized that a pure bureaucracy is nearly impossible to attain. Though his theories include characteristics of a highly efficient organization, these characteristics are only meant to serve as a model of how a bureaucratic organization works, recognizing that the manifestation of that model in life differs from the pure model.

With this said, the characteristics of Weber&#x27;s theory have to all be perfect for a bureaucracy to function at its highest potential. &quot;Think of the concept as a bureau or desk with drawers in it, which seems to call out to you, demanding that everything must fit in its place.&quot; If one object in the drawer does not fit properly, the entire drawer becomes untidy, which is exactly the case in Weber&#x27;s theory; if one characteristic is not fulfilled the rest of them are unable to work in unison, leaving the organization performing below its full potential.

One characteristic that was meant to improve working conditions was his rule that &quot;Organization follows hierarchical principle – subordinates follow orders or superiors, but have right of appeal (in contrast to more diffuse structure in traditional authority).&quot; In other words, everyone in a company or any sort of work environment has the opportunity and right to disagree or to speak up if they are unhappy with something rather than not voice their opinion in fear of losing their job. Open communication is a very important part of Weber&#x27;s bureaucracy, and is practiced today. Because of the communication it may not be the most efficient, but Weber would argue that improved human conditions are more important than efficiency.

Weber&#x27;s theory is not perfectly instantiated in real life. The elements of his theory are understood as &quot;ideal types&quot; and are not perfect reflections of individuals in their organizational roles and their interactions within organizations. Some individuals may regard Weber&#x27;s model as good way to run an organization.

==Rational system perspective==
A rational organization system has two significant parts: (1) specificity of goals and (2) formalization. Goal specification provides guidelines for specific tasks to be completed along with a regulated way for resources to be allocated. Formalization is a way to standardize organizational behavior. As a result, there will be stable expectations, which create the rational organizational system.

Scientific management: Frederick Winslow Taylor analyzed how to maximize the amount of output with the least amount of input. This was Taylor&#x27;s attempt to rationalize the individual worker by:
# dividing work between managers and workers
# providing an incentive system (based on performance)
# scientifically trained workers
# developing a science for each individual&#x27;s responsibilities
# making sure work gets done on time/efficiently

Problems arose out of scientific management. One is that the standardization leads workers to rebel against mundanes. Another may see workers rejecting the incentive system because they are required to constantly work at their optimum level, an expectation that may be unrealistic.

=== Formal Organization ===
The concept of formal organization has been touched upon by a number of authors in the subject of organizational theory, such as Max Weber, whose bureaucratic models could be said to be an extension of the concept.

In Chester Barnard&#x27;s book The Functions of the Executive, formal organization is defined as &quot;a system of contributors&#x27; activities that are consciously coordinated by the organization&#x27;s purpose.&quot; This differs from informal organization, such as a human group, that consists of individuals and their interactions, but do not require these to be coordinated toward some common purpose, although formal organizations also consist of informal organizations, as sub-parts of their system.

=== Scientific management ===
The scientific management theory was introduced by Frederick Winslow Taylor to encourage production efficiency and productivity. Taylor argues that inefficiencies could be controlled through managing production as a science. Taylor defines scientific management as &quot;concerned with knowing exactly what you want men to do and then see in that they do it in the best and cheapest way.&quot; According to Taylor, scientific management affects both workers and employers, and stresses control of the labor force by management.

Taylor identifies four inherent principles of the scientific management theory:

# The creation of a scientific method of measurement that replaces the &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot; method
# Emphasis placed on the training of workers by management
# Cooperation between manager and workers to ensure aforementioned principles are being met
# Equal division of labor between managers and workers

==Division of labor==
Division of labor is the separation of tasks so that individuals may specialize, leading to cost efficiency. Adam Smith linked the division of labor to increased efficiency and output. According to Smith, the division of labor is efficient for three reasons: (a) occupational specialization, (b) savings from not changing tasks, and (c) machines augmenting human labor. Occupational specialization leads to increased productivity and distinct skill. Furthermore, Smith argued that the skill of workers should be matched with the technology they employ.

Although division of labor is often viewed as inevitable in a capitalism, several problems emerge. These problems include alienation, lack of creativity, monotony, and lack of mobility. Adam Smith himself foresaw these problems and described the mental torpor the division of labor could create in workers. Creativity will naturally suffer due to the monotonous atmosphere that division of labor creates; repeatedly performing routines may not suit everyone. Furthermore, division of labor gives rise to employees that are not familiar with other parts of the job. They cannot assist employees of different parts of the system.

==Modernization theory==

Modernization &quot;began when a nation&#x27;s rural population started moving from the countryside to cities.&quot; It deals with the cessation of traditional methods in order to pursue more contemporary effective methods of organization. Urbanization is an inevitable characteristic of society because the formation of industries and factories induces profit maximization. It is fair to assume that along with the increase in population, as a result of the subsequent urbanization, is the demand for an intelligent and educated labor force. After the 1950s, Western culture utilized mass-media to communicate their good fortune—attributed to modernization. The coverage promoted &quot;economic mobility&quot; among the social class and increased the aspirations of many hopefuls in developing economic countries. Under this theory, any country could modernize by using Western civilization as a template.

Although this theory of modernization seemed to pride itself on only the benefits, countries in the Middle East saw this movement in a different light. Middle Eastern countries believed that the media coverage of modernization implied that the more &quot;traditional&quot; societies have not &quot;risen to a higher level of technological development.&quot; Consequently, they believed a movement that benefits those who have the monetary resources to modernize technological development would discriminate against the minorities and poor masses. Thus, they were reluctant to modernize because of the economic gap it would create between the rich and the poor.

The growth of modernization took place beginning in the 1950s. For the ensuing decade, people analyzed the diffusion of technological innovations within Western society and the communication that helped it disperse globally. This first &quot;wave,&quot; as it became known, had some significant ramifications. First, economic development was enhanced from the spread of new technological techniques. Second, modernization supported a more educated society (as mentioned above), and thus a more qualified labor-force. The second wave, taking place during the 1970s and 1980s, was a critical reframing of modernization, viewing the push of innovations of Western society onto developing countries as an exertion of dominance. It refuted the concept of relying heavily on mass media for the betterment of society. The last wave of modernization theory, which took place in the 1990s, depicts impersonality. As the use of newspapers, television, and radio becomes more prevalent, the need for direct contact, a concept traditional organizations took pride in, diminishes. Thus, organizational interactions become more distant.

According to Frank Dobbin, the &quot;modern worldview&quot; is the idea that &quot;modern institutions are transparently purposive and that we are in the midst an extraordinary progression towards more efficiency.&quot; This concept epitomizes the goal of modern firms, bureaucracies, and organizations to maximize efficiency. The key to achieving this goal is through scientific discoveries and innovations. Dobbin discusses the outdated role of culture in organizations. &quot;New Institutionalists&quot; explored the significance of culture in the modern organization. However, the rationalist worldview counters the use of cultural values in organizations, stating, &quot;transcendental economic laws exist, that existing organizational structures must be functional under the parameters of those laws, [and] that the environment will eliminate organizations that adopt non-efficient solutions.&quot; These laws govern the modern organizations and lead them in the direction that will maximize profits efficiently. Thus, the modernity of organizations is to generate maximum profit, through the use of mass media, technological innovations, and social innovations in order to effectively allocate resources for the betterment of the global economy.

== Hawthorne study ==

The Neoclassical perspective began with the Hawthorne studies in the 1920s. This approach gave emphasis to &quot;affective and socio-psychological aspects of human behavior in organizations.&quot;

The Hawthorne study suggested that employees have social and psychological needs along with economic needs in order to be motivated to complete their assigned tasks. This theory of management was a product of the strong opposition against &quot;the Scientific and universal management process theory of Taylor and Fayol.&quot; This theory was a response to the way employees were treated in companies and how they were deprived of their needs and ambitions.

In November 1924, a team of researcher – professors from the renowned Harvard Business School began investigating into the human aspects of work and working conditions at the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric Company, Chicago. The company was producing bells and other electric equipments for the telephone industry. Prominent professors in the research team included psychologist Elton Mayo, sociologists Roethlisberger and Whilehead, and company representative William Dickson. The team conducted four separate experimental and behavioral studies over a seven-year period. These were:

# &quot;Illumination Experiments (1924–27) to find out the effect of illumination on worker&#x27;s productivity.&quot;
# &quot;Relay Assembly Test Room experiment (1927–28) to find out the effect of changes in number of work hour and related working condition on worker productivity.&quot;
# &quot;Experiment in interviewing Working: In 1928, a number of researchers went directly to workers, kept the variables of previous experiment aside, and talked about what was, in their opinion, important to them. Around 20,000 workers were interviewed over a period of two years. The interviews enabled the researchers to discover a rich and intriguing world that was previously undiscovered and unexamined within the previously undertaken Hawthorne studies. The discovery of the informal organization and its relationship to the formal organization was the landmark of experiments in interviewing workers. This experiment led to a richer understanding of the social and interpersonal dynamics of people at work.&quot;
# &quot;Bank wiring Room Experiments (1931–32) to find out social system of an organization.&quot;

===Results===
The Hawthorne studies helped conclude that &quot;a human/social element operated in the workplace and that productivity increases were as much an outgrowth of group dynamics as of managerial demands and physical factors.&quot; The Hawthorne studies also concluded that although financial motives were important, social factors are just as important in defining the worker-productivity.

The &quot;Hawthorne Effect&quot; was the improvement of productivity between the employees, characterized by:
*The satisfactory interrelationships between the coworkers
*Classification of personnel as social beings and proposes that sense of belonging in the workplace is important to increase productivity levels in the workforce.
*An effective management that understood the way people interacted and behaved within the group.
*The management attempts to improve interpersonal skills through motivations, leading, communication and counseling.
*Encouragement of managers to acquire minimal knowledge of behavioral sciences to be able to understand and improve the interactions between employees

=== Criticism ===
Critics believed that Mayo gave a lot of importance to the social side of the study rather than addressing the needs of an organization. Also, they believed that the study takes advantage of employees because it influences their emotions by making it seem as if they are satisfied and content, however it is merely a tool that is being used to further advance the productivity of the organization.

== Polyphonic organizations ==

:de:Niels Åkerstrøm Andersen&#x27;s research about polyphonic organization arise out of his understanding of the society as functionally differentiated. The society is divided into a number of countless social systems; communication systems with their own values and commutative code. Niels Andersen is inspired by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann and his theory about social systems. The core element of Luhmann&#x27;s theory pivots around the problem of the contingency of the meaning. In other words, the system theory becomes a theory of communication and how meaning is created within different social systems.

Niels Anders uses the elements of Luhmann&#x27;s system theory to describe the differentiation of society and connect that to the evolution of the modern organization. According to Andersen, society is functionally differentiated into a wide range of systems with their own binary code. The binary codes set some distinctions between a positive and negative value and divide the world in two halves. Understandings of the world are made throughout one side of the binary code. Andersen says that an organizational system always communicates and creates meaning through a function system (binary code). In other words, an organization can only communicate through one side of one binary code at once.

Throughout history organizations have always used several codes in their communication, but they have always had a primary codification. Andersen calls this type of organization a homophonic organization. The homophonic organization is no longer exercised in today&#x27;s society. According to Andersen, today we have polyphonic organizations. 
Polyphonic organizations have emerged as a result of the way that the function systems have exploded beyond their organizational forms.

A polyphonic organization is an organization that is connected to several function systems without a predefined primary function system (multiple binary codifications). In other words, the polyphonic organization is an organization that describes itself through many codes.

Andersen addresses how it can be difficult for companies to plan their communication and action because they have to mediate between many codes at the same time. There is no longer a predicted hierarchy of codes and therefore no connection between organizations and specific communication. This can also create management challenges for companies because they have to take more factors into account compared to earlier. Andersen&#x27;s view on polyphonic organizations provides a newer way to critically examine modern organization and their communication decisions.

A scholar closely associated with the research about polyphonic organizations is :de:Niels Åkerstrøm Andersen. Niels Andersen believes that modern organizations have exploded beyond their original organizational boundaries. For many years, private companies have automatically been understood as part of the economy in the same way that political parties are considered a part of politics and museums are considered a part of art. Today, concepts are linked together, according to Niels Å. Andersen, is this called the polyphonic organizational-movement. This claim was first made back in 1963 by Richard M. Cyert and James G. March in the book &quot;A behavioral theory of the firm&quot;. They said that organizations rarely operate with only one value. According to Cyert and March, organizations actually often operate with more values in their everyday behavior. Niels Å. Andersen elaborates on this assertion in many of his publications.

==Contingency theory==
The contingency theory views organization design as &quot;a constrained optimization problem,&quot; meaning that an organization must try to maximize performance by minimizing the effects of varying environmental and internal constraints. Contingency theory claims there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make decisions. An organizational, leadership, or decision making style that is effective in some situations, may not be successful in other situations. The optimal organization, leadership, or decision making style depends upon various internal and external constraints (factors).

===Factors===
Some examples of such constraints (factors) include:
*The size of the organization
*How the firm adapts itself to its environment
*Differences among resources and operations activities
1. Contingency on the organization

In the contingency theory on the organization, it states that there is no universal or one best way to manage an organization. Secondly, the organizational design and its subsystems must &quot;fit&quot; with the environment and lastly, effective organizations must not only have a proper &quot;fit&quot; with the environment, but also between its subsystems.

2. Contingency theory of leadership

In the contingency theory of leadership, the success of the leader is a function of various factors in the form of subordinate, task, and/ or group variables. The following theories stress using different styles of leadership appropriate to the needs created by different organizational situations. Some of these theories are:

* The contingency theory: The contingency model theory, developed by Fred Fiedler, explains that group performance is a result of interaction between the style of the leader and the characteristics of the environment in which the leader works.
* The Hersey–Blanchard situational theory: This theory is an extension of Blake and Mouton&#x27;s Managerial Grid and Reddin&#x27;s 3-D Management style theory. This model expanded the notion of relationship and task dimensions to leadership, and readiness dimension.
3. Contingency theory of decision-making

The effectiveness of a decision procedure depends upon a number of aspects of the situation:

*The importance of the decision quality and acceptance.
*The amount of relevant information possessed by the leader and subordinates.
*The amount of disagreement among subordinates with respect to their alternatives.

=== Criticism ===
It has been argued that the contingency theory implies that a leader switch is the only method to correct any problems facing leadership styles in certain organizational structures. In addition, the contingency model itself has been questioned in its credibility.

<text>A micro air vehicle (MAV), or micro aerial vehicle, is a class of man-portable miniature UAVs whose size enables them to be used in low-altitude, close-in support operations. Modern MAVs can be as small as 5 centimeters - compare Nano Air Vehicle. Development is driven by commercial, research, government, and military organizations; with insect-sized aircraft reportedly expected in the future.
The small craft allow remote observation of hazardous environments or of areas inaccessible to ground vehicles. Hobbyists have designed MAVs for applications such as aerial robotics contests and aerial photography.
MAVs can offer autonomous modes of flight.

==Practical implementations==
In 2008, the TU Delft University in the Netherlands developed the smallest ornithopter fitted with a camera, the DelFly Micro, the third version of the DelFly project that started in 2005. This version measures 10 centimeters and weighs 3 grams, slightly larger (and noisier) than the dragonfly on which it was modeled. The importance of the camera lies in remote control when the DelFly is out of sight. However, this version has not yet been successfully tested outside, although it performs well indoors. Researcher David Lentink of Wageningen University, who participated in the development of previous models, DelFly I and DelFly II, says it will take at least half a century to mimic the capabilities of insects, with their low energy consumption and multitude of sensors—not only eyes, but gyroscopes, wind sensors, and much more. He says fly-size ornithopters should be possible, provided the tail is well designed. Rick Ruijsink of TU Delft cites battery weight as the biggest problem; the lithium-ion battery in the DelFly micro, at one gram, constitutes a third of the weight. Luckily, developments in this area are still going very fast, due to the demand in various other commercial fields.

Ruijsink says the purpose of these crafts is to understand insect flight and to provide practical uses, such as flying through cracks in concrete to search for earthquake victims or exploring radioactivity-contaminated buildings. Spy agencies and the military also see potential for such small vehicles as spies and scouts.

Robert Wood at Harvard University developed an even smaller ornithopter, at just 3 centimeters, but this craft is not autonomous in that it gets its power through a wire. The group has achieved controlled hovering flight in 2013 as well as landings on and takeoffs from different overhangs in 2016 (both inside a motion tracking environment).

The T-Hawk MAV, a ducted fan VTOL Micro-UAV, was developed by the United States company Honeywell and entered service in 2007. This MAV is used by the US Army and US Navy Explosive Ordnance Division to search areas for roadside bombs and inspect targets. The device was also deployed at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan to provide video and radioactivity readings after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In early 2008, Honeywell received FAA approval to operate its MAV, designated as &quot;gMAV&quot; in the national airspace on an experimental basis. The gMAV is the fourth MAV to receive such approval. The Honeywell gMAV uses ducted thrust for lift, allowing it to take off and land vertically and to hover. It is also capable of &quot;high-speed&quot; forward flight, according to the company, but no performance figures have been released. The company also states that the machine is light enough to be carried by a man. It was originally developed as part of a DARPA program, and its initial application is expected to be with the police department of Miami-Dade County, Florida.

In January 2010, Tamkang University (TKU) in Taiwan realized autonomous control of flight altitude of an 8-gram, 20-centimeter wide, flapping-wing MAV. The MEMS (MICRO-ELECTRO-MECHANICAL SYSTEMS) Lab of TKU had been developing MAVs for several years, and in 2007 the Space and Flight Dynamics (SFD) Lab joined the research team for the development of autonomous flight MAVs. Instead of traditional sensors and computational devices, which are too heavy for most MAVs, the SFD combined a stereo-vision system with a ground station to control the flight altitude, making it the first flapping-wing MAV under 10 grams that realized autonomous flight.
In 2012, the British Army deployed the sixteen gram Black Hornet Nano Unmanned Air Vehicle to Afghanistan to support infantry operations.

==Practical limitations==
Although there are currently no true MAVs (i.e., truly micro scaled flyers) in existence, DARPA has attempted a program to develop even smaller Nano Air Vehicles (NAVs) with a wingspan of 7.5 centimeters. However, no NAVs meeting DARPA&#x27;s original program specification were forthcoming until 2009 when AeroVironment demonstrated a controlled hovering of DARPA&#x27;s flapping-wing NAV.

Beyond the difficulties in developing MAVs, few designs adequately address control issues. The MAVs&#x27; small size makes teleoperation impractical because a ground station pilot cannot see it beyond 100 meters. An onboard camera allowing the ground pilot to stabilize and navigate the craft was first demonstrated in the Aerovironment Black Widow, but truly micro air vehicles cannot carry onboard transmitters powerful enough to allow for teleoperation. For this reason, some researchers have focused on fully autonomous MAV flight. One such device, which has been designed from its inception as a fully autonomous MAV, is the biologically-inspired Entomopter originally developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology under a DARPA contract by Robert C. Michelson.

Given that MAVs can be controlled by autonomous means, significant test and evaluation issues continue to exist. Some of the problems that might be encountered in physical vehicles are being approached through simulations of these models.

Limited flight duration is another limitation these vehicles face. This is especially true for vehicles weighing less than 10 grams, which are constrained to 10 minute flights. Solar-powered MAVs are a potential solution, but payload capacity and poor trade-offs between lift generation and power efficiency reduce their viability. However, Shen et al. (2024) hit upon a vehicle that could subvert these limitations, which they named the CoulombFly. The CoulombFly weighs 4.21 grams, yet can achieve 1 hour flights. This is realized with &quot;an electrostatic-driven propulsion system with a high lift-to-power efficiency of 30.7 g W−1 and an ultralight kilovolt power system with a low power consumption of 0.568 W&quot;.

==Bio-inspiration==

A new trend in the MAV community is to take inspiration from flying insects or birds to achieve unprecedented flight capabilities. Biological systems are not only interesting to MAV engineers for their use of unsteady aerodynamics with flapping wings; they are increasingly inspiring engineers for other aspects such as distributed sensing and acting, sensor fusion and information processing. Recent research within the USAF has focused on development of bird like perching mechanism. A ground mobility and perching mechanism inspired from bird claws was recently developed by Vishwa Robotics and MIT and sponsored by US Air Force Research Laboratory.

Various symposia bringing together biologists and aerial roboticists have been held with increasing frequency since 2000 and some books have recently been published on this topic. Bio-inspiration has been also used in design of methods for stabilization and control of systems of multiple MAVs. Researchers took inspiration from observed behaviors of schools of fish and flocks of birds to control artificial swarms of MAVs and from rules observed in groups of migratory birds to stabilize compact MAV formations.

<text>Squadron Leader Robert Kronfeld, AFC (5 May 1904 – 12 February 1948) was an Austrian-born gliding champion and sailplane designer of the 1920s and 30s. He became a British subject and an RAF test pilot. He was killed testing a glider in 1948.

==Early life==

Kronfeld was born in Vienna, the son of dentist also called Robert Kronfeld (1874–1946), who was nephew of Adolf Kronfeld (de) (doctor, writer), Ernst Moriz Kronfeld (de) (botanist), both Galician Jews.
In his youth his favourite sport was boating.

==Gliding==
As a young man, he visited the Wasserkuppe in Germany and became passionate about the sport of gliding that was developing there. So Kronfeld became a member of the first Austrian gliding school. 
He befriended Walter Georgii, who was a meteorologist working at the nearby Darmstadt University of Technology and who had recently discovered thermals. Kronfeld became something of a test-pilot for Georgii, investigating this still-new phenomenon with the assistance of a variometer disguised as a vacuum flask.

In 1926, the German newspaper &quot;Grüne Post&quot; offered a RM 5,000 prize for the first glider pilot to fly . Kronfeld took up the challenge in 1929 and selected a long chain of hills, the Teutoburger Wald, as a promising site for the record attempt.&lt;br&gt; 
He took off in a glider of his own design, named &quot;Wien (&quot;Vienna&quot;)&quot;, launched by bungee, near Ibbenbüren. After a flight lasting over five hours, he landed near Detmold, 102.5 km away. Kronfeld used the prize money to build a gigantic sailplane, named &quot;Austria&quot;, which had a wingspan of 30 metres - a record not to be matched until the end of the twentieth century. Kronfeld was awarded the Hindenburg Cup in 1930. In the same year he undertook the first flight from a mountain in Lower Austria. He also staged large air shows.
By 1930 he held the world records for distance (164 km) and height (2,589 m).

In 1930 he also had success gliding in England.

On 15 February 1931 Robert Kronfeld and Wolf Hirth were the first men awarded the &quot;Silver C&quot;.

On 20 June 1931 Kronfeld was the first pilot to fly a glider across the English Channel, making a return flight the same day. For this he won £1000 from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;

Kronfeld was an Air Scout within the &quot;Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund&quot; and took part in the 4th World Scout Jamboree (1933) in Hungary as a member of the Austrian contingent. He participated in the Air Scout camp and contributed to the Airshow. He served as Commissioner for Air Scouts of the Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund. Kronfeld also was an honorary member of this Scout association.

In addition to being the first person to pilot a glider across the English Channel, on Saturday 4 June 1938, Kronfeld became the first pilot to fly a towed glider across the Irish Sea. Under tow from an Avro Cadet piloted by Mark Lacayo, they departed Kirby Moorside, Yorkshire, proceeding westwards via Blackpool the original planned point in order to make the crossing to Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man.

However, with an airspeed of 65 knots flying into a 50 knot head wind resulting in a groundspeed of 15 knots, it was difficult to make concerted progress and at one point Lacayo suggested abandoning the attempt. The wind was causing significant problems in addition to lowering cloud and had blown the aircraft and glider 30 nautical miles off course. Nevertheless, Kronfeld was determined to make the attempt and they managed to fix their position at 2,000 feet above St Bees Head and re-planned a crossing to Maughold Head. The weather resulted in the aircraft and glider descending to only 50 feet above the sea and a further problem was being caused by reducing visibility and the approaching darkness. The sea crossing took 1 hour 50 minutes. Due to the weather conditions a landing at Ronaldsway Airport could not be made and this resulted in them diverting to Hall Caine Airport, touching down at 20:00hrs. On Tuesday 7 June, Kronfeld gave an exhibition of aerobatics over Ronaldsway as a feature of the 1938 Manx Air Derby.
==Exile==
In 1933, the new Nazi government prohibited Jews from flying, and as a Jew, Kronfeld fled Germany first for Austria, later for the United Kingdom. 
In 1934 he was awarded the Silver medal of the Lilienthal Society. 
There, he continued flying, taking over the British Aircraft Company, and in 1938 became chief instructor for the newly founded Oxford University and City Gliding Club (now split up in the Oxford University Gliding Club and the separate Oxford Gliding Club). He settled in England in January 1938 and his father followed him to England in 1939.

Kronfeld was a member of the Österreichischer Aero Club and brought the records of this association to the United Kingdom.

In 1939 he became a British citizen and during World War II he served in the Royal Air Force. He held the rank of Squadron Leader. He was posted to the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment on military glider development. For that work he was awarded the Air Force Cross.

Post war, as Chief Test Pilot for General Aircraft, he was killed in the crash of an experimental flying wing glider - the General Aircraft GAL 56 (&quot;TS507&quot;) - during stalling trials, at Lower Froyle after taking-off from Lasham Airfield. After successfully recovering from a stall, the aircraft entered an inverted dive. His observer was able to leave the aircraft and survived despite a low level parachute opening.

There are streets named after Robert Kronfeld in Detmold (&quot;Robert-Kronfeld-Straße&quot;), Fulda (&quot;Robert-Kronfeld-Straße&quot;), Oerlinghausen (&quot;Robert-Kronfeld-Straße&quot;), Gerasdorf (&quot;Kronfeldgasse), Graz (&quot;Kronfeldgasse) and Vienna (&quot;Kronfeldgasse&quot;).

In 1990 a memorial stone, commemorating the first 100 km flight by Kronfeld in 1929, was erected by the &quot;Heimatverein am Hermannshöhenweg&quot; near Riesenbeck.

In 1997 a memorial stone was erected on the Königsberg near Detmold (GPS 51° 55&#x27; N, 8° 53&#x27; E), where Kronfeld landed after his 100 km flight.

The Robert-Kronfeld-Memorial Prize (&quot;Robert-Kronfeld-Gedächtnispreis&quot;) is awarded by the Segelflugschule Oerlinghausen, since 1979.
&quot;The-Robert-Kronfeld-Cup was awarded by the State Government of Austria on the occasion of the 21st World Gliding Championships 1989 in Wiener Neustadt.&quot; It is also named The Robert Kronfeld Challenge Cup. 
There is also a Robert Kronfeld-contest (&quot;Robert-Kronfeld-Wettbewerb&quot;) organized by the &quot;Segelflugschule Oerlinghausen&quot;.

In 1961 the Robert Kronfeld Memorial flight from Innsbruck to Kufstein (&quot;Kronfeld-Gedächnissegelflug&quot;) took place and a special cachet was issued commemorating this flight.
In 1994 a special cachet was issued commemorating Robert Kronfeld&#x27;s 90th Birthday.
Robert Kronfeld was commemorated in an exhibition in the National Scout Center of the Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund in Vienna in September 2010 and stamp and special cachet were issued.

An Air Scout group of the &quot;Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund&quot; in the 1960s was named after Robert Kronfeld.

The sole surviving Kronfeld Drone de Luxe, G-AEKV, built in 1936, is preserved at Brooklands Museum, Surrey, UK. Acquired by Mike Beach in the early 1980s and restored to flying condition at Brooklands around 1984, &#x27;KV was later purchased by Brooklands Museum with the support of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant and is kept in ground running condition.

An orchard in memory of Robert and his son was created at Lasham Airfield in 2014.

In the years following Kronfeld&#x27;s death his widow, Margaret, approached L Wingfield MC DFC, to create a lasting memorial, to which the Oxford Gliding Club, was reformed, flying at Kidlington Airport in 1951. Kronfeld been the first permanent Chief Flying Instructor in 1938. The club is still operating, based at RAF Weston-on-the-Green to the north of Oxford City.

<text>Country Style Food Services, Inc., formerly Country Style Donuts, is a fast/casual chain of coffee shops operating primarily in the Canadian province of Ontario (where it ranks second among coffee chains), which serves oatmeal, soup, sandwiches, salads, baked goods including donuts, and coffee. The chain is based in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

==Organization==
In January 2006, there were 120 &quot;traditional&quot; locations in Ontario. There are over 420 &quot;non-traditional&quot; locations embedded in other stores such as gas stations, convenience stores, arenas and movie theatres. Over 70% of customer purchases in 2001 were coffee. In total, Country Style has over 1000 locations in Ontario, Western Canada, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick under the Country Style/Bistro name.

==History==
Country Style has been in business since 1963 when it opened its first location in Toronto. Country Style experienced a lot of growth early on, opening 100 stores in the first 15–20 years of existence. It had 50 outlets in 1974 when it was the leading coffee and donut establishment in Canada above Tim Hortons (which passed it two years later). It began to expand into Western Canada in the 1970s (including Vancouver and Calgary) and the East in the early 1980s. Poor results caused the franchise to withdraw from these regions: locations in Alberta were the only ones to survive into the 1990s, while in the East, it was ones in Nova Scotia and PEI.

By 2001, Country Style had been forced to close a quarter of its stores due to decreasing market share in an increasingly competitive Canadian market. Since then, it has opened many new stores and now ranks third behind Tim Hortons and McDonald&#x27;s in the Canadian coffee market. On November 1, 2011, its parent company, MTY Food Group, bought Mr. Sub for $23 million merging it with Country style to become Country Style Food Services Holdings Inc.

In the mid-1990s the Country Style logo was changed to use a font similar to Palatino instead of its former handwriting font.
In 2006, Country Style changed its image to a more upscale style: &quot;Country Style Bistro Deli&quot;. The new image includes a new logo, a new website, and an enhanced branded deli menu that will be phased into all stores. The logo still uses the Palatino style font and will also be phased into all stores. New stores will feature more modern design features, somewhat similar to Starbucks, and provides wide range of wraps, smoothies, breakfast, salads and sweets. In 2009, the brand rights to Country Style, used at 900 locations, were purchased by MTY Food Group of Montreal for $14.6 million in cash and debt.

In 2017, the stores in the Philippine franchise were rebranded to &quot;New Bistro Deli&quot;.

==Charity work==

In April 2003, Country Style partnered with the Make a Wish Foundation as its corporate charity of choice.

<doc id="447832" wikidata="Q138864" url="?curid=447832" title="Helicase">
<text>Helicases are a class of enzymes that are vital to all organisms. Their main function is to unpack an organism&#x27;s genetic material. Helicases are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic double helix, separating the two hybridized nucleic acid strands (hence &quot;helic- + &quot;), via the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases, representing the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases.

The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases. Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases. Some specialized helicases are also involved in sensing viral nucleic acids during infection and fulfill an immunological function. Genetic mutations that affect helicases can have wide-reaching impacts for an organism, due to their significance in many biological processes.

== Function ==

Helicases are often used to separate strands of a DNA double helix or a self-annealed RNA molecule using the energy from ATP hydrolysis, a process characterized by the breaking of hydrogen bonds between annealed nucleotide bases. They also function to remove nucleic acid-associated proteins and catalyze homologous DNA recombination. Metabolic processes of RNA such as translation, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, RNA splicing, RNA transport, RNA editing, and RNA degradation are all facilitated by helicases. Helicases move incrementally along one nucleic acid strand of the duplex with a directionality and processivity specific to each particular enzyme.

Helicases adopt different structures and oligomerization states. Whereas DnaB-like helicases unwind DNA as ring-shaped hexamers, other enzymes have been shown to be active as monomers or dimers. Studies have shown that helicases may act passively, waiting for uncatalyzed unwinding to take place and then translocating between displaced strands, or can play an active role in catalyzing strand separation using the energy generated in ATP hydrolysis. In the latter case, the helicase acts comparably to an active motor, unwinding and translocating along its substrate as a direct result of its ATPase activity. Helicases may process much faster &quot;in vivo&quot; than &quot;in vitro&quot; due to the presence of accessory proteins that aid in the destabilization of the fork junction.

=== Activation barrier in helicase activity ===
Enzymatic helicase action, such as unwinding nucleic acids, is achieved through the lowering of the activation barrier (formula_1) of each specific action. The activation barrier is a result of various factors, and can be defined by
: formula_2
where
* formula_3 = number of unwound base pairs (bps),
* formula_4 = free energy of base pair formation,
* formula_5 = reduction of free energy due to helicase, and
* formula_6 = reduction of free energy due to unzipping forces.
Factors that contribute to the height of the activation barrier include: specific nucleic acid sequence of the molecule involved, the number of base pairs involved, tension present on the replication fork, and destabilization forces.

=== Active and passive helicases ===
The size of the activation barrier to overcome by the helicase contributes to its classification as an active or passive helicase. In passive helicases, a significant activation barrier exists (defined as formula_7, where formula_8 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_9 is temperature of the system). Due to this significant activation barrier, its unwinding progression is affected largely by the sequence of nucleic acids within the molecule to unwind, and the presence of destabilization forces acting on the replication fork. Certain nucleic acid combinations will decrease unwinding rates (i.e. guanine and cytosine), while various destabilizing forces can increase the unwinding rate. In passive systems, the rate of unwinding (formula_10) is less than the rate of translocation (formula_11) (translocation along the single-strand nucleic acid, ssNA), due to its reliance on the transient unraveling of the base pairs at the replication fork to determine its rate of unwinding.

In active helicases, formula_12, where the system lacks a significant barrier, as the helicase can destabilize the nucleic acids, unwinding the double-helix at a constant rate, regardless of the nucleic acid sequence. In active helicases, formula_13 is closer to formula_14, due to the active helicase ability to directly destabilize the replication fork to promote unwinding.

Active helicases show similar behaviour when acting on both double-strand nucleic acids, dsNA, or ssNA, in regards to the rates of unwinding and rates of translocation, where in both systems formula_13 and formula_14 are approximately equal.

These two categories of helicases may also be modeled as mechanisms. In such models, the passive helicases are conceptualized as Brownian ratchets, driven by thermal fluctuations and subsequent anisotropic gradients across the DNA lattice. The active helicases, in contrast, are conceptualized as stepping motors – also known as powerstroke motors – utilizing either a conformational &quot;inch worm&quot; or a hand-over-hand &quot;walking&quot; mechanism to progress. Depending upon the organism, such helix-traversing progress can occur at rotational speeds in the range of 5,000 to 10,000 R.P.M.

== History of DNA helicases ==
DNA helicases were discovered in &quot;E. coli&quot; in 1976. This helicase was described as a &quot;DNA unwinding enzyme&quot; that is &quot;found to denature DNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent reaction, without detectably degrading&quot;. The first eukaryotic DNA helicase discovered was in 1978 in the lily plant. Since then, DNA helicases were discovered and isolated in other bacteria, viruses, yeast, flies, and higher eukaryotes. To date, at least 14 different helicases have been isolated from single celled organisms, 6 helicases from bacteriophages, 12 from viruses, 15 from yeast, 8 from plants, 11 from calf thymus, and approximately 25 helicases from human cells. Below is a history of helicase discovery:

== Structural features ==
The common function of helicases accounts for the fact that they display a certain degree of amino acid sequence homology; they all possess sequence motifs located in the interior of their primary structure, involved in ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and translocation along the nucleic acid substrate. The variable portion of the amino acid sequence is related to the specific features of each helicase.

The presence of these helicase motifs allows putative helicase activity to be attributed to a given protein, but does not necessarily confirm it as an active helicase. Conserved motifs do, however, support an evolutionary homology among enzymes. Based on these helicase motifs, a number of helicase superfamilies have been distinguished.

== Superfamilies ==
Helicases are classified in 6 groups (superfamilies) based on their shared sequence motifs. Helicases not forming a ring structure are in superfamilies 1 and 2, and ring-forming helicases form part of superfamilies 3 to 6. Helicases are also classified as α or β depending on if they work with single or double-strand DNA; α helicases work with single-strand DNA and β helicases work with double-strand DNA. They are also classified by translocation polarity. If translocation occurs 3’-5’ the helicase is type A; if translocation occurs 5’-3’ it is type B.

*Superfamily 1 (SF1): This superfamily can be further subdivided into SF1A and SF1B helicases. In this group helicases can have either 3’-5’ (SF1A subfamily) or 5’-3’(SF1B subfamily) translocation polarity. The most known SF1A helicases are Rep and UvrD in gram-negative bacteria and PcrA helicase from gram-positive bacteria. The most known Helicases in the SF1B group are RecD and Dda helicases. They have a RecA-like-fold core.
* Superfamily 2 (SF2): This is the largest group of helicases that are involved in varied cellular processes. They are characterized by the presence of nine conserved motifs: Q, I, Ia, Ib, and II through VI. This group is mainly composed of DEAD-box RNA helicases. Some other helicases included in SF2 are the RecQ-like family and the Snf2-like enzymes. Most of the SF2 helicases are type A with a few exceptions such as the XPD family. They have a RecA-like-fold core.
* Superfamily 3 (SF3): Superfamily 3 consists of AAA+ helicases encoded mainly by small DNA viruses and some large nucleocytoplasmic DNA viruses. They have a 3’-5’ translocation directionality, meaning that they are all type A helicases. The most known SF3 helicase is the papilloma virus E1 helicase.
* Superfamily 4 (SF4): All SF4 family helicases have a type B polarity (5’-3’). They have a RecA fold. The most studied SF4 helicase is gp4 from bacteriophage T7.
* Superfamily 5 (SF5): Rho proteins conform the SF5 group. They have a RecA fold.
* Superfamily 6 (SF6): They contain the core AAA+ that is not included in the SF3 classification. Some proteins in the SF6 group are: mini chromosome maintenance MCM, RuvB, RuvA, and RuvC.

All helicases are members of a P-loop, or Walker motif-containing family.

== Helicase disorders and diseases ==

=== ATRX helicase mutations ===
The &quot;ATRX&quot; gene encodes the ATP-dependent helicase, ATRX (also known as XH2 and XNP) of the SNF2 subgroup family, that is thought to be responsible for functions such as chromatin remodeling, gene regulation, and DNA methylation. These functions assist in prevention of apoptosis, resulting in cortical size regulation, as well as a contribution to the survival of hippocampal and cortical structures, affecting memory and learning. This helicase is located on the X chromosome (Xq13.1-q21.1), in the pericentromeric heterochromatin and binds to heterochromatin protein 1. Studies have shown that ATRX plays a role in rDNA methylation and is essential for embryonic development. Mutations have been found throughout the &quot;ATRX&quot; protein, with over 90% of them being located in the zinc finger and helicase domains. Mutations of ATRX can result in X-linked-alpha-thalassaemia-mental retardation (ATR-X syndrome).

Various types of mutations found in ATRX have been found to be associated with ATR-X, including most commonly single-base missense mutations, as well as nonsense, frameshift, and deletion mutations. Characteristics of ATR-X include: microcephaly, skeletal and facial abnormalities, mental retardation, genital abnormalities, seizures, limited language use and ability, and alpha-thalassemia. The phenotype seen in ATR-X suggests that the mutation of ATRX gene causes the downregulation of gene expression, such as the alpha-globin genes. It is still unknown what causes the expression of the various characteristics of ATR-X in different patients.

=== XPD helicase point mutations ===
XPD (Xeroderma pigmentosum factor D, also known as protein ERCC2) is a 5&#x27;-3&#x27;, Superfamily II, ATP-dependent helicase containing iron-sulphur cluster domains. Inherited point mutations in XPD helicase have been shown to be associated with accelerated aging disorders such as Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy are both developmental disorders involving sensitivity to UV light and premature aging, and Cockayne syndrome exhibits severe mental retardation from the time of birth. The XPD helicase mutation has also been implicated in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a disorder characterized by sensitivity to UV light and resulting in a several 1000-fold increase in the development of skin cancer.

XPD is an essential component of the TFIIH complex, a transcription and repair factor in the cell. As part of this complex, it facilitates nucleotide excision repair by unwinding DNA. TFIIH assists in repairing damaged DNA such as sun damage. A mutation in the XPD helicase that helps form this complex and contributes to its function causes the sensitivity to sunlight seen in all three diseases, as well as the increased risk of cancer seen in XP and premature aging seen in trichothiodystrophy and Cockayne syndrome.

XPD helicase mutations leading to trichothiodystrophy are found throughout the protein in various locations involved in protein-protein interactions. This mutation results in an unstable protein due to its inability to form stabilizing interactions with other proteins at the points of mutations. This, in turn, destabilizes the entire TFIIH complex, which leads to defects with transcription and repair mechanisms of the cell.

It has been suggested that XPD helicase mutations leading to Cockayne syndrome could be the result of mutations within XPD, causing rigidity of the protein and subsequent inability to switch from repair functions to transcription functions due to a &quot;locking&quot; in repair mode. This could cause the helicase to cut DNA segments meant for transcription. Although current evidence points to a defect in the XPD helicase resulting in a loss of flexibility in the protein in cases of Cockayne syndrome, it is still unclear how this protein structure leads to the symptoms described in Cockayne syndrome.

In xeroderma pigmentosa, the XPD helicase mutation exists at the site of ATP or DNA binding. This results in a structurally functional helicase able to facilitate transcription, however it inhibits its function in unwinding DNA and DNA repair. The lack of a cell&#x27;s ability to repair mutations, such as those caused by sun damage, is the cause of the high cancer rate in xeroderma pigmentosa patients.

=== RecQ family mutations ===

RecQ helicases (3&#x27;-5&#x27;) belong to the Superfamily II group of helicases, which help to maintain stability of the genome and suppress inappropriate recombination. Deficiencies and/or mutations in RecQ family helicases display aberrant genetic recombination and/or DNA replication, which leads to chromosomal instability and an overall decreased ability to proliferate. Mutations in RecQ family helicases BLM, RECQL4, and WRN, which play a role in regulating homologous recombination, have been shown to result in the autosomal recessive diseases Bloom syndrome (BS), Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS), and Werner syndrome (WS), respectively.

Bloom syndrome is characterized by a predisposition to cancer with early onset, with a mean age-of-onset of 24 years. Cells of Bloom syndrome patients show a high frequency of reciprocal exchange between sister chromatids (SCEs) and excessive chromosomal damage. There is evidence to suggest that BLM plays a role in rescuing disrupted DNA replication at replication forks.

Werner syndrome is a disorder of premature aging, with symptoms including early onset of atherosclerosis and osteoporosis and other age related diseases, a high occurrence of sarcoma, and death often occurring from myocardial infarction or cancer in the 4th to 6th decade of life. Cells of Werner syndrome patients exhibit a reduced reproductive lifespan with chromosomal breaks and translocations, as well as large deletions of chromosomal components, causing genomic instability.

Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, also known as poikiloderma congenitale, is characterized by premature aging, skin and skeletal abnormalities, rash, poikiloderma, juvenile cataracts, and a predisposition to cancers such as osteosarcomas. Chromosomal rearrangements causing genomic instability are found in the cells of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome patients. RecQ is a family of DNA helicase enzymes that are found in various organisms including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (like humans). These enzymes play important roles in DNA metabolism during DNA replication, recombination, and repair. There are five known RecQ helicase proteins in humans: RecQ1, BLM, WRN, RecQ4, and RecQ5. Mutations in some of these genes are associated with genetic disorders. For instance, mutations in the BLM gene cause Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by increased cancer risk and other health issues. Mutations in the WRN gene lead to Werner syndrome, a condition characterized by premature aging and an increased risk of age-related diseases. RecQ helicases are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and integrity. They help prevent the accumulation of genetic abnormalities that can lead to diseases like cancer. Genome integrity depends on the RecQ DNA helicase family, which includes DNA repair, recombination, replication, and transcription processes. Genome instability and early aging are conditions that arise from mutations in human RecQ helicases. RecQ helicase Sgs1 is missing in yeast cells, making them useful models for comprehending human cell abnormalities and the RecQ helicase function. The RecQ helicase family member, RECQ1, is connected to a small number of uncommon genetic cancer disorders in individuals. It participates in transcription, the cell cycle, and DNA repair. According to recent research, missense mutations in the RECQ1 gene may play a role in the development of familial breast cancer. DNA helicases are frequently attracted to regions of DNA damage and are essential for cellular DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. Chemical manipulation of their molecular processes can change the rate at which cancer cells divide, as well as, the efficiency of transactions and cellular homeostasis. Small-molecule-induced entrapment of DNA helicases, a type of DNA metabolic protein, may have deleterious consequences on rapidly proliferating cancer cells, which could be effective in cancer treatment.

During meiosis DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages in a chromatid are repaired by homologous recombination using either the sister chromatid or a homologous non-sister chromatid as template. This repair can result in a crossover (CO) or, more frequently, a non-crossover (NCO) recombinant. In the yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; the FANCM-family DNA helicase FmI1 directs NCO recombination formation during meiosis. The RecQ-type helicase Rqh1 also directs NCO meiotic recombination. These helicases, through their ability to unwind D-loop intermediates, promote NCO recombination by the process of synthesis-dependent strand annealing.

In the plant &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, FANCM helicase promotes NCO and antagonizes the formation of CO recombinants. Another helicase, RECQ4A/B, also independently reduces COs. It was suggested that COs are restricted because of the long term costs of CO recombination, that is, the breaking up of favourable genetic combinations of alleles built up by past natural selection.

== RNA helicases ==

RNA helicases are essential for most processes of RNA metabolism such as ribosome biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, and translation initiation. They also play an important role in sensing viral RNAs. RNA helicases are involved in the mediation of antiviral immune response because they can identify foreign RNAs in vertebrates. About 80% of all viruses are RNA viruses and they contain their own RNA helicases. Defective RNA helicases have been linked to cancers, infectious diseases and neuro-degenerative disorders. Some neurological disorders associated with defective RNA helicases are: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia type-2, Alzheimer disease, and lethal congenital contracture syndrome.

RNA helicases and DNA helicases can be found together in all the helicase superfamilies except for SF6. All the eukaryotic RNA helicases that have been identified up to date are non-ring forming and are part of SF1 and SF2. On the other hand, ring-forming RNA helicases have been found in bacteria and viruses. However, not all RNA helicases exhibit helicase activity as defined by enzymatic function, i.e., proteins of the Swi/Snf family. Although these proteins carry the typical helicase motifs, hydrolize ATP in a nucleic acid-dependent manner, and are built around a helicase core, in general, no unwinding activity is observed.

RNA helicases that do exhibit unwinding activity have been characterized by at least two different mechanisms: canonical duplex unwinding and local strand separation. Canonical duplex unwinding is the stepwise directional separation of a duplex strand, as described above, for DNA unwinding. However, local strand separation occurs by a process wherein the helicase enzyme is loaded at any place along the duplex. This is usually aided by a single-strand region of the RNA, and the loading of the enzyme is accompanied with ATP binding. Once the helicase and ATP are bound, local strand separation occurs, which requires binding of ATP but not the actual process of ATP hydrolysis. Presented with fewer base pairs the duplex then dissociates without further assistance from the enzyme. This mode of unwinding is used by the DEAD/DEAH box helicases.

An RNA helicase database is currently available online that contains a comprehensive list of RNA helicases with information such as sequence, structure, and biochemical and cellular functions.

== Diagnostic tools for helicase measurement ==

=== Measuring and monitoring helicase activity ===
Various methods are used to measure helicase activity &quot;in vitro&quot;. These methods range from assays that are qualitative (assays that usually entail results that do not involve values or measurements) to quantitative (assays with numerical results that can be utilized in statistical and numerical analysis). In 1982–1983, the first direct biochemical assay was developed for measuring helicase activity. This method was called a &quot;strand displacement assay&quot;.
* Strand displacement assay involves the radiolabeling of DNA duplexes. Following helicase treatment, the single-strand DNA is visually detected as separate from the double-strand DNA by non-denaturing PAGE electrophoresis. Following detection of the single-strand DNA, the amount of radioactive tag that is on the single-strand DNA is quantified to give a numerical value for the amount of double-strand DNA unwinding.The strand displacement assay is acceptable for qualitative analysis, its inability to display results for more than a single time point, its time consumption, and its dependence on radioactive compounds for labeling warranted the need for development of diagnostics that can monitor helicase activity in real time.

Other methods were later developed that incorporated some, if not all of the following: high-throughput mechanics, the use of non-radioactive nucleotide labeling, faster reaction time/less time consumption, real-time monitoring of helicase activity (using kinetic measurement instead of endpoint/single point analysis). These methodologies include: &quot;a rapid quench flow method, fluorescence-based assays, filtration assays, a scintillation proximity assay, a time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, an assay based on flashplate technology, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence quenching assays, and electrochemiluminescence-based helicase assays&quot;. With the use of specialized mathematical equations, some of these assays can be utilized to determine how many base paired nucleotides a helicase can break per hydrolysis of 1 ATP molecule.

Commercially available diagnostic kits are also available. One such kit is the &quot;Trupoint&quot; diagnostic assay from PerkinElmer, Inc. This assay is a time-resolved fluorescence quenching assay that utilizes the PerkinElmer &quot;SignalClimb&quot; technology that is based on two labels that bind in close proximity to one another but on opposite DNA strands. One label is a fluorescent lanthanide chelate, which serves as the label that is monitored through an adequate 96/384 well plate reader. The other label is an organic quencher molecule. The basis of this assay is the &quot;quenching&quot; or repressing of the lanthanide chelate signal by the organic quencher molecule when the two are in close proximity – as they would be when the DNA duplex is in its native state. Upon helicase activity on the duplex, the quencher and lanthanide labels get separated as the DNA is unwound. This loss in proximity negates the quenchers ability to repress the lanthanide signal, causing a detectable increase in fluorescence that is representative of the amount of unwound DNA and can be used as a quantifiable measurement of helicase activity.
The execution and use of single-molecule fluorescence imaging techniques, focusing on methods that include optical trapping in conjunction with epifluorescent imaging, and also surface immobilization in conjunction with total internal reflection fluorescence visualization. Combined with microchannel flow cells and microfluidic control, allow individual fluorescently labeled protein and DNA molecules to be imaged and tracked, affording measurement of DNA unwinding and translocation at single-molecule resolution.

=== Determining helicase polarity ===
Helicase polarity, which is also deemed &quot;directionality&quot;, is defined as the direction (characterized as 5&#x27;→3&#x27; or 3&#x27;→5&#x27;) of helicase movement on the DNA/RNA single-strand along which it is moving. This determination of polarity is vital in f.ex. determining whether the tested helicase attaches to the DNA leading strand, or the DNA lagging strand. To characterize this helicase feature, a partially duplex DNA is used as the substrate that has a central single-strand DNA region with different lengths of duplex regions of DNA (one short region that runs 5&#x27;→3&#x27; and one longer region that runs 3&#x27;→5&#x27;) on both sides of this region. Once the helicase is added to that central single-strand region, the polarity is determined by characterization on the newly formed single-strand DNA.

<text>Human subject research is systematic, scientific investigation that can be either interventional (a &quot;trial&quot;) or observational (no &quot;test article&quot;) and involves human beings as research subjects, commonly known as test subjects. Human subject research can be either medical (clinical) research or non-medical (e.g., social science) research. Systematic investigation incorporates both the collection and analysis of data in order to answer a specific question. Medical human subject research often involves analysis of biological specimens, epidemiological and behavioral studies and medical chart review studies. (A specific, and especially heavily regulated, type of medical human subject research is the &quot;clinical trial&quot;, in which drugs, vaccines and medical devices are evaluated.) On the other hand, human subject research in the social sciences often involves surveys which consist of questions to a particular group of people. Survey methodology includes questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups.

Human subject research is used in various fields, including research into advanced biology, clinical medicine, nursing, psychology, sociology, political science, and anthropology. As research has become formalized, the academic community has developed formal definitions of &quot;human subject research&quot;, largely in response to abuses of human subjects.

==Human subjects==
The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines a human research subject as a living individual about whom a research investigator (whether a professional or a student) obtains data through 1) intervention or interaction with the individual, or 2) identifiable private information (). (Lim, 1990)

As defined by HHS regulations ():
* Intervention – physical procedures by which data is gathered and the manipulation of the subject or their environment for research purposes.
* Interaction – communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject.
* Private Information – information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public.
* Identifiable information – specific information that can be used to identify an individual.

===Human subject rights===
In 2010, the National Institute of Justice in the United States published recommended rights of human subjects:
* Voluntary, informed consent
* Respect for persons: treated as autonomous agents
* The right to end participation in research at any time
* Right to safeguard integrity
* Protection from physical, mental and emotional harm
* Access to information regarding research
* Protection of privacy and well-being

=== From Subject to Participant ===
The term research subject has traditionally been the preferred term in professional guidelines and academic literature to describe a patient or an individual taking part in biomedical research. In recent years, however, there has been a steady shift away from the use of the term &#x27;research subject&#x27; in favour of &#x27;research participant&#x27; when referring to individuals who take part by providing data to various kinds of biomedical and epidemiological research.

== Ethical guidelines ==

In general, it can be said that experimental infections in humans are tightly linked to a history of scandals in medical research, with scandals being followed by stricter regulatory rules. Ethical guidelines that govern the use of human subjects in research are a fairly new construct. In 1906 some regulations were put in place in the United States to protect subjects from abuses. After the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and institutional review boards (IRBs) were gradually introduced. The policies that these institutions implemented served to minimize harm to the participant&#x27;s mental or physical well-being.

=== The Common Rule ===
The Common Rule, first published in 1991, also known as the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, is dictated by the Office of Human Research Protections under the United States Department of Health and Human Services and serves as a set of guidelines for institutional review boards (IRBs), obtaining informed consent, and Assurances of Compliance for human subject participants in research studies. On January 19, 2017, a final rule was added to the &quot;Federal Register&quot; with an official effective date of July 19, 2018.

===Nuremberg Code===
In 1947, German physicians who conducted deadly or debilitating experiments on concentration camp prisoners were prosecuted as war criminals in the Nuremberg Trials. A portion of the verdict handed down in the doctors&#x27; trial became commonly known as the Nuremberg Code, the first international document to clearly articulate the concept that &quot;the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential&quot;. Individual consent was emphasized in the Nuremberg Code in order to prevent prisoners of war, patients, prisoners, and soldiers from being coerced into becoming human subjects. In addition, it was emphasized in order to inform participants of the risk-benefit outcomes of experiments.

===Declaration of Helsinki===

The Declaration of Helsinki was established in 1964 to regulate international research involving human subjects. Established by the World Medical Association, the declaration recommended guidelines for medical doctors conducting biomedical research that involves human subjects. Some of these guidelines included the principles that &quot;research protocols should be reviewed by an independent committee prior to initiation&quot; and that &quot;research with humans should be based on results from laboratory animals and experimentation&quot;.

The Declaration of Helsinki is widely regarded as the cornerstone document on human research ethics.

===The Belmont Report===
The Belmont Report was created in 1978 by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to describe the ethical behaviors that involve researching human subjects. It is most heavily used by the current United States system for protecting human subjects in research trials. By looking primarily at biomedical and behavioral research that involve human subjects, the report was generated to promise that ethical standards are followed during research of human subjects. There are three standards that serve as the baseline for the report and how human subjects are to be researched. The three guidelines are beneficence, justice and respect for persons. Beneficence is described as protecting the well-being of the persons and respecting their decisions by being ethical and protecting the subjects from harm. The two rules of beneficence are maximizing the benefits of research and minimizing any possible risks. It is the job of the researcher to inform the persons of the benefits as well as the risks of human subject research. Justice is important because it causes the researchers to be fair in their research findings and share what they have found, whether the information is good or bad. The selection process of the subject is supposed to be fair and not separate due to race, sexual orientation or ethnic group. Lastly, respect for persons explains that at any point a person who is involved in a study can decide whether they want to participate, not to participate or withdraw themselves from the study altogether. Two rules of respect for persons involve the person being autonomous and persons with diminished autonomy and entitled to protection. The sole purpose of these guidelines is to ensure autonomy and to protect against those with a lesser chance to remain autonomous because of something out of their control.

== Ethical concerns ==
As science and medicine evolve, the field of bioethics struggles to keep up with updating guidelines and rules to follow. There has been an interest in revisiting the ethics behind human subject trials. Members of the health field have commented that it may be useful to have ethics classes available to students studying to be health care professionals as well as have more discussions surrounding the issues and importance of informed consent. There have also been a bigger push to protect participants in clinical trials. Rules and regulations of clinical trials can vary by country. Suggestions to remedy this include installing a committee to keep better track of this information and ensure that everything is properly documented. Research coordinators and physicians involved in clinical studies have their own concerns, particularly that an implementation of ethics rules could potentially disrupt the logistics of preparing a research study, specifically when it comes to enrolling patients. Another concern that research teams may have is that even if the rules are ethically sound, they may not be logical or helpful for conducting their studies.

Of note currently in the research field is the manner in which researchers direct their conversations with potential human subjects for a research study.

=== Research in rural communities ===
Recently there has been a shift from conducting research studies at research institution facilities or academic centers to rural communities. There is concern surrounding the topics addressed during the discussions with this specific demographic of participants, particularly having to do with funding, overall efficacy of the treatment being studied, and if conducting such studies is done to the highest ethical standard.

Ann Cook and Freeman Hoas from the University of Montana&#x27;s Department of Psychology conducted a study to gain more understanding about what influences potential candidates to consent to participation in any given clinical trial. They published their findings in February 2015. Cook and Hoas asked for the perspectives of the researchers and whether they would consent to being a subject in a clinical trial. To assess the shift to rural communities, they surveyed 34 physicians or researchers and 46 research coordinators from states that have &quot;large rural populations and have historically demonstrated limited participation in clinical research.&quot; Proper consent forms were provided and signed at the start of the study. Of the physicians and research coordinators that participated in this study, 90% were from hospital centers or worked in a hospital-clinic setting. Of all the participants, only 66% of research coordinators and 53% of physicians received training in research methods, while 59% of the coordinators received any ethics training. Only 17% of the physicians had ethics research training prior to this study.

Hoas and Cook categorized their findings into the following main topics:
* source of funding
* morally nagging and challenging issues
* willingness to join a research study

==== The role of funding ====
Cook and Hoas found that funding played a significant role in participant selection. One of Hoas&#x27;s and Cook&#x27;s participants commented that &quot;in his practice, the income from conducting pharmaceutical trials sometimes [is] used to offset the losses of conducting scientifically interesting but poorly funded federal studies,&quot; and most other participants administered trials because &quot;reimbursements generated from such trials made it possible to maintain a financially viable, as well as profitable, practice.&quot; Cook and Hoas found that most of the physicians and coordinators could not explain directly if they actually told their patients or subjects about any financial compensation they received. Respondents worry that discussing funding or compensation would affect enrollment, effectively swaying participants from joining a research study. In most respondents&#x27; experience, most patients do not even ask for that information, so they assume that they do not have to discuss it with them and not jeopardize enrollment. When asked if information about funding or compensation would be important to provide to patients, one physician replied &quot;...certainly it may influence or bring up in their mind questions whether or not, you know, we want them to participate because we&#x27;re gonna get paid for this, you know, budget dollar amount. But, you know, when you talk about full disclosure, is that something that we should be doing? That&#x27;s an interesting question.&quot;

==== Morally nagging or challenging issues ====
Respondents more often pointed out practical or logistical issues with the overall process rather than ethical issues. There was a general consensus that the whole practice of conducting research studies was more focused on the business aspects like funding and enrolling participants in the study in time. A physician commented that &quot;[industry] relationships are very important because of cash flow.&quot;

Typical ethical issues that arise in this type of research trials include participant enrollment, the question of coercion if a physician refers their own patients, and any misunderstandings regarding treatment benefits. Patients are more likely to enroll in a trial if their primary care physician or a provider that they trust recommends the study. Most respondents seem to agree that patients consent to participate because they believe that through this study, they would be receiving &quot;more attention than my regular patients&quot; and that &quot;there are an awful lot of additional opportunities for interaction.&quot; One respondent commented &quot;...the way that we&#x27;re required to actually recruit patients, which is to have their providers be the point of contact, some ways is--I mean, I don&#x27;t want to use the word &#x27;coercion&#x27;, but it&#x27;s kind of leaning in that direction because basically here&#x27;s this person that they entrust themselves to, who they&#x27;re very dependent on for, you know, getting their healthcare.&quot;

There was a large amount of respondents who thought that research participants did not read or understand the documents provided for informed consent. However, those respondents did not believe that was an ethical or moral concern.

==== Willingness to join a research study ====
Most of the coordinators and researchers showed some hesitation when they were asked if they would enroll as a subject in a clinical trial, not necessarily their own, but any study. When asked to elaborate on their hesitation, many said that they would be &quot;concerned about the motivations behind the study, its purpose, its funding, as well as expectations of what participation might entail.&quot; Ultimately, only 24% of the respondents said they would be willing to participate with a majority of them stating they would need full transparency and an indication that there would be some personal benefit in order for them to even consider participating. Some had a list of criteria that had to be met. Eleven percent indicated that they would not at all be willing to enroll in a research study. One respondent commented &quot;If it involved taking a medication, no. Never. I would be in a clinical trial if there was something, like...track [your] mammogram…[something] I am already subjecting myself to.&quot; Cook and Hoas stated that these answers were &quot;particularly puzzling&quot; because &quot;these respondents still reported that their patient/participants received &#x27;optimal care from clinical trials.

==Clinical trials==

Clinical trials are experiments done in clinical research. Such prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants are designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements, and medical devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate data on safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial - their approval does not mean that the therapy is &#x27;safe&#x27; or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.

Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results.

Trials can be quite costly, depending on a number of factors. The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory. For example, a clinical drug trial case at the University of Minnesota that was under investigation in 2015 for the Death of Dan Markingson was funded by AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in the United Kingdom.

==Human subjects in psychology and sociology==

===Stanford prison experiment===

A study conducted by Philip Zimbardo in 1971 examined the effect of social roles on college students at Stanford University. Twenty-four male students were assigned to a random role of a prisoner or guard to simulate a mock prison in one of Stanford&#x27;s basements. After only six days, the abusive behavior of the guards and the psychological suffering of prisoners proved significant enough to halt the two-week-long experiment. The goal of the experiment was to determine whether dispositional factors (the behavior of guards and prisoners) or positional factors (the social environment of prisons) are the major cause of conflict within such facilities. The results of this experiment showed that people will readily conform to the specific social roles they are supposed to play. The prison environment played a part in making the guards behavior more brutal, due to the fact that none of the participants showed this type of behavior beforehand. Most of the guards had a hard time believing they had been acting in such a way. The evidence concludes this to be positional behavior, meaning the behavior was due to the hostile environment of the prison.

===Milgram experiment===

In 1961, Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram led a series of experiments to determine to what extent an individual would obey instructions given by an experimenter. Placed in a room with the experimenter, subjects played the role of a &quot;teacher&quot; to a &quot;learner&quot; situated in a separate room. The subjects were instructed to administer an electric shock to the learner when the learner answered incorrectly to a set of questions. The intensity of this electric shock was to be increased for every incorrect answer. The learner was a confederate (i.e. actor), and the shocks were faked, but the subjects were led to believe otherwise. Both prerecorded sounds of electric shocks and the confederate&#x27;s pleas for the punishment to stop were audible to the &quot;teacher&quot; throughout the experiment. When the subject raised questions or paused, the experimenter insisted that the experiment should continue. Despite widespread speculation that most participants would not continue to &quot;shock&quot; the learner, 65 percent of participants in Milgram&#x27;s initial trial complied until the end of the experiment, continuing to administer shocks to the confederate with purported intensities of up to &quot;450 volts&quot;. Although many participants questioned the experimenter and displayed various signs of discomfort, when the experiment was repeated, 65 percent of subjects were willing to obey instructions to administer the shocks through the final one.

===Asch conformity experiments===

Psychologist Solomon Asch&#x27;s classic conformity experiment in 1951 involved one subject participant and multiple confederates; they were asked to provide answers to a variety of different low-difficulty questions. In every scenario, the multiple confederates gave their answers in turn, and the participant subject was allowed to answer last. In a control group of participants, the percentage of error was less than one percent. However, when the confederates unanimously chose an incorrect answer, 75 percent of the subject participants agreed with the majority at least once. The study has been regarded as significant evidence for the power of social influence and conformity.

===Robber&#x27;s Cave study===
A classic advocate of realistic conflict theory, Muzafer Sherif&#x27;s Robber&#x27;s Cave experiment shed light on how group competition can foster hostility and prejudice. In the 1961 study, two groups of ten boys each who were not &quot;naturally&quot; hostile were grouped together without knowledge of one another in Robber&#x27;s Cave State Park, Oklahoma. The twelve-year-old boys bonded with their own groups for a week before the groups were set in competition with each other in games such as tug-of-war and football. When competing, the groups resorted to name-calling and other displays of resentment, such as burning the other group&#x27;s team flag. The hostility continued and worsened until the end of the three-week study, when the groups were forced to work together to solve problems.

===Bystander effect===

The bystander effect is demonstrated in a series of famous experiments by Bibb Latane and John Darley. In each of these experiments, participants were confronted with a type of emergency, such as the witnessing of a seizure or smoke entering through air vents. A common phenomenon was observed that as the number of witnesses or &quot;bystanders&quot; increases, so does the time it takes for individuals to respond to the emergency. This effect has been shown to promote the diffusion of responsibility by concluding that, when surrounded by others, the individual expects someone else to take action.

===Cognitive dissonance===

Human subjects have been commonly used in experiments testing the theory of cognitive dissonance after the landmark study by Leon Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith. In 1959, Festinger and Carlsmith devised a situation in which participants would undergo excessively tedious and monotonous tasks. After the completion of these tasks, the subjects were instructed to help the experiment continue in exchange for a variable amount of money. All the subjects had to do was simply inform the next &quot;student&quot; waiting outside the testing area (who was secretly a confederate) that the tasks involved in the experiment were interesting and enjoyable. It was expected that the participants would not fully agree with the information they were imparting to the student, and after complying, half of the participants were awarded $1 (roughly the same as $ now), and the others were awarded $20 (like $ now). A subsequent survey showed that, by a large margin, those who received less money for essentially &quot;lying&quot; to the student came to believe that the tasks were far more enjoyable than their highly paid counterparts.

=== Vehicle safety ===

In the automotive industry, research has shown that civilian volunteers decided to participate in vehicle safety research to help automobile designers improve upon safety restraints for vehicles. This research allows designers to gather more data on the tolerance of the human body in the event of an automobile accident, in order to better improve safety features in automobiles. Some of the tests conducted ranged from sled runs evaluating head–neck injuries, airbag tests, and tests involving military vehicles and their restraint systems. From thousands of tests involving human subjects, results indicate no serious injuries were persistent. This is largely due to the preparation efforts of researchers to ensure all ethical guidelines are followed and to ensure the safety and well-being of their subjects. Although this research provides positive contributions, there are some drawbacks and resistance to human subject research for crash testing due to the liability of injury and the lack of facilities that have appropriate machinery to perform such experiments. Research with live persons provides additional data which might be unobtainable when testing with cadavers or crash test dummies.

=== Social media ===
The increased use of social media as a data source for researchers has led to new uncertainties regarding the definition of human subject research. Privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent are key concerns, yet it is unclear when social media users qualify as human subjects. Moreno &quot;et al.&quot; conclude that if access to the social media content is public, information is identifiable but not private, and information gathering requires no interaction with the person who posted it online, then the research is unlikely to qualify as human subjects research. Defining features of human subject research, according to federal regulations, are that the researchers interact directly with the subject or obtain identifiable private information about the subject. Social media research may or may not meet this definition. A research institution&#x27;s institutional review board (IRB) is often responsible for reviewing potential research on human subjects, but IRB protocols regarding social media research may be vague or outdated.

Concerns regarding privacy and informed consent have surfaced regarding multiple social media studies. A research project by Harvard sociologists, known as &quot;Tastes, Ties, and Time&quot;, utilized data from Facebook profiles of students at an &quot;anonymous, northeastern American university&quot; that was quickly identified as Harvard, potentially placing the privacy of the human subjects at risk. The data set was removed from public access shortly after the issue was identified. The issue was complicated by the fact that the research project was partially funded by the National Science Foundation, which mandates the projects it funds to engage in data sharing.

A study by Facebook and researchers at Cornell University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2014, collected data from hundreds of thousands of Facebook users after temporarily removing certain types of emotional content from their News Feed. Many considered this a violation of the requirement for informed consent in human subjects research. Because the data was collected by Facebook, a private company, in a manner that was consistent with its Data Use Policy and user terms and agreements, the Cornell IRB board determined that the study did not fall under its jurisdiction. It has been argued that this study broke the law nonetheless by violating state laws regarding informed consent. Others have noted that speaking out against these research methods may be counterproductive, as private companies will likely continue to experiment on users, but will be dis-incentivized from sharing their methods or findings with scientists or the public. In an &quot;Editorial Expression of Concern&quot; that was added to the online version of the research paper, PNAS states that while they &quot;deemed it appropriate to publish the paper... It is nevertheless a matter of concern that the collection of the data by Facebook may have involved practices that were not fully consistent with the principles of obtaining informed consent and allowing participants to opt out.&quot;

Moreno &quot;et al.&quot;&#x27;s recommended considerations for social media research are: 1) determine if the study qualifies as human subject research, 2) consider the risk level of the content, 3) present research and motives accurately when engaging on social media, 4) provide contact information throughout the consent process, 5) make sure data is not identifiable or searchable (avoid direct quotes that may be identifiable with an online search), 6) consider developing project privacy policies in advance, and 7) be aware that each state has its own laws regarding informed consent. Social media sites offer great potential as a data source by providing access to hard-to-reach research subjects and groups, capturing the natural, &quot;real-world&quot; responses of subjects, and providing affordable and efficient data collection methods.

==Unethical human experimentation==

Unethical human experimentation violates the principles of medical ethics. It has been performed by countries including Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, North Korea, the United States and the Soviet Union. Examples include Project MKUltra, Unit 731, Totskoye nuclear exercise, the experiments of Josef Mengele, and the human experimentation conducted by Chester M. Southam.

Nazi Germany performed human experimentation on large numbers of prisoners (including children), largely Jews from across Europe, but also Romani, Sinti, ethnic Poles, Soviet POWs and disabled Germans in its concentration camps mainly in the early 1940s, during World War II and the Holocaust. Prisoners were forced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures. Typically, the experiments resulted in death, trauma, disfigurement or permanent disability, and as such are considered as examples of medical torture. After the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors&#x27; Trial, and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code. During the Nuremberg Trials, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were prosecuted for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences. Of those 23, 15 were convicted, 7 were condemned to death, 9 received prison sentences from 10 years to life, and 7 were acquitted.

Unit 731, a department of the Imperial Japanese Army located near Harbin (then in the puppet state of Manchukuo, in northeast China), experimented on prisoners by conducting vivisections, dismemberments, and bacterial inoculations. It induced epidemics on a very large scale from 1932 onward through the Second Sino-Japanese war. It also conducted biological and chemical weapons tests on prisoners and captured POWs. With the expansion of the empire during World War II, similar units were set up in conquered cities such as Nanking (Unit 1644), Beijing (Unit 1855), Guangzhou (Unit 8604) and Singapore (Unit 9420). After the war, Supreme Commander of the Occupation Douglas MacArthur gave immunity in the name of the United States to Shirō Ishii and all members of the units in exchange for all of the results of their experiments.

During World War II, Fort Detrick in Maryland was the headquarters of US biological warfare experiments. Operation Whitecoat involved the injection of infectious agents into military forces to observe their effects in human subjects. Subsequent human experiments in the United States have also been characterized as unethical. They were often performed illegally, without the knowledge, consent, or informed consent of the test subjects. Public outcry over the discovery of government experiments on human subjects led to numerous congressional investigations and hearings, including the Church Committee, Rockefeller Commission, and Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, amongst others. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment, widely regarded as the &quot;most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history,&quot; was performed from 1932 to 1972 by the Tuskegee Institute contracted by the United States Public Health Service. The study followed more than 600 African-American men who were not told they had syphilis and were denied access to the known treatment of penicillin. This led to the 1974 National Research Act, to provide for protection of human subjects in experiments. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established and was tasked with establishing the boundary between research and routine practice, the role of risk-benefit analysis, guidelines for participation, and the definition of informed consent. Its &quot;Belmont Report&quot; established three tenets of ethical research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

From the 1950s-60s, Chester M. Southam, an important virologist and cancer researcher, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, healthy individuals, and prison inmates from the Ohio Penitentiary. He wanted to observe if cancer could be transmitted as well as if people could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune response. Many believe that this experiment violated the bioethical principles of informed consent, non-maleficence, and beneficence.

In the 1970s, the Indian government implemented a large-scale forced sterilization program, primarily targeting poor and marginalized populations. Millions of people, especially women, underwent sterilization surgeries without their informed consent, often under pressure from local authorities or in exchange for government services. 

Some pharmaceutical companies have been accused of conducting clinical trials of experimental drugs in Africa without the informed consent of participants or without providing adequate access to healthcare. These practices raise questions about the exploitation of vulnerable populations and the prioritization of commercial interests over the rights of participants.

Psychological experiments have also faced ethical criticism due to their manipulation of participants, inducing stress, anxiety, or other forms of emotional distress without informed consent. These experiments raise concerns regarding the respect for the dignity and well-being of the individuals involved.

<doc id="447844" wikidata="Q1137319" url="?curid=447844" title="Market maker">
<text>A market maker or liquidity provider is a company or an individual that quotes both a buy and a sell price in a tradable asset held in inventory, hoping to make a profit on the difference, which is called the &quot;bid–ask spread&quot; or &quot;turn.&quot; This stabilizes the market, reducing price variation (volatility) by setting a trading price range for the asset.

In U.S. markets, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission defines a &quot;market maker&quot; as a firm that stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price. A Designated Primary Market Maker (DPM) is a specialized market maker approved by an exchange to guarantee a buy or sell position in a particular assigned security, option, or option index.

==In currency exchange==
Most foreign exchange trading firms are market makers, as are many banks. The foreign exchange market maker both buys foreign currency from clients and sells it to other clients. They derive income from the trading price differentials, helping the market by providing liquidity, reducing transaction costs, and facilitating trade.

==In stock exchange==
Market makers that stand ready to buy and sell stocks listed on an exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the London Stock Exchange (LSE), are called &quot;third market makers&quot;. Most stock exchanges operate on a &quot;matched bargain&quot; or &quot;order driven&quot; basis. When a buyer&#x27;s bid price meets a seller&#x27;s offer price or vice versa, the stock exchange&#x27;s matching system decides that a deal has been executed. In such a system, there may be no designated or official market makers, but market makers nevertheless exist.

 there were over two thousand market makers in the United States, and over one hundred in Canada.

===New York===
In the United States, the NYSE and American Stock Exchange (AMEX), among others, have designated market makers, formerly known as &quot;specialists&quot;, who act as the official market maker for a given security. The market makers provide a required amount of liquidity to the security&#x27;s market, and take the other side of trades when there are short-term buy-and-sell-side imbalances in customer orders. In return, the specialist is granted various informational and trade execution advantages.

Other U.S. exchanges, most prominently the NASDAQ stock exchange, employ several competing official market makers in a security. These market makers are required to maintain two-sided markets during exchange hours and are obligated to buy and sell at their displayed bids and offers. They typically do not receive the trading advantages a specialist does, but they do get some, such as the ability to naked short a stock, i.e., selling it without borrowing it. In most situations, only official market makers are permitted to engage in naked shorting. Changes to the rules in the 2000s and 2010s have explicitly banned naked shorting by options market makers.

In liquid markets like the NYSE, nearly every asset has open interest, providing two benefits: price takers can buy or sell at any time, and observers can continually monitor a precise price of every asset.

A prediction market, or market explicitly designed to uncover the value of an asset, relies heavily on continual price discovery holding true. Prediction markets benefit from automated market makers, or algorithmic traders that maintain constant open interest, providing needed liquidity to the markets that would be difficult to provide naturally.

Examples of New York market makers are Optiver, Jane Street Capital, Flow Traders, IMC, and Virtu Financial, according to Article 17(13) of Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 14 March 2012.

===London===
On the LSE, there are official market makers for many securities. Some of the LSE&#x27;s member firms take on the obligation of always making a two-way price in each of the stocks in which they make markets. Their prices are the ones displayed on the Stock Exchange Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system and it is they who generally deal with brokers buying or selling stock on behalf of clients.

Proponents of the official market making system claim market makers add to the liquidity and depth of the market by taking a short or long position for a time, thus assuming some risk in return for the chance of a small profit. On the LSE, one can always buy and sell stock: each stock always has at least two market makers and they are obliged to deal.

In contrast, on smaller, order-driven markets such as the JSE Securities Exchange it can be difficult to determine the buying and selling prices of even a small block of stocks that lack a clear and immediate market value because there are often no buyers or sellers on the order board.

Unofficial market makers are free to operate on order driven markets or, indeed, on the LSE. They do not have the obligation to always be making a two-way price, but they do not have the advantage that everyone must deal with them either.

Examples of UK Market makers since Big Bang Day are Peel Hunt LLP, Winterflood Securities, Liberum Capital, Shore Capital, Fairfax IS and Altium Securities.

Prior to the Big Bang, jobbers had exclusive rights of market making on the LSE.

===Frankfurt===
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FWB) runs a system of market makers appointed by the listed companies. These are called &quot;designated sponsors&quot;. Designated Sponsors secure higher liquidity by quoting binding prices for buying and selling the shares. The largest market maker by number of mandates in Germany is ODDO BHF Corporates &amp; Markets AG.

===Tokyo===
Since 2018, the Tokyo Stock Exchange has had an ETF Market Making Incentive Scheme in place, which provides incentives to designated market makers who maintain quoting obligations in qualified ETFs. This list of market makers includes Nomura Securities, Flow Traders, and Optiver.

==Decentralized network protocols==
Liquidity provision in a decentralized network protocol, such as the trading or transacting of a cryptocurrency on an exchange, works rather differently. Decentralized markets by definition do not have official market makers, and there are no regulations enforced by centralized entities involved at the protocol level. Companies or individuals may become market makers by simply using or trading the protocol at high volumes and by providing liquidity to the protocol, typically in return for the prospect of making an ROI on the assets committed to the liquidity pools. Decentralized exchanges offer trading discounts for high-volume traders in order to encourage companies and individuals to provide liquidity as unofficial market makers.

=== Lack of Regulation and Oversight ===
Decentralized markets fall outside of the regulatory reach of traditional courts with jurisdiction in defined geographic boundaries. Therefore governments may have difficulty auditing, regulating or shutting down such protocols since the protocols have no central or headquarters jurisdiction in which they operate. The network operates on the principles, and according to the code, that is running on the network.

==Income of market makers==
The income of a market maker is the difference between the bid price, the price at which the firm is willing to buy a stock, and the ask price, the price at which the firm is willing to sell it. It is known as the market-maker spread, or bid–ask spread. Supposing that equal numbers of buy and sell orders arrive and the price never changes, this is the amount that the market maker will gain on each round trip.

Market makers usually also provide liquidity to the firm&#x27;s clients, for which they earn a commission.

<text>Marlène Jobert (born 4 November 1940) is a French actress and author.

==Life and career==
Jobert was born in Algiers, French Algeria, to a Jewish mother, Eliane Azulay and Charles Jobert, who served in the French Air Force. She came to Metropolitan France aged eight.

Jobert debuted as an actress on stage and television. In 1968, she achieved stardom by playing starring roles in the successful comedies &quot;Faut pas prendre les enfants du bon Dieu pour des canards sauvages&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Astragale&quot;. She co-starred with Charles Bronson in &quot;Rider on the Rain&quot; and with Jean-Paul Belmondo in &quot;The Married Couple of the Year Two&quot;. During the 1970s, Jobert was one of France&#x27;s popular movie actresses. But during the next decade, she gradually withdrew from film work and concentrated on a new career in children&#x27;s literature. She is the author and/or narrator of (mainly children&#x27;s) audio books. She also has written a series of books which cautiously lead on to the appreciation of classical music, e.g. of Mozart, Chopin, and Tchaikovsky.

Jobert and spouse Swedish dental surgeon Dr Walter Green have twin daughters: Eva Green, who is also an actress, and Joy Green, who is a horse breeder in Italy. Her niece Joséphine Jobert is an actress known for the television show &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.
