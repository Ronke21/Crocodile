<doc id="458350" wikidata="Q108212" url="?curid=458350" title="Azurite">
<text>Azurite or &quot;Azure spar&quot; is a soft, deep-blue copper mineral produced by weathering of copper ore deposits. During the early 19th century, it was also known as chessylite, after the type locality at Chessy-les-Mines near Lyon, France. The mineral, a basic carbonate with the chemical formula Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, has been known since ancient times, and was mentioned in Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; under the Greek name (κυανός: &quot;deep blue,&quot; root of English cyan) and the Latin name &quot;caeruleum&quot;. Copper (Cu2+) gives it its blue color.

==Mineralogy==

Azurite has the formula Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, with the copper(II) cations linked to two different anions, carbonate and hydroxide. It is one of two relatively common basic copper(II) carbonate minerals, the other being bright green malachite. Aurichalcite is a rare basic carbonate of copper and zinc. Simple copper carbonate (CuCO3) is not known to exist in nature, due to the high affinity of the ion for the hydroxide anion .

Azurite crystallizes in the monoclinic system. Large crystals are dark blue, often prismatic. Azurite specimens can be massive to nodular or can occur as drusy crystals lining a cavity. 

Azurite has a Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4. The specific gravity of azurite is 3.7 to 3.9. Characteristic of a carbonate, specimens effervesce upon treatment with hydrochloric acid. The combination of deep blue color and effervescence when moistened with hydrochloric acid are identifying characteristics of the mineral.

===Color===
The optical properties (color, intensity) of minerals such as azurite and malachite are characteristic of copper(II). Many coordination complexes of copper(II) exhibit similar colors. According to crystal field theory, the color results from low energy d-d transitions associated with the d9 metal center.

===Weathering===
Azurite is unstable in open air compared to malachite, and often is pseudomorphically replaced by malachite. This weathering process involves the replacement of some of the carbon dioxide (CO2) units with water (H2O), changing the carbonate:hydroxide ratio of azurite from 1:1 to the 1:2 ratio of malachite:

: 2 Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2 + H2O → 3 Cu2(CO3)(OH)2 + CO2

From the above equation, the conversion of azurite into malachite is attributable to the low partial pressure of carbon dioxide in air.

Azurite is quite stable under ordinary storage conditions, so that specimens retain their deep blue color for long periods of time.

===Occurrences===

Azurite is found in the same geologic settings as its sister mineral, malachite, though it is usually less abundant. Both minerals occur widely as supergene copper minerals, formed in the oxidized zone of copper ore deposits. Here they are associated with cuprite, native copper, and various iron oxide minerals.

Fine specimens can be found at many locations. Among the best specimens are found at Bisbee, Arizona, and nearby locations, and have included clusters of crystals several inches long and spherical aggregates and rosettes up to in diameter. Similar rosettes are found at Chessy, Rhône, France. The best crystals, up to in length, are found at Tsumeb, Namibia. Other notable occurrences are in Utah; Mexico; the Ural and Altai Mountains; Sardinia; Laurion, Greece; Wallaroo, South Australia; Brazil and Broken Hill.

Azurite is unstable in air, however it was used as a blue pigment in antiquity. Azurite is naturally occurring in Sinai and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. It was reported by F. C. J. Spurrell (1895) in the following examples; a shell used as a pallet in a Fourth Dynasty (2613 to 2494 BCE) context in Meidum, a cloth over the face of a Fifth Dynasty (2494 to 2345 BCE) mummy also at Meidum and a number of Eighteenth Dynasty (1543–1292 BCE) wall paintings. Depending on the degree of fineness to which it was ground, and its basic content of copper carbonate, it gave a wide range of blues. It has been known as &quot;mountain blue&quot;, &quot;Armenian stone&quot;, and &quot;azurro della Magna&quot; (&quot;blue from Germany&quot; in Italian). When mixed with oil it turns slightly green. When mixed with egg yolk it turns green-grey. It is also known by the names &quot;blue bice&quot; and &quot;blue verditer&quot;, though &quot;verditer&quot; usually refers to a pigment made by chemical process. Older examples of azurite pigment may show a more greenish tint due to weathering into malachite. Much azurite was mislabeled &quot;lapis lazuli&quot;, a term applied to many blue pigments. As chemical analysis of paintings from the Middle Ages improves, azurite is being recognized as a major source of the blues used by medieval painters. Lapis lazuli (the pigment ultramarine) was chiefly supplied from Afghanistan during the Middle Ages, whereas azurite was a common mineral in Europe at the time. Sizable deposits were found near Lyons, France. It was mined since the 12th century in Saxony, in the silver mines located there.

Heating can be used to distinguish azurite from purified natural ultramarine blue, a more expensive but more stable blue pigment, as described by Cennino D&#x27;Andrea Cennini. Ultramarine withstands heat, whereas azurite converts to black copper oxide. However, gentle heating of azurite produces a deep blue pigment used in Japanese painting techniques.

Azurite pigment can be synthesized by precipitating copper(II) hydroxide from a solution of copper(II) chloride with lime (calcium hydroxide) and treating the precipitate with a concentrated solution of potassium carbonate and lime. This pigment is likely to contain traces of basic copper(II) chlorides.

===Jewelry===
Azurite is used occasionally as beads and as jewelry, and also as an ornamental stone. However, its softness and tendency to lose its deep blue color as it weathers leaves it with fewer uses. Heating destroys azurite easily, so all mounting of azurite specimens must be done at room temperature.

===Collecting===
The intense color of azurite makes it a popular collector&#x27;s stone. The notion that specimens must be carefully protected from bright light, heat, and open air to retain their intensity of color over time may be an urban legend. Paul E. Desautels, former curator of gems and minerals at the Smithsonian Institution, has written that azurite is stable under ordinary storage conditions.

===Prospecting===
While not a major ore of copper itself, the presence of azurite is a good surface indicator of the presence of weathered copper sulfide ores. It is usually found in association with the chemically similar malachite, producing a striking color combination of deep blue and bright green that is strongly indicative of the presence of copper ores.

==History==
Azurite was known in the pre-classical ancient world. It was used in ancient Egypt as a pigment, obtained from mines in Sinai. Ancient Mesopotamian writers report the use of a special mortar and pestle for grinding it. It was also used in ancient Greece, for example on the Acropolis in Athens. It does not appear to have been used in ancient Roman wall paintings but Roman writers certainly knew about its use as a pigment. The fusing of glass and azurite was developed in ancient Mesopotamia.

<text>The South Street Seaport is a historic area in the New York City borough of Manhattan, centered where Fulton Street meets the East River, within the Financial District of Lower Manhattan. The Seaport is a designated historic district. It is part of Manhattan Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan, and is next to the East River to the southeast and the Two Bridges neighborhood to the northeast.

The district features some of the oldest buildings in Lower Manhattan, and includes the largest concentration of restored early 19th-century commercial buildings in the city. This includes renovated original mercantile buildings, renovated sailing ships, the former Fulton Fish Market, and modern tourist malls featuring food, shopping, and nightlife.

==History==

===As port===
The first pier in the area appeared in 1625, when the Dutch West India Company founded an outpost there. With the influx of the first settlers, the area was quickly developed. One of the first and busiest streets in the area was today&#x27;s Pearl Street, so named for a variety of coastal pearl shells. Due to its location, Pearl Street quickly gained popularity among traders. The East River was eventually narrowed. By the second half of the 17th century, the pier was extended to Water Street, then to Front Street, and by the beginning of the 19th century, to South Street. The pier was well reputed, as it was protected from the westerly winds and ice of the Hudson River.

In 1728, the Schermerhorn Family established trade with the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Subsequently, rice and indigo came from Charleston. At the time, the port was also the focal point of delivery of goods from England. In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the British occupied the port, adversely affecting port trade for eight years. In 1783, many traders returned to England, and most port enterprises collapsed. The port quickly recovered from the post-war crisis. From 1797 until the middle of 19th century, New York had the country&#x27;s largest system of maritime trade. From 1815 to 1860 the port was called the Port of New York.

On February 22, 1784, the &quot;Empress of China&quot; sailed from the port to Guangzhou and returned to Philadelphia on May 15, 1785, bringing along, in its cargo, green and black teas, porcelain, and other goods. This operation marked the beginning of trade relations between the newly formed United States and the Qing Empire.

On January 5, 1818, the 424-ton transatlantic packet &quot;James Monroe&quot; sailed from Liverpool, opening the first regular trans-Atlantic voyage route, the Black Ball Line. Shipping on this route continued until 1878. Commercially successful transatlantic traffic has led to the creation of many competing companies, including the Red Star Line in 1822. Transportation significantly contributed to the establishment New York as one of the centers of world trade.


One of the largest companies in the South Street Seaport area was the Fulton Fish Market, opened in 1822. The Tin Building opened within the market in 1907; it is one of two remaining structures from the market and the only one that is officially designated as a landmark. In 2005, the market moved to Hunts Point, Bronx.

In November 1825, the Erie Canal, located upstate, was opened. The canal, connecting New York to the western United States, facilitated the economic development of the city. However, for this reason, along with the beginning of the shipping era, there was a need to lengthen the piers and deepen the port.

On the night of December 17, 1835, a large fire in New York City destroyed 17 blocks, and many buildings in the South Street Seaport burned to the ground. Nevertheless, by the 1840s, the port recovered, and by 1850, it reached its heyday:

At its peak, the port hosted many commercial enterprises, institutions, ship-chandlers, workshops, boarding houses, saloons, and brothels. However, by the 1880s, the port began to be depleted of resources, space for the development of these businesses was diminishing, and the port became too shallow for newer ships. By the 1930s, most of the piers no longer functioned, and cargo ships docked mainly on ports on the West Side and in Hoboken. By the late 1950s, the old Ward Line docks, comprising Piers 15, 16, and part of 17, were mostly vacant.

===As museum===

The South Street Seaport Museum was founded in 1967 by Peter and Norma Stanford. When originally opened as a museum, the focus of the Seaport Museum conservation was to be an educational historic site, with shops mostly operating as reproductions of working environments found during the Seaport&#x27;s heyday.

In 1982, redevelopment began to turn the museum into a greater tourist attraction via development of modern shopping areas. According to Kenneth Schuman, New York City Commissioner for Economic Development, “It would allow New Yorkers to rediscover the long-obliterated, but historic, link between the city and its waterfront.” The project was undertaken by the prominent developer James Rouse, and was modeled on the concept of a &quot;festival marketplace,&quot; a leading revitalization strategy throughout the 1970s. On the other side of Fulton Street from Schermerhorn Row, the main Fulton Fish Market building, which had become a large plain garage-type structure, was rebuilt as an upscale shopping mall. Pier 17&#x27;s and Pier 18&#x27;s old platforms were demolished and a new glass shopping pavilion raised in its combined place, which opened in August 1984.

In 1982, the Museum acquired a collection of 285 Van Ryper ship models and archival materials from Charles King Van Riper&#x27;s son, Anthony K. Van Riper. The collection comprised models crafted between approximately 1938 and 1950, known as &quot;pattern models.&quot; The archival materials encompassed research content about steamships, photographs, deck plans, postcards, and advertising brochures from steamship companies.

The original intent of the Seaport development was the preservation of the block of buildings known as Schermerhorn Row on the southwest side of Fulton Street, which were threatened with neglect or future development, at a time when the history of New York City&#x27;s sailing ship industry was not valued, except by some antiquarians. Early historic preservation efforts focused on these buildings and the acquisition of several sailing ships. Almost all buildings and the entire Seaport neighborhood are meant to transport the visitor back in time to New York&#x27;s mid-19th century, to demonstrate what life in the commercial maritime trade was like. Docked at the Seaport are a few historical sailing vessels, including the &quot;Wavertree&quot;. A section of nearby Fulton Street is preserved as cobblestone and lined with shops, bars, and restaurants. The Bridge Cafe, which claims to be &quot;The Oldest Drinking Establishment in New York&quot; is in a building that formerly housed a brothel.

In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy heavily damaged the Seaport. Tidal floods of up to deep inundated much of the Seaport, causing extensive damage that forced an end to plans to merge the Seaport Museum with the Museum of the City of New York. Many of the businesses closed, and the remaining businesses suffered from a severe drop in business after the storm. The South Street Seaport Museum re-opened in December 2012. The Howard Hughes Corporation, announced that it would tear down the Seaport&#x27;s most prominent shopping area, Pier 17, as part of a broader redevelopment of the neighborhood. The new pier contains restaurants on its ground floor, and the Rooftop at Pier 17, an outdoor concert venue five-stories above the East River. It reopened in July 2018. Subsequently, the Tin Building was raised and relocated east in a project that started in 2018, with an expected completion date of 2021.

==Constituent parts==

===Ownership and management===
Pier 17, the Fulton Market Building, the Tin Building, and many other commercial spaces at the seaport are currently owned and managed by Seaport Entertainment Group. Formerly, they were owned by General Growth Properties, which acquired Pier 17&#x27;s longtime owner, The Rouse Company, in 2004. The Seaport was included in the 2010 spinoff of the Howard Hughes Corporation from General Growth, and then in the 2024 spinoff of Seaport Entertainment from Howard Hughes. In January 2025, over 100 workers were terminated after a surprise check of identity and employment authorization just before the new year.

=== Peck Slip ===

Peck Slip, which occupies the area between present-day Water and South streets, served as an active docking place for boats until 1810, and even served as a temporary hideout for George Washington and his troops in April 1776 when they fled from the Battle of Long Island. Then, in 1838, the first steam-powered vessel to make a transatlantic voyage, the &quot;S.S.  Great Western&quot;, docked in Peck’s Slip to the cheers of a quickly growing crowd of onlookers. Today, the median of the street serves as an open space for the community with Brooklyn Bridge views, often displaying public art installations and gatherings, such as fairs and concerts. Peck Slip is also home to the neighborhood&#x27;s K-5 elementary school The Peck Slip School, P.S. 343. In 2018, plans were revealed for the redevelopment of the parking lot at 250 Water Street, across from the school.

===Museum===
Designated by Congress in 1998 as one of several museums which together make up &quot;America&#x27;s National Maritime Museum&quot;, South Street Seaport Museum sits in a 12 square-block historic district that is the site of the original port of New York City. The Museum has over of exhibition space and educational facilities. It houses exhibition galleries, a working 19th-century print shop, an archeology museum, a maritime library, a craft center, a marine life conservation lab, and the largest privately owned fleet of historic ships in the country.

===Ships in the port===
The museum has five vessels docked permanently or semi-permanently, four of which have formal historical status.
Legend:
* – Designated National Historic Landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places
* – On the National Register of Historic Places

The &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;W. O. Decker&quot; operate during favorable weather.

===Entertainment===
Pier 17 was reconstructed in the 2010s and reopened in June 2018. Decks outside on pier 15 allow views of the East River, Brooklyn Bridge, and Brooklyn Heights. The Paris Cafe, within the South Street Seaport historic area, is claimed to be one of the oldest bars in New York City.

Pier 17 consists of different restaurants on its ground floor, and The Rooftop at Pier 17 on the top floor, a 3,500-capacity open-air concert venue that hosts summer concerts between May and October.
At the entrance to the Seaport is the &quot;Titanic&quot; Memorial lighthouse.

===ESPN studios===
Sports broadcaster ESPN opened a radio and television studio at Pier 17 in April 2018, covering .

==Transportation==

South Street Seaport is served by the New York City Bus routes.

New York Water Taxi directly serves South Street Seaport on Fridays, weekends, and holidays during the summer, while other New York Water Taxi, NYC Ferry, and SeaStreak ferries serve the nearby ferry slip at Pier 11/Wall Street daily.

The Fulton Street/Fulton Center station complex () is the closest New York City Subway station. A new subway station, provisionally called Seaport, has been proposed as part of the unfunded Phase 4 of the Second Avenue Subway. Although this station will be located only 3 blocks from the Fulton Street station, there are no plans for a free transfer between them.

<text>Earl Russell, of Kingston Russell in the County of Dorset, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 30 July 1861 for the prominent Liberal politician Lord John Russell. He was Home Secretary from 1835 to 1839, Foreign Secretary from 1852 to 1853 and 1859 to 1865 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1846 to 1852 and 1865 to 1866. At the same time as he was given the earldom of Russell, he was made Viscount Amberley, of Amberley in the County of Gloucester and of Ardsalla in the County of Meath. A member of the prominent Russell family, he was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford.
The first Earl was succeeded by his grandson the second Earl, the eldest son of John Russell, Viscount Amberley. He was one of the first peers to join the Labour Party and he held office under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as Under-Secretary of State for India from 1929 to 1931. He was childless and was succeeded in 1931 by his younger brother, the third Earl, the famous philosopher and Nobel Prize winner universally known as Bertrand Russell. When he died in 1970 his eldest son, the fourth Earl held the title until his half-brother, the fifth Earl inherited it in 1987. He was a noted historian of 17th century England. Russell also sat on the Liberal Democrat benches in the House of Lords and was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the titles are held by his youngest son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his brother in 2014.

<text>Richard Christopher Carrington (26 May 1826 – 27 November 1875) was an English amateur astronomer whose 1859 astronomical observations demonstrated the existence of solar flares as well as suggesting their electrical influence upon the Earth and its aurorae; and whose 1863 records of sunspot observations revealed the differential rotation of the Sun.

==Life ==
Carrington was born at Chelsea, the second son of Richard Carrington, the proprietor of a large brewery at Brentford, and his wife Esther Clarke Aplin. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1844; but, though destined for the church, rather by his father&#x27;s than by his own desire, his scientific tendencies gradually prevailed, and received a final impulse towards practical astronomy from Professor Challis&#x27;s lectures on the subject. This change in the purpose of his life was unopposed, and he had the prospect of ample means; so that it was purely with the object of gaining experience that he applied, shortly after taking his degree as thirty-sixth wrangler in 1848, for the post of observer in the University of Durham. He entered upon his duties there in October 1849, but soon became dissatisfied with their narrow scope. The observatory was ill supplied with instruments, and the leisure left him for study served only to widen his aims. Friedrich Bessel&#x27;s and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander&#x27;s star-zones, above all, struck him as a model for imitation, and he resolved to complete by extending them to the pole. Desirous of advancing so far beyond his predecessors as to include in his survey stars of the tenth magnitude, he vainly applied for a suitable instrument, and at last, hopeless of accomplishing any part of his design at Durham, or of benefiting by any further stay, he resigned his position there in March 1852. He had not, however, been idle. Some of his observations, especially of minor planets and comets, made with a Fraunhofer equatorial of 6½ inches aperture, had been published, in a provisional state, in the &#x27;Monthly Notices&#x27; and &#x27;Astronomische Nachrichten,&#x27; and the whole were definitively embodied in a volume entitled &#x27;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Observatory of the University, Durham, from October 1849 to April 1852’ (Durham, 1855). His admission as a member of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), 14 March 1851, conveyed a prompt recognition of his exceptional merits as an observer.
In June 1852 he fixed upon a site for an observatory and dwelling-house at Redhill, Surrey. In July 1853 a transit-circle of 5½ feet focus, reduced in scale from the Greenwich model, and an equatorial of 4½ inches aperture, both by Simms, were in their places, and work was begun. On 9 December 1853, Carrington presented to the RAS, as the result of a preliminary survey, printed copies of nine draft maps, containing all stars down to the eleventh magnitude within 9° of the Pole (Monthly Notices, xiv. 40). Three years&#x27; steady pursuance of the adopted plan produced, in 1857, &#x27;A Catalogue of 3,735 Circumpolar Stars observed at Redhill in the years 1854, 1855, and 1856, and reduced to Mean Positions for 1855.&#x27; The work was printed at public expense, the decision to that effect by the Lords of the Admiralty rendering unnecessary the acceptance of Leverrier&#x27;s handsome offer to include it in the next forthcoming volume of the &#x27;Annales&#x27; of the Paris observatory. It was rewarded with the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, in presenting which, 11 February 1859, Mr. Main dwelt upon the eminent utility of the design, as well as the &#x27;standard excellence&#x27; of its execution (ib. xix. 162). It included a laborious comparison of Schwerd&#x27;s places for 680 stars with those obtained at Redhill, and an elaborate dissertation on the whole theory of corrections as applied to stars near the pole. Ten corresponding maps, copper-engraved, accompanied the catalogue.

Meanwhile, Carrington had adopted, and was cultivating with his usual felicity of treatment, a &#x27;second subject&#x27; at that juncture of peculiar interest and importance. While his new observatory was in course of construction, he devoted some of his spare time to examining the drawings and records of sunspots in possession of the RAS, and was much struck with the need and scarcity of systematic solar observations. Sabine&#x27;s and Wolf&#x27;s discovery of the coincidence between the magnetic and sunspot periods had just then been announced, and he believed he should be able to take advantage of the pre-occupation or inability of other observers to appropriate to himself, by &#x27;close and methodical research,&#x27; the next ensuing eleven-year cycle. He accordingly resolved to devote his daylight energies to the Sun, while reserving his nights for the stars. Solar physics as a whole, however, he prudently excluded from his field of view. He limited his task to fixing the true period of the Sun&#x27;s rotation (of which curiously discrepant values had been obtained), to tracing the laws of distribution of maculæ, and investigating the existence of permanent surface-currents. Adequately to compass these ends, new devices of observation, reduction, and comparison were required. Leaving photography to his successors as too undeveloped for immediate use, he chose a method founded on the idea of making the solar disc its own circular micrometer. An image of the Sun was thrown upon a screen placed at such a distance from the eyepiece of the 4½-inch equatorial as to give to the disc a diameter of 12 to 14 inches. In the focus of the telescope, which was firmly clamped, two bars of flattened gold wire were fastened at right angles to each other, and inclined about 45° on either side of the meridian. Then, as the inverted image traversed the screen, the instants of contact with the wires of the Sun&#x27;s limbs and of the spot-nucleus to be measured were severally noted, when an easy calculation gave its heliocentric position (ib. xiv. 153).

In this manner, during seven and a half years, 5,290 observations were made of 954 separate groups, many of which were besides accurately depicted in drawings. By the sudden death of his father, however, in July 1858, and the consequent devolution upon Carrington of the management of the brewery, the complete execution of his project of research was frustrated. He continued for some time to supervise the solar work he had previously carried on in person; but in March 1861, seeing no prospect of release from commercial engagements, he thought it advisable to close the series. The results appeared in a quarto volume, the publication of which was aided by a grant from the Royal Society. Its title ran as follows: &quot;Observations of the Spots on the Sun from November 9, 1853, to March 24, 1861, made at Redhill&quot; (London, 1863). Never were data more opportunely furnished. Perhaps more effectually than the pronouncements of spectrum analysis, they served to revolutionise ideas on solar physics.

Efforts to ascertain the true rate of solar rotation had been continually baffled by what were called the &#x27;proper motions&#x27; of the spots serving as indexes to it. Carrington showed that these were in reality due to a great &#x27;bodily drift&#x27; of the photosphere, diminishing apparently from the equator to the poles (ib. xix. 81). There was, then, no single period ascertainable through observations of the solar surface. By equatorial spots the circuit was found to be performed in about two and a half days less than by spots at the (ordinarily) extreme north and south limits of 45°. The assumed &#x27;mean period&#x27; of 25.38 solar days applied, in fact, only to two zones 14° from the equator; nearer to it the time of rotation was shorter, further from it longer, than the average. Carrington succeeded in representing the daily movement of a spot in any heliographical latitude l, by the empirical expression 865′ ± 165 . sin 7/4 (l – 1°). But he attempted no explanation of the phenomenon. It formed, however, the basis of Faye&#x27;s theory (1865) of the Sun as a gaseous body ploughed through by vertical currents, which finally superseded Herschel&#x27;s idea of a flame-enveloped, but cool, dark, and even habitable globe.

Carrington&#x27;s determinations of the elements of the Sun&#x27;s rotation are still of standard authority. The inclination of the solar equator to the plane of the ecliptic he fixed at 7° 15′; the longitude of the ascending node at 73° 40′ (both for 1850) . A peculiarity in the distribution of sunspots detected by him about the time of the minimum of 1856, afforded, as he said, &#x27;an instructive instance of the regular irregularity and the irregular regularity&#x27; characterising solar phenomena (ib. xix. 1). As the minimum approached, the belts of disturbance gradually contracted towards and died out near the equator; shortly after which two fresh series broke out, as if by a completely new impulse, in comparatively high latitudes, and spread equatorially. No satisfactory rationale of this curious procedure has yet been arrived at. It is, nevertheless, intimately related to the course of sunspot development, since Wolf found evidence of a similar behaviour in Böhm&#x27;s observations of 1833–6, and it was perceived by Spörer and Secchi to recur in 1867.

While still in his apprenticeship at Durham, Carrington repaired to Sweden on the occasion of the total solar eclipse of 28 July 1851, and made at Lilla Edet, on the Göta river, observations printed in the &quot;Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; (xxi. 58). The experience thus gained was turned to public account in the compilation of &quot;Information and Suggestions addressed to Persons who may be able to place themselves within the Shadow of the Total Eclipse of the Sun on September 7, 1858&quot;, a brochure printed and circulated by the lords of the admiralty in May 1858. The eclipse to which it referred was visible in South America. A visit to the continent in 1856 gave him the opportunity of drawing up a valuable report on the condition of a number of German observatories (Monthly Notices, xvii. 43), and of visiting Schwabe at Dessau, to whose merits he drew explicit attention, and to whom, in the following year, he had the pleasure of transmitting the Gold Medal of the RAS. He fulfilled with great diligence the duties of secretary to that body, 1857–62, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1860.

===The great solar storm of 1859===
Carrington, independently with fellow amateur Mr. Hodgson, were documenting sunspots and directly witnessed the extraordinary solar outburst of 1 September 1859. Carrington and Hodgson compiled independent reports which were published side by side in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, and exhibited their drawings of the event at the November 1859 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The geomagnetic solar flare hit the Earth the following days, the main body of which fell over the American continents. In these early days of electrical communication, the telegraph systems was the most affected. Lines all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving telegraph operators electric shocks.
Telegraph pylons threw sparks.
Some telegraph operators could continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies. Based on Carrington&#x27;s observation of the solar storm, this event now bears the name of the Carrington Event, and events of similar magnitude are classified as &quot;Carrington-class&quot; events.

===Late life and demise===
But the lease by which he held his powers of useful work was unhappily running out. A severe attack of illness in 1865 left his health permanently impaired. In 1869, he married Rosa Ellen Jeffries (1845–75), and, having disposed of the brewery, he retired to Churt, Surrey, where, on the top of an isolated conical hill, 60 feet high, locally known as the Middle Devil&#x27;s Jump, in a lonely and picturesque spot, he built a new observatory (ib. xxx. 43). Its chief instrument was a large altazimuth on Steinheil&#x27;s principle, but there are no records of observations made with it. He no longer attended the meetings of the RAS, and his last communication to it, 10 January 1873, was on the subject of a &#x27;double altazimuth&#x27; of great size which he had thoughts of erecting (ib. xxxiii. 118).

A deplorable tragedy, however, supervened. On the morning of 17 November 1875 his wife was found dead in her bed, as it seemed, through an overdose of chloral. The event, combined perhaps with the censure on a supposed deficiency of proper nursing precautions conveyed by the verdict of the coroner&#x27;s jury, tolled heavily on her husband&#x27;s spirits. He left his house on the day of the inquest, and returned to it after a week&#x27;s absence, only to find it deserted by his servants. He was seen to enter it on 27 November, but was never again seen alive. After a time some neighbour gave the alarm, the doors were broken open, and his dead body was found extended on a mattress locked into a remote apartment. A poultice of tea-leaves was tied over the left ear, as if for the relief of pain, and a post-mortem examination showed death to have resulted from an effusion of blood on the brain. A verdict of &#x27;sudden death from natural causes&#x27; was returned.

===Legacy===
Carrington&#x27;s manuscript books of sunspot observations and reductions, with a folio volume of drawings, were purchased after his death by Lord Lindsay (later Earl of Crawford), and presented to the Royal Astronomical Society (ib. xxxvi. 249). To the same body Carrington bequeathed a sum of £2,000. Among his numerous contributions to scientific collections may be mentioned a paper &#x27;On the Distribution of the Perihelia of the Parabolic and Hyperbolic Comets in relation to the Motion of the Solar System in Space,&#x27; read before the Astronomical Society, 14 December 1860 (Mem. R. A. Soc. xxix. 355). The result, like that of Mohn&#x27;s contemporaneous investigation, proved negative, and was thought to be, through uncontrolled conditions, nugatory; yet it perhaps conveyed an important truth as to the original connection of comets with the solar system.

== Work ==

Even though he did not discover the 11-year sunspot activity cycle, Carrington&#x27;s observations of sunspot activity after he heard about Heinrich Schwabe&#x27;s work led to the numbering of the cycles with Carrington&#x27;s name. For example, the sunspot maximum of 2002 was Carrington Cycle No. 23.

Carrington also determined the elements of the rotation axis of the Sun, based on sunspot motions, and his results remain in use today. Carrington rotation is a system for measuring solar longitude based on his observations of the low-latitude solar rotation rate.

Carrington made the initial observations leading to the establishment of Spörer&#x27;s law.

Carrington won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) in 1859.

Carrington also won the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1864, for his &quot;Observations of Spots on the Sun from 9 November 1853 to 24 March 1861, Made at Redhill&quot;. This award was not reported in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, probably due to Carrington&#x27;s bitter, acrimonious and public criticism of Cambridge University over the appointment of John Couch Adams, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry, as the non-observing Director of the Cambridge Observatory. As a measure of displeasure Carrington withdrew &quot;Observations&quot; from official considerations of the RAS for what would likely have been the book&#x27;s second gold medal, for the year 1865.

===Carrington super flare===

On 1 September 1859, Carrington and Richard Hodgson, another English amateur astronomer, independently made the first observations of a solar flare. Because of a simultaneous &quot;crochet&quot; observed in the Kew Observatory magnetometer record by Balfour Stewart and a geomagnetic storm observed the following day, Carrington suspected a solar-terrestrial connection. For this reason, the geomagnetic storm of 1859 is often called the Carrington Event. 
Worldwide reports on the effects of the geomagnetic storm of 1859 were compiled and published by Elias Loomis which supported the observations of Carrington and Balfour Stewart.

<doc id="458370" wikidata="Q1586627" url="?curid=458370" title="Puff-throated babbler">
<text>The puff-throated babbler or spotted babbler (Pellorneum ruficeps) is a species of passerine bird found in Asia. They are found in scrub and moist forest mainly in hilly regions. They forage in small groups on the forest floor, turning around leaf litter to find their prey and usually staying low in the undergrowth where they can be hard to spot. However, they have loud and distinct calls, including a morning song, contact and alarm calls. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Pellorneum&quot; which may, however, currently include multiple lineages.

==Description==
Puff-throated babblers are brown above, and white below with heavily brown streaks towards the breast and belly. They have a chestnut crown, long buff supercilium and dusky cheeks. The throat is white, and is sometimes puffed out giving it the English name. Puff-throated babblers have strong legs, and spend a lot of time on the forest floor. They can often be seen creeping through undergrowth in search of their insect food, looking at first glance like a song thrush. Some subspecies have streaks on the mantle while others, especially in Peninsular India, are unstreaked.

The widespread distribution with population variations has led to nearly thirty subspecies being described. The nominate population is found in peninsular India (excluding the Western Ghats). The population in the northern Eastern Ghats is paler and has been called &quot;pallidum&quot; while a well-marked dark form occurs in the southern Western Ghats, which has been named &quot;granti&quot; (includes &quot;olivaceum&quot;). The western Himalayas population is &quot;punctatum&quot; (includes &quot;jonesi&quot;) and in the east is &quot;mandellii&quot;, which has streaking on the back and nape as well as having call differences. In the east of India, south of the Brahmaputra River occurs &quot;chamelum&quot; while &quot;ripley&quot; is found in a small region in eastern Assam (Margherita). Further east in Manipur is &quot;vocale&quot; and &quot;pectorale&quot; in Arunachal Pradesh and northern Burma with &quot;stageri&quot; further south, followed by &quot;hilarum&quot;, &quot;victoriae&quot; and &quot;minus&quot;. Further east are found &quot;shanense&quot;, &quot;subochraceum&quot;, &quot;insularum&quot;, &quot;indistinctum&quot;, &quot;chtonium&quot;, &quot;elbeli&quot;, &quot;acrum&quot;, &quot;oreum&quot;, &quot;dusiti&quot;, &quot;vividum&quot;, &quot;ubonense&quot;, &quot;euroum&quot;, &quot;deignani&quot;, &quot;dilloni&quot; and &quot;smithi&quot;. Several others have been described and many populations are difficult to assign to subspecies. This is the type species for the genus &quot;Pellorneum&quot; and its generic placement is assured, although other species currently included in the genus may be reassigned.

==Distribution and habitat==

This bird is a common resident breeder in the Himalayas and the forests of Asia. Like most babblers, it is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. Its habitat is scrub and bamboo thickets and it forages by turning over leaves to find insects.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Puff-throated babblers vocalize often. Their calls are a series of whistling notes ascending in scale. Some calls have been transcribed as &quot;he&#x27;ll beat you, pret-ty-sweet&quot;. The calling can be persistent. The breeding season is mainly during the rainy season. They build a nest on the ground at the base of a bush. The nest is dome-shaped and constructed of leaves and twigs with an entrance on the side. The opening usually points downhill when the nest is on sloping ground. The clutch varies from 2 to 5 eggs, with northern populations tending towards larger clutches. Parent birds run rodent-like in the undergrowth as they move in and out of the nest. Young birds fledge and leave the nest about 12 to 13 days after hatching.

<doc id="458382" wikidata="Q7567223" url="?curid=458382" title="South Ferry (Manhattan)">
<text>South Ferry is at the southern tip of Manhattan in New York City and is the embarkation point for ferries to Staten Island (Staten Island Ferry, through the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal) and Governors Island. Battery Park, abutting South Ferry on the west, has docking areas for ferries to Liberty Island and Ellis Island. Its name is derived from the more southerly route of service of the historical South Ferry Company in comparison to the Fulton Ferry.

== History ==
The name &quot;South Ferry&quot; derives from a more southerly route of service than previous ferry lines between what were then the separate cities of New York and Brooklyn, rather than from being at the southern tip of Manhattan.

The &quot;Old Ferry&quot; (later renamed the Fulton Ferry), crossed between Manhattan and Brooklyn from streets that in each city would eventually be renamed &quot;Fulton Street&quot;. The &quot;New Ferry&quot; (also called the Catherine Ferry) crossed on a more northerly route than the Old Ferry, between Catherine Street in Manhattan, and Main Street in Brooklyn.

As the City of Brooklyn grew, the area south of Atlantic Avenue, known as South Brooklyn, began to become developed, but the area lacked easy access to the ferry terminals in the northern parts of that city. Calls for a new ferry on a more southerly route were first brought up before the New York City Council in 1825, the proposal being commonly known as the &quot;New South Ferry&quot; since 1826, but progress stalled until the issue was taken up by the City of Brooklyn in 1833. The South Ferry Company established the South Ferry on May 16, 1836 to connect Lower Manhattan to the foot of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and the month-old Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (renamed Atlantic Avenue Railroad, later the Atlantic Avenue Railroad&#x27;s streetcar line, later still part of the South Side Railroad of Long Island, now the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road) through the Cobble Hill Tunnel. &quot;South Ferry&quot; was also the name of the Brooklyn landing and ferry house. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, the Brooklyn landing site served cargo as Brooklyn Piers 5 and 6, now part of Brooklyn Bridge Park

The Fulton Ferry Company, which then operated only the Fulton Ferry, merged with the South Ferry Company in 1839 to form the New York and Brooklyn Union Ferry Company.

== Transportation connections ==
South Ferry is served by several New York City Subway stations.

* South Ferry–Whitehall Street, a station complex consisting of three components:
** New South Ferry on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line; serving the 
** South Ferry loops on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line; (there are two platforms, both are closed to passengers; the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line temporarily reopened to provide replacement service from 2013 to 2017, after the new station was flooded by Hurricane Sandy.)
** Whitehall Street on the BMT Broadway Line; serving the 
* Bowling Green on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line; serving the (some Lexington Avenue Line trains stopped at South Ferry until 1977)
* Broad Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line; serving the 

Also serving the ferry terminal directly is the M15 Select Bus Service route via a bus loop directly at the front door of the terminal. The local routes stop on nearby streets.

Starting in 1877, South Ferry also hosted a four-track elevated terminal with access to all Manhattan elevated train lines running up Second, Third, Sixth and Ninth Avenues. The station was closed in 1950.

<doc id="458385" wikidata="Q1136590" url="?curid=458385" title="Coteau des Prairies">
<text>The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau approximately 200 miles in length and 100 miles in width (320 by 160 km), rising from the prairie flatlands in eastern South Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, and northwestern Iowa in the United States. The southeast portion of the Coteau comprises one of the distinct regions of Minnesota, known as Buffalo Ridge. The tip of the feature starts in extreme south North Dakota.

The flatiron-shaped plateau was named by early French explorers from New France (Quebec), &quot;coteau&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot; in French; the general term &quot;coteau&quot; has since been used in English to describe any upland dividing ridge.

The plateau is composed of thick glacial deposits, the remnants of many repeated glaciations, reaching a composite thickness of approximately 900 feet (275 m). They are underlain by a small ridge of resistant Cretaceous shale. During the last (Pleistocene) Ice Age, two lobes of the Laurentide glacier, the James lobe on the west and the Des Moines lobe on the east, appear to have parted around the pre-existing plateau and further deepened the lowlands flanking the plateau.

The plateau has numerous small glacial lakes and is drained by the Big Sioux River in South Dakota and the Cottonwood River in Minnesota. Pipestone deposits on the plateau have been quarried for hundreds of years by Native Americans, who use the prized, brownish-red mineral to make their sacred ceremonial pipes. The quarries are located at Pipestone National Monument in the southwest corner of Minnesota and in adjacent Minnehaha County, South Dakota.

Numerous wind farms have been built on the area&#x27;s surface to take advantage of the high average wind speeds.

<text>Urethral sounding is the practice of inserting objects (typically made by metal or silicone) into the urethra for sexual gratification. Urethral dilatation is a urological procedure that uses probes called sounds to enlarge the inside diameter of the urethra and locate obstructions in the urethra, or as a treatment for urethral strictures.

== Risks ==
The insertion of foreign bodies into the urethra can present serious medical problems. If not conducted carefully, sounding carries a risk of irritation, tearing of the urethra, or of urinary tract infection. Infections may become serious if they progress to the bladder or kidneys.

==Urethral play==

Urethral play can involve the introduction of either soft or rigid items into the meatus of the penis (as well as farther in) or vulva. Other toys and items, such as catheters, may be introduced deeper; in some cases even into the bladder. Some items may even be allowed to curl several times or expand within the bladder. This action may be directly or indirectly associated with stimulation of the prostate gland and some types of bladder control. In women urethral sounding can lead to clitoral stimulation.

<text>The blue-winged leafbird (Chloropsis moluccensis) is a species of leafbird found in forest and second growth throughout Southeast Asia as far east as Borneo and as far south as southern Sumatra. It previously included Jerdon&#x27;s leafbird (&quot;C. jerdoni&quot;) from the Indian Subcontinent, and the Bornean leafbird (&quot;C. kinabaluensis&quot;) from northern Borneo as subspecies, but differs from both in measurements and morphology, with Jerdon&#x27;s lacking any blue to the flight feathers, and Bornean having a distinctive male-like female plumage. The Javan leafbird (&quot;C. cochinchinensis&quot;), which is endemic to Java, was also formerly grouped with the species, but more recent phylogenetic studies have split both. The distribution of the blue-winged and the Bornean leafbird are known to approach each other, but there is no evidence of intergradation.

The male is green-bodied with a yellow-tinged head, black face and throat. It has a blue moustachial line. The female differs in that it has a greener head and blue throat, and young birds are like the female but without the blue throat patch.

It is common to fairly common throughout most of its range, and therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International.

The superficially similar golden-fronted leafbird lacks blue in the flight feathers and tail, and has a golden forehead.

As in other leafbirds, the call of the blue-winged leafbird consists of a rich mixture of imitations of the calls of various other species of birds.

<doc id="458399" wikidata="Q276538" url="?curid=458399" title="Eurocorps">
<text>Eurocorps, located in the French city of Strasbourg (Bas-Rhin), is a multinational corps headquarters. Founded by France and Germany in 1992, it is today composed of personnel from six framework nations and five associated nations. The framework nations place the Eurocorps at the service of the European Union (EU) and NATO, which certified it in 2002 as one of its nine High Readiness Land Headquarters (HRF (L) HQ).

The precedents of the Eurocorps date back to 1989, when German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the President of the French Republic, François Mitterrand, initiated military cooperation by establishing the Franco-German Defense and Security Council and creating a joint brigade, which became operational in 1991.

Subsequently, in 1992, at the La Rochelle summit, both countries signed the report that led to the creation of Eurocorps. That same year, the first German and French officers joined the unit. In 1993 Belgium joined the unit, followed by Spain a year later. In 1995 it was officially declared operational, and the following year Luxembourg joined. In 2022 Poland became the sixth framework nation. Currently there are five associated countries: Greece, Turkey, Italy, Austria and Romania. There have also been, during different periods, military personnel from Canada (2003–2007), the United Kingdom (1999–2002), the Netherlands (1999–2002) and Finland (2002–2005).

The Eurocorps was formally established on a legal basis by the Treaty concerning the Eurocorps and the status of its headquarters, also known as &quot;Treaty of Strasbourg&quot;, an agreement signed in Brussels on 22 November 2004 by the defense ministers of the five member countries at that time (Germany, France, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg) and ratified by their respective national parliaments. It became effective on 26 February 2009.

The purpose of the treaty, as stated in article 1, is to &quot;&quot;define the fundamental principles relating to the missions, organization and functioning of the Eurocorps&quot;.&quot;

Article 2 defines the European military group as &quot;&quot;the multinational army corps consisting of the Headquarters and the units in respect of which the Contracting Parties have effected the transfer of command to the Commanding General of the Eurocorps&quot;.&quot;

As for Eurocorps missions, article 3 states that they may be entrusted to it in the context of the United Nations, the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) evacuation missions, humanitarian missions, peacekeeping or crisis management.

== Participating countries ==
Six countries participate in the corps as member states. The treaty allows for any EU member state to become a member of Eurocorps, subject to the approval of existing Eurocorps members. Additionally, there are five associated members. The Eurocorps is staffed by personnel from both framework and partner nations.

== History ==
Eurocorps has its origins in the Franco-German Brigade, created in 1989. Following this approach, on 14 October 1991, France and Germany announced their intention to further strengthen European defense integration through the establishment of a corps headquarters. During the Franco-German summit in La Rochelle on 22 May 1992, French President François Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl decided to launch the project and to establish the Eurocorps headquarters. Although initially it was a Franco-German association, the Eurocorps was soon opened up to all member states of the Western European Union (WEU).

On 19 June, the European Union issued the Petersberg Declaration, which defined those missions that could be entrusted to the WEU and that Eurocorps would also undertake: ensuring the common defense of allied countries, carrying out peacekeeping or peace-keeping operations for the benefit of the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other missions of a humanitarian nature.

On 1 July 1992, a provisional General Staff is installed in the French city of Strasbourg to create the foundations of the Eurocorps Headquarters.

On 21 January 1993, an agreement was signed with SACEUR placing the Eurocorps at the disposal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On 1 October of the same year, the Eurocorps headquarters was definitively established in Strasbourg, on the basis of the General Staff activated a few months earlier.

During these first years, several countries joined the Franco-German initiative. On 12 October 1993, Belgium joined the Eurocorps with a mechanized division; on 1 July 1994, the Spanish Council of Ministers authorized the participation of Spain with a mechanized division; Luxembourg joined the project on 7 May 1996.

In November 1995, the Eurocorps reached the necessary conditions to be officially declared operational.

At that time the Eurocorps had the following units permanently affiliated: the 1st French Armored Division, the 10th German Armored Division, the 1st Belgian Mechanized Division, which included a Luxembourg reconnaissance company, the Mechanized Division &quot;Brunete&quot; and the Franco-German Brigade, totaling 50,000 troops, 645 tanks, 1,400 armored vehicles and 360 artillery pieces.

This situation continued until 1999, when the heads of state and government of the five Eurocorps framework nations declared at the European Council held in Cologne (3 and 4 June) their agreement to &quot;&quot;adapt the European Army Corps, and in particular its Headquarters, to the new strategic scenario in order to convert it into a European Rapid Reaction Corps, responding to the European Union&#x27;s desire to have forces adapted to crisis management operations&quot;.&quot;

The political statement was subsequently developed in the Luxembourg Report, November 1999, which set out the general guidelines for the aforementioned transformation, once again respecting the dual transatlantic and European orientation, by keeping the Eurocorps at the disposal of NATO and the EU for crisis management operations.

Poland was accepted as a member in 2010. This was expected to become effective from 1 January 2016, but was delayed to January 2017. However, a change in government with the 2015 Polish election led to the application for full membership being withdrawn in favour of remaining an associate member. In November 2021, Poland again expressed an interest in joining as a full member, and it became a framework member in 2022.

On 25 February 2003, Austria and Finland signed a treaty which allowed them to send staff to the headquarters of the corps. Finland remained an associated nation of the corps until 2005, and Austria until 2011. Romania became an associated nation in April 2016, while Austria rejoined as an associate nation in 2021. In addition, the Netherlands and United Kingdom have sent liaison officers to the headquarters of the corps.

The Eurocorps has adopted a modular philosophy and the affiliation of large units is no longer permanent. Today, such affiliation is based on the actual missions in which the Eurocorps has to intervene and its only permanent units are the Headquarters and a multinational support brigade.

Eurocorps is today one of the nine NATO High Readiness Land Headquarters (HRF (L) HQ), having been certified as such in 2003 and is fully integrated in the NATO Response Force (NRF) rotation system, the Eurocorps HQ is also offered to the EU for crisis management operations as a Land Component Command or European Union Battlegroups Headquarters (EUBG).

=== Badge ===
The chest badge was created by an officer of the French Army&#x27;s employment office, Lieutenant Colonel Pellabeuf. This badge, approved on 18 June 1993 under the number G4000, was produced by the Delsart company and, by order of the Chief of Staff, General Clerc, was worn for the first time on 5 November 1993, during the official ceremony of creation of the corps and in the presence of the Ministers of Defense of the three participating countries at that time (Germany, France and Belgium).

Its description is &quot;an insignia in the form of a shield symbolizing the defense of the European continent&quot;.

Europe is represented by two symbols:

* The blue background and the golden stars of the European flag,
* A symbolic silhouette of the continent that allows us to hide some of the stars and thus avoid over-identification with the European Union or the Council of Europe.

On the other hand, a sword reminds us that the Eurocorps is a large military unit.

== Organisation ==

=== Politico-military direction ===
The Eurocorps belongs to the six framework nations and is not subordinate to any other supranational defense organization. It is deployed on the authority of the Common Committee representing the member states, the Chief of Defence, and the Political Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its mission is to ensure the political-military direction and the coordination and conditions of employment of the forces and it is the collegiate body in charge of maintaining relations with Western defense alliances (EU and NATO) and other international organizations. This committee considers requests for support from multinational organizations such as the UN, NATO, OSCE. The Corps can also be deployed at the request of the framework nations.

=== Structure ===
The Eurocorps Headquarters is composed of a Command Group, a General Staff, a Multinational Support Brigade and the NSD.

==== Command Group ====

* Located in the &quot;Aubert de Vincelles&quot; barracks. It is composed of the Eurocorps lieutenant general, a second-in-command general, a chief of staff and the heads of the various divisions of the General Staff.

==== General Staff ====

* Located in the &quot;Aubert de Vincelles&quot; barracks. Multinational in nature, it is designed to be used with great flexibility and to be completed in a progressive and balanced manner with personnel from the different participating countries. The working language is English.

==== Multinational Support Brigade ====

* Located in the &quot;Aubert de Vincelles&quot; and &quot;Lizé&quot; barracks. It is made up of military personnel from the various member countries. Its task is to provide the necessary support for the deployment and support of the HQ (communications, protection, food, transport, accommodation...)

==== NSD ====

* National support detachment. It is in charge of national issues of the different framework states and is located at the barracks of &quot;Lizé&quot;.

===Relationship with EU defence policy===

The European Corps is presently not established at the EU level (referred to as the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP); it is for instance not a project of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) of the CSDP. The European Corps and its assets may however contribute in the implementation of the CSDP, when made available as a &quot;multinational force&quot; in accordance with article 42.3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

== Operations ==
The corps has:
*From May 1998 to January 2000: deployment in the Balkans, where Eurocorps participates in four successive contingents of the NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR). 
*Led KFOR III in Kosovo from 18 April 2000 to October 2000
*Led the ISAF6 Force in Afghanistan from 9 August 2004 to 11 February 2005.
*From 1 July 2006, to 10 January 2007, the headquarters of the corps was the land component stand by element of the NATO Response Force 7.
*From 1 July 2010 to 10 January 2011, the headquarters of the corps was the land component stand by element of the NATO Response Force 15 (NRF 15).
*In 2012, the corps has deployed to ISAF in Afghanistan.
*In the second semester the Eurocorps supported Germany with 57 soldiers in the EU mission EUTM Mali.
*July 2016 to July 2017: twelve-month standby period as headquarters of the ground component of two successive rotations of the European Union Battle Group (EUBG).
*From July 2016 to January 2018: deployment to the Central African Republic, where Eurocorps leads three successive contingents of the European Union Training Mission in the Central African Republic (EUTM RCA).
*In January 2020, Eurocorps takes a one-year NATO alert as command of the ground component of NATO Response Force 20.
*First and second half of 2021 European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM MALI).
*Second half of 2021 and first half of 2022 European Union Training Mission in the Central African Republic (EUTM RCA) aims to advise and support the government in the training of the country&#x27;s new armed forces, which are playing an important role in the stabilization of the country.

<doc id="458403" wikidata="Q681491" url="?curid=458403" title="DFS 230">
<text>The DFS 230 was a German transport glider operated by the Luftwaffe in World War II. It was developed in 1933 by the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS - &quot;German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;) with Hans Jacobs as the head designer. The glider was the German inspiration for the British Hotspur glider and was intended for airborne assault operations.

In addition to the pilot, the DFS-230 glider had room for nine men who sat close together on a narrow bench located in the middle of the fuselage (six facing forward, and four backward). Entry and exit to the cramped interior was by a single side door. The front passenger could operate its only armament, a machine gun. It was an assault glider, designed to land directly on top of its target, so it was equipped with a parachute brake. This allowed the glider to approach its target in a dive at an angle of eighty degrees and land within of its target. It could carry up to of cargo.

It played significant roles in the operations at Fort Eben-Emael, the Battle of Crete, and in the rescue of Benito Mussolini. It was also used in North Africa. However, it was used chiefly in supplying encircled forces on the Eastern Front such as supplying the Demyansk Pocket, the Kholm Pocket, Stalingrad, and the defenders of &quot;Festung Budapest&quot; (until February 12, 1945). Although production ceased in 1943, it was used right up to the end of the war, for instance, supplying Berlin and Breslau until May 1945.
By means of a cable running along the tow rope the pilots of the tow-plane and of the freight glider were able to communicate with each other which made blind flying possible, when necessary. The towing speed of the DFS-230 was approximately . It dropped its landing gear as soon as it was safely in the air, and landed by means of a landing skid. The DFS-230 could be towed by a Ju 52 (which could tow two with difficulty), a He 111, a Ju 87, Hs 126, a Bf 110, or a Bf 109. The Ju 52 towed the glider using a cable or, in bad weather, a much shorter rigid bar connected by an articulated joint to the tow aircraft. The DFS-230 had the highest glide ratio (8:1) of any World War 2 military glider other than the Antonov A-7. This was because it was thought that the glider had to be capable of a long approach during landing, so that it could be released a greater distance from the target so the sound of the towing aircraft did not alert the enemy.

;DFS 230 F-1
:Larger version with capacity for 15 soldiers, one prototype (DFS 230 V7, DV+AV)

;DFS 203: Two DFS 230 fuselages joined by an enlarged cantilever centre section, with span of and length of due to the rear fuselage being extended. Wind tunnel testing revealed little or no advantage over the standard DFS 230 so further work was abandoned.

;Focke-Achgelis Fa 225:A single DFS 230 converted to an auto-gyro by replacing the wings with the 3-bladed rotor from a Focke-Achgelis Fa 223, mounted on a pylon above the fuselage. The undercarriage was revised to include long oleo shock absorbers with a wide track for stability. Towed behind a Junkers Ju 52/3m during trials, it was found that the low towing speed and low approach speed made the combination more vulnerable to attack.

<text>The golden-fronted leafbird (Chloropsis aurifrons) is a species of leafbird. It is found from the Indian subcontinent and south-western China, to south-east Asia and Sumatra.

It builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-3 eggs. This species eats insects and berries.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Formerly, the Sumatran leafbird was considered as a subspecies, but the two differ extensively in morphology and other characteristics.

== Description ==
The adult is green-bodied with a black face and throat bordered with yellow. It has dark brown irises and blackish feet and bill. It has a yellowish orange forehead and blue moustachial line (but lacks the blue flight feathers and tail sides of blue-winged leafbird). Young birds have a plain green head and lack the black on their face and throat. The black of the face and throat appears slightly duller in females.

The southern Indian race, &quot; C. a. frontalis&quot;, has a narrower yellow border to black face. The throat is black and it has a blue sub-moustachial stripe and duller orange forehead. Towards the extreme south of India and Sri Lanka the race &quot;insularis&quot; occurs which is slightly smaller than &quot;frontalis&quot;.

=== Vocalization ===

Its song consists of rising and falling liquid chirps in bulbul-like tones and its call may include harsh whispers. They are also known to mimic the calls of other bird species and have loud calls.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The golden-fronted leafbird is a common resident breeder in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its habitat is forest and scrub.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The golden-fronted leafbird builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-3 eggs. This species eats insects and berries.

<text>Trinoda necessitas (&quot;three-knotted obligation&quot; in Latin) is a term used to refer to a &quot;threefold tax&quot; in Anglo-Saxon times. Subjects of an Anglo-Saxon king were required to yield three services: bridge-bote (repairing bridges and roads), burgh-bote (building and maintaining fortifications), and fyrd-bote (serving in the militia, known as the fyrd). Rulers very rarely exempted subjects from the &quot;trinoda necessitas&quot;, because these services were the lifeblood of an Anglo-Saxon kingdom. After the Norman Conquest, exemptions from the &quot;trinoda necessitas&quot; became more common.

The term &quot;trinoda necessitas&quot; was rarely used in Anglo-Saxon times: its only known use is in a grant of land near Pagham, Sussex from King Cædwalla of Wessex to Saint Wilfred. The Wilfred grant used the term &quot;trimoda&quot; (Latin for &quot;triple&quot;); &quot;trinoda&quot; (Latin for &quot;triple-knotted&quot;) was an error introduced by John Selden in 1610.

Instead of the term &quot;trinoda necessitas&quot;, it was common for Anglo-Saxon land grants to spell out the three obligations individually. For example, the land grant of Æthelberht of Kent to a thegn in 858 was free of obligation, except explicitly for military service, bridge repair, and fortification.

<text>The Amiot 354 was the last in a series of fast, twin-engine bombers which fought with the French Air Force in limited numbers during the Battle of France.

==Development==

In August 1933, the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force) issued a requirement for a reconnaissance bomber (&quot;Bombardment Combat Renseignement&quot; - BCR). Amiot initially planned to submit the Amiot 144, a derivative of its Amiot 143 bomber with a retractable undercarriage, but soon realised that to deliver the required performance, an entirely new design was needed, and this was developed into the Amiot 340 BR3, a twin-engined aircraft with a crew of three which promised a speed of when using Hispano-Suiza 12Y or Gnome-Rhône 14N engines. A mock up of the Amiot 340 was inspected in March 1936, which resulted in an order for a single prototype being placed, while a four seat version, the Amiot 341 B4 was planned to better meet the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;″s needs. Simultaneous with the development of the Amiot 340, Amiot was also instructed to design and build a civil version to compete in a planned trans-Atlantic air race to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s first solo trans-Atlantic flight. The mock up of the Amiot 340 was modified to represent this civil version and was exhibited at the 1936 Paris Air Show as a long range fast postal aircraft, under the designation Amiot 341, but the civil version was completed as the Amiot 370.

The Amiot 370 was first to fly, at Istres on 25 July 1937. It was powered by two liquid-cooled Hispano-Suiza 12Yjrs/Ykrs engines, which gave a maximum speed of , with an estimated range of cruising at . The Amiot 340 prototype, designated Amiot 340.01, was completed in early 1937. While the French Air Ministry had specified use of Hispano-Suiza 14AA radial engines for the 340, as also required for the competing Lioré et Olivier LeO 45, Romano R.120 and Latécoère 570, poor reliability of these engines resulted in them being replaced by Gnome-Rhône 14P engines. In this form, the Amiot 340.01 first flew on 6 December 1937. It was re-engined with Gnome-Rhône 14N0/N1 engines in February 1938. The prototype was delivered to the French test centre at Villacoublay airfield in March 1938, and after an initial period of testing, was returned to Amiot for modification, being fitted with Gnome-Rhône 14N20/N21 engines. In August 1938, it was used by the French Chief of Air Staff General Joseph Vuillemin to carry out an official visit to Germany, with two seats being fitted in the aircraft&#x27;s bomb bay to allow it to carry out this mission. On 16 August, it flew from Villacoublay to Berlin at an average cruise speed of and altitude of .
After returning from Germany, the prototype underwent another series of modifications, converting the aircraft to the preferred four-seat configuration, with a twin tail to improve the field of fire for its dorsal cannon. It first flew in its new form on 21 January 1939, with the new designation Amiot 351.01. Testing of the prototype revealed problems with the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage and lateral stability. The prototype was damaged in a landing accident, blamed on faulty brakes, on 4 July 1939. By the time the prototype was repaired, in September 1939, the first two production aircraft were about to be delivered, and it was decided to convert the prototype to a four seat reconnaissance aircraft, refitting the original single tail and becoming the Amiot 351.01 A4.
Production orders for the Amiot began to be placed in May 1938, as part of the French Air Ministry&#x27;s newly issued &quot;Plan V&quot;, with 20 aircraft ordered on 27 May 1938, followed by an order for a further 100 aircraft three weeks later. Deliveries were expected to start by April 1939, and were to reach a rate of 20 aircraft per month. Amiot proposed a number of versions of its new bomber, varying mainly on the engines used, and whether a single or twin tail was fitted, and the numbers of each version to be built frequently changed. The production aircraft had a shorter wingspan compared with the prototype, and a longer fuselage. Its crew of four consisted of a bomb-aimer/navigator in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, a pilot and dorsal gunner under a long canopy on the aircraft&#x27;s centreline and a radio operator in the rear fuselage. A Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon was fitted in the dorsal position, with MAC 1934 machine gun in the nose and ventral positions. Up to of bombs could be carried in a bomb bay. 

Production delays and modifications ensured that by September 1939 none had been delivered. 830 of this very modern aircraft were eventually ordered but only 80 machines were received by the Air Ministry. The main variant was the twin-tailed 351; due to delays, the single-tailed 354 was accepted into service as an interim type. Due to technical problems with the armament installation, many aircraft went to operational units with only a rifle-calibre machine-gun in the dorsal position.

==Operational history==
In May 1940, the Amiot 351/354 was in the process of equipping just two bomber &quot;groupes&quot;: GB 1/21 and GB II/21 based at Avignon. Though 200 were in the final stages of construction, only 35 were ready for flight. This situation was exacerbated by the Amiot 351/354 being built in three factories, two of which were later bombed by the Germans. On 16 May 1940, the Amiot 351/354s carried out armed reconnaissance sorties over Maastricht in the Netherlands - the first operation conducted by planes of this type. By June, the Amiot 351/354 was also delivered for GB I/34 and GB II/34, neither flying them in combat. At that time, all Amiot 351/354s were based on the northern front. Three had been lost in combat and ten in training accidents. All aircraft were ordered to evacuate to Africa on 17 June, 37 surviving the trip. As their numbers were too few to engage the Italians, the aircraft were sent back to Metropolitan France and their &quot;groupes&quot; disbanded in August 1940. Five Amiot 351/354s continued to be used as mail planes after the Battle of France. Four Amiot 351/354s were commandeered by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as transports, two found service in the 1./&quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 200 a special service unit. Engines taken from these aircraft were later used on Messerschmitt Me 323 cargo transports.

<text>Stanford University School of Engineering is one of the schools of Stanford University. The current dean is Jennifer Widom, the former senior associate dean of faculty affairs and computer science chair. She is the school&#x27;s 10th dean.

==Organization and academics==
The school of engineering was established in 1925, when Stanford organized the previously independent academic departments into a school. The original departments in the school were:

* Civil engineering, one of the original university departments (1891), later to become civil and environmental engineering
* Electrical engineering, taught as a subject prior to being established as a department in 1894
* Mechanical engineering, one of the original university departments (1891)
* Mining and metallurgy, established in 1918 and eventually disbanded in 1945

=== Departments added afterwards ===
* Aeronautics and astronautics, started as aeronautical engineering in 1958
* Chemical engineering in 1961 (split from chemistry)
* Computer science, established in 1965 in the school of humanities and sciences, but moved to the school of engineering in 1985
* Materials science and engineering in 1961 (originally known as materials science)
* Management science and engineering in the 1950s (originally industrial engineering)
* Bioengineering in 2002

=== Current departments at the school ===
* Aeronautics and astronautics
* Bioengineering (also in the School of Medicine)
* Chemical engineering
* Civil and environmental engineering
* Computer science
* Electrical engineering
* Materials science and engineering
* Management science and engineering
* Mechanical engineering

In addition, the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering is an interdisciplinary program.

== Department of Electrical Engineering ==
The Stanford Department of Electrical Engineering, also known as EE; Double E, is a department at Stanford University. Established in 1894,&lt;ref name=&quot;25_01_2023_ee.stanford.edu/about/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it is one of nine engineering departments that comprise the school of engineering, and in 1971, had the largest graduate enrollment of any department at Stanford University. The department is currently located in the David Packard Building on Jane Stanford Way in Stanford, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;2023_stanford.edu/people2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

==== Early developments (1800s–1940s) ====
Stanford University opened in 1891, and within the year, courses addressing topics such as electrical currents and magnetism were being taught by professors such as A.P. Carman. Professor Frederic A.C. Perrine was the first faculty to teach the subject of electrical engineering at Stanford, in 1893. In 1983, when F.A.C. Perrine was appointed Stanford&#x27;s first professor of electrical engineering, the program focused on central generating plants for electricity. Frederic A.C. Perrine, in 1893, made an acknowledgement of gifts to Stanford&#x27;s Electrical Engineering Department in &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;, among them 30 horse power double reduction street-railroad motor, field magnets, and various machines from the General Electric Company and wires from American Electrical Works and New England Butt Company.

Prior to 1894, electrical engineering had been taught as part of the Physics and Mechanical Engineering curriculum. That year, the EE Department was established in the Engineering Labs. In 1894, the first undergraduate degree in electrical engineering was awarded to Lucien Howard Gilmore of Capron, Illinois.

In January 1894, the electrical engineering department proposed building an electrical railroad from the university to Palo Alto. Perrine gave the project to students, with the land having been purchased by private owners prior for a railroad that had fallen through. The design proposed no overhead wires, with the plant to be owned by Stanford University, and the engineering and management to be entirely constructed by the different engineering departments at Stanford. A telegraph office was set up in the Electrical Engineering building in 1897 to act as an operator for the Western Union Company.

In 1898, it was reported that Perrine was taking a two-year leave of absence from teaching, but would continue to reside in Palo Alto and would still have charge of the electrical engineering department. With the advancement of electricity, industry and employment opportunities proved plentiful for those with knowledge in the subject. In 1899, Standard Electrical Company completed one of the world&#x27;s longest transmission lines. Professor FAC Perrine was the engineer, and the following year, he left academia for industry. When Perrine left in 1898, the department was administered instead by civil or mechanical engineering professors instead until 1905. That year, Harris J. Ryan was named both professor and chair of electrical engineering. Under Ryan, the department began teaching high voltage transmission of electric power.

A branch association formed at Stanford University of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1904, with membership limited to upper classmen in the Stanford Electrical Engineering Department. In 1919, Leonard F. Fuller earned a PhD degree at Stanford&#x27;s electrical engineering department. Primary faculty of the EE department as of 1923 included Ryan as professor, J.C. Clark as associate professor, H.H. Henline as assistant professor, and two instructors. Henline started the communications laboratory in 1924.

In 1925, Stanford established the school of engineering, with all undergraduate degrees in engineering given out by the school instead of the departments with the new change. F.E. Terman joined EE as an instructor, introducing radio courses, and also in 1925, the department opened The Ryan High Voltage Laboratory, financed in large part by Los Angeles and the private power industry.

Leonard Fuller returned to Stanford to serve as an acting professor of electrical engineering from 1946 until he retired in 1954.

==== Government contracts (1940s–1960s) ====
According to historian Piero Scaruffi, in 1946, Frederick E. Terman became dean of Stanford&#x27;s engineering school, using his connections with the military and the Office of Naval Research to both start and fund the Electronics Research Lab (ERL). The Korean War in 1950 brought in a new infusion of funds from the Office of Naval Research, and Terman used the money to open the Applied Electronics Library, then opening the adjacent Stanford Industrial Park nearby for private business. Terman served as head of the electrical engineering department and dean of the school of engineering until he retired in 1965.

In 1947, E. Ginzton in the EE department helped design and build the first Linear Accelerator. Also that year, a Joint Services Electronics Contract was signed, with the department stating on its website that the contract started &quot;large scale Federal support of Department Research.&quot;

The department&#x27;s Microwave Laboratory in 1949 was moved into a new building with Edward Ginzton as director, and was later turned into the Ginzton Laboratory. The department opened its Electronics Research Library (ERL) in 1951, with HP and Gilfillan &quot;significantly&quot; supporting construction until 1956, according to the department. An IBM 650 computer was maintained in ERL, which was the only air-conditioned room in the building. In 1955, the department held its first courses in digital and analog computing. In 1955, Stanford merged the Electronics Research Laboratory and the Applied Electronics Laboratory into the Systems Engineering Laboratory, to focus on electronic warfare under Terman. According to Stanford, the Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL) was constructed in 1958 to &quot;support military classified research in electronic countermeasures.&quot;

==== Gibbons Plan and AEL occupations (1960s–1970s) ====
John G. Linvill was appointed EE chair in 1964 and subsequently built the semiconductor program at Stanford.

In May 1966, after comments by Stanford administration about contracts, there was picketing by students at Stanford University protesting the Electrical Engineering Department&#x27;s contract with the Central Intelligence Agency. Heffner kept the nature what he called &quot;purely an engineering research project&quot; secret, stating &quot;we accept grants from donors with whom we do not particularly care to be allied, but we will not refuse a gift if its objectives are worthwhile.&quot;

In January 1969, chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department John Linvill stated that the department would allow the enrollment of &quot;minority group&quot; students to study for advanced degrees in electrical engineering. In the Gibbons Plan, the students were only allowed partial credits, with their studies financed by their external employers.

On April 3, 1969, 700 students voted to occupy the AEL. This formed the April Third Movement, a coalition of Stanford campus organizations, occupied the Applied Electronics Laboratory for nine days, in protest for Stanford doing classified work for the government. 1400 Stanford community members signed a statement of participation. At the time, the lab was linked with classified military electronics research and electronic warfare being used against the Vietnamese people. The students of the April Third Movement occupied the hallways of the Applied Electronics Lab building, shutting down research for the occupation. Students slept on the roof of the lab, with large nightly meetings. The group also used the publishing materials in the basement to product documents linking Stanford trustees to defense contractors. The sit-in ultimately led to the school severing ties with the former Stanford Research Institute and moving its military research off campus.

In later 1969, the Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL), was a part of the Stanford Electronic Laboratory, which was the &quot;research affiliate of the electrical engineering department, especially in doctoral research.&quot; That year, AEL director William Rambo admitted after criticism and a sit-in protest that the laboratory was working with the Department of Defense in matters related to the Vietnam War.

In 1969, Stanford EE classes were broadcast to Silicon Valley by the Stanford Instructional Television Network for the first time.

In 1971, the electrical engineering department had the largest graduate enrollment of any department at Stanford University.

=== Recent chairs and research (1980s–2020s) ===
In 1981, R.L.White was appointed EE chair, with a number of successions over the next two decades.

In 1997, James Plummer became the department chair, as the John M. Fluke Professor of Electrical Engineering. He became dean of the overall engineering department in 1999. Mark Horowitz was appointed chair of EE in 2009.

Jelena Vučković was the &quot;Fortinet Founders&quot; chair of the department as of 2023, leading the department&#x27;s Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics (NQP) lab.&lt;ref name=&quot;26_01_2023_/web.stanford.edu/~jela&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The department is currently based out of the David Packard Building on Jane Stanford Way in Stanford, California. Research is also done out of other locations at Stanford University.

=== Degrees ===
The Stanford University Department of Electrical Engineering offers Bachelor of Science degrees with a major in electrical engineering, full-time Master of Science degrees, and doctoral of philosophy (EE PhD) degrees.

Degree programs offer some flexible options, such as coterminal BS and MS degrees completed in 5 years. The department has two joint degree programs. The joint EE MS/MBA degree is managed in conjunction with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The JD/EE MS degree is managed in conjunction with the Stanford Law School. The department also offers online graduate certificates, and non-degree options (NDO) with four online certificate programs for graduate-level courses.

=== Research areas ===
Electrical Engineering is a broad subject. Stanford&#x27;s EE Department presents their research in 3 core areas, and 2 interdisciplinary areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;25_01_2023_stanford.edu/research/the-big-picture&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information Systems &amp; Science
* Hardware/Software Systems
* Physical Technology &amp; Science
* (Interdisciplinary) Energy
* (Interdisciplinary) Biomedical

=== Published work ===
In late 2021 a team in the department was working on ultra-thin solar cell technology, publishing in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in December 2021, with co-authors including Nassiri Nazif and Alwin Daus. In December 2022, Yecun Wu of the department was a co-author of &quot;Observation of an intermediate state during lithium intercalation of twisted bilayer MoS2&quot; published in &quot;Nature&quot;.

<doc id="458423" wikidata="Q2304457" url="?curid=458423" title="South End, Boston">
<text>The South End is a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States which is bordered by Back Bay, Chinatown, and Roxbury. It is distinguished from other neighborhoods by its Victorian-style houses and the parks in and around the area. The South End is the largest intact Victorian row-house district in the country, covering over . It has eleven residential parks. In 1973, the South End was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the neighborhood was originally marshlands in Boston&#x27;s South Bay. After it was filled in, construction began on January 7, 1849. 

It is home to diverse groups, including immigrants, young families and professionals, and it is popular with Boston&#x27;s gay and lesbian community. The South End has been characterized by diversity since the 1880s, with substantial Irish, Jewish, African-American, Puerto Rican (in the San Juan Street area), Chinese, Italian, and Greek populations. Its 2010 population was 55.2 percent white, 13.3 percent Hispanic, 12.5 percent Black, 16.2 percent Asian, and 2.7 percent &quot;other&quot;. 55.2 percent of South End residents had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher; median household income was $57,699, and the median age was 36. 65.6 percent were primarily English speakers, and 12.9 percent primarily spoke Spanish.

==Geographic history==
The South End is south of the Back Bay, northwest of South Boston, northeast of Roxbury, north of Dorchester, and southwest of Bay Village. Despite the name, it is not directly south of downtown Boston.

Land belonging to the South End has been part of the city of Boston since its founding, although it was smaller when first settled and surrounded by large tidal flats. The neighborhood was expanded and developed by filling in the marshlands, part of a larger project of filling Boston&#x27;s Back Bay and South Bay between the 1830s and the 1870s. Fill was brought in by train as gravel quarried in Needham. Nineteenth-century technology did not allow driving steel piles into bedrock, and a system of submerged timbers provided an understructure for most South End buildings. Groundwater levels in Boston had been dropping for years by 2006, damaging some wood pilings by exposing them to air. A series of monitoring wells have been drilled; the water level is checked by the Boston Groundwater Trust, and can be raised by introducing water.

The South End was bordered on the north and west by the Boston and Providence Railroad, which terminated at the B&amp;PRR station bordering the Public Garden. The rail line is now covered by Southwest Corridor Park. 

The primary business thoroughfares in the South End are Columbus Avenue, Tremont Street, and Washington Street. Washington Street, the original causeway that connected Roxbury to Boston, experienced reinvestment during the 1990s. The street was once defined by the Washington Street Elevated, an elevated train that was moved below Southwest Corridor Park in the 1980s. Part of the Silver Line, Boston&#x27;s first bus rapid transit line, runs along Washington Street. The MBTA Orange Line rapid-transit train runs along the partially-covered Southwest Corridor.

===Subdistricts===

The Boston Redevelopment Authority identified several subdistricts in the neighborhood&#x27;s southeast portion:
* SoWa (South of Washington), roughly between Albany to Washington and East Berkeley to Massachusetts Avenue
* New York Streets, between Herald, East Berkeley, Albany, and Tremont Streets
* Back Streets, roughly between I-93, Harrison, East Brookline, and East Berkeley Streets
* Medical area, roughly between the highway, Massachusetts Avenue, Franklin Square, and East Brookline Street

==Parks==
The South End has eleven residential parks, varying in size and inspired by English-style residential squares first laid out downtown by Charles Bulfinch. The neighborhood also has newer parks, including Peters Park, and a series of sixteen community gardens and pocket parks operated by the Trustees of Reservations.

==History==
===Residential history===

As the South End expanded with fill north and west of &quot;the Neck&quot;, Boston envisioned a large inner-city residential neighborhood to relieve the crowded downtown and Beacon Hill neighborhoods and hoped for a large, stable tax base. Architect Charles Bulfinch laid out some of the first filled land. He designed a large residential park called Columbia Square located at the present Franklin and Blackstone Squares. Bulfinch&#x27;s plan was to route traffic around the square. His plan was abandoned, and Washington Street was allowed to again divide the square (creating separate squares).

Many rooming houses on the Back Bay side of the South End had no bathing facilities, and roomers bathed in public showers. Filled land in the neighborhood was originally eight feet above sea level, but has settled to four feet. The original shoreline of Boston Neck crosses in front of 40 St. George Street, and tapers to the narrowest point of the Neck at East Berkeley St. (formerly Dover Street). Blackstone and Franklin Square is solid land on the original neck, but clam and snail shells are just beneath its surface because high seas would occasionally overrun the Neck. 

Middle-class people moved to the South End, including business owners, two mayors, bankers, and industrialists, but the neighborhood&#x27;s wealthy status was relatively short-lived. A series of national financial panics such as the Panic of 1884, combined with new residential housing in Back Bay and Roxbury, fed a steady decline of whites of English Protestant ancestry. 

By the close of the nineteenth century, the South End was becoming a tenement district; it attracted immigrants and, during the 1940s, gay men. The neighborhood also became a center of Black middle-class Boston life and culture. The largest concentration of Pullman porters in the country lived in the South End, primarily between Columbus Avenue and the railroad. 

The first settlement houses in Boston were in the South End: the South End House, Haley House, Lincoln House, the Harriet Tubman House, and the Children&#x27;s Art Centre. In 1960, these settlement houses merged to form United South End Settlements.

===Urban renewal===
The South End was one of many large-scale Boston landfill projects to create new residential districts. Construction began in 1849, on tidal marshes that surrounded Boston Neck. The street plan for the South End was patterned on 18th-century English models, with blocks of townhouses overlooking small parks in the centers of residential streets. The parks were built to make the neighborhood feel more like a community. Townhouses quickly became the predominant form of housing, and builders produced blocks of houses for middle-class families. The townhouses were built from 1850 to 1880, typically in a mix of architectural styles. The South End became a popular hospital district; the first was Boston City Hospital, which attracted other hospitals to the area. One was the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital, built in 1875. The hospital used fresh-air cures and home remedies on patients, and surgical cases were sent to the Boston University School of Medicine. The medical school came to the South End in 1874 with the New England Female College, the first college in the region to accept women. By the late 19th century, the South End was becoming increasingly populated by African Americans from the South. Although City Hospital admitted Black patients, they were not allowed in their training programs or hired as professionals. Cornelius Garland, a Black physician from Alabama, opened Plymouth Hospital and Nurse&#x27;s Training School by 1908. By 1929, Plymouth Hospital was closed because City Hospital had begun to accept people of color into its medical and nursing programs.

The connection of Boston and Albany by railroad (by some of the various companies that would later merge into the Boston and Albany Railroad) was celebrated in 1841 as a way to keep Boston competitive with New York City as an Atlantic port. The New York Streets district, a residential area of the South End whose streets were named after cities on the route to Albany, arose south of the Boston and Worcester Railroad (the present-day Massachusetts Turnpike) over the next decade. Albany Street still exists, although it now ends at the turnpike instead of Kneeland; connecting it with Harrison Street from north to south were Seneca, Oneida, Oswego, Genesee, Rochester and Troy Streets. Troy is the present-day Traveler Street.

Nearly all the buildings in New York Streets began to be bulldozed in 1955 as part of an urban renewal project to clear slums and make room for industrial activity during a period characterized by urban decline. The resulting superblock was redeveloped into the headquarters of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. The Herald-Traveler Corporation extended from the new Herald Street to Traveler Street until 2012, when it moved to the Seaport District in South Boston. It was redeveloped as a mixed-use area known as the Ink Block, with apartments, a grocery store, restaurants, and other retail businesses. Other populated sites in the South End received similar treatment, particularly the early high-rise, high-density Cathedral Housing Projects adjacent to Holy Cross Cathedral and high- and low-rise redevelopments such as Castle Square, from 1964 to 1966.

The South End is residential and commercial. Since it is near access to railroads and port facilities, it attracted a number of manufacturers. Albany Street, along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories and was the center of Boston&#x27;s furniture and piano-making industry by the 19th century. The South End has new developments that will add residential and commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), a new project will be built on Albany Street which will &quot;include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor. A 3-level, above-ground parking garage with approximately 137 parking spaces will serve both hotels.&quot; The project was expected to provide about 200 new jobs for construction workers and &quot;employ approximately 200 employees (full-time equivalents) in management, operations, customer service, retail, and food service functions.&quot;

====Jazz====

Until the 1950s, the South End and nearby Roxbury was a jazz mecca with clubs such as the Royal Palms, Eddie Levine&#x27;s, the Pioneer Club, Handy&#x27;s Grille, Tic-Toc, Connolly&#x27;s, Estelle&#x27;s, the Hi-Hat, The Savoy, The Cave, Basin Street, Louie&#x27;s Lounge, and Wally&#x27;s Paradise; Wally&#x27;s is the only club still in operation. The American Federation of Musicians Local 535 was the top black musicians&#x27; union in the country from 1915 to 1970, with local and national musicians including Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Earl Hines, and Jimmie Lunceford. Its offices were originally above Charlie&#x27;s Sandwich Shoppe (whose walls are lined with photographs of jazz musicians who ate there), but moved to 409 Massachusetts Avenue around 1930. Local 535 and Local 9 (the white union) were ordered by the courts to merge into Boston Musicians Association Local 9-535 in 1970, and most of the Black musicians left.

====Education====

The South End has five primary and secondary schools, providing education from kindergarten through grade 12 as part of Boston Public Schools. The McKinley South End Academy is four schools, a special-education school that focuses on behavioral, emotional and learning needs. The Josiah Quincy Upper School teaches grades six to 12, balancing core-subject requirements with world languages, the arts and physical education. Blackstone Elementary School has over 500 students from diverse backgrounds from pre-kindergarten to grade five. Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, established in 1908, is a four-year South End school for students desiring a technical degree.

==Community resources==
The South End is served by three public libraries, and the South End Branch has a diverse collection of popular and scholarly materials for adults and children. It has local-history documents, DVDs, CDs and audiobooks for adults, and recurring programs for children. Programs for adults include monthly book-discussion groups and a weekly English conversation class. The Blackstone Community Center, on West Brookline Street, is one of 35 community centers for youth and families and the only one serving the South End and lower Roxbury. Blackstone&#x27;s mission is to enhance the quality of life for Boston residents by &quot;supporting children, youth, and families through a wide range of programs and services&quot;, and it has a number of programs for children and adults. Two major hospitals in the South End are Boston Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine. The South End Community Health Center, a board-governed non-profit &quot;comprehensive, health care organization for all residents of the South End and the surrounding communities&quot;, is &quot;committed to providing the highest quality, culturally and linguistically sensitive, coordinated health care and social services to every patient, regardless of their ability to pay&quot;. Services include adult medicine, behavioral health, dental care and nutrition to name a few.

Other community organizations include South End Baseball, Youth Enrichment Services, the South End Lower Roxbury Open Space Land Trust, Mytown (an organization training youth to lead walking tours on neighborhood and Boston history), the South End Historical Society, Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion, and United South End Settlements. The Animal Rescue League of Boston, founded in 1899 by Anna Harris Smith, is at 10 Chandler Street. The league has an animal shelter, an animal-cruelty investigation and prosecution law-enforcement department, a rescue department, an animal-behavior department and Boston Veterinary Care, an outpatient veterinary facility.

===Diversity===
The South End&#x27;s population has been diverse since the 1880s when Irish, Lebanese, Jewish, African-American, Puerto rican, Italian, and Greek people began to settle in the neighborhood. A number of immigrants from Canada&#x27;s maritime provinces found economic opportunity in Boston, and homes in the South End, during the 1930s.

In the 1940s, particularly after the end of World War II, the South End&#x27;s rooming houses became home to a growing number of gays and lesbians; single-sex rooming houses provided a home and social cover for LGBT people. Late in the decade, the Hispanic population began to grow; at first, much of this settlement was centered around the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. The neighborhood remains diverse, with people of nearly every race, religion, and sexual orientation.

Income levels are anecdotally reported as stratified, with concentrations of wealth and poverty, but neither the U.S. census or the city of Boston reports the neighborhood&#x27;s income. Although gentrification is sometimes cited as a reason for the flight of poorer, non-white residents, the neighborhood has maintained racial and income diversity due to its subsidized, publicly owned, or otherwise low-income housing units and a homeless shelter. Subsidized, below-market-rate housing developments such as Methunion Manor, Cathedral Housing (a public housing project), Villa Victoria, Tent City, Lenox Street Apartments, Camden, Camfield Gardens, 1850 Washington St, and Mandela Homes and represent evolving attitudes to public-housing design and governance.

Although all neighborhoods in Boston experience crime, the city has a comparatively low incidence of street crime. Some parts of the South End are known for street crime, and others are family friendly. The neighborhood has more public playgrounds per square foot than other Boston neighborhoods. The South End is known as an increasingly upper middle class neighborhood, although it is still home to many lower income residents. Some long-time residents are being pushed out by rising rents and property taxes.

The South End has been known as a gay, artistic, and cultural neighborhood, although costs in the neighborhood are rising. Unlike cities such as New York and Los Angeles, there are no city policies to help artists keep their long-term studios. Existing art galleries, however, are flourishing. GardenMoms, one of Boston&#x27;s most popular online parent groups with over 2,500 members citywide, was founded by several South End mothers in 2002.

==2010 census==

According to the 2010 census, the South End&#x27;s population was 24,577 (a 12.2-percent increase from 2000). The neighborhood was 55.2 percent white, 13.3 percent Hispanic or Latino, 12.5 percent Black, 16.2 percent Asian, and 2.7 percent other groups.

The median age for the South End is 36. About 55.2 percent of the population hold a college degree; 29.2 percent have a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and 26 percent hold a graduate degree. The primary language spoken in the neighborhood is English (65.6 percent), followed by Spanish (12.9 percent), Chinese (10.4 percent), French (2.7 percent), Portuguese (one percent), and other languages (7.4 percent). The median annual South End income is $57,699, with 10.9 percent of the population earning $50,000 to $74,000. There are 12,831 households in the South End, with 23.3 percent living in a family that includes a wife and a husband; 47.4 percent live alone. In 2010, 45.2 percent of residents did not own a vehicle. Thirty-four percent of residents use public transportation, excluding taxis. The South End has 58.1 percent of its population working in the management, business, science, and arts sectors, with 79.1 percent of the labor force between the ages of 20 and 34. According to the 2010 census, 72.6 percent of the South End has lived in the same place for the past year; 12.8 percent moved to a different location in the same county, 7.5 percent moved from a different county, and 5.9 percent moved from a different state to the South End.

==Public transportation==

The South End is near MBTA subway stops, including , , and stations on the Green Line; and , , and stations on the Orange Line. Commuter rail service on the Franklin/Foxboro, Needham, and Providence/Stoughton lines is available at the Ruggles and Back Bay stations. Back Bay is also served by the Framingham/Worcester Line. These commuter rail lines continue to South Station.

The bus rapid transit Silver Line routes SL4 and SL5 between Nubian Square and downtown Boston run on Washington Street through the South End, with several stops between Lenox and Herald Streets. The neighborhood is also served by local MBTA bus routes. Major routes include route on Tremont Street and route on Massachusetts Avenue.

<text>The National Eye Institute (NEI) is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The mission of NEI is &quot;to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research.&quot; NEI consists of two major branches for research: an extramural branch that funds studies outside NIH and an intramural branch that funds research on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Most of the NEI budget funds extramural research.

NEI was established in 1968 as the nation&#x27;s leading supporter of eye health and vision research projects. These projects include basic science research into the fundamental biology of the eye and the visual system. NEI also funds translational and clinical research aimed at developing and testing therapies for eye diseases and disorders. This research is focused on developing therapies for leading causes of vision loss including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, myopia and amblyopia. NEI also funds research on many other causes of vision loss including retinitis pigmentosa, uveitis, retinal detachment, and rare eye diseases and disorders.

Since its founding, NEI has supported the work of several Nobel Prize recipients, including Roger Y. Tsien (2008); Peter Agre (2003); David H. Hubel (1981); and Torsten Wiesel (1981).

==History==
=== National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness, 1950 to 1968 ===
Before 1968, vision research at NIH was funded and overseen by the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness (now known as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke), which was established in 1950, after President Harry S. Truman signed the Omnibus Medical Research Act. This bill marked the beginning of vision research at the federal level.

Organizing, structuring, and separating vision and neurological research was a challenge at National Institute of Neurological Disease and Blindness. In its early years, securing funding was difficult. The institute established an Ophthalmology Branch, which served primarily as an ophthalmic consultation service for NIH. Ophthalmic research grew slowly throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, producing results despite small budgets. One notable example was the study that identified the cause of retrolental fibroplasia (now known as retinopathy of prematurity, the leading cause of blindness among children at the time.

Despite this progress, some prominent members of the vision research community asserted that too many important proposals for ophthalmic research were not granted funding. They also emphasized that ophthalmology could stand on its own as a discrete academic discipline beyond surgery and neurology. This prompted some leading academic ophthalmologists and vision community supporters to campaign for a separate institute focused solely on vision research. These advocates included Bernard Becker, M.D.; A. Edward Maumenee, M.D.; David Glendenning Cogan, M.D.; Frank Newell, M.D.; Michael J. Hogan, M.D.; Frank C. Winter, M.D.; John M. McLean, M.D.; and Jules Stein, M.D.

The lobbying campaign for a separate ophthalmology-focused institute began in earnest in the mid-1960s and culminated in President Lyndon B. Johnson signing legislation creating NEI as part of NIH. NEI was established on August 16, 1968, as the United States&#x27; first civilian governmental body focused on eye diseases, eye disorders, and vision research.

=== NEI, 1968 to present ===
NEI officially began operating on December 26, 1968, and the first meeting of the National Advisory Eye Council occurred on April 3, 1969. The first director of NEI, Carl Kupfer, was appointed on January 11, 1970.  

From 1970 to Kupfer&#x27;s retirement in 2000, NEI&#x27;s budget grew from $24 million to over $500 million.[3] Kupfer expanded NEI&#x27;s vision research program to focus not only on the eyes but on the entire visual system, including visual processing in the brain.  

In June 2001, Paul A. Sieving, joined NEI as its second director and served until July 2019.

Under Sieving&#x27;s directorship, NEI established the Audacious Goals Initiative for Regenerative Medicine. The initiative is a strategic research effort to replace cells of the retina that have been damaged by disease or injury and to restore their connections to the visual centers of the brain. Success will mean new approaches to prevent and even reverse vision loss caused by diseases such as AMD and glaucoma.

==Past directors==
Directors dating to 1970

== Organizational structure ==

=== Director ===
In November 2020, Michael F. Chiang, began serving as the third director of NEI. Chiang, a pediatric ophthalmologist, conducts research on the interface of biomedical informatics and clinical ophthalmology in areas such as retinopathy of prematurity, telehealth, artificial intelligence, electronic health records, data science, and genotype–phenotype correlation.

=== Extramural Research Program ===
NEI supports extramural vision research through about 2,100 research grants and training awards to scientists at more than 150 medical centers, universities, and other institutions across the United States and worldwide.

The NEI extramural research program is organized by anatomy and disease around core areas: retina; cornea; lens and cataract; glaucoma and optic neuropathy; strabismus, amblyopia, and visual processing; and vision rehabilitation. These core areas reflect clinical divisions of most ophthalmology and optometry departments.

In addition to these core program areas, the NEI Strategic Plan Vision for the Future 2021-2025 outlines seven cross-cutting areas of emphasis: genetics, neuroscience, immunology, regenerative medicine, data science, quality of life, and public health and health disparities. These areas emphasize the methodological expertise required to address challenges across the entire visual system and facilitate translation of promising findings into clinical care and population health.

=== Intramural Research Program ===
NEI&#x27;s Intramural Research Program is part of the NIH Intramural Research Program, which conducts eye and vision research on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.

=== Research Initiatives and Offices ===
In support of its extramural and intramural activities, the NEI has established several offices and research initiatives to facilitate oversight and collaboration in specific areas of emphasis.

==Research achievements==
NEI-supported research has contributed important knowledge about the cause, progression, and treatment of many eye diseases. Some notable examples are described below.

=== Age-related macular degeneration ===
AMD typically happens when aging damages the macula. It is a leading cause of vision loss for older adults. It can blur the sharp central vision needed to read, see faces, and do close-up work. NEI has supported several studies investigating treatments for AMD, including:

* Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS): This randomized controlled trial showed that a dietary supplement formula with high doses of antioxidants, zinc, and copper reduced the risk of advanced AMD and related vision loss.
* Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2): This study investigated the roles of zinc and beta-carotene in the original AREDS formulation. It also examined whether adding omega-3 fatty acids and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin would improve the effectiveness of the AREDS formulation.

Although AREDS2 found no overall additional benefits, it did show that two groups of participants had improved results: participants who took the AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene and participants with very low initial levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in their diets.

* Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trial: Lucentis-Avastin Trial: This two-year, multicenter clinical trial compared the effectiveness of two treatments used for AMD: Lucentis and Avastin. It showed that both treatments are equally effective in treating AMD and improving vision, whether used monthly or as needed.
*  Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial: This study assessed the safety and effectiveness of laser treatment in preventing vision loss caused by AMD in people with large drusen. It showed that laser treatment was not effective at preventing vision loss.
* Submacular Surgery Trials: These trials investigated the risks and benefits of surgery to remove a type of lesion—known as choroidal neovascularization—that is associated with AMD. The results showed that surgery to remove these lesions did not help preserve or improve vision in patients with AMD.

=== Diabetic retinopathy ===
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people with diabetes. NEI has supported several studies on the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, including:

* Diabetic Retinopathy Study: This study evaluated whether treatment with either an argon laser or xenon arc lamp could prevent severe vision loss caused by diabetic retinopathy. It showed that this type of treatment effectively reduced the risk of severe vision loss, especially in patients at higher risk.
* Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study: This study assessed whether patients with diabetic retinopathy would benefit from early vitrectomy (within one to six months). The results showed that patients receiving early vitrectomy had better visual acuity than those receiving delayed vitrectomy (after 12 months).
* Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial investigated using laser treatment and aspirin to treat and delay the progression of clinically significant macular edema. This study showed that focal argon laser photocoagulation reduced the risk of additional vision loss but that aspirin had no effect on the risk, onset, progression, or severity of retinopathy.
* Anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic retinopathy: This two-year, NEI-supported study, by the DRCR Retina Network found that the drug Lucentis can be an effective treatment for people with advanced diabetic retinopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Lucentis is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor that can block the growth of abnormal blood vessels—a feature of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The results suggested that VEGF inhibitors like Lucentis may help prevent macular edema.

=== Glaucoma ===
Glaucoma refers to a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve and cause vision loss and blindness. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma in the United States. Most clinical trials focus on managing open-angle glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure (IOP), the only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. NEI has supported several studies, including:

* Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study: This prospective, multicenter randomized trial aimed to assess the long-range outcomes of two intervention sequences to manage advanced glaucoma. After seven years, the study found different results for Black/African American patients and white patients. As a result, a treatment program that begins with laser surgery is recommended for Black/African American patients with advanced glaucoma, while a treatment program that begins with trabeculectomy is recommended for white patients with advanced glaucoma and no life-threatening health problems.
* Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study: This study compared the effects of medical treatment to early filtration surgery in newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma. It found that increased eye pressure was significantly decreased in both the medically and surgically treated groups, with the surgery group having a larger decrease. However, in the surgery group, the need for subsequent cataract surgery was significantly higher, and patients were more likely to lose visual acuity and visual field within the first few years. After four years, patients in both groups were similar in visual acuity and visual field. Few patients developed serious vision loss from glaucoma after either treatment.
* Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial: This study evaluated the effects of reducing eye pressure versus no treatment or late treatment for early open-angle glaucoma. It showed that reducing eye pressure can be valuable as early glaucoma treatment—but when to offer this treatment should be decided on a case-by-case basis.
* Fluorouracil Filtering Surgery Study: This study investigated the safety and effectiveness of 5-fluorouracil after trabeculectomy. It showed that using 5-fluorouracil after glaucoma surgery improved patients&#x27; results and reduced the need for additional surgeries and medications.
* Glaucoma Laser Trial and Glaucoma Laser Trial Follow-up Study: The initial study examined the safety and effectiveness of argon laser trabeculoplasty for treating primary open-angle glaucoma. The results showed that argon laser trabeculoplasty was as safe and effective as using timolol maleate eye drops (the standard treatment). The follow-up study confirmed the results and showed that the side effects of argon laser trabeculoplasty were temporary.
* Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study: This study measured the effectiveness of medicated eye drops to treat high eye pressure to see whether this treatment could help prevent primary open-angle glaucoma. It showed that treating high eye pressure with medicated eye drops can safely and effectively delay or prevent primary open-angle glaucoma.

=== Amblyopia (lazy eye) ===
Amblyopia is a type of visual impairment that occurs when the brain does not recognize visual signals from one eye and favors the other eye. NEI has supported research into effective treatment for amblyopia, including:

* Amblyopia treatment in older children: This study aimed to evaluate whether children older than 7 years with amblyopia could benefit from the treatments used in younger children (prescription eyeglasses, patching, and atropine eye drops). The results showed that older children whose amblyopia was not corrected with eyeglasses alone can benefit from patching or atropine eye drops—especially if they did not get treatment for amblyopia earlier in childhood.
* Amblyopia Treatment Studies: These studies examined several methods of treating amblyopia, including prescription eyeglasses, patching, and atropine eye drops. The results showed that:
*# Wearing prescription eyeglasses is effective for some children with amblyopia, though others also need occlusion treatment, like patching.
*# Increasing the daily duration of patching can increase the effectiveness of correction with eyeglasses.
*# Using atropine eye drops daily is as effective as patching for at least six hours per day.
*# Wearing a Bangerter filter (a sticker attached to an eyeglass lens to make it opaque) full time is as effective as patching for two hours per day.
* Patching regimens to treat severe amblyopia: An NEI-funded study showed that six hours of daily patching was as effective as full-time patching in treating severe amblyopia in children.
* Pediatric vision scanner for amblyopia screening: NEI funded the development of blinq, a handheld device that easily and accurately screens children for amblyopia.

=== Corneal stromal keratitis ===
Corneal stromal keratitis or herpetic simplex keratitis is inflammation of the cornea caused by herpes infection of the eye. NEI-funded research led to a breakthrough in treatment for this condition:

* Acyclovir Prevention Trial: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial was part of a larger study called the Herpetic Eye Disease Study (HEDS). It investigated whether the oral antiviral drug acyclovir would prevent herpes infection of the eye from recurring. The study showed that acyclovir reduced the recurrence of both herpes infection of the eye and corneal stromal keratitis, a severe form of the disease.

=== Optic nerve diseases ===
Optic nerve diseases, like optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, can damage the connection between the eye and the visual processing centers of the brain and cause vision loss. NEI has supported studies on the treatment of optic nerve disease, including:

* Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of optic nerve decompression surgery to treat nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. It found that compared with careful follow-up, this surgery was not beneficial in treating this condition.
* Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial: This study assessed the efficacy of oral prednisone alone or intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone for treating optic neuritis, which is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis. The results showed that patients who received intravenous methylprednisolone recovered their vision faster than those who received oral prednisone and had a much lower risk of experiencing optic neuritis again.

=== Retinopathy of prematurity ===
Retinopathy of prematurity happens when abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina and cause vision loss and blindness in babies who are premature or who weigh less than 3 pounds at birth. NEI has supported studies investigating the treatment and progression of retinopathy of prematurity, including:

* Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity Trial: This study measured the effectiveness of cryotherapy in preventing vision loss in babies with retinopathy of prematurity. It showed that cryotherapy could prevent vision loss without risking babies&#x27; future ability to see.
* Early Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity Study: This study aimed to help doctors use certain eye characteristics to predict which babies would benefit from early treatment with cryotherapy to prevent severe vision loss later in life. The results showed that weekly examinations made it possible to identify infants who would benefit from early treatment.
* Effects of Light Reduction on Retinopathy of Prematurity Trial: This study measured the effect of reduced light exposure in babies with retinopathy of prematurity. It showed that light exposure does not significantly affect premature babies&#x27; risk for developing retinopathy of prematurity.
* Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold Retinopathy of Prematurity) Trial: This study aimed to determine what effect, if any, supplemental oxygen therapy has on how retinopathy of prematurity progresses in premature babies. It showed that supplemental oxygen does not cause moderate illness to become severe, so there is no need to restrict the use of oxygen therapy in babies with moderate retinopathy of prematurity.
* Telemedicine Approaches to Evaluating Acute-phase Retinopathy of Prematurity Trial: This study measured whether trained medical staff at a remote image reading center could use retinal photos to identify babies with retinopathy of prematurity as accurately as ophthalmologists examining babies in person. The results showed that the trained medical staff were almost as accurate as ophthalmologists at identifying retinopathy of prematurity in premature babies. They also found nearly half of advanced cases 15 days earlier, on average, than ophthalmologists.

=== Retinitis pigmentosa ===
Retinitis pigmentosa refers to a group of genetic eye diseases that cause cells in the retina to degenerate, leading to impaired night vision and loss of peripheral vision. NEI has supported research into therapies that slow disease progression, including:

* Gene therapy: In a canine model, NEI-funded research showed that gene therapy prevented vision loss in late-stage retinitis pigmentosa by stopping the thinning of the retinal layer (where photoreceptors are located) and preserving the surviving photoreceptors.

=== Uveitis ===
Uveitis is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina. NEI has supported several studies to examine the causes of uveitis, including:

* First-line Antimetabolites as Steroid-sparing Treatment Trial: This study compared two steroid-sparing immunosuppressant treatments for uveitis: methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil. It showed that methotrexate is at least as effective as mycophenolate at treating uveitis.
* Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment Trial: This study compared two treatments for uveitis: steroid and immunosuppressant pills and a steroid eye implant (fluocinolone acetonide implant). This study showed that for most people with uveitis, treatment with steroid and immunosuppressant pills is safer and more effective than steroid implants.
* PeriOcular vs. INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial: This study compared three treatments for uveitic macular edema, a common complication of uveitis: periocular (near the eye) triamcinolone acetonide shots, intravitreal (inside the eye) triamcinolone acetonide shots, and intravitreal shots to place implants that slowly release dexamethasone inside the eye. This study showed that intravitreal delivery of either steroid was more effective than periocular delivery at controlling uveitic macular edema and preserving vision.
* Uveitis and T cells: NEI researchers studied gut bacteria and how it protects the body&#x27;s natural flora to learn more about how immune cells attack the eye in autoimmune eye diseases like uveitis. The study showed that the activation of immune cells, also known as T cells, to attack the eye is affected by gut bacteria. These results shed light on the causes of uveitis and other autoimmune diseases.

=== Leber congenital amaurosis ===
Leber congenital amaurosis is a rare inherited eye disease that impairs vision starting in infancy. NEI supported work leading to a gene therapy for one type of this disease:

* RPE65 gene therapy: NEI-funded research led to the discovery of the RPE65 gene and a gene therapy for Leber congenital amaurosis associated with an RPE65 gene mutation. This gene makes a protein in the retinal pigment epithelium. In a clinical trial testing the gene therapy, patients with the gene mutation received healthy RPE65 genes by injection. Participants reported an improved ability to see in dim light within days of the treatment, and researchers found evidence of improved eyesight and retinal sensitivity.

In December 2017, Luxturna became the first directly administered gene therapy approved in the United States that targets a disease caused by mutations in a specific gene. It was approved for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy that leads to vision loss and may cause complete blindness in certain patients.

=== Technology development ===
NEI has invested in the development of technologies to support diagnosis and management. A few examples of this investment include:

* Laser therapies: NEI has contributed to the development and evaluation of medical laser treatments to treat AMD, glaucoma, and myopia (nearsightedness), and other refractive errors.
* Noninvasive imaging: NEI-funded researchers supported the development of optical coherence tomography, a technology that allows doctors to see the tissues inside the eye in real time without surgery. With optical coherence tomography, doctors can look for early signs of eye diseases and monitor how a patient&#x27;s disease progresses or responds to treatment.

== Education and outreach activities ==
Part of NEI&#x27;s mission is to educate health care providers, scientists, policymakers, and the public about advances in vision research and their impact on health and quality of life. This effort is led by NEI&#x27;s National Eye Health Education Program.

=== National Eye Health Education Program ===
NEI created the National Eye Health Education Program to educate professionals and the public about the importance of eye health. The program partners with more than 60 national organizations representing health professionals, educators, and patients in accomplishing this mission. It also oversees public and professional education programs on diabetic eye disease, glaucoma, vision rehabilitation, special population outreach, and vision and aging—with a focus on individuals and populations at higher risk of eye health disorders, including older people, those with diabetes, Black/African American people, and Hispanic/Latino people.

The program also draws on research supported by NIH and NEI to identify other populations at risk (e.g., Asian American people, residents of rural communities) and to produce educational materials for professional and public audiences. It emphasizes the importance of early detection and timely treatment of eye disease and the benefits of vision rehabilitation. The program also aims to increase awareness among health professionals and the public of science-based health information that can be applied to preserving sight and preventing blindness.

=== Eye on the Future Teen Video Contest ===
In 2022, the NEI created the Eye on the Future Teen Video Contest to foster the next generation of American scientists. The NEI awards American youth who create educational videos in three categories: &quot;Science in your world,&quot; &quot;Science in the field or lab,&quot; and &quot;Science in your future.&quot; One winner is selected in each category, each receiving a prize of $2,000 USD.

<text>Arado Flugzeugwerke was a German aircraft manufacturer, originally established as the Warnemünde factory of the Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen firm, which produced land-based military aircraft and seaplanes during the First and Second World Wars.

==History==
With its parent company, it ceased operations following the First World War, when restrictions on German aviation were created by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1921, the factory was purchased by Heinrich Lübbe, who is said to have assisted Anthony Fokker in the creation of the pioneering &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; synchronization gear system during 1914-15, and re-commenced aircraft construction for export. Walter Rethel, previously of Kondor and Fokker, was appointed head designer. In 1925, the company joined the Arado Handelsgesellschaft (&quot;Arado trading firm&quot;) that was founded by the industrialist Hugo Stinnes Jr. for covering up illegal trade with military equipment. When the Nazi government came to power in Germany in 1933, Lübbe took control of the company. Just prior to that, Walter Blume, formerly of Albatros, replaced Rethel.

Arado achieved early prominence as a supplier to the Luftwaffe with the Arado Ar 66, which became one of the standard Luftwaffe trainers right into World War II. The firm also produced some of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s first fighter aircraft, the Ar 65 and Ar 68. In 1936, the RLM (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; – &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) insisted that, as a show of loyalty, Lübbe should join the Nazi party. When he refused, he was arrested and forced to sell the company to the state. It was renamed to the more specific (and accurate) Arado Flugzeugwerke GmbH, and was placed under the direction of Erich Serno, and Felix Wagenführ, himself a former IdFlieg officer in World War I.

When Germany invaded Poland, instigating World War II, two more Arado products rose to prominence, the 
Ar 96, which became the Luftwaffe&#x27;s most used trainer, and the Ar 196 a reconnaissance seaplane that became standard equipment on all larger German warships. Unfortunately for Arado, most of their other designs were passed over in favour of stronger products from their competitors, such as Germany&#x27;s only heavy bomber fielded during the war, the Heinkel He 177, for which Arado was the primary subcontractor. Perhaps Arado&#x27;s most celebrated aircraft of the war was the Ar 234, the first jet-powered bomber. Too late to have any real effect on the outcome of the conflict, it was nevertheless a sign of things to come.

Until their liberation in April 1945 by the Soviet army, 1,012 slave laborers from Freiberg, a sub-camp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp, worked at the Arado factory, beginning with the first trainload of 249 prisoners arriving in August 1944. The prisoners were mostly Polish Jewish women and girls sent to Freiberg from Auschwitz.

Arado also licence-built various versions of, and components for the Focke-Wulf Fw 190.

In 1945, the company was liquidated and broken up.

The Ar 96 continued to be produced in Czechoslovakia by Zlin for many years after the war as the C.2B.

He is the only child of actor and comedian Freddie Prinze.

==Early life==
Freddie James Prinze Jr. was born in Los Angeles on March 8, 1976, the only child of Katherine Elaine Prinze (&quot;née&quot; Cochran) and actor and stand-up comedian Freddie Prinze.

His paternal grandmother was from Puerto Rico and he is fluent in Spanish. Prinze had enjoyed acting in school productions as a child and participated in Albuquerque Children&#x27;s Theatre, though he originally planned to become a civil engineer before getting roles on &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;The Watcher&quot;. Soon after that he saw Neil Patrick Harris at his high school getting kids excited about getting into acting, and he decided to do that. After graduating from La Cueva High School in 1994, Prinze moved to Los Angeles to audition for television roles.

==Career==
===Television and film===
Prinze was cast in a guest role on the ABC TV series &quot;Family Matters&quot; in 1995. He then appeared in a few programs and made-for-TV movies, before making his motion picture debut in &quot;To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday&quot; in 1996. In subsequent years, Prinze appeared in youth-oriented movies &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997) and its sequel &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998), made him known to teenage audiences. His first leading role, the romantic comedy &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999), grossed $63 million in the United States.

He guest starred on &quot;George Lopez&quot; for a crossover with &quot;Freddie&quot;. In 2004, Prinze accepted a special award from TV Land on behalf of his late father. He thanked his father&#x27;s former co-star Della Reese for her continued advice and support. In 2006, he lent his voice to the character of Pi in the animated film &quot;Shark Bait&quot;. Also in 2007, he lent his voice to the character of Rick in &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot; along with his wife Gellar, Wallace Shawn, Andy Dick, George Carlin, and Sigourney Weaver. In 2008, he auditioned for Jigsaw in &quot;&quot;, but was not given the part at the decision of Lionsgate Studios. He later was the voice of the titular character in the animated movie &quot;Delgo&quot;. In 2010, Prinze guest starred on &quot;Psych&quot; as Dennis, a grade school friend of Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster.

He also voiced the future version of Tim and Jim Possible in the &quot;Kim Possible&quot; movie &quot;Kim Possible: A Sitch in Time&quot;.

In March 2009, it was announced that Prinze had signed on to star as Bradley, aka Ultimatum, in the ABC show &quot;No Heroics&quot;, a U.S. remake of the British show of the same name. The show was not picked up, but Prinze was cast as a series regular for the eighth season of the television show &quot;24&quot;; he played Cole Ortiz, a new CTU operative.

He had created an official profile on WWE&#x27;s &quot;Universe&quot; blog community where he would regularly write his thoughts about the current goings-on in the world of the WWE. His relationship with the company was furthered when he was hired as a member of the creative staff to contribute to weekly television and pay-per-view programming for the SmackDown brand. It was reported on February 22, 2009 that Prinze and WWE had parted ways, but in January 2021, Prinze explained that he had actually chosen to leave the company at that time.

Prinze returned to WWE on October 1, 2010 in a role as a producer and director. On the November 1, 2010 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Prinze made an on-screen appearance as Vince McMahon&#x27;s doctor, a dream sequence scene that coincided with Linda McMahon&#x27;s attempt to win a seat in the Senate for the state of Connecticut.

<text>Yabucoa () is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the eastern region, north of Maunabo; south of San Lorenzo, Las Piedras and Humacao; and east of Patillas. Yabucoa is spread over 9 barrios and Yabucoa Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== Etymology and nicknames ==
The name &quot;Yabucoa&quot; is said to come from the Taíno name &quot;Guaroca&quot;, both a toponymic and personal name meaning &quot;where water [is found]&quot;. However this is considered a folk etymology and other linguists suggest the name is most likely a Spanish interpretation of the Taíno word &quot;yaucoa&quot; (similar to the name Yauco) which means &quot;cassava plantation&quot;.

Some nicknames of the city are &quot;Sugar City&quot;, after the numerous sugarcane plantations of the Yabucoa Valley, and &quot;Pueblo de Yuca&quot; (&quot;Yuca Town&quot;) which references the Taíno origin of the name of the town. The locals are also known as the &quot;Bebe Leches&quot; (&quot;milk drinkers&quot;) after the numerous dairy farms located in the region.

==History==
The region of what is now Yabucoa belonged to the Taíno region of Guayaney, which covered a portion of the southeast region of Puerto Rico. The region was led by cacique Guaraca. After the Spanish colonization, the region of Yabucoa belonged to Humacao, and its territory was mostly used for cattle and farming. Yabucoa, as a town, was founded on October 3, 1793, when Don Manuel Colón de Bonilla and his wife, Doña Catalina Morales Pacheco, donated the lands to the people.
Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, as a high-end, category 4 hurricane, knocking out power to the entire island and also affected access to clean water. The hurricane made landfall in Camino Nuevo, Yabucoa and triggered numerous landslides, caused widespread flooding and damaged critical infrastructure. Yabucoa&#x27;s municipal buildings sustained mayor damages, and up to 2500 other structures in Yabucoa were affected.

Elderly were especially affected because many homes were completely destroyed. Many elderly living in Yabucoa died as a result of Hurricane Maria. People on oxygen machines died with the lack of electrical power. In June, 2018 the administrators of the municipality stated that they noticed an uptick in mortality rates (deaths) and were relaying the information since February, of 2018 but the government of Puerto Rico was not interested in hearing about it. Many more deaths were occurring than expected. An entire new section to the cemetery was built following the hurricane and the deaths that followed.

As of June 12, 2018, eight months after the hurricane, more than 30% of Yabucoa homes were still without electrical power, stated the mayor of Yabucoa, Rafael Surillo. He stated there were 4,000 residences with between 12,000 and 15,000 residents without electrical power, of 36,000 residents. Large swaths of Yabucoa municipality including Guayabota, Tejas, Juan Martín, Calabazas, Limones and Aguacate barrios, and 100% of Jácanas were without electrical power for nine months, some since Hurricane Irma had hit a week prior to Hurricane Maria.

The municipality of Yabucoa is located in the south-eastern coast of Puerto Rico.

The San Lorenzo Batholith is a composite body that is composed of gabbro (Kd), diorite, tonalite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite. The Cuchillas de Panduras, a fork of the Sierra de Cayey in the Cordillera Central runs through its south. Santa Elena is one of its most prominent peaks with an altitude of . Santa Elena is located in Juan Martin ward. Pandura Peak rises above sea level. Pandura is located in the Calabazas ward. The altitude of the hills surrounding the Valley of Yabucoa reaches a maximum of about at the head of the Río Guayanés basin.

<text>Phoenix FM is a community radio station serving the areas of Brentwood and Billericay, United Kingdom on 98.0FM and online, covering an area of over 140,000 people.

==History==
The station was formed in 1996 and has been broadcasting full-time on FM since 23 March 2007, having completed twelve 28-day restricted service licence broadcasts on FM between 1996 and 2006.

On 16 February 2006, Ofcom announced that Phoenix FM, after ten years of campaigning, had been awarded a full-time Community Radio licence.

Having previously set up studios in Ongar Road, The Hermitage and Hutton Poplars Lodge, Phoenix FM moved its base of operations to the Baytree Centre in early 2007 and started broadcasting full-time on 98.0 FM at 7p.m. on Friday 23 March 2007. The station moved to its current base at the Brentwood Centre in February 2012.

The station&#x27;s broadcasts have provided a valuable platform for local bands looking to gain airtime. Inme, who were then known under the name of Drowned, were one band whose first radio play and interviews were on the station.

The station&#x27;s Creative Sessions have given studio recording time to unknown and young local bands as well as featuring established recording artists such as Republica, Imogen Heap, Turin Brakes, Salad, Echobelly, Midway Still, Chris T-T and MJ Hibbett.

Phoenix FM was also the first community radio station in the UK to provide a streaming internet service, in 2001.

==DAB==

East London and Essex Digital, a consortium led by Phoenix FM and including Basildon station Gateway 97.8, won the small scale DAB multiplex licence in July 2024. Phoenix FM is likely to launch on DAB in early 2005, increasing its terestial audience to over 1.3 million.

<doc id="458435" wikidata="Q251289" url="?curid=458435" title="Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine">
<text>Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine (also known as Carter USM or simply Carter) were an English indie rock band formed in 1987 by singer Jim &quot;Jim Bob&quot; Morrison and guitarist Les &quot;Fruitbat&quot; Carter. They made their name with a distinctive style of power pop, fusing samples, sequenced basses and drum machines with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll guitars and off-beat wordplay-loaded lyrics. They reached the height of their fame in 1992. Over the following years the band took on new members, reaching a six-piece, but struggled to regain their earlier popularity. They initially split up in 1998 after releasing seven albums.

==History==
===Starting out: 1987–1990===
Based in Lambeth in South London, England, Carter and Morrison originally played in an indie band called Jamie Wednesday, which released two singles – &quot;Vote For Love&quot; and &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Aren&#x27;t&quot;. Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine was formed on Thursday 6 August 1987, when Carter and Morrison were the only band members to turn up for a charity gig at the London Astoria, and went on stage to perform as a duo with backing tapes. The debut single &quot;A Sheltered Life&quot; was released later in 1988 on the Big Cat label, but it was not until the second single &quot;Sheriff Fatman&quot; was released in 1989 that the band began to receive recognition. The song was followed by the album &quot;101 Damnations&quot; – a critical account of life south of the River Thames, full of black humour, cynicism, wordplay and puns. The album reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart.

The band&#x27;s gigs became well known for a wall of white stage lights that threw off enormous heat and contributed to the sweaty, stage-diving crowd scenes that became part of the band&#x27;s image. Such scenes are depicted in the video &quot;In Bed With Carter&quot;, filmed at the Brixton Academy.

===Rough Trade: 1991===
In 1991 – having signed to Rough Trade Records – Carter USM released the album &quot;30 Something&quot; which, thanks to non-stop touring, entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight. One of the singles released from the album, &quot;Bloodsport for All&quot;, an attack on racism and bullying in the army, was released at the start of the Gulf War and consequently banned by the BBC. Spurred on by infamy, Jim Bob and Fruitbat toured Japan, Yugoslavia and the United States (with EMF) and made a second-on-the-bill appearance at the Reading Festival. The band also made its first &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance with the single &quot;After the Watershed (Early Learning The Hard Way)&quot;, a song about child abuse that would become more famous for its subsequent legal battle with The Rolling Stones&#x27; publisher over the use of the lyrics &quot;Goodbye Ruby Tuesday&quot; in the chorus. The band also hit the headlines when Fruitbat rugby tackled the children&#x27;s TV presenter Phillip Schofield in front of millions of television viewers at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party in 1991.

===Chrysalis Records: 1992–1995===
The demise of Rough Trade records necessitated a change of label, and Carter made the switch to Chrysalis Records to work on their third album. That album, &quot;1992 – The Love Album&quot;, went straight to number one in the UK Albums Chart, propelling the band to pop stardom. Also, in 1992, the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival where Fruitbat, annoyed at the shortening of their headline set due to other bands overrunning insulted Michael Eavis and was subsequently banned from the festival forever. The band was unhappy, however, and this came across in the anger and cynicism of their next record, &quot;Post Historic Monsters&quot;.

In 1994, Carter&#x27;s friend Wez, from former support band Resque, joined the band on drums and the newly inspired trio played America, Japan and Europe, including a major concert in Croatia which was recorded and later released on video. The recording was also given away as a free live album with Carter&#x27;s fifth studio LP, &quot;Worry Bomb&quot; – a punk-pop album with upbeat material such as &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Tattoos&quot; and slow acoustic songs such as &quot;My Defeatist Attitude&quot;.

===Cooking Vinyl: 1996–1998===
In 1996, Carter left Chrysalis Records and joined Cooking Vinyl. With Salv from the band S*M*A*S*H on bass, Wez&#x27;s brother Steve on guitar, and teenager Ben Lambert on keyboards, Carter became a six-piece band.

After signing to Cooking Vinyl they released a mini-album, &quot;A World Without Dave&quot;, and started their longest ever UK tour. The band then went back to Canada and the U.S. They decided to split shortly after their 10th anniversary, and their final studio album, &quot;I Blame The Government&quot;, was released in January 1998. Two further albums, &quot;Live!&quot; and &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;, were released in the same year, in June and October respectively.

===Post-USM projects: 1999–present===
Les Carter currently lives in Folkestone and plays with the band Abdoujaparov and was announced on 27 November 2014 as the new guitarist for Ferocious Dog. He plays bass with Keith TOTP. He is also a former presenter on the Brentwood radio station Phoenix FM, having presented a regular weekly show between 2001 and 2011. James Morrison&#x27;s projects included the band Jim&#x27;s Super Stereoworld before moving on to solo albums including &quot;Angelstrike!&quot; He has also written four books: &quot;Goodnight, Jim Bob&quot;, detailing his experiences on the road with Carter USM; and three novels – &quot;Storage Stories&quot;, &quot;Driving Jarvis Ham&quot;, &quot;The Extra Ordinary Life of Frank Derrick, Age 81&quot;, and &quot;Frank Derrick&#x27;s Holiday of a Lifetime&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Gutted – A Revengers Musical&quot; that debuted at the 2010 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

EMI released &quot;Anytime Anyplace Anywhere&quot;, a &quot;best of&quot; record featuring tracks from the band&#x27;s birth until their switch to Cooking Vinyl. This reportedly annoyed the band as they were not consulted or even made aware of the release of the record. In 2004 two new Carter CDs were released: a live album of BBC concerts from the early 1990s, and &quot;Brixton Mortars&quot;, a compilation album of tracks from their final two studio albums. In 2006, Carter released a new compilation of unreleased tracks and rarities called &quot;The Good, The Bad, The Average And Unique&quot;. Echoing the earlier &quot;Starry Eyed And Bollock Naked&quot;, the sleeve features a Volkswagen Beetle – this time a bright green new model convertible. Autumn 2007 saw the release of a band-authorised best of compilation album spanning their entire career on EMI, under the title, &quot;You Fat Bastard&quot;. The title came from a chant performed by the crowd at gigs. It originated from MC (and lighting man) Jon &quot;Fat&quot; Beast&#x27;s topless on-stage band introductions. Jon &quot;Fat&quot; Beast died on 27 July 2014.

==Reunions==

In 2001 and 2002, Jim Bob and Fruitbat toured as Who&#x27;s The Daddy Now? The pair&#x27;s two bands, Jim&#x27;s Super Stereoworld and Abdoujaparov, would play a set each, after which the pair combined to perform a number of Carter USM songs. On 4 March 2007, almost ten years after the band last performed, Carter USM&#x27;s original two-man line-up played a set of four songs as part of a gig to celebrate the life of Darren &#x27;Wiz&#x27; Brown, former frontman of the Mega City Four, who had died in December 2006. The band had been booked to play acoustically but surprised the audience by playing a traditional electric set at the last moment.

Due to the success of this performance, Carter reunited for two &#x27;farewell&#x27; gigs later that year. The first show took place on 2 November 2007 at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy with support from The Sultans of Ping. Another concert was later arranged, which took place at Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 October 2007. This was recorded for the &quot;Back in Bed With Carter&quot; DVD that contained the whole concert, along with an interview and rehearsal footage. Support at The Barrowlands came from The Frank and Walters and Chris T-T. The reunion celebrated twenty years since the band&#x27;s foundation and ten years since their split. The gigs were performed as the original two-piece of Fruitbat and Jim Bob.

To coincide with the reunion EMI released a two-CD anthology, &quot;You Fat Bastard&quot;, compiled by Jim Bob and Fruitbat. The songs were digitally remastered at Abbey Road studios. This was released in conjunction with the majority of their back catalogue (albums and promo videos) being made available digitally for the first time by EMI.

On 6 February 2008, Jim Bob and Fruitbat hinted at the possibility of further Carter USM gigs when they sent an email to members of the band&#x27;s mailing list. Two dates were then announced for Birmingham Academy and Brixton Academy for 21 and 22 November 2008. Support came from EMF at both gigs. Two further sell out gigs followed in London in November 2009, titled &quot;The Drum Machine Years&quot;. Further concerts followed in November 2011, with the band playing Manchester Academy on Friday 18 November and London O2 Academy Brixton on Saturday 19 November.

In February 2012, more reunion concerts were announced, in Leeds O2 Academy on 9 November and London O2 Academy Brixton on Saturday 10 November. EMI also announced re-mastered versions of the albums &quot;30 Something&quot; and &quot;1992 – The Love Album&quot; to coincide with these concerts. Carter announced in February 2014 that they would play another one-off gig at the Brixton Academy on 22 November that year, billed as the final ever Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine live show – The Last Tango in Brixton. Due to popular demand, a further date was added at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 21 November.

<doc id="458437" wikidata="Q1190547" url="?curid=458437" title="Governors Island">
<text>Governors Island is a island in New York Harbor, within the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is located approximately south of Manhattan Island, and is separated from Brooklyn to the east by the Buttermilk Channel. The National Park Service administers a small portion of the north end of the island as the Governors Island National Monument, including two former military fortifications named Fort Jay and Castle Williams. The Trust for Governors Island operates the remaining , including 52 historic buildings, as a public park. About of the land area is fill, added in the early 1900s to the south of the original island.

The native Lenape originally referred to Governors Island as Paggank (&quot;nut island&quot;) because of the area&#x27;s rich collection of chestnut, hickory, and oak trees; it is believed that this space was originally used for seasonal foraging and hunting. The name was translated into the Dutch Noten Eylandt, then Anglicized into Nutten Island, before being renamed Governor&#x27;s Island by the late 18th century. The island&#x27;s use as a military installation dates to 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, when Continental Army troops raised defensive works on the island. From 1783 to 1966, the island was a United States Army post, serving mainly as a training ground for troops, though it also served as a strategic defense point during wartime. The island then served as a major United States Coast Guard installation until 1996. Following its decommissioning as a military base, there were several plans for redeveloping Governors Island. It was sold to the public for a nominal sum in 2003, and opened for public use in 2005.

Governors Island has become a popular destination for the public, attracting more than 800,000 visitors per year as of 2018. In addition to the public park, Governors Island includes free arts and cultural events, as well as recreational activities. The New York Harbor School, a public high school with a maritime-focused curriculum, has been on the island since 2010. The island can only be accessed by ferries from Brooklyn and Manhattan, and there are no full-time residents . It was accessible to the public only during the summer until 2021, when the island started operating year-round.

== Etymology ==
The Native Lenape refer to the island as &quot;Paggank,&quot; &quot;Pagganck&quot;, or &quot;Pagganack.&quot; All of these names literally translate to &quot;Nut Island&quot;, likely in reference to the many chestnut, hickory, and oak trees on the island. The Dutch explorer Adriaen Block called it &quot;Noten Eylandt&quot;, a translation, and this was Anglicized into &quot;Nutten Island&quot;, a name that continued to be used until the late 18th century. The name &quot;Governor&#x27;s Island&quot;, with an apostrophe, stems from the British colonial era, when the colonial assembly reserved the island for the exclusive use of New York&#x27;s royal governors. The current name without an apostrophe was made official in 1784.

==History==
===Colonial period===
Governors Island was initially much smaller than it is today. It had many inlets along its shoreline, and groves of hardwood trees, from which the island&#x27;s native name is derived. There is insufficient evidence as to whether Governors Island contained any permanent Lenape settlements, or was used mainly for hunting and gathering. In 1524, the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was perhaps the first European to observe what was then called &quot;Paggank&quot;. One hundred years later, in May 1624, Noten Eylandt was the landing place of the first settlers in New Netherland. They departed from Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic with the ship &quot;Nieu Nederlandt&quot; under the command of Cornelius Jacobsen May and disembarked on the island with thirty families in order to take possession of the New Netherland territory. For this reason, the New York State Senate and Assembly recognize Governors Island as the birthplace of the state of New York, and also certify the island as the place on which the planting of the &quot;legal-political guaranty of tolerance onto the North American continent&quot; took place.

In 1633, the fifth director of New Netherland, Wouter van Twiller, arrived with a 104-man regiment on Noten Eylandt, and later commandeered the island for his personal use. He secured his farm by drawing up a deed on June 16, 1637, which was signed by two Lenape leaders, Cacapeteyno and Pewihas, on behalf of their community at Keshaechquereren, situated in present-day New Jersey. Van Twiller cultivated a farm on the island, even building a windmill on the land, until he returned to the Netherlands in 1642. The windmill was demolished possibly by 1648, when colonial governor Peter Stuyvesant burned it down after seeing it in inoperable condition. Following this, Noten Eylandt is said to have been used as a recreation ground by the Dutch between 1652 and 1664. There is little other documentation on the use of the island during the Dutch colonial period, other than the fact that it has remained in public ownership since van Twiller left New Netherland.

New Netherland was conditionally ceded to the English in 1664, and the English renamed the settlement New York in June 1665. By 1674, the British had total control of the island. At this point, the eastern shore of the island was separated from Brooklyn by a shallow channel that could be easily traversed at low tide. This became known as Buttermilk Channel, since farm women would use the channel to travel to Manhattan island in boats and sell buttermilk. By 1680, Nutten Island contained a single house and pasture to be used by colonial governors for raising sheep, cattle, and horses.

The British started calling Nutten Island &quot;Governor&#x27;s Island&quot; (with an apostrophe) in 1698 and reserved the island for the exclusive use of colonial governors. Four years later, when Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury took office as New York colonial governor, he built a mansion on Governor&#x27;s Island, though evidence of this mansion no longer exists. Later, governor William Cosby used the island as a preserve to breed and hunt pheasants. Other governors leased out the island for profit, and for a short period around 1710, Governor&#x27;s Island was designated as a quarantine station for Palatine (German) refugees arriving from England on their way to Germantown on the Hudson. Otherwise, Governor&#x27;s Island mostly remained untouched until the American Revolutionary War started in 1775.

===American Revolution===
The first plans for fortifications on Governor&#x27;s Island were made in 1741, in anticipation of a war with France, but the fortifications were never built. The island was first used by a military encampment in 1755 during the French and Indian War, when Sir William Pepperell led the 51st Regiment of Foot onto Governor&#x27;s Island. Other regiments soon followed, and by the mid-1760s, there was documentation of a fort on the island as well as several surrounding earthworks. Further plans to improve the fortifications on Governor&#x27;s Island were devised in 1766 by British military engineer John Montresor. These plans were never realized, even though the British had asked for funding for these fortifications in 1774.

After the American Revolution started, Continental Army General George Washington assigned General Charles Lee to create a defensive plan for New York Harbor. Lee&#x27;s plan called for several defensive forts in Brooklyn, in Manhattan&#x27;s Battery, and on Governor&#x27;s Island. On the night of April 9, 1776, Continental Army General Israel Putnam came to the island to add earthworks and 40 cannons, in anticipation of the return of the British, who had fled New York City the year before. The island&#x27;s defenses continued to be improved over the following months, and on July 12, 1776, the defenses engaged HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; and HMS &quot;Rose&quot; as they made a run up the Hudson River to the Tappan Zee. Even though the British were able to travel as far north as the Tappan Zee, the colonists&#x27; cannon inflicted enough damage to make the British commanders cautious of entering the East River, and the fortifications contributed to the success of Washington&#x27;s retreat from Brooklyn to Manhattan after the Battle of Long Island, when the British Army attempted to take Brooklyn Heights during the largest battle of the war, around August 27, 1776.

In what appeared to be a strategic miscalculation, the rebels&#x27; munitions caused little to no damage to the British ships that were waiting some downstream. Two days after the British withdrawal to Manhattan, the Continental Army forces withdrew from Brooklyn and Governor&#x27;s Island, and the British took back Governor&#x27;s Island. From September 2 to 14, 1776, the new British garrison engaged volleys with Washington&#x27;s guns on the Battery in front of Fort George in Manhattan. On September 6, the Americans&#x27; unsuccessful attempt to detonate the submersible &quot;Turtle&quot; at the island was the first documented submarine attack in history. The fort, along with the rest of New York City, was held by the British for the rest of the war until Evacuation Day in 1783. During this time, the British continued to improve Governor&#x27;s Island&#x27;s defenses.

===Late 18th through 19th centuries===

==== Late 18th century to War of 1812 ====
At the end of the Revolution, Governor&#x27;s Island was transferred from the Crown to the state of New York. The island saw no military usage, instead being used as a hotel and racetrack. The quality of the fortifications, which were mostly made of earth, began to decline. The name of Nutten Island was changed to &quot;Governors Island&quot; by act of the United States legislature on March 29, 1784. Governors Island was conveyed to the New York State Board of Regents in 1790 &quot;for the encouragement of education ... unless needed for military purposes.&quot; Little else is known about the island&#x27;s use during this time.

By the mid-1790s, increased military tensions renewed an interest in fortifying New York Harbor, and a U.S. congressional committee had drawn a map of possible locations for the First System of fortifications to protect major American urban centers. Governors Island was one of the first locations where defenses were built. As such, the agreement with the Board of Regents was voided in 1794, and some $250,000 in federal funding was allocated to the construction of defenses on Governors Island in 1794 and 1795. Fort Jay was built starting in 1794 on the site of the earlier Revolutionary War earthworks. Work proceeded despite concerns that Fort Jay&#x27;s low elevation made it vulnerable to being captured. Fort Jay, a square four-bastioned fort, was made of earthworks and timber, two impermanent materials that deteriorated soon after the threat of war went away, and by 1805 it had significantly degraded. Ownership of the island was transferred to the federal government on February 15, 1800.

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, placed in charge of New York Harbor defenses in the early 1800s, proposed several new fortifications around the harbor as part of the Second System of fortifications. Unlike the First System defenses, the new fortifications were to be made of masonry to preclude deterioration, and they included increased firepower and improved weaponry. Fort Jay was rebuilt from 1806 to 1809 in its current five-pointed star shape, and was renamed Fort Columbus shortly afterward. A second major fortification, Castle Williams, was a circular battery built between 1807 and 1811 on a rocky shoal extending from the northwest corner of the island, to the north of Fort Columbus. A third fortification, the South Battery or Half-Moon Battery (now building 298), was built to the south of Fort Columbus on the island&#x27;s eastern shore in 1812. The War of 1812 commenced shortly after the completion of these defenses, though the fortifications never saw combat.

==== Mid-19th century and Civil War ====
After the War of 1812, the island did not see much development. Rather, it was used for garrisoning troops starting 1821. The troops garrisoned on the island were deployed to wars four times in the rest of the 19th century. The New York Arsenal, a military division that dealt with artillery and was separate from the Army, moved to the island in 1832 and started constructing an armory building three years later. Construction of structures for the Arsenal continued for several decades. To distinguish the Arsenal&#x27;s and the Army&#x27;s structures, the former&#x27;s buildings were designed in the Greek Revival style, such as the Admiral&#x27;s House built in 1843.

The Army still retained a military presence on the island, and in the 1830s, it constructed several new buildings, such as officers&#x27; barracks and a hospital. The Army also added masonry seawalls and opened an &quot;administrative and training center&quot; starting from the 1850s. The erection of the recruiting center and barracks resulted in the creation of Nolan Park, to the east for Fort Columbus. Together with these changes, a grassy area was cleared between Fort Columbus and Castle Williams to allow better vantage points should defensive attacks be launched. Other Army structures included a muster station that operated throughout the Mexican–American War and American Civil War, as well as a music school. Still, most of the troops continued to live in tents. To accommodate Army personnel&#x27;s religious requirements, a small Gothic Revival chapel for Protestants was built on Governors Island in 1846.

No new permanent buildings were built specifically for the Civil War, though a temporary hospital was built. The hospital treated victims of cholera and yellow fever in epidemics during the 1850s and 1860s. During the war, Governors Island was used mostly as a support facility to muster soldiers, though the fortifications were still operational. Castle Williams held Confederate prisoners of war and Fort Columbus held captured Confederate officers. The austere accommodations frequently held over a thousand prisoners, and they frequently escaped and swam across to &quot;mainland&quot; Manhattan. In 1863, in the midst of the New York City draft riots, protesters unsuccessfully attempted to take over the island when Army troops were deployed to Manhattan.

After the war, Castle Williams was used as a military stockade and became the East Coast counterpart to military prisons at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and Alcatraz Island, California. Infrastructure and facilities were repaired, unused structures were destroyed, and in 1875 a new munitions warehouse was built north of Fort Columbus. Significant development occurred on the formerly undeveloped northern and eastern sides of the island: the old wood-frame barracks outside Fort Columbus were replaced, and new officers&#x27; quarters were built in Nolan Park, east of Fort Columbus. The seawalls on the north and west sides of the island were rehabilitated or extended to create additional buildable land. During this period of expansion, in 1870, a particularly severe yellow fever epidemic occurred on the island, sickening hundreds and requiring a quarantine. The structures that hosted yellow fever patients were later demolished. Despite these changes, in 1873 Fort Columbus and Castle Williams were still described as operable.

In 1878, Fort Columbus became a major Army administrative center, and Army officers&#x27; families started to move in. Other recreational options on the island were tennis courts in Nolan Park; a South Battery community garden; golf links; and a promenade for bicycling. A cemetery was also present on the island, and initially hosted yellow fever and cholera victims, but interments were halted in 1878 and all of the remains were moved to Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn by 1886. The secluded ambiance of Governors Island was altered somewhat when the first solid waste incinerator in the U.S. was built on Governors Island in 1885. Subsequent construction in the 1890s and 1900s added several officers&#x27; residences to the island. Starting in 1888, there was a movement to convert Governors Island into a public park for Lower Manhattan residents. Though park proponents argued that Central Park and Prospect Park were too far away for Lower Manhattan residents, the plan did not succeed.

===Army operation in the 20th century===

==== Expansion and World War I ====

The Army started planning to expand the island in the late 1880s and the 1890s. The U.S. Secretary of War, Elihu Root, contemplated such an expansion so that the island would have enough space to accommodate a full battalion. Using material excavated from the first line of the New York City Subway, the Army Corps of Engineers added of fill, extending Governors Island to the south. The work was mostly finished by 1909-1910 and was declared complete by January 1913. When the project was finished, it expanded the island&#x27;s total area by , to .

Secretary Root also retained the services of Beaux-Arts architect Charles Follen McKim to redesign nearly every structure on Governors Island, as well as create a plan for the island&#x27;s topography. McKim presented plans in 1902 and 1907 to tear down all of the old buildings and provide for symmetrical building layouts. These plans were never executed.

In addition, Root changed Fort Columbus&#x27;s name back to its historic title, Fort Jay, in 1904. The Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion replaced the former chapel in 1907.

The newly constructed southern part of Governors Island was initially used as an airstrip. In the world&#x27;s first over-water flight in October 1909, Wilbur Wright flew from Governors Island, over the west side of Manhattan, then back to the island. The following year, Glenn Curtiss completed a flight from Albany to New York City by landing on the island. An aviation training center even operated from 1916 to 1917. In honor of these aviators, the Early Birds Monument at Liggett Hall was dedicated in 1954.

Despite the island&#x27;s expansion, little development happened immediately, but significant construction occurred during World War I. Governors Island is sometimes mentioned as the location of the United States&#x27; first overt military action during the war, on April 6, 1917, when troops from the island captured German vessels in New York Harbor minutes after the U.S. Congress declared war on Germany. Barracks, tents, and temporary wooden buildings were built on the original northern portion of the island, while the new southern section housed warehouses and other ancillary facilities which collectively stored $75 million worth of material. The structures were all connected by the Governors Island Railroad, which consisted of numerous sidings for shunting. The railroad had been reduced to and was dubbed the &quot;World&#x27;s Shortest Railroad&quot; by the time it was torn up in 1931. A buried railroad truck was dug up on the island in 2014, possibly the remains of a handcar.

==== Mid-20th century ====

In 1920, upon the end of World War I, the Army restructured its internal organization so that Governors Island was now the headquarters of the Second Corps Area. Few structures were built immediately after the end of the war, though the Army maintained the existing buildings and continued to utilize the island as a military prison. Some of the wooden barracks structures deteriorated rapidly, prompting objections from congressional delegations. A school for Army soldiers&#x27; children was opened on Governors Island in 1926.

In 1927, General Hanson Edward Ely commenced a major program to build several mostly Georgian revival structures on Governors Island. The new structures included a movie theater, a YMCA, an &quot;officer&#x27;s club&quot;, and a public school. The three-story Liggett Hall (also known as Building 400), a military barracks spanning nearly the entire width of the original island, was built on the site of former World War I warehouses, and was one of the world&#x27;s largest barracks upon its completion in 1928. Afterward, the Army hired McKim, Mead &amp; White to build a &quot;barracks district&quot; near Liggett Hall. During the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration landscaped much of the island and reinforced many existing structures, hiring up to 5,000 workers in the process. Some of the WPA&#x27;s projects included the restoration of the General&#x27;s House, as well as the eradication of invasive Japanese beetles. The Army also incrementally repaved Governors Island&#x27;s roads so they could accommodate modern vehicles, and constructed garages.
An Army community developed on Governors Island during the mid-20th century. The island had three chapels in addition to the movie theater, YMCA, and &quot;officer&#x27;s club&quot;. Recreation was also popular; one common sport was polo, a relic from the 19th century when travel on the island was by horseback. In 1920, a polo playing field was established on the island&#x27;s Parade Ground. Though a golf course had been built in 1903 near Fort Jay, a new polo-and-golf course called the Governors Island Golf Course was built circa 1925–1926. The course was located on the grounds of Fort Jay, and was sometimes called the &quot;world&#x27;s crookedest&quot; golf course due to its enclosed nature in a confined space. Tennis courts and swimming pools were also present on Governors Island. Different groupings of recreational areas were generally located according to military hierarchy. The number of houses of worship increased as a Roman Catholic church was built in 1942, followed by a synagogue in 1959.

World War II resulted in another hierarchical change on Governors Island, turning it into an administrative center. In 1939, the island became the headquarters of the U.S. First Army, and two years later the Eastern Defense Command was also established on the island. In conjunction, 72 temporary structures were erected on the island. Governors Island became a U.S. Army recruitment center in 1941, and was processing 1,500 recruits daily by 1942. This volume proved to be overwhelming due to the island&#x27;s isolation. In October 1942 the recruitment station was moved to Grand Central Palace, near Grand Central Terminal. Following the end of World War II in 1945, Governors Island continued to be the U.S. First Army&#x27;s headquarters, and few substantive changes were made. Some buildings were razed in the southwest corner of the island, and an administrative office was destroyed to make way for a parking lot, but overall the building layout remained relatively untouched.

==== Infrastructure ====

Prior to the construction of Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn in 1930, the island was considered as a site for a municipal airport. In 1927, U.S. Representative and future New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia advocated for a commercial airport to be placed in Governors Island, since it was closer to Manhattan than the proposed site of Floyd Bennett Field. A bill in the U.S. House to create a Governors Island airport was voted down. The island also hosted the Governors Island Army Airfield for some time after World War II until the 1960s.

In 1940, work started on the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which passes underwater offshore of the island&#x27;s northeast corner. A ventilation building designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White is connected to the island by a causeway. Initially, Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority chairman Robert Moses had proposed a bridge across the harbor, but the War Department quashed the plan, calling it a possible navigational threat to the Brooklyn Navy Yard located upriver. A subsequent plan to build a ramp from Governors Island to the bridge was rejected as well. The Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel opened to traffic in 1950 without any other physical connection to the island.

==== Decommissioning ====
In 1963, Department of Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara started studying the feasibility of closing redundant military installations, especially naval ship yards, in order to save money. The Department of Defense announced in May 1964 that it was considering closing Fort Jay, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Despite protests from workers at the three facilities, McNamara announced that November that Fort Jay would be one of nearly a hundred military installations that would be closed. In February 1965, the United States Coast Guard announced that it had asked for permission to move to Fort Jay in order to consolidate its facilities within New York City. The Coast Guard saw the island as an opportunity to consolidate and provide more facilities for its schools, and as a base for its regional and Atlantic Ocean operations.

=== Coast Guard operation ===
On December 31, 1965, the Army base was formally decommissioned and the installation became a Coast Guard base. At that point, most of the World War II-era buildings on the island&#x27;s southern tip were still standing. The Coast Guard consolidated its operations at Governors Island, making the island the Coast Guard&#x27;s largest installation. The island was used as a base of operations for the Atlantic Area Command and its regional Third District command. By 1985, the island had a population of 4,000 personnel and 1,000 family members. It was also homeport for U.S. Coast Guard cutters, including USCGC &quot;Gallatin&quot; (WHEC-721), USCGC &quot;Morgenthau&quot; (WHEC-722), and USCGC &quot;Dallas&quot; (WHEC-716).

The Coast Guard split the island&#x27;s operations among seven divisions, and began making various improvements such as adding a boat marina and the world&#x27;s first search-and-rescue training school. By 1972, the Coast Guard had opened some apartment blocks on the southern portion of Governors Island, which replaced the temporary World War II-era buildings on that site. The golf course and open space in the center of the island were preserved during this wave of development. Liggett Hall was converted to classrooms, and other historic structures were preserved and restored. A community of Coast Guard members began to develop on the island, and it came to include a fire and police department, banks, stores, churches, an elementary school, a movie theater, a motel, a bowling alley, and a Burger King fast-food restaurant.

During this time, several notable events took place at Governors Island. During Liberty Weekend in 1986, President Ronald Reagan traveled to the island for a ceremony to relight the Statue of Liberty upon completion of the statue&#x27;s restoration. On December 8, 1988, Reagan and President-elect George Bush met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the island, in Reagan&#x27;s last U.S.-Soviet summit as president. In July 1993, the United Nations held discussions between Haitian political leaders at the South Battery, which resulted in the Governors Island Accord being signed. The Coast Guard era also coincided with two landmark designations. On February 4, 1985, a portion of Governors Island was designated a National Historic Landmark. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission created the Governors Island Historic District on June 18, 1996.

The United States Department of Transportation, the parent of the Coast Guard, identified the Governors Island base for closure in 1995. The move was part of a series of Coast Guard base closures that would collectively save $100 million a year. Governors Island alone cost $60 million a year to maintain. By 1996, the Coast Guard had relocated all functions and residential personnel to offices and bases, but left a caretaker detachment to jointly maintain the island with the General Services Administration (GSA) while its future was determined. Other federal agencies were loath to take control of the island. Upon the announcement of the base&#x27;s closure in 1995, President Bill Clinton offered to give up the island for $1 if Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Governor George Pataki could agree to reserve the island for public use. The city was initially reluctant to take up Clinton&#x27;s offer because it would not have been financially beneficial to the city. The issue was exacerbated when the Balanced Budget Act was passed in 1997, stipulating that the GSA sell the island at a fair market value by 2002. The island&#x27;s sale was expected to net the federal government $500 million.

===Redevelopment===
==== Early proposals ====

With the announcement of the Coast Guard base&#x27;s closure, officials and developers began offering plans for development. Mayor Giuliani considered building a casino and hotel on Governors Island. Other plans entailed preserving the island as a museum; converting it into a public park; establishing a free-trade zone; and building an educational campus, a prison, an amusement park, a golf courses, or even a nightclub district. In 1996, the Van Alen Institute hosted an ideas competition called &quot;Public Property&quot;, attracting over 200 submissions. An agreement between the city and state to maintain the island for public use was reached in 2000. Throughout this time, the federal government continued to maintain the island for $20 million a year.

In a last-minute act while in office, President Clinton designated a area, including Fort Jay and Castle Williams, as Governors Island National Monument on January 19, 2001. The monument would be administered by the National Park Service. The following year, it was announced that Governors Island would become public property, though the transfer of the island was delayed due to the 2002 New York gubernatorial election. On January 31, 2003, the rest of the island&#x27;s 150 acres, as well as of underwater land, were sold for a &quot;nominal sum&quot; (reported to be $1) and placed under the management of a joint city-state agency, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC). The transfer included deed restrictions which prohibit permanent housing or casinos on the island. The agreements also stipulated that of land had to be used as parkland, and another had to be used for &quot;educational, civic or cultural&quot; purposes. In practice, the deed restriction precludes most long-term development on Governors Island.

Progress on redevelopment was slow, but in early 2006, Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg launched a competition for ideas to preserve Governors Island. During this period, the National Park Service and GIPEC began conducting restorations on parts of Governors Island. Major construction was necessary to convert the island for public use, such as repairs to the seawall and removal of asbestos. By 2006, the GIPEC had awarded leases to its first two tenants. The public was first allowed to visit the island in 2005, and eight thousand visitors came that year. At first, Governors Island was only open during summer weekends, except for a few concerts. Bikes and ferry services were made free in order to attract visitors. Art exhibits were later added.

====Phase 1 and 2 renovations====

In mid-2007, GIPEC announced five finalist design teams, namely West 8, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Rogers Marvel Architects, Quennell Rothschild &amp; Partners, and SMWM. West 8 ultimately won the contest. The plan included of open space, as well as provided for the restoration of the historic district and a new park on the island&#x27;s southern portion. Artificial hills were part of West 8&#x27;s plan for the island, as were free bicycle rentals. Since the island was windy, West 8 designed their proposed topography to provide moments of shelter. Some plans were not implemented; these included an aerial gondola system designed by Santiago Calatrava, as well as a proposal by Center for Urban Real Estate (CURE) at Columbia University to physically connect Manhattan to Governors Island using landfill. A proposal to convert Castle Williams into a theater in the style of London&#x27;s Globe Theatre was designed by architect Norman Foster in 2005, but was deemed unsuitable for the castle&#x27;s design. Additionally, in 2008, there were unrealized plans to relocate the security and ticketing checkpoints for the Liberty Island and Ellis Island tourist ferries from the Battery to Governors Island, bringing as many as 500,000 additional people to Governors Island each year.

The number of tenants on Governors Island started to increase, though they numbered fewer than 1,000 as of 2014. In 2009, a commercial organic farm, operated by the non-profit organization Added Value, was launched. In 2010, the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School relocated from Bushwick, Brooklyn, to building 550 on Governors Island. Also opened that year were artist studios run by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and housed in a portion of Building 110.
Demolition of old structures on Governors Island began in 2008 with the destruction of a derelict motel. In April 2010, the city took control of the island&#x27;s development, and GIPEC was succeeded by the Trust for Governors Island. The city also unveiled a new master development plan that preserved the historic north end of Governors Island, developed the middle and southern portions of the island as a park, and reserved the western and eastern sections for private development. The administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg had provided funding for the first phase of construction. Construction on the $260 million park started May 24, 2012, and the Coast Guard-era military housing complexes were demolished.

As part of phase 1 of the master plan, Soissons Landing was upgraded with new ferry docks and a waiting plaza, while the Parade Ground was regraded for lawn sports, while the Historic District gained concessions. In 2013, construction started on a new potable water connection (which replaced a locally illegal connection from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel) as well as repairs to the seawall. The Liggett Terrace courtyard was built in 2014, as was Hammock Grove and a new play structure. The Oyster Pavilion opened in June 2015, followed by the Hills section of the park in July 2016. The island became more popular over the years. While it attracted 275,000 visitors in 2009, over 800,000 people came to the island in 2018.

====Mid-2010s to present====
In September 2016, the Trust for Governors Island and the New York City Economic Development Corporation started an online survey to develop ideas for Governors Island as a year-round destination. Two years later, mayor Bill de Blasio opened a formal process to rezone the remaining un-redeveloped portions of Governors Island for dormitory, office, or educational use. The proposed rezoning drew opposition from activists who wanted Governors Island to be kept largely as-is. Also in 2018, the city&#x27;s government held the NYCx Governors Island Connectivity Challenge, asking three companies to test out 5G technology on Governors Island; if the project was successful, the city&#x27;s government would pursue a wider rollout of 5G in New York City.

The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council&#x27;s expanded Arts Center at Governors Island opened in September 2019 in a renovated former ordnance warehouse at the north end of the island. The new Arts Center features gallery, exhibition, and performance space as well as studio areas for up to 40 artists. The opening of the Arts Center added LMCC to the island&#x27;s community of year-round tenants, which also includes Billion Oyster Project, an organization to restore New York Harbor&#x27;s oyster population and biodiversity; the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, a high school focused on maritime vocational education; and QC NY, a destination day spa. In October 2019, city officials proposed constructing a climate change research center on the island. In March 2020, the Trust for Governors Island issued a Request for Proposals seeking arts and culture organizations to become year-round tenants in two historic buildings in Nolan Park. During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the island opened two months later than usual, and a timed ticketing system limited daily visitation to 5,000.

In September 2021, mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the island would operate year-round rather than from May through October. Though there were no full-time residents at the time, the Trust for Governors Island started expanding nighttime access to the island following the announcement. Additionally, two organizations announced plans to host about a dozen residents by 2022. The QC NY spa opened inside a former barracks on the north side of the island in March 2022, and the Gitano Island beach club opened that July. In April 2023, the Trust for Governors Island selected Stony Brook University to construct a climate research lab on the island, which was planned to cost $700 million and be complete in 2028. The lab, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, is to consist of two narrow timber structures connected by a solar-paneled roof. The Trust announced plans in 2024 to convert Building 140 into a restaurant and event space, and the New York Harbor School began an expansion that year.

==Geography ==
Governors Island comprises of land. About are operated by the National Park Service while the rest are under the jurisdiction of The Trust for Governors Island. The island is about west of Brooklyn and south of Manhattan. Politically it is part of the borough of Manhattan, and shares the ZIP Code 10004 with the blocks around South Ferry in Manhattan. Governors Island contains several named streets, mostly in the northern part of the island. The entirety of the island is surrounded by a waterfront promenade.

Governors Island&#x27;s shape is roughly characterized as resembling an ice cream cone. The northern part of the island is original and can be described as the &quot;ice cream&quot;, while the artificial southern section can be described as the &quot;cone&quot;. Functionally, the island is bisected by Division Road and Liggett Hall, which separate the NPS-operated northern section from the parkland in the southern section.

The highest natural point on Governors Island is above mean water level at the base of Fort Jay, in the northern portion of the island. The southern section formerly was lowland and was located no more than above mean sea level, but, since the construction of the new parkland in the 2010s, has contained the Hills, which range from high. This construction, part of the island&#x27;s Park and Public Space Master Plan, included various measures to make the island more resilient against the effects of climate change, like raising much of the south island out of the 100-year flood plain, and replacing the old sea wall with a layer of riprap to better mitigate wave action. A 2023 study found that Governors Island was sinking at a rate of about per year, making it among the fastest-sinking locations in New York City. This is mainly because the southern part of the island was created through land reclamation.

== Notable structures ==

=== Fortifications ===
Several fortifications were built on Governors Island to protect New York Harbor. These worked in conjunction with Castle Clinton at the southern tip of Manhattan, as well as Fort Wood on Liberty Island, and Fort Gibson on Ellis Island. The existing fortifications were meant to protect the city during the War of 1812.

Fort Jay, located at the center of the original (northern) portion of Governors Island, is the oldest, having been built in 1794. It was built on the highest point of the island, with a glacis sloping down from all sides. The initial fortifications degraded to such a point that they were replaced in 1806. Fort Jay was initially named for New York governor John Jay, but after being rebuilt, was known as Fort Columbus until about 1904. The rebuilt fort, which reused the original glacis and many of the original walls, comprised &quot;an enclosed pentagonal work, with four bastions of masonry, calculated for one hundred guns&quot;, and initially included a 230-person brick barracks. Though Fort Jay has been renovated multiple times throughout its history, its current appearance largely stems from renovations in the 1830s. The walls of Fort Jay are made of sandstone and granite, with an arrow-shaped ravelin on the northern wall. The fortification is surrounded by a moat that is now dry.

Castle Williams was built from 1807 through 1811 on the northwestern corner of the island, on what was then a submerged rock. Named for USACE chief engineer Jonathan Williams, it is a cylindrical four-tiered sandstone building measuring high by in diameter. The walls taper from from bottom to top. The building is four-tiered, with 13 casemates on each tier each having a capacity of two cannons, for a total capacity of 104 cannons. Two structures inside the southern side of the fort were removed in 1900.

A third structure, called the South Battery or Half-Moon Battery, is located at the southeast corner of the original island near Buttermilk Channel, and was built before the War of 1812. The arrowhead-shaped South Battery contained 13 barbette guns, mounted on the parapet and facing Buttermilk Channel, as well as a barracks inside. It was then used as an officer&#x27;s mess and Catholic chapel by 1878; as a court-martial room by the 1880s; and as an amusement hall after a 1904 renovation. From the 1930s, South Battery was also used as an officers&#x27; club.

===Open landscapes===

==== Northern portion ====

There are four open landscapes in the historic northern part of Governors Island. The northernmost is the glacis of Fort Jay, a treeless grassy area that slopes down from all sides of the fort. The glacis formed a buffer between the walls of Fort Jay and the moat at the bottom of the slope. The glacis contained a polo field, as well as the Governors Island Golf Course.

To the southeast of Fort Jay is Nolan Park, a formal trapezoidal area with tree-lined walks that is surrounded by former officers&#x27; quarters and administrative buildings. The park&#x27;s eastern border curves southwest toward the southern end of the area, while the western and northern borders are roughly perpendicular to each other. Nolan Park&#x27;s current configuration dates to the 1870s, and it was named after Major General Dennis E. Nolan, who was First Army&#x27;s commander from 1933 to 1936. A bandstand formerly existed on the site.

Governors Island&#x27;s Parade Ground is located directly west of Nolan Park and south of Fort Jay, and is about . The parade ground slopes downward, away from Fort Jay and toward the waterfront to the south. It was used as both a military training ground and as an execution site for prisoners stockaded at Castle Williams. The golf course formerly extended into the parade ground, though remnants of the golf course still exist. Near the Parade Ground, overlooking Buttermilk Channel, is New York City&#x27;s only lavender field.

The fourth open landscape is the triangle between Clayton and Hay Roads, also known as Colonels Row Green or Hay Park, located southwest of Fort Jay and northeast of Liggett Hall. It was created in the early 20th century and forms a wedge shape between Hay Road to the east, which forms the island&#x27;s original southwest shoreline, and Clayton Road and Liggett Hall to the southwest.

==== Southern portion ====

The southern portion of Governors Island includes a park that covers more than . The north end of the park contains Hammock Grove, a landscaped area of rolling hills with over 60 tree species. The grove&#x27;s hills are located up to above mean sea level, preventing it from flooding. The grove itself is and contains 50 hammocks. Immediately to the west is the Play Lawn, which contains two turf fields that can be used for baseball. The paths in this portion of Governors Island are meandering, in a style similar to Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s designs of Central Park and Prospect Park, which incorporate winding paths to reinforce a secluded atmosphere.

The south end of the park contains the Hills section of Governors Island, which covers 10 acres. The Hills consists of four hills that are high, and are made partially of reclaimed debris from the demolition of the island&#x27;s former residential towers. Each hill has a trail that leads up to their peak. From shortest to tallest, the hills are the 26-foot Grassy Hill; the Discovery Hill, with site-specific artwork; the 40-foot Slide Hill, which contains four long slides; and the 70-foot Outlook Hill, which contains an observation area at its peak with views of New York Harbor, Lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn. The Hills includes over 41,000 shrubs and 860 new trees. The Hills cost $70 million to build; the construction of the Hills was funded in part by Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who donated $15 million.

At the southernmost tip of Governors Island is Picnic Point. This area contains grills and picnic tables close to the waterfront.

=== Other structures ===
When the Coast Guard abandoned Governors Island in 1996, there were 49 buildings built before 1917, mostly in the northern part of the island, and 121 buildings built after 1917, mostly in the southern part. The southern part was mostly residential and industrial, while the northern part was mixed-use. The island was relatively low-density with extensive open space.

==== Residential ====
Governors Island contains several clusters of low-rise officers&#x27; housing, now mostly unoccupied, though some structures are used as exhibits or for administrative purposes. The two largest sections of housing in the historical northern part of the island are Colonel&#x27;s Row (buildings 403–410), as well as the structures around Nolan Park (buildings 1–20).

Nolan Park contains several structures that are historical in their own right. The Admiral&#x27;s House/Commanding Officer&#x27;s Quarters (building 1), a two-story Colonial Revival brick house built in 1843, is listed separately on the NRHP and as a city landmark. To the north is the Governor&#x27;s House (building 2), a two-story Georgian brick house built . The southeast corner of Nolan Park contains the Block House (building 9), a two-story Greek Revival building built in 1843, which served initially as a post hospital and later as administrative offices and officers&#x27; quarters. Buildings 3-5 (built in the 1850s), 6-11 and 14-18 (built in 1878–1879), and 19-20 (built in the 1890s) all served as two-company officers&#x27; quarters. Building 12, a three-story Georgian Revival brick apartment complex, was constructed in 1928 or 1931 to house the 16th Infantry Regiment.

The eastern side of Colonel&#x27;s Row contains eight individual officers&#x27; quarters numbered 403 from north to south, which initially faced the original shoreline southwest of Hays Road. The first structures to be built, buildings 405–408, were designed in accordance with the same Quartermaster General plans, and were built in 1893-1895 as two-family duplexes. This was followed by buildings 403–404, built in 1904-1906 also to the same plan. The two-and-a-half-story building 409, a Colonial Revival structure, was designed as Bachelor Officers&#x27; Quarters and was completed in 1910, while building 410 was built as a duplex officer&#x27;s quarters in 1917 and is the only structure of the Modified Arts and Crafts design on the island.

The southwestern side of Colonel&#x27;s Row is dominated by Liggett Hall (building 400), a three-to-four-story barracks that spans nearly the entire width of Governors Island, measuring long with two wings extending south. Initially built in 1930 for the 16th Infantry, it was among the largest military barracks in the world when completed, and was the first Army building intended to house an entire regiment. The building contains a ground-level arcade that bisects the first and second floors, as well as an annex to the southeast. Two nearly identical Georgian Revival structures, building 550 (now the New York Harbor School) to the north and building 333 to the south, are located directly adjacent to Liggett Hall. The three-story structures are both U-shaped with the wings surrounding a front courtyard; they were built in 1932 as detachment housing for the First Army before being used by the Coast Guard as classrooms. Nearby are a smaller pair of nearly identical -story family housing blocks for the 16th Regiment, built in 1940. These consist of building 555 to the north of building 550, and building 315 near the southern waterfront south of the YMCA and theater.

Several other residential structures exist throughout the northern part of Governors Island. Buildings 111 and 112, a pair of three-story neo-Georgian structures on the island&#x27;s east side, were built in 1934 to a design by Rogers &amp; Poor. These served as officers&#x27; quarters for the 16th Regiment, accommodating additional officers once Liggett Hall was full. Inside Fort Jay were four buildings numbered 202, 206, 210, and 214; these were nearly identical Greek Revival barracks that housed soldiers at the fort. The north side of the island, between Castle Williams to the west and Soissons Dock to the east, contains the Fort Jay Nurses&#x27; Quarters (building 114), a -story neo-Georgian brick-with-concrete structure designed by Rogers &amp; Poor; this later became bachelor officers&#x27; quarters as well. Officers&#x27; quarters were also located in building 135, a former storehouse along the northeastern waterfront built in 1835.

Many of the former residences located in Nolan Park and Colonels Row now serve as seasonal homes to a variety of arts and culture organizations that typically offer free programs for visitors during the Island&#x27;s public season. During the 2020 season, indoor programs were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. As a result, many of the organizations based in the former homes joined the Governors Island Residency Initiative to offer the houses as free workspace for artists and cultural workers.

Formerly, residential apartment blocks ranging up to 11 stories tall were located on the southern half of Governors Island. There were 594 total apartments each with 2 to 5 bedrooms, spread out across three apartment complexes. Unlike the housing on the island&#x27;s north side, these structures were not historically protected. The largest of these structures, the 11-story, 165-unit Cunningham Apartments (building 877), was located on the island&#x27;s north side. Built in 1968, it was imploded in 2013, something uncommon in the city.

==== Religious ====
Religious practice on Governors Island dates to the opening of the first chapel in 1846. There later came to be three houses of worship on Governors Island. The Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion (building 13), a two-story limestone structure in the southern part of Nolan Park, was designed by Charles C. Haight and built in 1907, replacing the old 1846 chapel. Throughout the chapel&#x27;s history, chaplains have been assigned by several different entities, namely the Army, Coast Guard, and Trinity Church. Maintenance was performed by Trinity Church until 1986, when it turned operations over to the Coast Guard under condition that Trinity Church would resume maintenance duties if and when the Coast Guard left the island.

A Catholic church called Our Lady, Star of the Sea was built in 1942. The one-story clapboard structure is located at Clayton and Comfort Roads on the north shore of Governors Island.

A synagogue housing Congregation Shaare Shomayim was established in 1960 in what is known as building S-40. The one-story clapboard building, located east of Barry Road on the island&#x27;s east shore, was initially a &quot;temporary&quot; building used for storage.

==== Office and storage ====
Several buildings were built as part of the Arsenal but have not been used as residential structures, instead being utilized for office or storage space. These include buildings 104 and 107, originally used as storehouses; 105, a two-winged structure used as an armory and office; and 110, used as a quartermaster&#x27;s depot and storehouse. Building 110 is now home to the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council&#x27;s Arts Center at Governors Island, which opened in September 2019. All were built in brick from the 1850s through 1870s. Buildings 106 (pump house) and 108 and 109 (offices) were built during the 1940s in the same style as the other structures, though building 109 replaced a wooden structure built in 1918. Pershing Hall (building 125), a three-story brick building north of buildings 107 and 108 on the northern waterfront, served as the headquarters for the First Army when built in 1934.

The waterfront contains several buildings, including building 130, the original Arsenal workshop, as well as building 134, a modern structure which hosted offices for USCG Group: Station New York.

Governors Island also has several small vehicular garages of varying styles. Most of these garages were built in the 1930s and 1940s during the WPA&#x27;s renovations of the island.

==== Service structures ====

The northwest side of the island hosts building 515, the former Post Hospital, later used as enlisted bachelors&#x27; housing. The three-story brick-and-limestone building was constructed in 1935 to a Neo-Georgian design by McKim, Mead &amp; White. Nearby is the Tampa Memorial Library (building S-251), a one-story rectangular wooden building. Constructed in 1908, it originally served as a storehouse and was renamed after the sinking of the cutter in 1918.

The area around the South Battery, south of the Parade Ground, includes several former service structures. Building 301, a single-story brick building near the waterfront, housed an elementary school called PS 26. It was originally built in 1934, though two wings were added in 1959–1960. To the west is building 324, constructed in 1926 as the Army YMCA. The War Department Theater (building 330), a two-story 700-seat theater built in 1937–1939, is located west of the YMCA, facing the southern portion of Governors Island.

Formerly located near the South Battery was the former Governors Island Guest House/Super 8 Motel in building 293. The one-and-a-half-story brick building was originally a quarters built in 1871–1872. The abandoned motel was demolished in 2007–2008 to expand the Parade Ground. On the southern part of Governors Island was building 785, which included a fast-food restaurant and a bowling alley. Building 902 houses several FDNY fire protection vehicles.

=== Monuments ===
The Monumental Setting for Bronze Plaque, a brick monumental bench with stone trim between buildings 406 and 407, was built by the WPA in 1938. The Early Birds Monument, originally dedicated in 1954 south of Liggett Hall, is a bronze cast of a Wright Brothers&#x27; plane&#x27;s propeller on a granite base that commemorates early aviation on the island.

== Operations ==
=== Management ===

Three organizations work in partnership to maintain the island: the National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy, the Trust for Governors Island, and Friends of Governors Island.

====National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy====
The National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, is responsible for managing the that comprise the Governors Island National Monument. It works with the National Parks of New York Harbor (a branch of the National Park Service) in a public-private partnership, and is the official nonprofit partner for the National Parks of New York Harbor. The Conservancy was founded in 2003 because the NPS is legally prohibited from operating its own business ventures. The National Park Service owns and operates the monument itself.

==== Trust for Governors Island ====
The Trust for Governors Island, legally the Governors Island Corporation, is a nonprofit organization of the city government that is responsible for managing the redevelopment for the rest of the island. Its predecessor, the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC), was founded in 2003, when Governors Island was sold to the public. At the time, GIPEC was a partnership between the city and the state. In April 2010, the city entered an agreement to take full control of the island&#x27;s development from the state of New York. GIPEC was then dissolved and superseded by the Trust for Governors Island.

The Trust is charged with the planning, redevelopment, and ongoing operations of the that are not part of the national monument. The organization is also responsible for coordinating public art displays on the island. The Trust&#x27;s first artistic curator, Meredith Johnson, was hired in 2016. In 2024, Lauren Haynes was appointed as the Trust&#x27;s head curator.

==== Friends of Governors Island ====
The Friends of Governors Island is the private nonprofit organization that manages the island&#x27;s operations and programming. It was founded as the Governors Island Alliance in 1995, following the Coast Guard&#x27;s decision to vacate the island. The Alliance and its 50 member organizations led a campaign to return the island to New York for public purposes. Since 2014 the Alliance has been an independent non-profit, and in 2016 it was renamed Friends of Governors Island. The Friends run volunteer and membership programs, raise money and perform advocacy for the island.

=== Working dogs ===
Governors Island employs working dogs to chase the Canada geese off of the island. The working dogs provide a humane geese dispersal method for the super flocks of Canada geese that migrate through the New York Harbor. Before the dog program started in 2015, attempts to use R/C cars, strobe lights, and a special laser to chase the geese all failed. Chasing the geese from the island helps avoid the large amount of bird droppings they leave behind, as well as mitigates their aggressive nature. Keeping the super-flocks off the island helps protect both other bird species and park visitors, as Canada geese are known to be hostile during nesting season. The Working Dogs program began in January 2015 when Jim Reed, Director of Park and Public Space, adopted Max, a Border Collie who came from a failed career as a farm dog.

 the Governors Island working dog team is composed of four dogs. A Border Collie named Quinn was added to the team of working dogs in 2017, followed by a Border Collie named Chip in mid-2018 and a mini Aussie named Aspen in late 2018. The dogs are popular on social media with a growing following. In addition to their duties chasing geese, the dogs serve as ambassadors to Governors Island guests.

=== Cannonball removal ===
The majority of cannonballs and shells from the island&#x27;s military history had already been removed by the 21st century. In 1900, the government sold 5,635 tons of cannonballs to an iron dealer who intended on smelting the iron in order to build trains and other machinery. More were sold in 1942 and smelted down to support World War II manufacturing efforts. Cannonballs continue to be found: for example, a 350-pound cannonball was found near Soissons Landing in 2012 and deemed to not be at risk of explosion. Inactivated cannonballs are available for viewing near Fort Jay.

== Activities ==

Activities on the island include free National Park Service tours of the National Monument, bike riding, picnicking, art installations, fairs, festivals, and concerts. The northern half contains Governors Island National Monument as well as the Governors Island Historic District. The southern half contains the 43-acre park constructed and operated by the Trust for Governors Island.

=== Recurring activities ===
Various free activities are offered on Governors Island. The houses around Nolan Park and Colonels row host arts, culture and educational exhibits during typical public seasons. Downtown Boathouse has offered free kayaking classes at Pier 101. In addition, there are several NPS-operated walking tours and self-guided tours of Governors Island&#x27;s historic landmarks. Other public programs and exhibits are available, including an adventure playground operated by called The Yard, as well as a compost site run by Earth Matter called the Compost Learning Center and a functioning urban farm, the Teaching Garden, run by GrowNYC. The American Indian Community House, a non-profit that works to improve the well-being of the American Indian community and increase visibility of the community&#x27;s culture, uses the Admiral&#x27;s House to present exhibitions, performances, and other cultural and educational programs.

Some activities require additional fees. QC NY, an Italian-based day spa spanning two buildings on the north side of the island, contains a courtyard with heated pools and lawn chairs overlooking Manhattan; it offers personal treatments in addition to its saunas. Collective Retreats, a glamorous camping or &quot;glamping&quot; retreat, allows its guests to use the island three hours before the island opens to the general public each day, and several tiers of accommodations and activities are provided at progressively higher prices. Though Collective Retreats can accommodate about 70 campers per night, there are no full-time residents on the island . For travel throughout the island, Blazing Saddles rents out bikes and pedicabs, and there are also three Citi Bike bike-sharing stations on the island.

=== Events ===

Many events take place on Governors Island during a typical public season including outdoor films, food and art festivals, runs, concerts, and a pumpkin patch in October. The Trust for Governors Island operates a program called Governors Island Arts, in which art and public programs are presented on the island. Several organizations-in-residence are selected every year to present activities on Governors Island. Since 2010, Governors Island Arts has operated Organizations in Residence, an artist-in-residence program on the island, every year. The New York City Poetry Festival is also hosted annually on the island, as is the Ice Sculpture Show.

Concerts have also taken place on the island. For instance, the Rite of Summer Festival, a series of free concerts, has been held on the island throughout the summer since 2011. The Jazz Age Lawn Party, a two-day-long Prohibition-era cosplay event, is also hosted on the island. In September 2019, the Longines Global Champions Tour, a globe-traveling equestrian jumping league, made its New York debut on Governors Island.

Past attractions have included a Dutch festival called Goverthing in 2009, as well as a French carnival in 2013 that contained 19th- and 20th-century rides. Several previous large concerts have also been held on Governors Island. These include the inaugural Governors Ball Music Festival in 2011, though it moved to Randalls Island for subsequent seasons. Governors Island Art Fair, run by the art collective 4heads, took place annually on the island from 2008 to 2023. Originally located in buildings on Colonel&#x27;s Row, the event has also hosted artists in Castle Williams and Fort Jay.

==Public access==
, Governors Island is open year-round, operating from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. seven days a week. Until 2015, Governors Island was publicly accessible only on summer weekends and was rarely open during nighttime except during concerts. From 2015 to 2020, the island was open seven days a week, but only from May through October.

=== History ===
The first public boat service to Governors Island was instituted in 1794, when John Hillyer was given a franchise to operate a rowboat line to the island, collecting a fare of three cents per person. The Army took over the franchise as passenger traffic grew, operating barges from South Ferry or the Battery in Manhattan. The first recorded port of departure at the Battery, located south of what is now Castle Clinton, opened in 1854. At that point, there were two barges that each had a maximum capacity of 12 people. Test runs of steamboat service started in 1844, and they supplanted the former open-barges by 1879. Many of the passengers were employees at the New York Armory on Governors Island. By 1879, an &quot;ugly little tug&quot; that charged 15-cent fares for travel to the island was replaced with a steamboat.

Around 1897, it was announced that the ferry service would be overhauled to accommodate the expanded Army presence on the island. Three new ferryboats with capacity of 823 passengers and 21 cars were added in 1925–1929. Two of these were replaced in 1956 with larger vessels that could hold 1,100 passengers and 32 cars.

Public ferry access from Manhattan started in 2005; at the time, the ferry was free on weekends. Starting in 2010, weekend ferry service commenced between Governors Island and Brooklyn Bridge Park&#x27;s Pier 6 at Atlantic Avenue. In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of NYC Ferry&#x27;s East River route. A new 400-person vessel named &quot;Governors 1&quot; as delivered in 2019 in anticipation of large crowds, supplementing the existing vessel &quot;Lt. Samuel Coursen&quot;. The same year, NYC Ferry added a weekend-only shuttle from Pier 11/Wall Street to Governors Island, replacing the East River and South Brooklyn service to the island. In December 2023, the federal government awarded $7.5 million for the construction of electric charging equipment for the Governors Island Ferry fleet.

=== Current services ===

Governors Island has two ferry landings: Soissons Landing and Yankee Pier. Soissons Landing, located at the northern shore of the island, contains two slips. The current cast-iron piers of Soissons Landing were built in 1947 and commemorate the Battle of Soissons during World War I, during which over half of the 16th Regiment were killed. Building 148, a brick waiting room built in 1917, is located directly to the west. Ferries travel from here to Slip 7 at the Battery Maritime Building, located adjacent to the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. The ride is about 7 minutes long. These ferries are operated by HMS Ferries for The Trust for Governors Island and operate daily when the island is open.

Ferries also operate to Yankee Pier on the southeastern side of the island, which is served by two ferry routes. One route is operated by HMS Ferries for The Trust on weekends and travels to Red Hook (though it traveled to Pier 6 of Brooklyn Bridge Park prior to 2020). The second route is the Governors Island route operated by NYC Ferry; during summer weekends, the route travels to Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District, where it meets the other six NYC Ferry routes. Starting in November 2021, NYC Ferry has run the South Brooklyn route from Yankee Pier during the winter and on summer weekdays. The South Brooklyn route travels to Red Hook; Piers 1 and 6 of Brooklyn Bridge Park; Pier 11/Wall Street; and Corlears Hook in Manhattan.

Ferries operated by the Trust run half-hourly. , the Trust charges a round-trip fare of $5; children, seniors, and certain groups of adults ride for free, and no fare is charged during weekend mornings. While the ferry to Manhattan runs seven days a week, the ferry to Brooklyn runs only on weekends. NYC Ferry services run half-hourly and charge a separate fare from the Trust&#x27;s ferries.

The main ferryboat operated by the Trust is the &quot;Samuel S. Coursen&quot;, a passenger and vehicular ferry built for the Army in 1956 and named for soldier Samuel S. Coursen. A second vessel, &quot;Governors 1&quot;, entered service in 2019; it can carry 400 passengers and can travel at up to . , the Trust is replacing the &quot;Coursen&quot; with a battery-electric vessel carrying up to 1,200 people.

<text>Richard Clayderman (; born Philippe Pagès , 28 December 1953 in Paris) is a French pianist who has released numerous albums including the compositions of Paul de Senneville, Olivier Toussaint and Marc Minier, instrumental renditions of popular music, rearrangements of movie soundtracks, ethnic music, and easy-listening arrangements of popular works of classical music.

==Early life==
Clayderman learned piano from his father, an accordion teacher.

At the age of twelve, he was accepted into the Conservatoire de Paris, where he won great acclaim in his later adolescent years. Financial difficulties, precipitated by his father&#x27;s illness, forestalled a promising career as a classical pianist. In order to earn a living, he found work as a bank clerk and as an accompanist to contemporary bands. He accompanied French singers such as Johnny Hallyday, Thierry Le Luron, and Michel Sardou.

==&quot;Ballade pour Adeline&quot;==

In 1976, he was invited by Olivier Toussaint, a French record producer, and his partner Paul de Senneville, to record a gentle piano ballad. De Senneville had composed this ballad as a tribute to his baby daughter, Adeline. The 23-year-old Pagès was auditioned along with 20 other pianists and got the job. &quot;He was an interesting musician with a soft touch and good technique&quot;, said Toussaint. &quot;And he looked good, too.&quot;

His producers felt that his name would be difficult to pronounce in Spanish, German, etc. so they picked Clayderman on finding it was a great-grandmother&#x27;s last name and invented the name Richard as they didn&#x27;t like Philippe Clayderman. The single took off, selling 22 million copies in 38 countries. It was called &quot;Ballade pour Adeline&quot;. This work was one of the most popular pieces in China, especially during the initial years of China&#x27;s opening to the West, when it was ubiquitous and played in almost every hotel lobby in China, and it continues to be popular in China today. 

==Success==
Clayderman has recorded over 1,300 melodies and has created a new romantic style through a repertoire which combines his trademark originals with classics and pop standards. As of 2006, his record sales number at approximately 70 million, and has 267 gold and 70 platinum albums to his credit. He is popular in Asia and is noted by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as being &quot;the most successful pianist in the world&quot;.

<doc id="458439" wikidata="Q6679245" url="?curid=458439" title="Lord Forbes">
<text>Lord Forbes is the senior Lordship of Parliament in the Peerage of Scotland.

The title was created sometime after 1436 for Alexander de Forbes, feudal baron of Forbes. The precise date of the creation is not known, but in a Precept dated July 12, 1442, he is already styled Lord Forbes. Brown&#x27;s 1834 &quot;Peerage of Scotland&quot; gives a creation year of 1440. Alexander&#x27;s descendant, the twelfth Lord, served as Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and Kincardineshire. His great-grandson, the seventeenth Lord, was a general in the Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1806 to 1843. His son, the eighteenth Lord, fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

He was succeeded by his son, the nineteenth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1874 to 1906. His nephew, the twenty-first Lord, served as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1917 and 1924. The latter&#x27;s son, the twenty-second Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1955 to 1963, when all Scottish peers were given an automatic seat in the House of Lords, and served in the Conservative administration of Harold Macmillan as Minister of State for Scotland from 1958 to 1959. The title is currently held by his son, Malcolm Nigel, the twenty-third Lord Forbes, who succeeded in 2013. Lord Forbes is Chief of Clan Forbes.

Hon. Patrick Forbes, third son of the second Lord Forbes, was the ancestor of both the Earls of Granard and the Forbes baronets of Craigievar. Also, the Lords Forbes of Pitsligo were descended from Sir William Forbes, brother of Alexander Forbes, 1st Lord Forbes.

The family seat is Castle Forbes near Alford, Aberdeenshire. 

== Numbering matter ==

John Forbes (1570–1606), the elder surviving son of John Forbes, 8th Lord Forbes, became a friar and seemingly abandoned his claim to the Lordship. He died later in the same year (1606) as his father and there would be dispute over whether to count his brief succession in the numbering of Lordships. The question was most recently () settled in 1955, stating that he was not to be considered a Lord Forbes and his younger brother would be their father&#x27;s immediate successor as Arthur Forbes, 9th Lord Forbes.

<text>The &#x27; (; ), officially known as the &#x27; (&quot;313th Acrobatic Training Group, National Aerobatic Team (PAN) Frecce Tricolori&quot;), is the aerobatic demonstration team of the Italian Air Force. Based at Rivolto Air Base, province of Udine, it was created on 1 March 1961 as a permanent group for the training of Air Force pilots in air acrobatics.

The Tricolour Arrows replaced unofficial teams that had been sponsored by various commands starting in the early 1930s. The team flies the Aermacchi MB-339-A/PAN, a two-seat fighter-trainer craft capable of 898 km/h at sea level. With ten aircraft, nine in close formation and a soloist, they are the world&#x27;s largest acrobatics patrol, and their flight schedule, comprising about twenty acrobatics and about half an hour, makes them the most famous in the world. It is one of national symbols of Italy. On 28 August 1988 the Frecce Tricolori caused the Ramstein air show disaster, one of the worst air show disasters in history, in which 67 spectators and three pilots died and 346 spectators sustained serious injuries.

==History==
===Previous patrols===
In Italy the first acrobatic flight school was founded in 1930 at the Udine-Campoformido Airport on the initiative of Colonel Rino Corso Fougier, commander of the 1st Fighter Wing: the first formation consisted of five Fiat C.R.20 and already on 8 June 1930 at first air show, called &quot;Wing Day&quot;, these planes performed in a &quot;bomb&quot;, a figure similar to the current bomb.

In the years before the World War II the patrol of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; participated in various events (to note is that in 1932 Breda Ba.19 was used, in 1934 Fiat CR.30 and from 1936 Fiat CR.32), among which in 1938 the inauguration of the Milan-Linate Airport during which the Chief Patrol was Bruno Sartori, Silver Medal of Military Valor.

After the inevitable parenthesis of the 1939-1945 period the acrobatic patrol was dissolved and reformed after the war, even if not officially classified as an acrobatic patrol. It was in fact the 51st Fighter Wing, equipped with US P-51D Mustang and British Spitfire Mk.IX aircraft, the first to perform with three Spitfires at Padua Airport in September 1947. The enthusiasm of these pilots was soon followed by some of their colleagues of the 5th Wing, which formed another aerobatic team based on Spitfire aircraft.

In 1950 a patrol called &quot;Cavallino Rampante&quot; (Prancing Horse) formed, consisting of four pilots of the 4th Wing equipped with D.H.100 Vampire aircraft. In parallel with this department, in 1953 the &quot;Guizzo&quot; (Wriggle) was established, coming from the 5th Wing and operating on F-84G Thunderjet aircraft. This unit participated by gaining considerable success at various shows throughout Europe, thanks also to the return of the acrobatic manoeuvre called &quot;bomb&quot;: the four pilots at the top of a looping in formation swooped down in opposite directions, calling the plane only near the ground. The notoriety of Guizzo grew to such an extent that in 1955 he was given a film called &quot;The four of the thundering jet&quot; (in honour of the Thunderjet), and it was thanks to this film that the department officially changed its name to &quot;Getti Tonanti&quot; (Thundering Jets), continuing to perform until 1956, when they were replaced by the &quot;Tigri Bianche&quot; (White Tigers) of the 51st Fighter Wing, always mounted on F-84G.

After a successful year, this new acrobatic team gave way to the reborn &quot;Cavallino Rampante&quot; and its new F-86E Saber, which will begin operations on May 19, 1957 at the Turin Airport, reaching its peak with the exhibition at the international exhibition of aeronautics and space in Paris Air Show. Many artistic victories also derived from the fact that, for the first time in Italy, a white smoke generator was used, with which the acrobatic figures were particularly highlighted. 1957 also saw the entry into the scene of two new acrobatic departments: the &quot;Diavoli Rossi&quot; (Red Devils) and the &quot;Lanceri Neri&quot; (Black Lancers). The former were on staff at the 6th Fighter Wing, and with their F-84F Thunderstreak they achieved a great consensus among the population, as shown by their tour in the United States of America; the latter instead came from the 2nd Aerobrigata, demonstrating, with the help of the F-86E, great operational ability, which led them to fly also in Iran in 1959 in the presence of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

In 1959 the Getti Tonanti line-up equipped with F-84F was also reconstituted, whose livery will be modified in 1960 with the five circles of the Olympic flag on the occasion of the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome.

===Birth of the Frecce Tricolori===
Towards the end of 1960, it was decided to end this shifting between the various flocks and to found a department whose specific purpose was to form the national aerobatic team, selecting the best pilots of the various departments.

Major Mario Squarcina, leader of the &quot;Diavoli Rossi&quot; was thus commissioned by the General Staff of the Italian Air Force to establish the &quot;Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale&quot; (National Aerobatic Patrol) composed of pilots from all the Air Force departments. The 313th Aerobatic Training Group was founded on 1 March 1961 at the Rivolto Air Base. On the same day, 6 North American F-86 Sabers of the 4th Air Brigade took off from Grosseto to Rivolto. On 1 May 1961 the first official release of the &quot;Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale&quot; (P.A.N.) with the high program of 4 + 1 F86 Saber on the airport of Trento - Gardolo, on the occasion of the Air Show of the local Aero Club. Three days later, on May 3, there was an incident in a flight, during which a pilot died.
The flew on North American F-86 Sabre until 1963. The staff, initially not as numerous as today, was enlarged in 1963 to nine elements plus the soloist, adding the possibility of using coloured fumes. The following year the Fiat G.91PAN fighter-bombers arrived, then moved to the current Aermacchi MB-339 A/PAN MLU in 1982.

On 28 August 1988, the PAN was the protagonist of the Ramstein air show disaster, one of the worst air show disasters in history, in which 67 spectators and three pilots died and 346 spectators sustained serious injuries. Two of the three dead pilots, Mario Naldini and Ivo Nutarelli, were supposed to testify at the trial for the Itavia Flight 870 a few days later. This was the cause of various suspicions and conspiracy theories about what happened that day.

In 2000 they reached 50,000 flying hours on the Aermacchi MB-339.

In 2005 they won the award for best exhibition at the Royal International Air Tattoo at Fairford, England. They were the first non-Russian unit to receive the Russian Silver Medal for Aeronautical Merit. On 8 September 2007 the took part at the funeral of Luciano Pavarotti in Modena and honoured him with a fly-past leaving green-white-red smoke trails.

The replacement (scheduled for 2017) of the MB-339PAN with Alenia Aermacchi M.345 HET (High-Efficiency Trainer), announced in 2013, was blocked in 2014, reconfirmed in 2016 with entry into service scheduled for 2020; however, as of 2024 the team was still flying the MB-339PAN.

On 12 September 2024, the Italian Air Force announced that Frecce Tricolori would use Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master as their new aircraft. 

==Description==
===Aircraft features===
The livery of the Aermacchi MB-339 used by the Group is given by the characteristic tricolour band that crosses the side of the plane against a savoy blue background. The airplane&#x27;s abdomen is light gray while the formation numbers are yellow stickers. For the classic Aermacchi MB-339 A under the Italian Air Force the wingtip tanks were removed for two reasons:

#penalize the acrobatic performance of the aircraft, in particular, the fast tonneaux due to a considerable mass placed far from the axis of rotation;
#would make it more difficult to maintain tight formation during acrobatic manoeuvres, partially inhibiting the view of the aircraft next to which one is flying and thus depriving the &quot;gregari&quot; of precise reference points for maintaining the position.

Mixed subalary tanks are thus created, containing both vaseline oil for fumes and a certain amount of fuel to partially compensate for the reduction in autonomy caused by the removal of wingtip tanks. Larger subalar fuel tanks (pylon tanks), already provided for at the origin, can be installed on the external subaltern pylons for long-range transfer flights. On the occasion of the first cruise in USA-Canada (1986), special cylindrical tip tanks were set up, with a capacity much higher than that of the original elliptical tip-tank. These cylindrical tip tanks, added to the nylon tanks, provide adequate autonomy for large stops in the North Atlantic, allowing even a digression on a possible diversion airport.

The coloured smoke is generated by dispersion, and is composed of vaseline oil to which non-polluting pigments are added. The escape of this compound occurs through a small tube placed in the rear exhaust of the plane.

===Formation===
During the performances, the formation of the acrobatic patrol is usually composed of 9 aircraft, called &quot;Pony&quot;, each labelled with a number ranging from 1 to 10. The name &quot;Pony&quot; was coined by the then Captain Zeno Tascio to remember the horse of Francesco Baracca which is the sign of the 4th Wing, at the time 4th Airbase who was already preparing to take over the task PAN for the 1961. Depending on the needs of the Department, aircraft can also be 11 in total, thus including the figure of the acrobatic training manager.
* Pony 0 - Commander
* Pony 1 - Head of Formation
* Pony 2 - 1° Left Domestique 
* Pony 3 - 1° Right Domestique 
* Pony 4 - 2° Left Domestique 
* Pony 5 - 2° Right Domestique 
* Pony 6 - 1° Tail light
* Pony 7 - 3° Left Domestique 
* Pony 8 - 3° Right Domestique 
* Pony 9 - 2° Tail light
* Pony 10 - Soloist
* Pony 11 - Acrobatic Training Supervisor
* Pony 12 - Pilot in Training
* Pony 13 - Pilot in Training
* Pony 14 - Pilot in Training
* Pony 15 - Pilot in Training
* Pony 16 - Pilot in Training

==Flight programs and pilot selection==
The have three programs for performing acrobatics: high, low, and flat, depending on the weather conditions and the characteristics of the exhibition area. The high program is chosen when the cloud base is above 1,000 m and is characterized by the execution of the acrobatic figures entirely on the vertical plane; the low program is preferred instead when the clouds do not exceed 500 – 600 m and vertical manoeuvres are not carried out (such as looping or the bomb); finally, the flat variant includes low-level formation manoeuvres.

For several years, when possible, the PAN performances have ended with the complete line-up drawing a five km long flag of Italy in the sky while from the floor speakers, the voice of Luciano Pavarotti intones the finale of &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; for the entire duration of the passage. The first realization of this manoeuvre took place in Pratica di Mare ( of Pomezia) during the farewell ceremony at the F-104 Starfighter and this earned the the world record for the longest national flag ever made. Also for this reason, on September 8, 2007, hurtling through the Modena sky, the paid tribute to Pavarotti whose funeral he had just held.

Only the best pilots have access to the : each year one or two of them are chosen strictly among those who have more than 1,000 flight hours, and once they have entered they must follow a gradual insertion training program.

<text>Contact Improvisation (CI) is a postmodern dance practice that explores movement through shared weight, touch, and physical awareness. Originating in the United States in 1972, contact improvisation was developed by dancer and choreographer Steve Paxton, drawing on influences from modern dance, aikido, and somatic practices. Contact Improvisation emphasizes the interplay of gravity, momentum, and improvisation, fostering an experimental approach to movement that invites both professional dancers and newcomers into its global community.

The practice involves continuous physical touch between dancers, where gravity, momentum, inertia, and friction shape their interactions.

The dance is further described by Paxton:

&quot;The exigencies of the form dictate a mode of movement which is relaxed, constantly aware and prepared, and onflowing&quot;.

Known for its open &quot;jams,&quot; contact improvisation is both a social dance and a tool for movement research, offering a unique blend of physicality and mindfulness. Formally, contact improvisation is a movement improvisation that is explored with another being. According to one of its first practitioners, Nancy Stark Smith, it &quot;resembles other familiar duet forms, such as the embrace, wrestling, surfing, martial arts, and the Jitterbug, encompassing a wide range of movement from stillness to highly athletic.&quot;

Contact improvisation has evolved into various formats, including performance art, experimental dance, and education. Figures like Nancy Stark Smith, Lisa Nelson, and Nita Little played significant roles in broadening its influence, integrating the practice into postmodern dance traditions and contemporary performance studies.

==History of contact improvisation==

=== From &quot;Magnesium&quot; to &quot;Contact Improvisations&quot; ===
Contact improvisation was developed in the United States in the 1970s by a group of dancers and athletes gathered under the guidance of choreographer and dancer Steve Paxton.

In January 1972, Steve Paxton was in residence at Oberlin College during a tour with Grand Union, a collective where he collaborated with other prominent figures in postmodern dance, including Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown. For several weeks, he offered Oberlin students two sets of practices:
# every morning at dawn, a &quot;soft class&quot; involving an exploration that he soon called the &quot;small dance,&quot; a form of meditation that is practiced standing, where attention is paid to postural adjustments and micro-weight transfers;
# and later in the day, rehearsals for a performance that he transmitted to a group of young men and whose score is to explore the extremes of movement and disorientation, from standing still to falling, rolling, colliding, and jumping in the air. For these rehearsals, Steve Paxton relied on his training in modern dance (he had danced in the companies of José Limón and Merce Cunningham), in aikido and in gymnastics.
The combination of these practices culminated in &quot;Magnesium&quot;, a twenty-minute performance in which dancers performed on gym mats. The piece involved jumping, bumping into each other, manipulating, and clinging to one another. Paxton described the movements as using &quot;the body as a whole, where all parts are simultaneously unbalanced or thrown against another body or into the air&quot;. After about fifteen minutes, the dancers stop and start a &quot;Small Dance&quot; that concludes the performance.

In the Spring of 1972, Steve Paxton received a grant from Change, Inc which allowed him to invite dancers to work on the form he was evolving. He invited some colleagues from the Judson Dance Theater years like Barbara Dilley and Nancy Topf, release technique pioneer Mary Fulkerson, as well as students met during his teaching tours, including Nancy Stark Smith and Curt Siddall (from Oberlin College), Danny Lepkoff and David Woodberry (from the University of Rochester, where Mary Fulkerson was a teacher) and Nita Little (from Bennington College).

At the end of this residency, the group presented a performance that Paxton named &quot;Contact Improvisations&quot;. The performance took the form of a continuous afternoon practice over five days at the John Weber Gallery in Manhattan. Spectators were free to come and go as the dancers practiced, alongside a concurrent film screening of George Manupelli&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Chicago&quot;.

=== Expansion Across Regions ===

==== In North America ====

===== Styles =====
Following the first performance of &quot;Contact Improvisations&quot; in New York in 1972, the participants scattered to different parts of the United States but soon began to teach the practice. The syncopated, risky, raw and awkward style of the first performances gave place rather quickly to a variety of aesthetics within the form.

One of those aesthetics was the development of smooth, continuous, controlled flow of quality in the late 1970s and early 1980s, running parallel with the opposite trend of interest in conflict and unexpected responses, including previously avoided eye contact and direct hand contact. Says Nancy Stark Smith,

Within the study of Contact Improvisation, the experience of flow was soon recognized and highlighted in our dancing. It became one of my favorite practices and I proceeded to &quot;do flow&quot; for many years-challenging it, testing it: could we flow through &quot;this&quot; pass? Could we squeak through &quot;that&quot; one, and keep going?

Regardless of those aesthetic choices, the central characteristic of contact improvisation remains a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements. One of the founders of the form, Daniel Lepkoff, comments that the “precedence of body experience first, and mindful cognition second, is an essential distinction between Contact Improvisation and other approaches to dance.” Another source affirms that the practice of contact improvisation involves “mindfulness, sensing and collecting information” as its core.

===== Languaging and observing =====

In 1975, the dancers working with Steve Paxton considered trademarking the term contact improvisation in order to control the teaching and practice of the dance form, consequently for reasons of safety. This idea was rejected in favor of establishing a forum for communication: this became the &quot;Contact Newsletter&quot; founded by Nancy Stark Smith, which evolved into the bi-annual journal &quot;Contact Quarterly&quot; which continues to be published online by the non-profit Contact Collaborations (incorporated in 1978) after a final print edition came out in January 2020. The journal, now co-edited by Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson, brings together different reflections of contact improvisation teachers and practitioners and cements an international community by equipping it with a communication organ, as well as hosting several other orders of reflections, including writings by contemporary dancers and somatic practitioners. According to the magazine&#x27;s statement,&quot;Contact Quarterly&quot; is the longest living, independent, artist-made, not-for-profit, reader-supported magazine devoted to the dancer&#x27;s voice. Founded in 1975, &quot;Contact Quarterly&quot; (CQ) began as a forum for discussion of the emerging dance form Contact Improvisation. Serving as a meeting ground for a worldwide network of contact improvisers, &quot;CQ&quot;quickly grew to include writings and interviews on postmodern and contemporary experimental dance, somatic movement practices, improvisational dance, mixed-abilities dance, teaching methods, creative process, and performance.While the development of contact improvisation has benefited greatly from Nancy Stark Smith and Lisa Nelson&#x27;s editorial work to support the writings of dancers in their exploration of the form, it also owes much to the cameras of Steve Christiansen and then Lisa Nelson, who documented many moments of the work (especially in performance) and allow the contactors to observe themselves with meticulousness.

===== Development of art-sport =====
Since the mid-1970s, regular jams are present in most major cities in North America (New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Montreal). Other multi-day residential spaces (such as the Breitenbush Jam, which has existed since 1981) have been in existence since the late 1970s. Remembers dancer Mark Pritchard,

The 1979 Country Jam was a first of its kind in the Contact world: over fifty people from the western United States and Canada came together for twelve days of non-structured existence, life and dance: neither a workshop, a conference or a seminar, but an improvisational gathering, with the sole aim of creating a space for dancing and living in flux... Our days were without structure, except for meals: at the beginning, we planned to keep 90-minute slots for the courses, but the idea was quickly abandoned thanks to a system based on Supply and demand, in which each could suggest a topic to be dealt with and offer to lead a class. These residential events (workshops, festivals, long jams) represent a parallel economy that invited the creation of dedicated spaces of practice, the model of which was provided very early by Earthdance, a residential center built in 1986 by a Boston community of dancers.

==== In Europe ====
In Europe, contact improvisation was presented for the first time in 1973 (from June 25 to 28th) in an art gallery in Rome, L&#x27;Attico run by Fabio Sargentini. In the 1970s and 1980s, Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson were regularly invited to the Dartington College of Arts in Great Britain (where early contacter Mary Fulkerson was part of the dance faculty) and the School for New Dance Development in Amsterdam, which served as transmission belts for contact improvisation in Europe.

Nancy Stark Smith was key to the organization of the first European Contact Improvisation Teachers Exchange. Subsequent exchanges have been organized since 1985 and hosted each year by a different European country.

Belgian dancer and choreographer Patricia Kuypers noted in 1999 that, depending on the country and the individual, it has spread more or less rapidly in the world of dance or amateurs. In Belgium, where Steve Paxton had come since the 1980s, invited by the Klapstuk and the Kaaitheater, few professional dancers regularly practiced it, and apart from certain outbreaks of fever in successful jams, it can not be said that contact improvisation left any lasting trace among professional dancers, except in a choreographed form.

===== In France =====

In France, contact improvisation (sometimes called &quot;danse-contact&quot;, as in French-speaking Canada) was introduced for the first time in 1978, where a contact improvisation course was given by Steve Paxton and Lisa Nelson during the musical festivities of Sainte Beaume:Didier Silhol, Mark Tompkins, Suzanne Cotto, Edith Veyron and Martine Muffat-Joly attended. Their enthusiasm brought them together, to explore together this new form of dance, to organize new courses by bringing back Steve Paxton, Lisa Nelson and by inviting other teachers such as Nancy Stark Smith. In 1980, they created the association Danse Contact Improvisation and began to teach themselves, mostly in pairs.Contact improvisation is now practiced in most major cities of the French metropolis - Paris, Grenoble, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Lille, Rennes all have at least one weekly jam - and is taught in many conservatories, including the National Conservatory of Music and Dance of Paris.

==== In the world ====
The network of social practices or amateurs of contact improvisation has spread to all the continents except Antarctica, with a particularly intense presence in the Americas, Western and Eastern Europe, Finland, Russia, Israel, Japan, Taïwan, Australia, India, China and Malaysia, as evidenced by the regularity of the jams, festivals and weekly courses taught in these countries.

== Principles and techniques ==

=== Interior techniques ===

Contact Improvisation involves technical aspects or &quot;moves&quot; that support the duets and create a recognizable style of movements: shoulder and hip lifts, head-to-head improvisation, table-top position (being on all fours, supporting the weight of the partner on the back), surfing (rolling on the floor, being &quot;surfed by&quot; the partner), and aikido rolls.

But these are conceived of as the means to an end, which can be described as the dialogue of sensations of weight and touch between partners:The body in [contact improvisation] is accordingly not merely a physical body whose weight and momentum are subject to natural laws of gravity and motion, but a responsive, experiencing body. Here it must be emphasized that despite the use of the term “inward focus” in Novack’s account, the cultivation of kinaesthetic awareness cannot be equated with an “introspective” preoccupation with private sensations; rather, the accent lies on sensing-through the responsive body, combining both “internal awareness” and “responsiveness to another”.Steve Paxton insisted on this aspect with the concept of &quot;interior techniques&quot; involving in the dance practice a training of perception, resting on investigations based on the sciences of the senses (physiology, experimental and ecological psychology, anatomy, and behaviour sciences).

Lisa Nelson, in that regard, occupied a special place in the effervescence of the development of contact improvisation. Taking distance from the dance, she watched a lot through the eye of the camera and pursued personal research on the collaboration between the senses, in particular on the organization of kinaesthesia in relation to the way in which vision works (a practice later known as the &quot;Tuning Scores&quot;). As Patricia Kuypers remarked, &quot;her staggered gaze nourished the maturation of the [contact improvisation], developing analysis of the perceptual system and revealing specific questions about how improvisation works.&quot;

=== Round robin ===

The &quot;round robin&quot; is the most frequent structure of performances, this happens where small groups of dancers arrive in the center of a supporting circle of other dancers, who can at any time integrate the couples and replace one of the two dancers. Dancers are dressed casually (sweat pants, T-shirts) and performances can happen in many venues, including theaters, bookstores, galleries. The duration of the concerts can go from 20 minutes to 6 hours.

Central to the poetics of the form is a desire to create a non-hierarchical way of developing the movement, based on the simple exchange of weight and touch between partners improvising together. This stance has been argued to reflect the counter-cultural context in which contact improvisation was developed (aftermath of the 1960s Vietnam War and Hippie movement).

=== Underscore ===

In the 1990s, Nancy Stark Smith, one of the most active propagators of contact improvisation and editor of &quot;Contact Quarterly&quot;, developed a practice out of her teachings called &quot;the underscore.&quot; It consisted of a score serving as a descriptive and prescriptive base for the practice of group improvisations. In this practice, vocabulary is tailored to fit the specific experiences of dancers and benefits from Nancy Stark Smith enmeshment with contact improvisation.As a teacher of contact improvisation, she had observed that particular warm-up exercises and movement activities were helpful in bringing dancers to a state of body-mind preparedness for engaging in a Contact duet. The Underscore is a scored collection of those exercises and activities, complete with pictographs that represent each phase and subphase of its progression.Some moments of the practice clearly refer to activities explored in the practice of contact improvisation:
* &quot;Bonding with the earth&quot; thus refers (in part) to the experience of the &quot;Small Dance&quot;
* &quot;Engagement&quot; to the commitment that can be involved in a contact improvisation duet
* &quot;Skinesphere&quot;, the space beneath the skin (as opposed to the kinesphere, which is the space surrounding the body), refers to the inward focus involved in some somatic preparations for the practice of contact improvisation.

==Spaces of practice ==

=== Universities ===
In June 1980, Elizabeth Zimmer, organizer and director of the American Dance Guild, put together the conference Improvisation: Dance Considered as Art-Sport. The conference was mainly dedicated to contact improvisation, which had been referred to as an &quot;art-sport&quot; a few years earlier by Simone Forti, and introduced contact improvisation in the American academic world. Contact improvisation is now taught in a majority of American universities offering a choreographic curriculum (New York University, Oberlin College, Bennington College, Smith College, Ohio State University) as well as in many contemporary dance festivals (Jacob&#x27;s Pillow, Bates Dance Festival).
=== Jams ===
In the mid-1970s, the term &quot;jam&quot; appeared to describe, like jazz jam sessions and milongas in tango, an opportunity for free practice where dancers who do not know each other can meet and negotiate together their dance or observe the practice of their partners.Every week in dozens of cities that make up an international network, members of this Contact Improvisation &quot;community of experience&quot; meet for a few hours in a dance studio for a jam. This hybrid practice seems to me to work halfway between a bodily meditation, a psycho-kinesthetic therapy, a sports training, and a dance improvised session.

Jams also occur at multi-day residential courses led by a dancer or a group of dancers at conferences or festivals, where the days can alternate between free practices, courses by guest artists, and debates regularly bring practitioners together.

==== Inclusion ====
Some have argued that this relaxed space of practice favoured contact improvisation&#x27;s inclusivity towards disabled movers:Unlike a structured workshop or a performance, the Contact jam setting allows for open-ended dancing, a mode particularly conducive to dancers with different abilities. For one thing, it is a lot easier to rest or stop and talk with your partner... More than any other genre of dance, Contact Improvisation has nurtured and embraced dancing that can integrate multiple abilities and limitations. In fact, many of the most renowned nondisabled Contact practitioners (including Steve Paxton), spend a lot of time teaching, facilitating and dancing with disabled communities.

==== Sexual harassment ====
Women have expressed feeling uncomfortable on the dance floor and in the community, especially with men who overstep intimacy, bringing unwanted sexual energy into the connection. As a result, some people organized #MeToo disruptions of jams. To address sexual harassment issues, many jams are establishing jam guidelines and instigating other measures.

== Intersections of contact improvisation and contemporary dance ==

=== Similar simultaneous explorations ===

The explorations envisaged in the first moments of contact improvisation are not specific to the collective led by Steve Paxton. Many other forms of dance had also experimented with weight, touch and improvisation and examples abound in the 1960s of dancers who practice something similar, but not as systematic as contact improvisation, including Trisha Brown, Grand Union, Daniel Nagrin&#x27;s Workgroup, Anna Halprin &#x27;s San Francisco Dancers&#x27; Workshop, Julian Beck and Judith Malina&#x27;s Living Theater or Carolee Schneeman&#x27;s &quot;Meat Joy&quot; (1964).

Simone Forti, for instance, developed &quot;Huddle&quot; in the 1960s. It was a dance in which six to seven dancers were invited to form together an agglutinated mass of which one by one they detached themselves to gradually reintegrate it, thus testing the tactile, olfactory and weight sensations.

=== As a resource for movement ===

Many contemporary choreographers today use contact improvisation as a significant resource for movement. This is the case with choreographers Bill T. Jones, Wim Vandekeybus and Antonija Livingstone, or in the companies Punchdrunk (especially in their famous site-specific 2011 production &quot;Sleep No More&quot;) and DV8 Physical Theater.

References to contact improvisation vary: some are inspired by the qualities of the duet styles involving a specific use of touch, while others insist on the acrobatic dimension of contact improvisation and put forward situations of risk as means of reaching adrenalized states of performance. 
Many also perpetuate the work of sensation put forward by contact improvisation while making way for an interrogation on the relations between the genders that contact improvisation tends rather to make disappear behind an equality advocated but not always enforced. Companies like DV8 and The Cholmondeleys have thus produced choreographies based on a similar anti-mechanistic approach to that of contact improvisation, coupling it with interrogations on gendered roles.&quot; Similarly, a number of early contactors – such as Keith Hennesy, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Bill T. Jones and his partner Arnie Zane – participated in the struggles for LGBT rights in the wake of the AIDS crisis of the 1980s.

In Europe in particular, many improvisers during the 1980&#x27;s were influenced by contact improvisation. Examples of such dancers are João Fiadeiro from the Portuguese New Dance, British improvisers Julyen Hamilton, Kirstie Simson, and Charlie Morrissey, as well as North American artists who emigrated to Europe like Benoît Lachambre, Mark Tompkins and Meg Stuart.

Meg Stuart considers her lineage to be in the experimental approach to dance proposed in the early days of contact improvisation history:If I could go back in dance history I would put myself at Oberlin College in 1972, crashing into Steve Paxton and his students as we performed &quot;Magnesium&quot;. I have always been passionate about Contact Improvisation. It is rare that something experimental and radical is proposed in a dance studio, and out of that research a language, a community, a world develops. Contact is not defined as &quot;Paxton&#x27;s technique&quot;, it&#x27;s an open field, a living form.

<text>Dance improvisation is the process of spontaneously creating movement. Development of movement material is facilitated through a variety of creative explorations including body mapping through levels, shape and dynamics schema.

Improvisation is a free, seemingly unstructured, less technically strict and impulsive form that draws inspiration from everyday dance practices and influences. It is a movement technique that is capable of evoking dramatic and thought-provoking content just as well as more codified western dance techniques such as ballet and non-western movement forms.

Dance improvisation is not only about creating &quot;new&quot; movement but is also defined as freeing the body from habitual movement patterns (see Postmodern dance and Judson Dance Theater). Dancer and singer Michael Jackson combined improvisation in both of those definitions, insisting that he had an interest in performing a dance to &quot;Billie Jean&quot; only if he could do it a new way each time.

A lot of improvisation is focused on finding a deeper way of comprehending otherwise concealed thoughts or feelings of an individual. Through the emphasis of instinctual, unpredictable, free movement that improvisation is centred upon the mover is able to explore authentic feelings and inspirations.

== The history of improvisation in dance ==

=== Western theatrical dance ===
In Renaissance Italy, improvisation was used and valued in performance and participatory dances. In performance-based settings in the 15th century, dancers used improvisation to alter or replace various steps or motions, particularly hand gestures, in choreography for the purpose of creating variety. This use of improvisation declined in the 16th century, as set, specific choreography came to be favored over more individual, improvised motions. Improvisation was still used in some sense to enhance choreography during this time; however, this improvisation also became much more regulated and structured. For the following several centuries in the west, improvisation became used primarily as a method of creating choreography and remedying mistakes and mishaps during a performance. 

During the period of Romantic and classical ballet, improvisation was used very scarcely, however there remained a place for it in ballet performance. Primarily, improvisation was used in ballet at this time by certain exceptional principal dancers such as Marie Taglioni, Anna Pavlova, and Fanny Elssler who used improvisation to embellish their leading roles in ballets.

It was not until the end of the 19th century, however, that dance improvisation in western dance became such a large part of performance and dance technique. Towards the end of the 19th and throughout the 20th century, with the beginning of what has become known as modern dance, dance improvisation flourished both as a choreographic tool as well as a method performance. In the late 19th century, Loïe Fuller exemplified an explicit improvisational performance method with her use of task-based and idiosyncratic movement that both allowed for and necessitated improvisation on the part of the dancer. Slightly later in the early 20th century, movement choruses, especially those under the direction of Mary Wigman and Rudolf Laban used improvisational techniques intensely in training, and to varying degrees in performance in accordance with the director&#x27;s preference and opinion on the subject. In the second half of the 20th century, improvisation in dance exploded once more and was explored even more deeply by creators including but not limited to Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Merce Cunningham, and Paul Taylor. Each of these individuals developed their own methodology and technique behind modern dance and employed improvisation in numerous different ways that were key to the choreography and execution of their techniques. It is important to note that although Isadora Duncan is often cited as having improvised her performances, this may be based more on the free, natural quality of her movement rather than fact. While some of her material was definitely set, it is likely that other parts were in fact improvised.

Contact and group improvisation also evolved in this time with Yvonne Rainer’s formation of the Grand Union in 1970. The Grand Union was an improvisational dance group that performed improvisation that was not prepared or rehearsed beforehand.

Furthermore, and in part thanks to theories on human development that were developed in the 19th century, improvisation started being used in dance therapy and dance education in the 20th century as well. Improvisation became a key part in the educational methods of many dance educators including Bird Larson and Margaret H’Doubler who emphasized self-expression through dance improvisation.

Many other important tenets of dance improvisation come from and were innovated by the African American community. From jazz to blues to hip hop to tap, so many major forms of improvisational dance were created in the African American community, making clear the incredible impact Black artists had and continue to have on dance improvisation as well as dance at large.

==Developed dance forms with improvisational life==

===Argentine tango===
Argentine tango is a dance form that despite the apparent choreography relies on improvisation. Improvisation techniques are taught and improvisation is encouraged as necessary to reach high levels of competency in dance and performance environments. Closely knit crowds, varying rhythmic patterns in music, switching partners for each dance, and a large vocabulary of movements encourage improvisational dance in Argentine tango.

===Belly dance===
Belly dance is one of the most commonly improvised dance forms, since often live music does not support the structured nature of choreography. Professional belly dancers may dance publicly 6 nights a week, up to three times a night, and simply do not have the time to choreograph for the 15–60 minutes a night that such performing requires. Even dancers with substantial choreography repertoires often choose to improvise when performing to live music because they value the exchange of energy between the dancer, the musicians, and the audience, which is heightened by working &quot;in the moment&quot;. American Tribal Style belly dance and Improvisational Tribal Style are built entirely upon group improvisation, although the group will typically plan and rehearse individual combinations and their cues in advance.

===Blues===
Blues dance is generally done to blues music, and is highly improvisational. Like lindy hop, emphasis is on the lead and follow connection, but the emphasis is even greater. Blues dance is a partnered and structured form of interpretive dance, and relies mostly on the leader interpreting the music how he or she will; at the same time, the follower usually has some freedom to interpret the music and add in his or her own style as well.

===Break dance===
B-boying features a heavily improvisational style based on cyclic movement patterns. Many styles of b-boying exist, and dance crews will often choreograph performances for specific songs. Individual performances are more commonly improvised due to the nature of the dance.

===Lindy Hop===
Lindy Hop is generally an eight-count swing dance, developed in large part by Frankie Manning, and includes a large amount of improvisation. Once a dancer has learned a variety of swing dance moves, ranging from West Coast Swing to Charleston to Balboa, the dancer will often combine any and all the moves he or she knows of these styles of dance, as well as add his or her own dance style, or make up new dance moves or aerials. Because of its improvisational nature, lindy hop heavily relies on lead and follow connection, rather than each partner knowing the steps and doing them together.

===Post-modern dance and contact improvisation===
In the 1970s, Judson Church dancer and choreographer Steve Paxton, in collaboration with other post-modern dancers, developed Contact Improvisation. &quot;Contact improv&quot; is an un-codified, somatic technique that serves as a framework for collective improvisation. It involves multiple dancers who explore movement together by supporting each other&#x27;s weight, maintaining contact with each other, and bringing their attention to the point or points of contact between them. Unlike the pas de deux of classical ballet, in which the male partner lifts and supports the female, contact improvisation does not assign differential roles to each dancer. There are no officially codified or standardized movements, but partners commonly lift, carry, fall onto or off of, caress, and lean on each other.

Contact improvisation is sometimes used by post-modern choreographers to generate or develop choreography.

<text>Buttermilk Channel is a small tidal strait in Upper New York Bay in New York City, approximately long and wide, separating Governors Island from Brooklyn. The channel is marked by a number of navigation aids (green cans no. 5 and 7 at the northeast entrance, and green gong no. 1, marking low water off the tip of Governors Island). Tidal currents on the channel are rather strong.

== History ==
Origins of the name are uncertain but it is alleged to be a reference to the dairy farmers who used to cross this channel by boat to sell their milk in Manhattan markets. Some people believe that the channel got its name because crossing it was so rough that the farmers&#x27; milk was churned into butter by the time they reached Manhattan. According to another legend, before the channel was dredged to accommodate cargo ships, cows were walked across it at low tide to graze on Governors Island. In his newspaper articles about Brooklyn history, Walt Whitman wrote of a time &quot;as late as the Revolutionary War (when) cattle were driven across from Brooklyn, over what is now Buttermilk Channel, to Governor&#x27;s Island.&quot; In the bitter volcanic winter of 1817—the volcanic winter following the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;—when the thermometer dropped to , the waters of the Upper Bay froze so hard that horse-drawn sleighs were driven across Buttermilk Channel to Governors Island.

On the Brooklyn side, modern development started in the 1840s, when the Atlantic Basin and docks, and the &quot;Erie Basin&quot; were started. The former is now the Red Hook Container Port, the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, and the Red Hook stop of the NYC Ferry SB route while the latter is now the site of the Brooklyn IKEA.

In 1902, the channel was dredged extensively by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Subsequent modifications were made in 1913, 1935 and 1962. With current charted depths of , Buttermilk Channel is still a busy shipping lane offering the most convenient access to the Brooklyn waterfront. Until the late 20th century the primary user of the channel was the U.S. Coast Guard, which had a local headquarters on Governors Island.

In April 2015, the Army Corps of Engineers issued a Request for Proposals for additional maintenance dredging of Buttermilk Channel. The channel was fully dredged in fiscal year 2016.

<doc id="458448" wikidata="Q1355858" url="?curid=458448" title="Mark Roberts (streaker)">
<text>Mark Roberts is an English streaker who has run naked during numerous international events. Roberts&#x27; streaking began when he saw a news report about a female streaker at a 1993 rugby sevens game in Hong Kong. After a bet in a bar, he exposed himself to the crowd the next day.

Roberts has done this, as of 2024, 583 times in 23 countries, targeting such events as those held at Hamilton Park Racecourse, a Mr. Universe contest, a Miss World contest, multiple Olympic Games, tennis matches, the Running of the Bulls, the synchronized swimming world championship, and his specialty, association football matches. According to Roberts, he was mandated to surrender his passport whenever an English football team played abroad following a 2001 conviction for streaking (including FA Cup Final 2001). It is unclear how long this mandate was in place.

One famous streak was on a live 1995 broadcast of &quot;This Morning&quot;, where he swam onto Fred Talbot&#x27;s floating weather map and proceeded to emulate Talbot&#x27;s trademark leap from Scotland to Ireland.

A 2002 advertisement created by the Spanish ad agency Dimension for Spanish football club Athletic Bilbao featured Mark Roberts streaking fully clothed during a nude football game. It won a bronze award at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

In January 2003, Roberts flew to San Diego, California, where he planned to streak at the Super Bowl XXXVII. He was unable to get tickets to the game, but succeeded the next year for Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston, Texas. Just before the start of the second half, he ran onto the field disguised as a referee, stripped, and performed a dance wearing only a thong. He was taken into custody after being tackled by members of the Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots. He was given a $1,000 fine for trespassing.

On 21 May 2003, in the 2003 UEFA Cup Final at the Estadio Olímpico de Sevilla, Spain, before the start of the match between Celtic Scotland and Porto Portugal, he ran into the center of the field disguised as a referee, presented the referee with a red card, then completely undressed, revealing the words &quot;GoldenPalaceCasino.com Click here&quot; on his back (as part of an advertising deal) while in this state for a few seconds, he picked up the ball and made a slalom pass to the gate protected by Vítor Baía. Roberts struck at him, but the goalkeeper deflected the blow. Afterwards, Roberts was detained by security. A year earlier, he managed to score a goal against Hans-Jörg Butt in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, and also did a somersault through the net in the final of the men&#x27;s singles tennis tournament Wimbledon. In 2000, he &quot;participated&quot; in one of Anna Kournikova&#x27;s matches also at Wimbledon (women&#x27;s singles 2000).

Roberts planned to retire after streaking at the 2006 World Cup final at Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion, but was stopped before entering the stadium. In 2007, Roberts ran out on the field of Wembley Stadium during the National Football League&#x27;s first regular season game outside of North America between the Miami Dolphins and New York Giants. The next year, Roberts struck again during the final of the 2008 World Snooker Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, just as he did at the Championship four years earlier.

In March 2010 Roberts was seen sporting a cat-shaped mask over his genitals at Crufts.

In 2011, artist Benedikt Dichgans hired Roberts to streak at the Turner Prize awarding ceremony at Tate Britain, but he was tackled by police while only partially on stage, and was arrested.

He was featured in the 2011 Banksy-produced documentary, &quot;The Antics Roadshow&quot;. In 2013, he was subject of the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Streak! The Man Who Can&#x27;t Keep His Clothes On&quot;. In the programme, he announced his forthcoming retirement, but not before one last streak.

In 2018, Roberts made his first appearance since 2013 at the Gangneung Oval during the speed skating events of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. As the men&#x27;s 1,000-meter speed skating medal ceremony concluded, Roberts took to the ice wearing nothing but a pink tutu and skimpy underwear with the words &quot;peace and love&quot; emblazoned across his bare chest.

In October 1995 the United States Coast Guard announced it would close its largest base, at Governors Island, as a cost savings measure. The Coast Guard had established the base on the island in 1966 after the U.S. Army closed Fort Jay, an Army post since 1794.

In 1996, the Coast Guard closed the base and conveyed it as surplus property to the federal government&#x27;s General Services Administration for disposal through transfer or sale. The closure was at the initiative of the Coast Guard, then a bureau of the U.S. Department of Transportation, which was seeking to close a $400 million budget gap. The closure of the base represented an estimated 30 million dollar savings. Since the closure was an initiated action by the Coast Guard, it was not subject to the Base Realignment and Closure process.

At the time of the closure announcement in October 1995, President Bill Clinton and New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan reached an informal agreement to convey the island to the city and state of New York for $1, if a plan for public benefit could be developed. The city was initially reluctant to take up Clinton&#x27;s offer because it would not have been financially beneficial to the city. The issue was exacerbated when the United States Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act in August 1997, stipulating that the GSA sell the island at a fair market value by 2002. The island&#x27;s sale was expected to net the federal government $500 million.

==Establishment of the monument==

As President Clinton left office in January 2001, with no resolution of the island&#x27;s future in hand, and at the urging of members of the New York congressional delegation, he established a Governors Island National Monument by Presidential Proclamation 7402 of January 19, 2001. The proclamation did not fully establish the boundaries of the monument, but did set forth the federal intention of preserving the fortifications, Fort Jay and Castle Williams, the oldest and most historic features on the island. The Justice Department under President George W. Bush concluded the proclamation possessed technical errors, but did not revoke or invalidate the proclamation.

In an April 2002 White House meeting with city and state officials, President Bush announced his intention to sell the island to the city and state of New York. While the White House intended the transaction to be concluded by September 2002, it took several months of negotiations with city, state and federal officials to resolve outstanding issues.

On January 31, 2003, the island was conveyed to an intermediary, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which attached restrictive land use covenants to the deed, then conveyed the island to two parties: was conveyed to the U.S. Department of the Interior for use as a national monument; and went to the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation, formed jointly by the State and City of New York – now The Trust for Governors Island, an instrumentality of the City of New York – for the purpose of administering and redeveloping the island. formally re-affirmed the establishment of the national monument.

==Significance==

Both presidential proclamations noted that the island served as an outpost to protect New York City from sea attack. Between 1806 and 1811, Castle Williams and Fort Jay were constructed as part of the First and Second American System of Coastal Fortification; they played important roles in the War of 1812, the Civil War, and World Wars I and II.

The fortifications were built on the most strategic defensive positions on the island. Fort Jay, first constructed in the 1790s and reconstructed between 1806 and 1809, is on the highest point of the island. The surrounding open space or glacis slopes down to the waterfront on all sides. Castle Williams, started in 1807 and completed in November 1811, occupies a rocky shoal that extended into the harbor channel at the northwest corner of the island and served as the most important strategic defensive point in the upper bay of New York Harbor.

By the 1830s, the protective functions of both fortifications had diminished, but the core of a small urban Army post evolved around them. By the 1870s, with deep reductions in a post-Civil War army, the post became a major headquarters for the U.S. Army, a role it played until their departure in 1966. The residential and institutional structures surrounding the two fortifications are now part of the Governors Island National Historic Landmark District, containing over 60 structures related to two centuries of the military history of the nation.

Since the island was managed by the United States Army and the United States Coast Guard for nearly 200 years, and was no longer required for defense or Coast Guard purposes, the establishment of the monument provided an excellent opportunity for the public to observe and understand the harbor history, its defense and its ecology.

The island and monument has been open on a seasonal basis during the summer months since 2005. The island became more popular over the years, attracting 275,000 visitors in 2009 and 800,000 visitors in 2018.

<text>Worship dance or liturgical dance take on several forms of sacred dance in Christianity and Messianic Judaism, and is usually incorporated into liturgies or worship services.

==History==
Some liturgical dance was common in ancient times or non-Western settings, with precedents in Judaism beginning with accounts of dancing in the Old Testament. An example is the episode when King David danced before the Ark of the Covenant (), but this instance is often considered to be outside of Jewish norms and Rabbinic rituals prescribed at the time.

Dance has historically been controversial within Christianity. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders of most branches of the Christian Church, for such reasons as the association of dance with paganism, the use of dance for sexual purposes, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, and especially following the Second Vatican Council, there was a significant growth in the use of dance in Christian worship. This received a boost from the charismatic movement of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to contemporary worship in many churches.

A distinctive style of worship dance has developed within Messianic Judaism. Known as &quot;messianic dance&quot; or &quot;davidic dance&quot; (for King David), it sometimes incorporates elements of Israeli Folk Dancing.

<doc id="458454" wikidata="Q103336" url="?curid=458454" title="Antje Vollmer">
<text>Antje Vollmer (; 31 May 194315 March 2023) was a German Protestant theologian, academic teacher and politician of the Alliance 90/The Greens. She became a member of the Bundestag in 1983 when the Greens first entered the West German parliament, before joining the party in 1985. From 1994 to 2005, she was Vice President of the Bundestag, the first Green in the position. She was a pacifist.

== Education and early career ==

Vollmer was born in Lübbecke (Westphalia). Her parents ran a textile shop which they later had to close. After graduating from Wittekind-Gymnasium Lübbecke in 1962, she studied Protestant theology in Berlin, Heidelberg, Tübingen, and Paris, completing her first theological exam in 1968, her second in 1971, and receiving her doctorate in 1973. From 1969 to 1971, she was a research assistant at the Kirchliche Hochschule Berlin. In 1971, she started a postgraduate course in adult education, which she completed in 1975. From 1971 to 1974, she worked as a pastor in Berlin-Wedding, a problematic district at the time. From 1976 to 1982, she was an instructor in adult education at the of the Bethel Foundation in Bielefeld; she collaborated with the local Protestant and Catholic organisations for rural young people (&quot;Landjugend&quot;), and experienced the beginning of the ecological movement. She wrote a book related to the attempt to assassinate Hitler in the 20 July plot together with Lars-Broder Keil, &quot;Stauffenbergs Gefährten: Das Schicksal der unbekannten Verschwörer&quot; (&quot;Stauffenberg&#x27;s companions: The fate of the unknown conspirators&quot;), which was published in 2013.

== Political career ==

In the 1970s, Vollmer was politically active in the Anti-Imperialist League (), close to the Maoist KPD/AO, but did not join the party. They were activists against the Vietnam War. She became a member of the Bundestag in 1983 on the ticket of the Green Party, although she was not a party member. In 1985, she joined the Greens. In 1984, she was elected to the party&#x27;s board in parliament, as one of three women. In 1985, she initiated a dialogue of the state and prisoners of the Red Army Faction. Within the party, she called in &quot;Grüner Aufbruch&quot; for a bridge between the &quot;Realos&quot; and &quot;Fundis&quot;, those adjusting to the realities of possible developments, and fundamental thinkers. Due to the party principle of &quot;rotation&quot; she had to give up the parliamentary seat in 1985, but was reelected in 1987 and again in 1994, 1998, and 2002.

In November 1994, Vollmer was the first politician of the Green Party to be elected into the Presidium of the Bundestag. She remained vice president of the Bundestag until the 2005 elections, at which point, she did not run for re-election.

== Later life ==

In 2009, Vollmer was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburg&#x27;s NRW School of Governance. She gave both seminars and lectures at the university.

Vollmer was one of the first signatories of an open letter on the German position on the Russo-Ukrainian War, published in the magazine &quot;EMMA&quot; in April 2022, which called on Chancellor Olaf Scholz to not supply Ukraine with offensive weapons during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to do everything he could to end the war, in order to prevent an escalation of the conflict into &quot;a third world war&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1979, Vollmer gave birth to a son, Johann, whom she raised as a single mother.

Vollmer died on 15 March 2023, at age 79.

Katrin Göring-Eckardt, vice president of the Bundestag then, said of Vollmer, &quot;She was there from the beginning and fought through much of what we benefit from today. And she kept her own head, unbending!&quot; (&quot;Sie war von Beginn an dabei und hat Vieles von dem durchgekämpft, wovon wir heute profitieren. Und sie hat ihren eigenen Kopf behalten, unbeugsam!)

<doc id="458455" wikidata="Q492415" url="?curid=458455" title="Battle of Talas">
<text>The Battle of Talas (; ) was an armed confrontation between the Abbasid Caliphate against the Tang dynasty in 751. In July of that year, the Tang and Abbasid armies clashed at the Talas River over control of the regions surrounding the Syr Darya. According to Chinese sources, the engagement began with several days of military stalemate, before a mercenary column of 20,000 Karluks—representing two-thirds of the initial Tang army strength—defected to the Abbasids, and played a vital role in routing the Tangs.

After the battle, the caliph dispatched an envoy to the emperor, who arrived in December 752 to negotiate the restoration of diplomatic relations. In response, the Tangs reconciled with the Abbasids, but continued to expand into Central Asia. With the An Lushan rebellion in 755, Abbasid influence and control west of the Pamir Mountains was able to spread without opposition from the Tang government, which redeployed all available military forces back into China&#x27;s interior in order to suppress the rebellion. By 821, though the Abbasids had lost direct control over their Central Asian territories, and the Mamluk Turkic Ghaznavids rose to power in the region in 977. The gains brought about by the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana were entirely lost in 1124, when the non-Muslim Qara Khitai conquered the region. The Abbasids placed great value on controlling this area as it was a strategic point on the Silk Road. Chinese prisoners captured at Talas in 751 are said to have introduced papermaking to the peoples of West Asia, although this account is disputed by several findings.

== Location ==
The exact location of the battle has not been confirmed but is believed to be near Taraz and Talas, on the border between present-day Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Chinese name was first seen in the account of Xuanzang. Du Huan located the city near the western drain of the Chui River.

==Background==
The oasis towns on the Silk Road in central Asia had once been controlled by the Türgesh, but the Turkic tribal confederation plunged into chaos in the latter half of the 7th century. Empress Wu had retaken control of the Tarim Basin from the Tibetan Empire in 692 as part of the Tang expansion in Inner Asia and the oasis towns became a major source of income for the Tang. In 705, Qutayba ibn Muslim started to lead the Umayyad army on campaigns to conquer towns across along the Silk Road, exploiting Türgesh infighting. The caliphate conquered the oasis towns Bukhara and Samarkand, expanding the border of their empire eastwards. At the same time, the Türgesh khagan Suluk began uniting the infighting Türgesh tribes. The Muslim, Tibetan and Tang armies would have two encounters. In 715, Alutar was established as king of Fergana with the help of Umayyad and Tibetan soldiers. The deposed Ikhshid fled to the Tang controlled Kuqa and requested the aid of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang; 10,000 Tang soldiers reinstated Ikhshid as Fergana&#x27;s king. In 717, Umayyad soldiers, assisted by the Tibetan Empire, besieged Aksu City in the Tarim Basin, but were defeated by the Tang military in the Battle of Aksu.

In 715, the Tang emperor declined the demand of the Türgesh tribe leader Suluk to be recognized as Khagan, instead offering him the rank of duke within the Tang military. In response, Suluk invaded the Tarim Basin along with the Tibetans, but they were driven out by the cavalry of Ashina Xian. Suluk and his soldiers regularly challenged Umayyad–Tang control of the oasis towns. Before Suluk&#x27;s death, his soldiers were defeated by the Tang in 736 and by the Caliphate in 737. At the same time, Türgesh tribes established metal industries in Tang-controlled Fergana Valley, an area that was also home to important centres of iron production. The Karluks, a federation of three Türgesh tribes with settlements around Tian Shan, were producers and exporters of iron weapons to the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty.

In 747, the Tang general Gao Xianzhi, who had successfully fought the Tibetan empire in the Pamir Mountains, established control over the Gilgit region. In early 748, the Abbasid general Abu Muslim occupied Merv, the capital of Greater Khorasan, and went on to lead what has become known as the Abbasid Revolution. In 750, Abu al-&#x27;Abbas al-Saffah was proclaimed the first Abbasid caliph in the great mosque of Kufa. The Umayyad Caliphate fell in 750 at the Battle of the Zab. Abu Muslim had raised an army that included Muslims and non-Muslims, which he dispatched westwards to take control over Umayyad territory. The Tang general and the Abbasid general would eventually meet in 750 when the kings of the Silk Road towns Tashkent and Ferghana sought the support of their imperial overlords in a battle of dominance. Gao Xianzhi conquered the Abbasid-controlled Tashkent after a siege. The Abbasid general escaped from Tashkent to Samarkand, where he gathered troops and marched eastwards to confront the Tang army. In Fergana, the Tang general Gao Xianzhi raised an army by recruiting Karluk Turks. During the reign of Lalitaditya Muktapida, the Karkota dynasty of Kashmir that acknowledged the Tang as suzerain or their vassal lord, supported the Chinese against the Tibetans. According to art historians Denise Patry Leidy and Donna K. Strahan, Kashmir &quot;helped defeat the Arabas at the Battle of Talas in 751&quot;.

==Battle==

The numeric quantities of the combatants involved in the battle of Talas are not known with certainty. The Abbasid army consisted of 200,000 soldiers according to Chinese estimates, which included contingents from their Tibetan ally. On the opposite side, Arabic records put the combined Chinese forces at 100,000. But Chinese sources record a combined army of 10,000 Tang infantry and 20,000 Karluk mercenaries. The &quot;Tongdian&quot; (801), the earliest narrative for battle itself by either side, suggests 30,000 deaths, and the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; (945) counted 20,000 deaths in this battle. The earliest Arabic account for the battle, itself from &quot;Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh&quot; (1231) suggests 50,000 deaths and 20,000 prisoners. Gao Xianzhi&#x27;s official position was that of the Anxi Jiedu envoy, The total number of Tang troops in the jurisdiction was 24,000 and was stationed in the four countries of Qiuzi, Yanqi, Khotan, and Shule.

In July 751, the Abbasid forces, including the Karluk mercenaries faced with the Tang forces on the banks of the Talas River. The Muslim General had assembled his troops in a standard formation, with his archers in the front, the spearmen behind them and heavy cavalry with his guard. Gao Xianzhi had assembled his army in a similar manner, with his professionally-trained heavy infantry of crossbowmen and spearmen in the front and in the second line respectively, and the lighter columns of Ferghana mercenaries behind, with the Karluk Turks on the extreme far right and left flanks.The sequence of the first three days of the battle were similar to each other, with the Chinese attacking first from the front, with their archers and crossbowmen dealing substantial damage to the Arab archers with greater accuracy and ranged superiority in crossbows. The Abbasid archers had to retreat behind their spearmen and the Abbasid spearmen charged ahead, with the infantry lines colliding between the Tang and Abbasid spearmen. However, the Tang professional heavy infantry were better armoured and could sustain more injuries than their Abbasid counterparts, and managed to push the Arab infantry backwards despite being outnumbered. The Muslim general attempted to alleviate the pressure on his infantry by sending his heavy cavalry to attack the lighter column cavalry on the Chinese flanks. However, this attack failed to outflank Gao&#x27;s units, but the Chinese general had to move his reserves into a fray. A similar sequence of events happened on the second and third days, but on the fourth day, the Karluk mercenaries betrayed the Chinese and attacked their flanks from the left and right while the Abbasid infantry made a frontal assault.

The Tang army was subjected to a devastating defeat, owing to the defection of the Karluk mercenaries and the retreat of Ferghana allies who originally supported the Chinese. The Karluk mercenaries, two-thirds of the Tang army, defected to the Abbasids during the battle; Karluk troops attacked the Tang army from close quarters while the main Abbasid forces attacked from the front. The Tang troops were unable to hold their positions, and the commander of the Tang forces, Gao Xianzhi, recognized that defeat was imminent and managed to escape with some of his Tang regulars with the help of Li Siye. Out of an estimated 10,000 Tang troops, only 2,000 managed to return from Talas to their territory in central Asia. Despite losing the battle, Li did inflict heavy losses on the pursuing Arab army after being reproached by Duan Xiushi.

== Aftermath ==
According to a text by Al-Maqdisi, one of the few Arabic sources on the battle that has survived, Abbasid general Abu Muslim took 5,000 Chinese prisoners and confiscated possessions from the Tang military camp. According to Al-Maqdisi, Abu Muslim prepared his forces and equipment to invade more Tang controlled territory. However, he was first presented with a letter from the caliph As-Saffah, in which he was informed that his services were needed as governor of Khurasan. After the Battle of Talas, the Abbasids coerced the Tang army to evacuate the Gilgit region.

The An Lushan rebellion ended the Tang presence in central Asia and forced them to withdraw from the northwestern frontier; because the Abbasids did not advance any further after the battle, Talas was of no strategic importance.
After the battle, a small number of Karluks converted to Islam. However, the majority would not convert until the mid-10th century, when Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan established the Kara-Khanid Khanate. This occurred well after Tang dynasty was gone from central Asia.

Caliph Al-Saffah died in 754. Chinese sources record that his successor, the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur, sent his diplomatic delegations regularly to China. Al-Mansur&#x27;s delegations were known in China as &quot;Khayi Tashi&quot; (&quot;Black Clothes&quot;). Shortly after the battle of Talas, the domestic An Lushan rebellion and subsequent warlordism gave the Abbasids the opportunity to further expand into central Asia as Tibetans took over the region between the Abbasids and Tangs and Tang influence in the region retreated. The An Lushan rebellion broke out in 755 and lasted until 763, forcing the Tang army to retreat from the northwestern frontier after enjoying around a century of sovereignty. This effectively ended the Tang presence in central Asia. In 756 Al-Mansur sent 3,000 mercenaries to assist Emperor Xuanzong of Tang in the An Lushan rebellion. A massacre of foreign Muslim merchants by Tian Shengong happened during the An Lushan rebellion in the Yangzhou massacre (760).

The Tang dynasty recovered its power decades after the An Lushan rebellion and was still able to launch offensive conquests and campaigns like its destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate in Mongolia during 840–847. It was the Huang Chao rebellion (874–884) that permanently destroyed the power of the Tang dynasty since Huang not only devastated the north but marched into southern China which An Lushan failed to do due to the Battle of Suiyang. Huang&#x27;s army in southern China committed the Guangzhou massacre against foreign Muslim, Zoroastrian, Jewish and Christian merchants in 878–879 at the seaport and trading entrepôt of Guangzhou, and captured both Tang dynasty capitals, Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an. A medieval Chinese source claimed that Huang Chao killed 8 million people. Even though Huang Chao was eventually defeated, the Tang Emperors lost all their power to regional &quot;jiedushi&quot; and Huang Chao&#x27;s former lieutenant Zhu Wen who had defected to the Tang court turned the Tang emperors into his puppets and completed the destruction of Chang&#x27;an by dismantling Chang&#x27;an and transporting the materials east to Luoyang when he forced the court to move the capital. Zhu Wen deposed the last Tang Emperor in 907 and founded Later Liang (Five Dynasties), plunging China into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period as regional &quot;jiedushi&quot; warlords declared their own dynasties and kingdoms.

The Tibetan Empire began attacking China, during a period where the Tibetan army also conquered territory in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains from Indian kingdoms and assisted the establishment of the eastern Indian Pala Empire in the latter half of the 8th century. It was only under the fifth Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid that a formal military alliance was established between the Tang, the Uighurs engaged the Tibetan army on the western Tibetan frontier with the Abbasids. At the same time, the Uighurs fought the Tibetans along the Silk Road. The Karluks expanded their settlements around Tian Shan, and also settled westwards in Abbasid-controlled Fergana and Tukharistan. Iron weapons continued to be exported to Tibet and China on the Silk Roads between Kuqa and Aksu near the Tarim basin. Arabic sources record that in the 10th century Aksu and Fergana had markets for arms traders.
Talas is in modern-day Kyrgyzstan and had been part of the Silk Road. From Dunhuang in China, along the edge of the Takla Makan desert, passing through oasis towns such as Kucha, roads went through a region Arabs called Transoxiana. The Silk Roads in Transoxiana went through Talas, Tashkent, Samarkand, and Khwarazm. Turning south, roads went through Kunduz in present-day Afghanistan, the Pamir Mountains could be crossed on roads going through Kulob and Balkh in the Bactria region. From there present day India could be reached on a road through Bamyan that lead over the Hindu Kush. Muslim influence along these central Asian trade routes had started in the 8th century, one key event being the battle of Talas. Prior to Talas, Buddhists controlled much of the roads. Central Asian Buddhism went into decline after the battle of Talas.

Following the An Lushan rebellion, the diplomatic exchange between Buddhist Indian kingdoms and the Tang dynasty all but ceased. Prior to the An Lushan rebellion, between 640 and 750 diplomatic envoys from Indian kingdoms, often accompanied by Buddhist monks, had regularly visited the Tang court. Chinese Buddhism developed into an independent religion with distinct spiritual elements, such as Pure Land Buddhism and Zen. China became the center of East Asian Buddhism, creating a canon and spreading on to Japan and Korea. The Battle of Talas did not mark the end of Buddhism or Chinese influence in the region. The Buddhist Kara-Khitan Khanate defeated the Seljuk and Kara-Khanid Turks at the Battle of Qatwan in 1141, conquering a large part of central Asia from the Karluk Kara-Khanid Khanate during the 12th century. The Kara-Khitans also reintroduced the Chinese system of Imperial government, since China was still held in respect and esteem in the region among even the Muslim population, and the Kara-Khitans used Chinese as an official language. The Kara-Khitan rulers were called &quot;the Chinese&quot; by the Muslims.

According to the 11th-century historian Al-Thaʽālibī, Chinese prisoners captured at the Battle of Talas in 751 introduced paper manufacturing to Samarkand. They engaged in the craft of papermaking while living on land occupied by the Abbasids following Talas. However, this account is unlikely to be factual. Paper was already in use throughout Central Asia by the 8th century; paper fragments dating to the 4th and 5th centuries have been found in the areas of Turpan and Gaochang, and letters written in the Sogdian language between the 4th and 6th centuries have been found in Dunhuang and Loulan. One such letter was a communication with Samarkand. According to Jonathan Bloom, paper was used in Samarkand, and probably produced there, several decades before the battle. Several paper documents have also been discovered near Panjakent at Mount Mugh, a mountain stronghold, that likely predate the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. They were either local or came from Buddhist monks active in the region. By the 8th century, Chinese paper was mostly made of bast fibers while Islamic papers were mostly made of rag fibers. Bloom suggests that papermakers were already active in Central Asia for quite some time and had learned to use rag fibers rather than bast fibers as their primary papermaking material.

No historic Chinese source records this transfer of technology through prisoners of war and no contemporary Arabic accounts of the transfer of paper exist. Du Huan, who was captured by the Abbasid army at the battle of Talas and upon his return to China published his travel writings, documented that Chinese crafts such as silk weaving were practiced by Chinese prisoners of war while living on territory controlled by the Abbasids. It may have been a convention to reference Chinese craftsmen, who had long been esteemed in Islamic lands, and Chinese paper remained a prized product for centuries. According to Al-Nadim, a writer in Baghdad during the 10th century, Chinese craftsmen made paper in Khorasan. It was only after the first paper mill was built in Baghdad in 794–795 that paper was manufactured throughout the Islamic world and paper started to replace papyrus.

== Modern evaluation ==
Among the earliest historians who proclaimed the importance of this battle was the Russian historian Vasily Bartold, according to whom: &quot;The earlier Arab historians, occupied with the narrative of events then taking place in western Asia, do not mention this battle; but it is undoubtedly of great importance in the history of Western Turkestan as it determined the question which of the two civilizations, the Chinese or the Muslim, should predominate in the land [of Turkestan].&quot;

The Tang loss of 8,000 troops can be compared to a total strength of more than 500,000 on the eve of the An Lushan rebellion. According to Bartold, during the first three centuries of Islam, al-Tabari was the chief source—which has survived to the present in a compilation by Ibn al Athir—which was brought down to 915. Neither Tabari nor early Arabic historical works make any mention of this; however, Athir&#x27;s statement is confirmed by the Chinese &quot;History of the Tang Dynasty&quot;.

Denis Sinor said that it was interference in the internal affairs of the Western Turkic Khaganate which ended Chinese supremacy in central Asia, since the destruction of the Western Khaganate rid the Muslims of their greatest opponent, and it was not the Battle of Talas which ended the Chinese presence.

The Chinese historian Bai Shouyi wrote that, at the same time that Talas took place, the Tang also sent an army from Shibao city in Qinghai to Suyab and consolidated Chinese control over the Turgesh. According to Bai, Chinese expansion in central Asia did not halt after the battle of Talas. The Tang commander Feng Changqing, who took over the position from Gao Xianzhi through Wang Zhengjian, virtually swept across the Kashmir region and captured Gilgit shortly two years later. Even Tashkent re-established its vassal status in 753, when the Tang bestowed a title to its ruler. Bai also maintains that the Chinese influence to the west of the Pamir Mountains certainly did not cease as the result of the battle. Central Asian states under Muslim control, such as Samarkand, continued to request aid from the Tang against the Abbasids and in 754, all nine kingdoms of Western Turkestan again sent petitions to the Tang to attack the Abbasids and the Tang continued to turn down such requests as it did for decades. Ferghana, which participated in the battle earlier, in fact joined among the central Asian auxiliaries with the Chinese army under a summons and entered Gansu during the An Lushan Rebellion in 756. Bai also noted that neither did the relations between the Chinese and Arabs worsen, as the Abbasids continued to send embassies to China after the battle without interruption. Such visits had overall resulted in 13 diplomatic gifts between 752 and 798.

Xue Zongzheng came to the conclusion that other than the transfer of paper, there is no evidence to support a geopolitical or demographic change resulting from this battle. In fact, it seems that Tang influence over central Asia even strengthened after 751 and that by 755, Tang power in central Asia was at its zenith. Several of the factors after the battle had been taken note of prior to 751. Firstly, the Karluks never in any sense remained opposed to the Chinese after the battle. In 753, the Karluk Yabghu submitted under the column of Cheng Qianli and captured A-Busi, a Chinese mercenary who had defected to the Tongluo chief earlier in 743, receiving his title in court on 22 October.

<doc id="458462" wikidata="Q202905" url="?curid=458462" title="Lake Okeechobee">
<text>Lake Okeechobee ( ) is the largest freshwater lake in the U.S. state of Florida. It is the eighth-largest natural freshwater lake among the 50 states of the United States and the second-largest natural freshwater lake contained entirely within the contiguous 48 states, after Lake Michigan.

Okeechobee covers and is exceptionally shallow for a lake of its size, with an average depth of only . Not only is it the largest lake in Florida and the largest lake in the southeast United States, it is also too large to see across. The Kissimmee River, located directly north of Lake Okeechobee, is the lake&#x27;s primary source. The lake is divided between Glades, Okeechobee, Martin, Palm Beach and Hendry counties. All five counties meet at one point near the center of the lake.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The earliest recorded people to have lived around the lake were the Calusa. They called the lake Mayaimi, meaning &quot;big water&quot;, as reported in the 16th century, by Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda. The name &quot;Okeechobee&quot; comes from the Hitchiti words &quot;oki&quot; (water) and &quot;chubi&quot; (big).

Slightly later in the 16th century, René Goulaine de Laudonnière reported hearing about a large freshwater lake in southern Florida called &quot;Serrope&quot;. By the 18th century the largely mythical lake was known to British mapmakers and chroniclers by the Spanish name &quot;Laguna de Espiritu Santo&quot;. In the early 19th century it was known as &quot;Mayacco Lake&quot; or &quot;Lake Mayaca&quot; after the Mayaca people, originally from the upper reaches of the St. Johns River, who moved near the lake in the early 18th century. The modern Port Mayaca on the east side of the lake preserves that name.

The Battle of Lake Okeechobee was fought on the northern shore of the lake in 1837 during the Seminole Wars. On the southern rim of Lake Okeechobee, three islands—Kreamer, Ritta, and Torey—were once settled by early pioneers. These settlements had a general store, post office, school, and town elections. Farming was the main vocation. The fertile land was challenging to farm because of the muddy muck. Over the first half of the twentieth century, farmers used agricultural tools—including tractors—to farm in the muck. By the 1960s, all of these settlements were abandoned.

=== 20th century ===
All of Lake Okeechobee was included in the boundaries of Palm Beach County when it was created in 1909. In 1963, the lake was divided among the five counties surrounding the lake.

In 1926, the Great Miami Hurricane hit the Lake Okeechobee area, killing approximately 300 people. Two years later in 1928, the Okeechobee Hurricane crossed over the lake, killing thousands. The Red Cross reported 1,836 deaths, a figure which the National Weather Service initially accepted, but in 2003, the number was revised to &quot;at least 2,500&quot;. In both cases the catastrophe was caused by flooding from a storm surge when strong winds drove water over the mud dike that circled the lake at the time. After the two hurricanes, the Florida State Legislature created the &quot;Okeechobee Flood Control District&quot;. 

The organization was authorized to cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in actions to prevent similar disasters. U.S. President Herbert Hoover visited the area personally, and afterward the Corps designed a plan incorporating the construction of channels, gates, and nearly 140 miles of levees to protect areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee from overflow. 

The Okeechobee Waterway was officially opened on March 23, 1937, by a procession of boats which left Fort Myers, Florida, on March 22 and arrived at Stuart, Florida, the following day. The dike was then named the &quot;Herbert Hoover Dike&quot; in honor of the president.

The 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane sent an even larger storm surge to the crest of the new dike, which was expanded again in the 1960s.

=== 21st century ===

Four recent hurricanes – Frances, Jeanne, Wilma, and Irma – had no major adverse effects on communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee, even though the lake rose after Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Hurricane Ernesto increased water levels by in 2006, the last time it exceeded . However, the lake&#x27;s level began dropping soon after and by July 2007, it had dropped more than to its all-time low of .
In August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay increased water levels to above sea level, the first time it exceeded since January 2007. Over a seven-day period (including some storms that preceded Fay), about of rain fell directly onto the lake.
In 2007, during a drought, state water and wildlife managers removed thousands of truckloads of toxic mud from the lake&#x27;s floor, in an effort to restore the lake&#x27;s natural sandy base and create clearer water and better habitat for wildlife. The mud contained elevated levels of arsenic and other pesticides. According to tests from the South Florida Water Management District, arsenic levels on the northern part of the lake bed were as much as four times the limit for residential land. Independent tests found the mud too polluted for use on agricultural or commercial lands, and therefore difficult to dispose of on land.

Through early 2008, the lake remained well below normal levels, with large portions of the lake bed exposed above the water line. During this time, portions of the lake bed, covered in organic matter, dried out and caught fire. In late August 2008, Tropical Storm Fay inundated Florida with record amounts of rain. Lake Okeechobee received almost a increase in water level, including local run-off from the tributaries.

In 2013, heavy rains in central Florida resulted in high runoff into the lake; rising lake levels forced the CoE (Army Corps of Engineers) to release large volumes of polluted water from the lake through the St. Lucie River estuary to the east and the Caloosahatchee River estuary to the west. Thus the normal mix of fresh and salt water in those estuaries was replaced by a flood of polluted fresh water resulting in ecological damage.

Since 2013, the CoE has been forced to pump billions of gallons of water out of the lake to avoid jeopardizing the integrity of the Hoover dike holding back the water from inundating the surrounding populated area. Some claim that sugar plantations have been pumping polluted water from their flooded fields into the lake, but U.S. Sugar claims back pumping is only to avoid flooding of communities, never to protect farmland. 

In March 2015, the rate was daily. This results in pollution problems for the Treasure Coast, St. Lucie estuary, and the Indian River Lagoon.

In May 2016, of the southern portion of the lake were affected by an algal bloom. The outbreak was possibly due in part to nutrient-laden waters reaching the lake from farms and other sources. Microcystin was found among the other species involved in the outbreak.

In July 2016, the Federal Government denied Governor Rick Scott&#x27;s request for Federal Disaster Aid to the Treasure Coast as a result of the toxic algal bloom in the St. Lucie Estuary which was responsible for millions of dollars of lost income for local businesses: this reaffirmed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) finding that the lake&#x27;s water quality was a State issue. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and Martin County had carried out toxicity testing on the algae, but had not funded any work to clean up the water, and a FEMA spokesman said that &quot;The state has robust capability to respond to emergencies and disasters.&quot;

On June 23, 2017, the South Florida Water Management District was granted emergency permission to back pump clean water into Lake Okeechobee to save animals and plants in bloated water conservation areas.&quot;

==Uses==
According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the congressionally authorized uses for Lake Okeechobee include the following:
* Flood and storm risk management
* Navigation
* Water supply for the following:
**Salinity control in estuaries
**Regional groundwater control
**Agricultural irrigation
**Municipalities and industry
* Enhancement of fish and wildlife
* Recreation
The wide dike surrounding Lake Okeechobee is the basis for the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail (LOST), a part of the Florida National Scenic Trail, a trail. There is a well-maintained paved pathway along the majority of the perimeter, although with significant breaks. It is used by hikers and bicyclists, and is wide enough to accommodate vehicles.

==Geology==
Lake Okeechobee sits in a shallow geological trough that also underlies the Kissimmee River Valley and the Everglades. The trough is underlain by clay deposits that compacted more than the limestone and sand deposits did along both coasts of peninsular Florida. Until about 6,000 years ago, the trough was dry land. As the sea level rose, the water table in Florida also rose and rainfall increased. From 6,000 to 4,000 years ago, wetlands formed building up peat deposits. Eventually the water flow into the area created a lake, drowning the wetlands. Along what is now the southern edge of the lake, the wetlands built up the layers of peat rapidly enough (reaching thick) to form a dam, until the lake overflowed into the Everglades. At its capacity, the lake holds of water and is the headwaters of the Everglades.

The floor of the lake is a limestone basin, with a maximum depth of . Its water is somewhat murky from runoff from surrounding farmlands.

== Hydrology ==
Lake Okeechobee is a shallow lake, with an average depth of only , and has a fetch of . In total, the lake has a surface area of . The lake is normally mixed, but on days with direct sunlight and limited wind, the lake can exhibit diurnal thermal stratification. Although daily thermal stratification is brief, a hypolimnion can form during this time resulting in decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen at the lake bottom. Lake transparency, measured as secchi depth, is found to be inversely correlated with the amount of suspended solids in the lake. Suspended solids varied with season with higher amounts of suspended solids in the winter, and thus less transparency on average, and lower amounts of suspended solids in the summer, leading to more transparency on average. Secchi depths not only varied across seasons, but also by location in the lake. Secchi depths ranges average from about in the winter, depending on location in the lake, and in the summer. Secchi depths of have been recorded, indicating higher transparencies than average for the lake.

Water flows into Lake Okeechobee from several sources, including the Kissimmee River, Fisheating Creek, Lake Istokpoga, Taylor Creek, and smaller sources such as Nubbin Slough and Nicodemus Slough. The Kissimmee River is the largest source, providing more than 60% of the water flowing into Lake Okeechobee. Fisheating Creek is the second largest source for the lake, with about 9% of the total inflow. Prior to the 20th century, Lake Istokpoga was connected to the Kissimmee River by Istokpoga Creek, but during the rainy season Lake Istokpoga overflowed, with the water flowing in a 40 km wide sheet across the Indian Prairie into Lake Okeechobee. Today Lake Istokpoga drains into Lake Okeechobee through several canals that drain the Indian Prairie, and into the Kissimmee River through a canal that has replaced Istokpoga Creek.

Historically, outflow from the lake was by sheet flow over the Everglades, but most of the outflow has been diverted to dredged canals connecting to coastal rivers, such as the Miami Canal to the Miami River, the New River on the east, and the Caloosahatchee River (via the Caloosahatchee Canal and Lake Hicpochee) on the southwest.

The Army Corps of Engineers targets keeping the surface of the lake between above sea level. The lake is enclosed by a high Herbert Hoover Dike built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after a hurricane in 1928 breached the old dike, flooding surrounding communities and killing at least 2,500 people.

During construction of the dike, earth was excavated along the inside perimeter, resulting in a deep channel which runs along the perimeter of the lake. This channel is known as the rim canal. In most places the canal is part of the lake, but in others it is separated from the open lake by low grassy islands such as Kreamer Island. During the drought of 2007–2008, this canal remained navigable while much of surrounding areas were too shallow or even above the water line. Even when the waters are higher, navigating the open lake can be difficult, whereas the rim canal is easier, so to reach a specific location in the lake it is often easiest to use the rim canal to get close then take one of the many channels into the lake.

One area of the lake is called the &quot;Monkey Box&quot; area, after a strange now-eroded beacon located inside a wooden box on top of a marker pole, which resembled from a distance a monkey&#x27;s head inside a box.

== Limnology ==
Lake Okeechobee is home to more than 40 species of native fish, along with introduced species, such as the Mayan cichlid, &quot;Cichlasoma urophthalmus&quot;. Fish species displaying varying distributions throughout the lake depending on seasonality, site depth, sediments, and turbidity. Yearly fish recruitment was found to be positively correlated with increased water levels, providing more substrate and protection. These fish populations support different wading birds, including various species of egrets, ibises, wood storks, and herons, along with alligator populations. Fish diets in Lake Okeechobee depend on macro-invertebrates and zooplankton, such as calanoids, cyclopoids, and cladocerans. Lake Okeechobee supports over 3,800 different arthropods, including insects and arachnids, along with around 400 species of nematodes.

The most common fish in this lake are largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill. Pickerel have been less commonly caught.

=== Flora ===
Vascular macrophytes are important in the nutrient dynamics of lakes, along with creating micro-habitats for fish and invertebrates, and providing substrate for epiphytes. Macrophytes provide the lake with oxygen through photosynthesis, along with acting as a buffer for eutrophication by uptake of phosphorus. However, with increased eutrophication of lakes along with climate change, trends are showing decreased richness of macrophytes. Because the fauna are so reliant on the macrophytes for habitat, food, and protection from predation, a decrease in macrophyte diversity and abundance has negative consequences on fauna richness. Macrophyte abundance is dependent on many abiotic factors such as water depth, water transparency and light availability, and nutrients, along with influence of biotic factors. Increasing phytoplankton and algal blooms from eutrophication and nutrient abundance can decrease water transparency and light availability to submerged macrophytes, providing one explanation how macrophytes are sensitive to eutrophication. Some submerged macrophytes that have been recorded at Lake Okeechobee include southern naiad (&quot;Najas guadalupensis&quot;), Illinois pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton illlinoensis&quot;), vallisneria (&quot;Vallisneria americana&quot;), and hydrilla (&quot;Hydrilla verticillata&quot;). Lake Okeechobee is afflicted with the invasive terrestrial plant torpedograss (&quot;Panicum repens&quot;).

=== Eutrophication and algal blooms ===
This shallow lake has been previously studied for its algal blooms. Lake Okeechobee is known for its algal blooms in consequence of increased eutrophication. Algal blooms like this can be harmful to the environment, including the lake&#x27;s flora and fauna, because of released toxins. The vegetation at Lake Okeechobee is important in maintaining the oxygen in the lake on which many aquatic biota rely. There are various species of biota in Lake Okeechobee that are interdependent on each other for food, habitat, and other resources. Multiple limnological studies and related research has been conducted at Lake Okeechobee.

The concerning levels of total phosphorus (TP) began to be noticed in 1970s, and since then inputs of TP have averaged 516 tons per year. These yearly inputs can vary based on the volume of runoff entering the lake. The years 2005 and 2018 had particularly large volumes of water and TP inputs in relation to hurricanes increasing runoff. Despite limiting TP inputs by decreasing phosphorus use in agriculture, Lake Okeechobee has yet to reach the aimed target set by the South Florida Water Management District&#x27;s in the 1980s of reducing the lake&#x27;s TP by 40 μg/L. Although proposed by the South Florida Water Management District, this initiative of limiting the lake&#x27;s TP to 40 μg/L was adopted by The Lake Okeechobee Technical Advisory Committee (LOTAC), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), but phosphorus inputs have yet to be controlled enough to reach this goal. Concerning estimates of phosphorus assimilation capacity indicates that even if phosphorus inputs were to be stopped, or severely limited, the extensive saturation of the lake would result in it taking years before improved water quality can be observed.
These inputs of phosphorus provide optimal conditions for harmful algal blooms (HABs). Cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs), which need nitrogen and phosphorus for growth, have the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. With this ability along with the high inputs of phosphorus, the shallow nature of the lake providing plenty of sunlight, and cyanobacteria&#x27;s preference for warm waters, Lake Okeechobee is an optimal environment for a cyanobacteria algal bloom. The presence of various species of cyanobacteria in Lake Okeechobee have been recorded since the 1980s. Cyanobacteria produce various toxins, including microcystin, which is not only harmful to the environment, but humans. 

In 2016, Lake Okeechobee experienced an extensive cyanobacteria algal bloom that lasted from May to mid-July. During the previous 2015–16 winter, there were relatively high recorded temperatures, and higher than average rates of precipitation and storms in relation to the El Niño event. As mentioned, higher rates of precipitation can lead to greater influxes of runoff which unload more phosphorus into the lake, enabling harmful algal bloom. Along with this algal bloom in 2016, other algal blooms have been found to occur in relation to hurricanes and other climate events leading to increased water flow into the lake.

==== Research ====
Research done by James et al. (2009) aimed to evaluate and compare shallow lakes, including Lake Okeechobee and Lake Taihu in P.R. China, including their light, temperature, and nutrient dynamics. This research provides important knowledge on conditions that influence algal blooms. They found that for both lakes, wind, nutrients, water depth, and water transparency varied seasonally, and this had implications on phytoplankton abundance. Different locations in the lake may have had different limiting factors based on the light and nutrient availability in those locations. At Lake Okeechobee specifically, algal blooms were found to have strong effects during the winter on the western side of the lake.

In the limnological study conducted by Beaver et al. (2013) at Lake Okeechobee, lake phytoplankton composition was examined in response to conditions of anthropogenic inputs, including nutrient inputs, along with natural events, like extreme weather conditions. Lake Okeechobee was a great location for this study because of its long history of agricultural runoff causing algal blooms, along with its location in the Gulf of Mexico making it susceptible to weather events like tropical storms and hurricanes. From 2000–2008, phytoplankton samples were collected using an integrated tube sampler, and weather conditions, including temperature and wind conditions, were recorded. They found that phytoplankton composition transitioned from non-nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria dominating the lake before 2000, to nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria dominating the lake after 2000 and up until 2004 as phosphorus inputs were high and nitrogen was limiting. This time was referred to as the &quot;pre-hurricane&quot; time period, and the period after the 2004–2005 hurricane season was referred to as the &quot;post-hurricane&quot; period. During the post-hurricane period, light became limiting and influenced phytoplankton composition.

Kramer et al. (2018) studied Lake Okeechobee during and after its major 2016 algal bloom that was related to the El Niño event. They collected information on nutrient availability, phytoplankton communities, and the presence of toxins, along with the genetic makeup of the phytoplankton communities and their genetic abilities to produce toxins. Additionally, they conducted nutrient experiments to couple with their findings. They found that cyanobacteria with the ability to do nitrogen fixation were in high abundance during this 2016 algal bloom. During this time, nitrogen was a limiting factor due to the extreme amounts of phosphorus in the freshwater ecosystem. The field experiments conducted with this study found that microcystin, the toxin produced by cyanobacteria, was produced in higher quantities when there was more nitrogen present.

A study conducted by Pei, Zhang, and Mitsch (2020) examined nitrate concentrations, and their respective isotope compositions, in hopes of determining origins of major inflows and outflows of nitrogen into the lake and what their respective contributions are. They found that ammonium based fertilizers and soil nitrogen were the largest contributors to nitrate found in the lake. Manure and precipitation were two other sources of nitrate. These results can aid in monitoring and regulation of nitrogen uses around Okeechobee, and subsequently aid in restoring the lake.

<text>National Signing Day has traditionally been the first day that a high school senior can sign a binding National Letter of Intent for a collegiate sport with a school that is a Division II member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States.

Although all NCAA Division I and II sports have at least one national signing day, college football&#x27;s signing days typically receive the most attention from sports media. Traditionally, college football&#x27;s National Signing Day is the first Wednesday of February. As of 2017, college football has an additional national signing day for early signees during the third week of December, meaning recruits have the opportunity to sign with their college team over a month before the regular signing period.

==History==
Until 1981, several college football conferences, including the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), held conference signing days on the second Saturday in December to have recruits sign conference letters-of-intent. The College Football Association, led by several prominent college head football coaches, proposed a resolution to eliminate conference signing days during their 1980 convention, and have a singular signing day in their places, called a national signing day. In 1981, the last year for conference signing days, recruits had to sign both conference and national letters-of-intent if their school was in the Big Eight or Southwest Conferences (four members of the latter conference later joined the former, which became known as the Big 12 Conference after the expansion). The conference letters-of-intent restricted a recruit to signing with only one school in a conference, but was unrestricted to signing with a school outside of the conference. The national letters-of-intent restricted a recruit to signing with only one school in the NCAA. National signing day has typically been on the first Wednesday in February.

In April 2017, the NCAA Division I Council voted to reinstate an early signing period in football, effective with the 2017–18 school year. The Collegiate Commissioners Association approved the new NCAA rule the following month, setting the early signing window for high schoolers as the first three days of the current early signing window for junior college players.

On October 9, 2024, the NCAA Division I Council abolished the NLI program for that division, effective immediately. The NLI was replaced by written offers of athletic financial aid that provide most of the NLI&#x27;s core functions. The abolition of the NLI in Division I was reportedly tied to the settlement of the &quot;House v. NCAA&quot; legal case, expected to lead to a revenue-sharing model across college sports.

<text>In mathematics, in particular field theory, the conjugate elements or algebraic conjugates of an algebraic element , over a field extension , are the roots of the minimal polynomial of over . Conjugate elements are commonly called conjugates in contexts where this is not ambiguous. Normally itself is included in the set of conjugates of .

Equivalently, the conjugates of are the images of under the field automorphisms of that leave fixed the elements of . The equivalence of the two definitions is one of the starting points of Galois theory.

The concept generalizes the complex conjugation, since the algebraic conjugates over formula_1 of a complex number are the number itself and its &quot;complex conjugate&quot;.

==Example==
The cube roots of the number one are:

: formula_2

The latter two roots are conjugate elements in with minimal polynomial

: formula_3

==Properties==
If &quot;K&quot; is given inside an algebraically closed field &quot;C&quot;, then the conjugates can be taken inside &quot;C&quot;. If no such &quot;C&quot; is specified, one can take the conjugates in some relatively small field &quot;L&quot;. The smallest possible choice for &quot;L&quot; is to take a splitting field over &quot;K&quot; of &quot;p&quot;&quot;K&quot;,&quot;α&quot;, containing &quot;α&quot;. If &quot;L&quot; is any normal extension of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;α&quot;, then by definition it already contains such a splitting field.

Given then a normal extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, with automorphism group Aut(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) = &quot;G&quot;, and containing &quot;α&quot;, any element &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; will be a conjugate of &quot;α&quot;, since the automorphism &quot;g&quot; sends roots of &quot;p&quot; to roots of &quot;p&quot;. Conversely any conjugate &quot;β&quot; of &quot;α&quot; is of this form: in other words, &quot;G&quot; acts transitively on the conjugates. This follows as &quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) is &quot;K&quot;-isomorphic to &quot;K&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) by irreducibility of the minimal polynomial, and any isomorphism of fields &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F″&quot; that maps polynomial &quot;p&quot; to &quot;p″&quot; can be extended to an isomorphism of the splitting fields of &quot;p&quot; over &quot;F&quot; and &quot;p″&quot; over &quot;F″&quot;, respectively.

In summary, the conjugate elements of &quot;α&quot; are found, in any normal extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; that contains &quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), as the set of elements &quot;g&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) for &quot;g&quot; in Aut(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;). The number of repeats in that list of each element is the separable degree [&quot;L&quot;:&quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)]sep.

A theorem of Kronecker states that if &quot;α&quot; is a nonzero algebraic integer such that &quot;α&quot; and all of its conjugates in the complex numbers have absolute value at most 1, then &quot;α&quot; is a root of unity. There are quantitative forms of this, stating more precisely bounds (depending on degree) on the largest absolute value of a conjugate that imply that an algebraic integer is a root of unity.

<text>The Territory of Oklahoma was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 2, 1890, until November 16, 1907, when it was joined with the Indian Territory under a new constitution and admitted to the Union as the state of Oklahoma.

The 1890 Oklahoma Organic Act organized the western half of Indian Territory and a strip of country north of Texas known as No Man&#x27;s Land (now the Oklahoma Panhandle) into Oklahoma Territory. Native American reservations in the new territory were then opened to settlement in a series of land runs in 1890, 1891, and 1893.

Seven counties were defined upon the creation of the territory. They were originally designated by number and eventually became Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne, and Beaver counties. The Land Run of 1893 led to the addition of Kay, Grant, Woods, Garfield, Noble, and Pawnee counties. In 1896, the Oklahoma Territory acquired Greer County, Texas when the Supreme Court resolved the boundary case &quot;United States v. State of Texas&quot; in favor of the federal government. Today, this land in the southwest corner of the state is split into Greer, Jackson, Harmon, and part of Beckham counties.

==History==

===Organization===
Oklahoma Territory began with the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 when the United States Congress set aside land for Native Americans. At the time, the land was unorganized territory that consisted of the federal land &quot;west of the Mississippi and not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana, or the territory of Arkansas...&quot; By 1856, the territory had been reduced to approximately the modern-day borders of the state of Oklahoma, except for the Oklahoma Panhandle and Old Greer County. These lands became known as Indian Territory, as they had been granted to certain Indian nations under the Indian Removal Act, in exchange for their historic territories east of the Mississippi River.

Until this point, Native Americans had exclusively used the land. In 1866, after the American Civil War, the federal government required new treaties with the tribes that had supported the Confederacy and forced them into land and other concessions. As a result of the Reconstruction Treaties, The Five Civilized Tribes were required to emancipate their slaves and offer them full citizenship in the tribes if they wanted to stay in the Nations. This forced many of the tribes in Indian Territory into making concessions.

U.S. officials forced the cession of some of land in the center of the Indian Nation Territory. Elias C. Boudinot, a railroad lobbyist, wrote an article that was published in the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; on February 17, 1879, that popularized the term Unassigned Lands to refer to this tract. Soon the popular press began referring to the people agitating for its settlement as Boomers. To prevent settlement of the land by European-Americans, President Rutherford B. Hayes issued a proclamation forbidding unlawful entry into Indian Territory in April 1879.

===David Payne and the Boomers===
Despite federal obstruction, popular demands for the land did not end. Captain David L. Payne was one of the main supporters of the opening of Oklahoma to White settlement. Payne traveled to Kansas, where he founded the Boomer &quot;Colonial Association&quot;. Payne&#x27;s organization of 10,000 members hoped to establish a white colony in the Unassigned Lands. The formation of the group prompted President Hayes to issue a proclamation ordering Payne not to enter Indian Territory on February 12, 1880. In response, Payne and his group traveled to Camp Alice in the Unassigned Lands, east of Oklahoma City. There, they made plans for a city, which they named &quot;Ewing&quot;. The Fourth Cavalry arrested them and escorted them back to Kansas. Payne was furious, as the Posse Comitatus Act prohibited the military from interfering in civil matters. The federal government freed Payne and his party, effectively denying them access to the courts.

Anxious to prove his case in court, Payne and a larger group returned to Ewing in July. The Army again arrested the party and escorted them back to Kansas. Again they were freed, but this time the federal government charged Payne with trespassing under the Indian Intercourse Act; he went to trial in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Judge Isaac C. Parker ruled against Payne and fined him the maximum amount of $1,000. Since Payne had no money and no property, the government could not collect the fine. The ruling settled nothing on the question of the public domain lands, and Payne continued his activities.

Payne tried a third time to enter the Unassigned Lands. In December, Payne and his group moved along the northern border of Indian Territory. They were followed by a unit of cavalry under the command of Colonel J. J. Copinger. Copinger warned Payne that if he crossed the border that they would be &quot;forcibly resisted&quot;. As the number of Boomers grew as people joined Payne, they sent a messenger to President Hayes asking permission to enter Indian Territory. After weeks of no response, Payne led his followers to the Unassigned Lands. Once again, they were arrested and Payne was sent back to Fort Smith. He was found guilty and sentenced to pay a $1,000 fine. Upon his release, he returned to Kansas, where he spent the next four years trying to open Oklahoma.

During Payne&#x27;s last venture, this time into the Cherokee Outlet in 1884, the Army again arrested him. They took him several hundred miles under severe physical circumstances over a tortuous route to Ft. Smith. The public was outraged about his treatment by the military, and the U.S. government decided to try his case. Payne was turned over to the United States district court at Topeka, Kansas. He was indicted for the crime of bringing whiskey into Indian Territory, a federal offense. In the fall term, Judge Cassius G. Foster quashed the indictments and ruled that settling on the Unassigned Lands was not a criminal offense. The Boomers celebrated, but the federal government refused to accept the decision.

Payne immediately planned another expedition, but he did not lead it. On November 28, 1884, in Wellington, Kansas, the morning after a late-night address to the Boomers, he collapsed and died.

===William Couch and the opening===

After Payne&#x27;s death, his associate, William L. Couch, assumed the leadership role. Couch moved the Boomers into Indian Territory and founded Camp Stillwater on December 12, 1884. President Chester Arthur sent a small detachment of troops to escort Couch out of the territory. When the soldiers arrived, 200 armed men met them and refused to move. After 600 troops arrived as reinforcements, the officers gave the Boomers the choice of leaving within 48 hours or being apprehended. After the Boomers refused to leave, the commanders moved their troops across the Kansas border and cut off Couch&#x27;s supply lines. Soon their food was gone, and Couch and the other Boomers were escorted back to Kansas.

In response to Couch&#x27;s claims that the federal government was discriminating against them, on March 3, 1885, Congress approved the Indian Appropriations Act of 1885. This act authorized negotiations for the cession of unoccupied lands belonging to the Creek, the Seminole, and the Cherokee. Couch stopped being a colonist and became a lobbyist.

Couch spent four years in Washington, D.C., trying to convince Congress to open the Oklahoma lands. Many Indians from the Five Civilized Tribes lobbied against Couch&#x27;s actions. In January 1889, Pleasant Porter led a group of Muscogee (Creek) who offered to sell their unoccupied lands. Within weeks, they sold their &quot;Unassigned Lands&quot; to the United States. These lands embraced less than in the heart of Indian Territory.

On March 2, 1889, Congress passed an amendment to the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871, which provided for the creation of homestead settlements in the unassigned lands, to be known as &quot;Oklahoma Territory&quot;. President Benjamin Harrison announced that the Oklahoma lands would be opened on April 22 via land run.

===Land Run and the Sooners===
The Land Run of 1889, the first land run in the territory&#x27;s history, opened Oklahoma Territory to settlement on April 22, 1889. Over 50,000 people entered the lands on the first day, among them thousands of freedmen and descendants of slaves. Couch and his Boomers, now numbering approximately 14,000, also entered the race. Those who entered Oklahoma before the official start of the race were called Sooners. The term referred to the &quot;sooner clause&quot; in the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which states that anyone who violated the official start would be denied a claim to the land.

When the run began at noon, men on thousands of horses, wagons, buggies, carts, and vehicles rushed across to Oklahoma. The law-abiders fought with the Sooners on several instances. A legal pioneer shot and wounded William Couch, a Sooner. He died on April 21, 1890, as a result of his wounds. 

When the race was over, many disappointed pioneers were forced to leave the area without any claim. Of the 14,000 Boomers, only 1,000 had made claims. Tent cities grew overnight at Oklahoma City, Kingfisher, El Reno, Norman, Guthrie, and Stillwater, which were the first of the large settlements. Many lawsuits resulted because more than one person claimed a particular piece of land. Often this involved trying to determine which party was a legal claimant. A portion of the cases even went as far as the U.S. Supreme Court.

===Early territorial period===

By the end of the day on April 22, 1889, there were more than enough settlers in the Unassigned Lands to require creation of a territorial government. However, the brief legislation that provided for the opening of the land called for no form of government in Oklahoma. No local police or courts were established; federal military troops provided law enforcement, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas under federal judge Isaac C. Parker was the only form of criminal and civil jurisdictions. Despite that, the district was generally peaceful. Most land disputes were settled without bloodshed, although a few took years to resolve. For over a year the people of Oklahoma Territory were semi-autonomous.

On May 2, 1890, Congress passed the Oklahoma Organic Act, which organized the western half of Indian Territory into Oklahoma Territory. The eastern half remained under Indian rule, predominantly that of the Five Civilized Tribes, as Indian Territory. Congress included in Oklahoma Territory the strip of country known as No Man&#x27;s Land, embracing , which became Beaver County. In September 1890, the of the Sac and Fox, Iowa, and Pottawatomie reservations in the eastern part of Oklahoma Territory were opened to settlement. The following spring, the of Cheyenne and Arapaho lands in the center of the territory were opened. On September 16, 1893, the Cherokee Outlet was opened to settlement, adding of land. In 1895, the Kickapoo reservation of was settled, and the year following Greer County, which had been considered a portion of Texas, was given to the territory by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. These developments, with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache and Wichita reservations just opened, gave Oklahoma Territory a settled area of , of which was still included in Indian reservations.

===Path to statehood===
With the passage of the Organic Act of 1890, Oklahoma Territory existed from 1890 to 1907. During that time, seven governors and two acting governors administered the territory. During its 17-year existence, little of note occurred because of the growing idea of statehood, which had originated in Indian Territory. Most of the governors stayed in office for only a few months; institutions founded during this time were the University of Oklahoma, the Territorial Normal School (University of Central Oklahoma), and the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical School (Oklahoma State University).

Representatives of the Five Civilized Tribes met in 1902 to work on securing statehood for Indian Territory and held a convention in Eufaula. The representatives met again in 1903 to organize a constitutional convention. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention met in Muskogee on August 21, 1905. General Pleasant Porter, Principal Chief of the Creek Nation, was elected as president of the convention. The elected delegates decided that the executive officers of the Five Civilized Tribes would be appointed as vice-presidents: William C. Rogers, Principal Chief of the Cherokees; William H. Murray, appointed by Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston to represent the Chickasaw; Chief Green McCurtain of the Choctaw; Chief John Brown of the Seminole; and Charles N. Haskell, appointed by Porter to represent the Creek.

The convention drafted a constitution, drew up a plan of organization for the government, put together a map showing the counties to be established, and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood. The convention&#x27;s proposals were presented in a referendum in Indian Territory, in which they were overwhelmingly endorsed. The delegation received a cool reception in Washington. Eastern politicians, fearing the admission of two more Western states, put pressure on President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt recommended that the Indian and Oklahoma Territories be granted joint statehood, which led to Congress passing the Oklahoma Enabling Act to allow this upon writing and ratifying a constitution.

The hard work of the Sequoyah State Constitutional Convention was not entirely lost. When representatives from Indian Territory joined the Oklahoma State Constitutional Convention in Guthrie the next year, they brought their constitutional experience with them. The Sequoyah Constitution served in large part as the basis for the constitution of the State of Oklahoma, which came into being with the merger of the two territories in 1907.

Territorial Governor Frank Frantz oversaw the transition from territory to state. He was selected as the Republican nominee to serve as the state&#x27;s first governor. He faced the Democratic Charles N. Haskell in the election on September 17, 1907. In the same election, the Oklahoma Constitution was proposed. The constitution was passed and Haskell was elected governor. Once the people of Oklahoma adopted the United States Constitution on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma and Indian Territories officially dissolved, and the State of Oklahoma was admitted to the Union as the 46th state.
==Government==
With the passage of the Oklahoma organic act in 1890, the territorial government came into existence. The territorial government had no constitution, except for sections of the organic act creating it, which served as a semi-governing document. The organic act provided for a complete organization of the territory, defined the functions of the territorial government, placed limitations upon the acts of the legislative assembly, as well as that of the territorial officers. It also designated the town of Guthrie as the territorial capital.

Congress provided for the creation of a legislative branch elected by the people, but the executive and judicial branches of the territories were selected and appointed by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the United States Senate. The appointees included a governor, a secretary, three federal judges and a marshal. President Benjamin Harrison appointed George Washington Steele, a Republican from Indiana, as the first territorial governor.

===Legislative branch===
The organic act called for the establishment of a bicameral Territorial Legislative Assembly composed of a Territorial Council, the upper house of the assembly, and Territorial House of Representatives, the lower house of the assembly. The assembly could only create laws consistent with the Constitution of the United States and the organic act but did not require the consent of Congress to take effect. They had the same force of law, as did a law passed by a regular state government. Laws enacted by the assembly could be suspended by the President of the United States or revoked, in part or in their entirety, by an act of Congress.

When Steele took office, he issued an executive order on July 8, 1890, calling for the first elections to the assembly. The election was set for August 5, 1890. The assembly was to have convened August 12, but owing to the death of two members-elect, a special election was called, and the convening of the legislature was postponed until August 27, 1890.

The territorial assembly met for 120-day sessions in Guthrie. The first legislative session was narrowly divided between Republican and Democratic Party members, with Republicans having a slight edge in representatives. However, the Democrats allied with delegates from the People&#x27;s Party (Populists) and thereby controlled both houses. Populist delegates were elected as presiding officers in both. The legislators spent most of the session arguing about the locations of the capital, the state university, state teachers&#x27; college, and the agricultural school. Only near the end of the session did they begin to address other issues necessary to create and maintain the territory. Steele became so disgusted by the political stalemate that he resigned his position and returned to Indiana. The Oklahoma Territorial Legislature met for the last time in 1905.

===Executive branch===
The territorial governor was vested with the executive power of the territory, was responsible for ensuring that its laws were faithfully executed, and served as the symbol of the federal government in the territory. The governor was the ex officio commander-in-chief of the territorial militia and the federal troops in the territory as well as ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs. The governor possessed the power to grant pardons for offenses against the laws of the territory. He could grant reprieves for offenses against the laws of the United States until the president made his decision on the matter. It was also the duty of the governor to outline the boundaries of the counties, name the county seats, and to appoint territorial and county officers with the consent of the territorial council.

Laws passed by the territorial assembly had to be presented to the governor for his approval. If he did not approve, he would veto if and return it to the assembly for reconsideration. The governor&#x27;s veto could only be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the territorial assembly. The governor also had the right to convene the assembly into special session.

The territorial secretary served as the chief assistant to the governor, and in the event of a vacancy of the governorship the secretary would serve as the acting governor until the president appointed a new one. The secretary was responsible for recording and preserving the laws and proceedings of the assembly and the acts and proceedings of the governor. Copy of the same would semi-annually be submitted to the president, the President of the United States Senate, and the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives for their review.

A territorial attorney was responsible for giving legal advice to the governor and assembly, served as the chief law enforcement official of the territory, and represented Oklahoma Territory and the United States in court cases. The territorial marshal was responsible for protecting the court system and for executing processes issued from the territorial courts.

====List of governors====
===Judicial branch===
The territory&#x27;s judiciary consisted of a territorial supreme court made up of three justices, a chief justice and two associate justices. Additional associate justices were added later as more counties were created in the territory. The judiciary was given a wide jurisdiction. It functioned as a United States Federal Court, but its jurisdiction extended to a trial of cases, both civil and criminal, arising under the code enacted by the territorial assembly. The court could sit half of the day as a federal court and the other half as territorial court. It would also serve as a supreme court and hear cases that had been appealed from territory&#x27;s lower courts.

President Benjamin Harrison appointed Edward B. Green of Illinois as the first chief justice and John G. Clark of Wisconsin and Abraham J. Seay of Missouri as the first associate justices.

Oklahoma Territory was divided into seven Judicial Districts in 1902, as follows:
*First – Logan, Lincoln and Payne Counties
*Second – Canadian, Kingfisher, Cleveland, Washita and Custer Counties
*Third – Oklahoma and Pottawatomie Counties
*Fourth – Noble, Kay and Pawnee Counties
*Fifth – Garfield, Grant, Blaine and Roger Mills Counties
*Sixth – Woods, Woodward, Beaver, Day and Dewey Counties
*Seventh – Caddo, Comanche, Kiowa and Greer Counties

Charles Brown of Kansas was named the first Attorney General and Horace Speed of Guthrie (formerly of Indiana) was appointed the first United States attorney in Oklahoma.

===Federal representation===
The territory was entitled to elect one delegate to the United States House of Representatives to serve a two-year term. While unable to vote in the full House, the delegate was allowed to vote in a House committee of which the delegate was a member. The first territorial representative was David A. Harvey.

Four men represented Oklahoma Territory as non-voting delegates in the United States House of Representatives:

==Counties==
===Original counties===
When Oklahoma Territory was created in 1890, seven counties were defined and designated numerically. Thereafter, when additional lands were opened to settlement, new counties were designated by the letters of the alphabet. Later, by vote of the people, these were given permanent county names. The first seven numbered counties later were named as follows: Logan, Cleveland, Oklahoma, Canadian, Kingfisher, Payne and Beaver.

The Secretary of the Interior defined the boundaries and assigned the names of the three counties to be defined and their names assigned by executive proclamation when the Kiowa-Comanche and Wichita-Caddo Reservations were opened to settlement in 1901.

===Greer County===
Greer County, created by the Texas legislature on February 8, 1860, and named for John Alexander Greer, a Texas lieutenant governor, was land claimed by both Texas and the United States. The dispute arose from a map submitted with the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. The treaty stated that the boundary between the French claims on the north and the Spanish claims on the south of the United States was the Rio Roxo de Natchitoches (Red River) until it reached the 100th meridian west, as noted on John Melish&#x27;s map published in 1818. However, the upper reaches of the Red River were not surveyed, as required by the fourth article of the treaty, until 1852. The problem was that the 100th meridian on the Melish map was approximately east of the true 100th meridian and the Red River forked about east of the 100th meridian. Another survey team discovered the mapping error in 1857 and showed that the southern fork was the Red River should be the correct boundary described by the Adams–Onís Treaty. Texas rejected that assertion and claimed the land south of the North Fork. The United States claimed the land north of the South Fork (previously named the Prairie Dog Town River).

Texas continued to claim sovereignty over Greer County during and after the Civil War. It opened the land to veterans of the Texas Revolution and Confederate Army veterans and leased land to ranchers. In 1884, President Chester A. Arthur took a more active role in looking for a resolution of the dispute. However, the attempt failed to resolve anything. Meanwhile, area residents officially organized Greer County as a Texas entity in 1886, designating Mangum as the county seat. In 1890, Congress passed the Oklahoma Organic Act, which required the United States attorney general to resolve the boundary issue by filing suit against Texas.

The dispute went directly before the Supreme Court, since no lower court had jurisdiction. The court&#x27;s opinion, in &quot;United States v. State of Texas&quot; , issued on March 16, 1892, held that the land of approximately 1.5 million acres (6070 km2/2345 mi2) belonged to the United States. Following that ruling, on May 4, 1896, the land was officially assigned by Congress to Oklahoma Territory. The Greer County Homestead Law, passed just afterwards, gave the Texas settlers the 160 acres (647,000 m2) they were living on and the option to purchase an additional 160 acres (647,000 m2) for $1.00 per acre ($247/km2).

When Oklahoma became the 46th U.S. state on November 16, 1907, old &quot;Greer County&quot; was divided into Greer, Jackson, and part of Beckham counties. Mangum remained the county seat of the redefined Greer County. Harmon County was created May 22, 1909, by a vote of the people from a portion of Greer County, Oklahoma. Mangum remained the county seat of the redefined Greer County.

<doc id="458469" wikidata="Q1518057" url="?curid=458469" title="Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta">
<text>The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta (often referred to colloquially as Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta) was a provincial centre-right party in the Canadian province of Alberta that existed from 1905 to 2020. The party formed the provincial government, without interruption, from 1971 until the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2015 provincial election under premiers Peter Lougheed, Don Getty, Ralph Klein, Ed Stelmach, Alison Redford, Dave Hancock and Jim Prentice. At 44 years, this was the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian history.

In July 2017, the party membership of the PC and the Wildrose Party voted to approve a merger to become the United Conservative Party (UCP). Due to previous legal restrictions that did not formally permit parties to merge or transfer their assets, the PC Party and Wildrose Party maintained a nominal existence and ran one candidate each in the 2019 election, in which the UCP won a majority, to prevent forfeiture of their assets. The UCP government, under Premier Jason Kenney, later passed legislation allowing parties to merge, clearing the way for the PCs to formally dissolve on February 7, 2020.

==History==
===Origins and early years===
The party was created from the Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party that existed from 1898 to 1905. Unlike its predecessor party, who formed government during its entire existence, the Alberta Conservatives were a marginal party for most of the first 60 years after Alberta became a province. In the province&#x27;s first election, the 1905 election, the Conservatives, led by future Canadian Prime Minister Richard Bennett, won only two seats and were barely able to improve on that in subsequent elections. The main policy difference between the Tories and the Alberta Liberal Party was over the Tories&#x27; belief that the province should control its natural resources, which the province had been denied. However, those concerns fell on deaf ears in the midst of an economic boom. Additionally, the Liberals had the advantage of incumbency; they were in office on an interim basis pending the first election.

===On the political sidelines===
In the 1913 election, the Tories achieved a breakthrough, winning 18 seats and 45% of the vote. Despite this result, and an even better result in the 1917 election, they were still unable to beat the Liberals. The Tories then split into &#x27;traditional&#x27; and &#x27;radical&#x27; camps. The party collapsed, and was unable to run a full slate of candidates in the 1921 election. Only one Conservative Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) was returned to the Legislative Assembly in this election, in which the new United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) defeated the Liberals, and took power.

For the next 45 years, the Tories were unable to elect more than a half dozen MLAs. The party was marginalized after the UFA was able to negotiate the province&#x27;s control of its resources from Ottawa, denying the Tories their major policy plank.

In 1935, the UFA collapsed. The Social Credit Party of Alberta took power on a populist and Christian conservative platform. Social Credit attracted conservative voters for decades, particularly after the party moved away from its radical social credit economic theories, and embraced fiscal conservatism.

===The party in the 1940s and 1950s===
In the late 1930s, the Conservatives and Liberals formed a united front in an attempt to fight Social Credit and, as a result, no Conservative candidates ran in 1940, the 1944, or 1948. Supporters of both parties ran instead as &quot;independents&quot;.

The failure of the coalition strategy led to the reemergence of separate Liberal and Conservative parties in the early 1950s. The Tories only nominated five candidates in the 1952 election, only one of whom won election. The Conservatives were led in the general election of 1959 by William J. Cameron Kirby, Member for Red Deer from 1954 to 1959.

The Tories became &quot;Progressive Conservatives&quot; in 1959 in order to conform with the name of the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. The party continued to be unable to improve their fortunes, and by 1963 was swept out of the legislature altogether.

===The party under Peter Lougheed and Don Getty===
In March 1965, Peter Lougheed became leader of the party, and began transforming it into a political force by combining fiscal conservatism with a modernist, urban outlook. This approach was in stark contrast to the parochialism and rural agrarianism of Social Credit. In particular, the party started gaining support in Calgary and Edmonton. Social Credit had been very popular in urban areas for decades—indeed, long-serving Premier Ernest Manning represented an Edmonton riding. However, at bottom, it was a rural-based party, and never lost this essential character. It was thus slow to adapt to the changes in Alberta as its two largest cities gained increasing influence.

In 1967, the Tories returned to the legislature, electing six MLAs. Lougheed became Leader of the Opposition.

In 1968, Manning retired after 25 years, and was replaced by Harry Strom. After having spent nearly all of its 33-year history as the governing party, Social Credit had grown tired and complacent. Albertans, particularly those associated with the booming oil industry, began to turn to the young and dynamic Lougheed Tories. They were very active for an opposition in a Westminster system, introducing 21 bills. Over the next four years, Lougheed saw his small caucus grow to 10 members as a result of two by-election wins—one of which was Manning&#x27;s old Edmonton seat—and two floor-crossings.

In the 1971 election, the Progressive Conservatives campaigned on a simple theme — &quot;NOW!&quot; — symbolizing their goal of increasing Alberta&#x27;s clout in Canada. On August 30, the Tories won power for the first time in Alberta&#x27;s history. They finished only four percentage points ahead of Social Credit. However, they swept Edmonton and took all but five seats in Calgary. Due to the first past the post system, this gave Lougheed a strong majority government, with 49 of the 75 seats in the legislature. He won a second term in resounding fashion in 1975, reducing the opposition to six MLAs (four Socreds, one New Democrat and one independent) in total. During the Lougheed years, Alberta became a virtual one-party state, much like it had been during the height of the Manning years. Indeed, the six opposition MLAs elected in 1975 would be the most that Lougheed would face during his final three terms. The Tories would govern with fairly large majorities for the next four decades, though nowhere near as large as the ones Lougheed had.

In power, the Progressive Conservatives fought a long battle with the federal government over control of Alberta&#x27;s natural resources (particularly oil). The oil industry provided the Alberta government with large revenue surpluses that allowed it to maintain Alberta as the only province or territory in Canada without a provincial retail sales tax. Alberta experienced a large development boom, particularly in Calgary, in the 1970s and 1980s.

Lougheed retired in 1985, and Don Getty, a former longtime cabinet minister under Lougheed, came out of retirement to succeed him. Getty was unable to match Lougheed&#x27;s dominance in the provincial legislature, but he enjoyed large majorities nevertheless.

===The party under Klein and Stelmach===

While the popularity of the Tories sagged somewhat under Don Getty, it was revived under Ralph Klein, who succeeded Getty as premier in 1992. Klein moved the party sharply to the right, and under his watch the Alberta Tories were one of the most (if not &quot;the&quot; most) right-wing provincial governments in Canada. In contrast, under Lougheed and Getty, the party was considered a classic example of a Red Tory government.

The party&#x27;s rightward turn came at the same time that the Reform Party of Canada replaced the federal Tories as the dominant party in Alberta&#x27;s federal politics. Reform and its successor, the Canadian Alliance, dominated the province&#x27;s federal politics until 2003, when it merged with the federal Tories to become the Conservative Party of Canada. The Alliance&#x27;s first leader, Stockwell Day, was a cabinet minister under Klein.

The party was reduced to 51 seats in the 1993 election, the closest it would come to losing power during its four decades in office. However, he won a larger majority in 1997. In 2001, Klein led the PCs to their biggest majority since the Lougheed era, reducing the opposition to only nine MLAs (seven Liberals, two NDP) in total.

It was viewed as unlikely that a centrist or left-leaning opposition party (the Liberals and NDP, respectively) would be in a serious position to challenge the Conservatives for power in the 2004 general election. The Liberals, New Democrats, and a new right-wing party, the Alberta Alliance, all campaigned aggressively against the Tories in 2004. The Klein government was re-elected, but lost a dozen urban seats. Many pundits expected losses in Edmonton, the traditional heartland of the provincial Liberals; indeed, the Conservatives were cut down to three seats in Edmonton (but subsequently gained a fourth on a recount). However, the Conservatives unexpectedly lost three seats to the Liberals in Calgary, where the Tories had previously held every seat.

The Alliance did not seriously challenge the Tories&#x27; majority, but it was competitive in several rural districts that could formerly have been described as Tory bastions. For instance, the one seat taken by the Alliance, Cardston-Taber-Warner, in the southwest, had been an ultra-safe Tory seat for 30 years. This has led many pundits to conclude that although the Alliance gained less than ten percent of the popular vote in 2004, it was potentially in a position to launch a more serious challenge to the Tories in the future.

On April 4, 2006, after receiving a 55% vote of support from his party, Klein issued a press release expressing his intent to retire. A number of candidates stepped forward as possible replacements for a leadership election in late 2006. Klein officially resigned on September 20, 2006. The first round of voting on November 25 eliminated all but three candidates - Jim Dinning, Ted Morton and Ed Stelmach. None received the required 50% of the vote, so a second round was held on December 2. In the second round, Stelmach was declared the winner. He assumed the premiership on December 14. In mid-2007, the Tories passed the Socreds as the longest-serving government in Alberta history.

Stelmach would go on to stun pundits and even his own supporters when he led the Tories to an increased majority in the 2008 general election, winning 72 of 83 seats. Notably, they won 13 in Edmonton, their highest total in the capital since 1982. The Tories continued to lose ground in Calgary, winning 18 seats to the Liberals&#x27; five. The Liberals were nonetheless reduced to nine seats and the NDP two, and with the Tories re-taking Cardston-Taber-Warner from the renamed Wildrose Alliance in a close race.

===The party under Redford===
On January 25, 2011, Stelmach announced his intention to step down as party leader and Premier prior to the next provincial election as a result of a dispute with his finance minister, Ted Morton, over the provincial budget. Stelmach formally resigned in September 2011. Justice Minister Alison Redford won the following leadership contest on October 2, 2011, and was sworn in as Premier on October 7, 2011, becoming Alberta&#x27;s first female Premier.

Most polls from 2011 onward showed the PCs losing badly to the Wildrose. However, Redford defied expectations by leading the PCs to a 12th consecutive majority government in the 2012 provincial election. The PCs won 61 seats, a loss of only five. On June 18, 2013, the Alberta PCs passed their Ontario counterparts as the second-longest running provincial government in Canadian history; the Ontario PCs spent 42 consecutive years in office from 1943 to 1985.

With her approval rating at 18% and growing caucus discontent, including the defection of two MLAs, Redford announced on March 19, 2014, that she was resigning as Premier effective March 23, 2014. After her departure, it emerged that Redford had used provincial resources for personal and partisan purposes.

===Interim leadership under Hancock and defeat under Prentice===

Deputy Premier Dave Hancock took over as interim leader and premier pending a leadership convention. On September 6, 2014, former federal Conservative cabinet minister Jim Prentice was elected leader on the first ballot with more than 76% of the vote. Two days earlier, the Alberta PCs passed the Nova Scotia Liberals as the longest-serving provincial government in Canadian history; the Nova Scotia Liberals spent 43 consecutive years in government from 1882 to 1925.

On October 27, 2014, the PCs swept four byelections, electing Prentice and three other PC candidates.

On November 24, 2014, Kerry Towle (Innisfail-Sylvan Lake), and Ian Donovan (Little Bow), crossed the floor to join the PC Party&#x27;s caucus giving the turmoil within the Wildrose Party, uncertainty about official opposition Wildrose Party Danielle Smith&#x27;s leadership and confidence in Prentice as reasons for their move. They were followed on December 17, 2014, by Smith and eight other Wildrose members — deputy leader Rob Anderson, Gary Bikman, Rod Fox, Jason Hale, Bruce McAllister, Blake Pedersen, Bruce Rowe and Jeff Wilson — also joining the Progressive Conservative caucus. Smith said that extensive talks with Prentice revealed that she and Prentice had much common ground, and therefore it made no sense for her to continue in opposition. The defections were termed &quot;an unprecedented move in Canadian political history&quot; and reduced the Wildrose Party to just 5 seats, tied with the Liberal Party.

Prentice&#x27;s efforts were not enough to save the PCs from being heavily defeated at the May 5, 2015 provincial election. The Alberta New Democratic Party, led by Rachel Notley, rebounded from fourth place in the legislature to a strong majority government. They actually finished second in the popular vote, more than 50,000 votes ahead of the Wildrose. However, due to a near-total collapse in Edmonton (where they lost every seat) and Calgary (where they won only eight seats), they were reduced to 10 seats–all but two of which were in Calgary–and third place behind the NDP and the Wildrose. The PCs were reduced to their smallest presence in the legislature since 1967. It was one of the largest defeats suffered by a provincial government in Canada. With the result beyond doubt, Prentice immediately announced his resignation as party leader, disclaimed his election to a full term in his Calgary riding, and retired from politics.

Ric McIver was chosen interim leader by caucus on May 11, 2015.

===The party under Kenney and merger===

The 2017 leadership election was held on March 18, 2017, and resulted in former federal cabinet minister Jason Kenney, formerly the Conservative federal MP for Calgary Midnapore, winning on the first ballot. Kenney campaigned on a pledge to seek a merger with the Wildrose and form a unified centre-right party, similar to the Unite the Right movement that formed the federal Conservative Party.

On May 18, 2017, Kenney and Wildrose leader Brian Jean announced that their two parties had come to a merger agreement pending the outcome of votes that will be held by the membership of both parties on July 22, 2017. Pending approval by a margin of 50%+1 of Progressive Conservative members and 75% of Wildrose members, the parties were slated to begin the process of merging into the United Conservative Party, with a leadership election to occur on October 28, 2017, and a founding convention to be held in 2018. On July 22, 2017, Progressive Conservative and the Wildrose members voted, in both cases with 95% of voting members in favour, to approve the merger.

Of the 42,617 Wildrose members eligible to vote on July 22, 2017, there was a 57 per cent turnout with 23,466 voters (95%) in favour of the agreement and 1,132 (5%) against, clearing the 75% threshold required by the party&#x27;s constitution. The Progressive Conservative membership also approved the agreement by a margin of 95% to 5%. With a turnout of 55% of eligible members, 25,692 PC members voted yes and 1,344 voted no with 24 spoiled ballots; the party&#x27;s constitution required a simple majority of its membership to approve the merger.

With the exception of Richard Starke, the entire PC caucus joined the new UCP caucus on July 24, 2017. Starke continued as the lone PC MLA until he announced he would not be running for re-election in the 2019 Provincial Election.

===Post-merger legal status and official dissolution===
Because Alberta electoral law did not permit parties to formally merge (or even to transfer money among themselves), the PC and Wildrose parties did not formally dissolve upon creation of the new UCP. As a result, when the UCP officially came into existence on July 24, 2017; the UCP&#x27;s interim leadership team formally assumed the leaderships of the PC and Wildrose parties as well. In that role, they withdrew both organizations from any meaningful public presence, thus effectively dissolving them although they continued to exist on paper. In order to give &quot;de facto&quot; effect to the merger, all PC members in good standing of as of July 24 became members of the UCP from that date, and all but a few PC members formally withdrew their memberships in the PCs. Legally, the core leadership team of the UCP remained members of both the PC and Wildrose parties. (Notwithstanding this, after he refused to join the UCP caucus, Richard Starke continued to be designated a PC member of the legislature until the 2019 election.)

To maintain their registration through the 2019 Alberta general election, both the PCs and Wildrose ran one paper candidate each in that election. Both of these nominal candidates appeared on the ballot in Edmonton-Strathcona, the riding held by incumbent Premier Notley and considered among the NDP&#x27;s safest seats.

The newly elected UCP government passed legislation allowing parties to merge during the Fall 2019 legislative session. On February 7, 2020, the merger was formally approved by Elections Alberta, allowing the party to officially merge into the UCP and dissolve.

<text>Jordan Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor that competed from 1991 to 2005. The team was named after Irish businessman and founder Eddie Jordan and was based at Silverstone, UK but raced with an Irish licence.

In early 2005, the team was sold to Midland Group, who competed for one final season as &#x27;Jordan&#x27;, before renaming the team as Midland F1 Racing for the season. Later that same year, it was sold to Dutch car manufacturer, Spyker, to become Spyker F1 for the season, and then sold again to become Force India in . In 2018, as a result of the financial collapse of the Force India team, and its subsequent buyout by a consortium led by Lawrence Stroll, the team&#x27;s FIA entry was not transferred, and the Jordan Grand Prix&#x27;s original entry came to an end. As of 2024 the team competes as the Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Eddie Jordan had a brief stint as a race driver in the late 1970s before founding Eddie Jordan Racing in the early 1980s. The team first came to prominence in the 1983 British Formula Three championship with a duel between one-time Jordan test driver Ayrton Senna and Jordan-Ralt driver Martin Brundle. Brundle was edged out by the Brazilian at the last round of the championship. The team graduated to International Formula 3000 for 1988, winning its first race in the category with Johnny Herbert behind the wheel. In 1989, Jordan won the F3000 drivers&#x27; championship with future Formula One star Jean Alesi. The team also ran future F1 drivers such as Martin Donnelly and Eddie Irvine in F3000.

=== Formula One ===

==== The beginning ====

Jordan&#x27;s success in lower formulae inspired the creation of a Formula One programme for the season and a change of name to Jordan Grand Prix. The first driver to test a Jordan F1 car was John Watson. Jordan hired Italian veteran Andrea de Cesaris and Belgian Bertrand Gachot to race his first cars, which were powered by Ford. The team had a very solid debut finishing 5th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, with de Cesaris finishing 9th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. De Cesaris ran second for much of the Belgian Grand Prix, and was actually gaining on leader Ayrton Senna until the car failed in the closing laps. Gachot was sent to prison mid-season for attacking a taxi driver, and was replaced for the by Michael Schumacher. The team received $150,000 from Mercedes-Benz in return for giving their young German sportscar star experience of Grand Prix racing. Despite Jordan&#x27;s agreement in principle with Mercedes to retain Schumacher for the remainder of the season, the German driver signed to Benetton-Ford for the following race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the UK courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton, but lost the case as they had not yet signed a contract. Ousted Benetton driver Roberto Moreno and future Champ Car title winner Alessandro Zanardi filled the second car afterwards. Success for Jordan literally came at a high price. The team was forced to switch to cheaper Yamaha engines for the season. With Maurício Gugelmin and Stefano Modena driving, the team struggled badly and failed to score a point until the final race of the season.

 saw further changes, with the team switching engine suppliers, this time to Hart. Again, the season started with two new drivers, Ivan Capelli and Brazilian rookie Rubens Barrichello. Capelli left after two races and five other drivers teamed with Barrichello during the 1993 campaign. Jordan only had moderate improvement, scoring three points. Signs of stability were beginning to show near the end of the season when Barrichello was joined by Eddie Irvine, a former Jordan driver in F3000. Irvine finished sixth and secured a point on his debut Formula One race at Suzuka, memorably unlapping himself against McLaren&#x27;s Ayrton Senna, in order to overtake Damon Hill. After the race finished, an incensed Senna, infuriated by what he deemed as unsafe racing by Irvine in poor weather conditions, stormed into the Jordan garage and punched Irvine in the face after Irvine pushed him in a heated discussion.

Barrichello and Irvine returned for the season, as did the Hart engines, but Irvine had a bad start to the season, earning a three-race ban for reckless driving. Barrichello earned the team their first top three finish in Japan at the Pacific Grand Prix, but was nearly killed during the following race in San Marino in a frightening qualifying crash. The team overcame these difficulties and returned to their initial form, repeating its fifth place finish in the Constructors&#x27; Championship with 28 points, a notable achievement from a low budget team with an engine designed and built by Darrell O&#x27;Brien/Hart Engineering. Barrichello earned Jordan&#x27;s first pole position after a gamble during a wet qualifying session in Belgium, and finished 6th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 19 points. 

Jordan switched to full-works Peugeot power in after one season with McLaren team who switched to works Mercedes-Benz engines. During the Canadian Grand Prix that year, both Barrichello and Irvine finished on the podium, finishing second and third respectively. It was the highlight to an unspectacular but relatively solid year for Jordan, as they hung around mid-pack to finish 6th in the Championship.

When Irvine left in to become Michael Schumacher&#x27;s teammate at Ferrari, Jordan replaced him with veteran Martin Brundle, the ex-Le Mans winner and World Sportscar Champion. The team failed to make the podium, but both drivers managed to score a string of fourth-place finishes as the team scored yet another 5th among the constructors. 1996 also saw the team adopt their bright-yellow colour scheme which would become their trademark.

====Late 1990s ascent====

 saw the departure of both drivers from the previous year. Barrichello left for the newly formed Stewart Grand Prix, whilst Brundle became a Formula One commentator for ITV. Jordan replaced them with Italian Giancarlo Fisichella, who had raced for Minardi the previous year, and young Ralf Schumacher, Michael&#x27;s brother. Again, the team finished 5th in the Championship, with Fisichella achieving two podium finishes. At Hockenheim, Fisichella had led the race, but lost out to Gerhard Berger before retiring when a puncture holed his car&#x27;s radiator. The Italian&#x27;s other highlight was scoring the fastest race lap at the Spanish Grand Prix. A lowlight of the season came in Argentina when Ralf Schumacher took out his Italian teammate during the race, which was tempered by Ralf&#x27;s first podium.

In , the team made its biggest signing as former World Champion Damon Hill, a graduate of Jordan&#x27;s F3000 programme, replaced Fisichella. The team also replaced its Peugeots, which went to Prost, with Mugen Honda motors. Up to the halfway point of the season, Jordan had failed to score a single point due to reliability problems. At that point, they signed Mike Gascoyne from Tyrrell to bolster the technical team and long-standing technical director Gary Anderson resigned a few months after. Things improved greatly towards the end of the season and at that year&#x27;s rain-soaked Belgian Grand Prix in which only six cars finished, Hill earned Jordan their first ever Formula One win, which was also Hill&#x27;s 22nd career Grand Prix victory. Ralf Schumacher sweetened the victory by finishing second. However, it was later revealed to be team orders - Schumacher had been ordered not to pass Hill. Angered by this, his brother Michael told Jordan that Ralf would never race for the team again and subsequently bought out his brother&#x27;s contract for 2 million pounds, this satisfied Jordan due to the scandal and manner of Michael&#x27;s own switch from Jordan to Benetton back in 1991. Hill finished 6th in the drivers&#x27; standings with Ralf 10th. Hill&#x27;s last lap, last-corner move on Heinz-Harald Frentzen at Suzuka enabled him to finish the race in fourth and also earned Jordan fourth in the Constructors&#x27; Championship for 1998 (this was tempered by speculation that Frentzen had &quot;gifted&quot; the place to Hill, the German having confirmed a move to Jordan for 1999, after a tumultuous career with Williams).

With Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher swapping teams for (Frentzen at Jordan and Ralf at Williams), the season would turn out to be a nightmare for Hill, who was to retire at the end of the season. However, Frentzen&#x27;s season was immensely successful, with the German earning two victories and a pole position. For a short while Frentzen had entertained thoughts of a world title, but poor luck and greater speed from McLaren and Ferrari ended his hopes. Frentzen finished third in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and the team also finished third amongst the Constructors&#x27;. 1999 was to be the team&#x27;s finest season.

==== Decline ====
For Hill was replaced by Jarno Trulli, fresh from a couple of years at Prost and Minardi. His qualifying speed in particular impressed, but he was unable to score a podium. Frentzen was unable to replicate the success of 1999 and the team slipped back to 6th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The team had been on course for major points at Monaco, but poor luck intervened: Trulli was ahead of eventual winner David Coulthard until his gearbox failed, while Frentzen running in second place hit the wall at Sainte Devote with only eight laps to go.

Both drivers returned to start and Jordan switched to works Honda engines which were already being supplied to rival team BAR after Mugen left the sport at the end of 2000. This led to a battle for the right to use the Honda engines in the long term. Frentzen was released from the team in mid-season, a series of disagreements with team boss Eddie Jordan a possible explanation. Jordan himself has said that he dropped Frentzen to bring in Takuma Sato for 2002, an attempt to satisfy Honda. Frentzen was replaced by test driver Ricardo Zonta at the German Grand Prix, but from thereafter Jean Alesi, in the final stages of his Formula One career, took the seat. Amidst all the turmoil, Trulli finished in the points four times, and the team finished 5th in the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the fifth time, ahead of rivals BAR.
Jordan re-organised in , with Fisichella returning and Takuma Sato joining the team, thanks in no small part to Honda&#x27;s influence. Due to a drop in sponsorship money the team slipped down the pecking order on the grid. Fisichella often qualified well, a sixth place on the grid in Montreal and a fifth place on the grid in Budapest. Yet results-wise, the Italian had to make do with a trio of fifth places and a sixth place from Hungary. Sato showed flashes of promise, but managed just two points at his home race. Despite the drop in form, Jordan still managed sixth in the championship, two places ahead of main rivals BAR.

==== Return to Ford ====

For , Honda left Jordan to concentrate on their partnership with BAR. Jordan had to make do with Ford Cosworth engines, and the season was not regarded as a success. Despite beating only Minardi to score 9th in the standings, Jordan won in 2003. This came under bizarre circumstances in the which was affected by rain. Following a massive accident on the start/finish straight, the race was red flagged and stopped. After some initial confusion, Giancarlo Fisichella was initially ruled to have finished second behind Kimi Räikkönen who took the top step on the podium. However, an FIA inquiry several days later led to Fisichella being officially declared the winner of his first F1 race. Fisichella was therefore unable to celebrate his first career victory on the top step of the podium, although he and Räikkönen swapped their drivers&#x27; trophies in an impromptu ceremony at the following race in San Marino, while McLaren&#x27;s Ron Dennis handed over the constructors&#x27; trophy to Eddie Jordan. Aside from the opportunistic win, neither Fisichella nor rookie teammate Ralph Firman were able to achieve any sort of success in their EJ13s. After Firman was injured in practice for the Jordan fielded the first ever Hungarian Formula One driver, Zsolt Baumgartner. Firman returned for the final two events, but was unable to add to the point he won in Spain. Fisichella only managed two points on top of his victory and unhappy at the team&#x27;s form he departed for Sauber.

In June 2003 Jordan sued mobile phone company Vodafone for £150 million, claiming that the company had made a verbal contract for a three-year sponsorship, then given it to Ferrari instead. Jordan withdrew the action two months later, agreeing to pay Vodafone&#x27;s costs. This was a double financial blow from which the team never recovered. The judge was highly critical of Eddie Jordan, branding the allegations against Vodafone &quot;without foundation and false&quot;.
In , Jordan struggled financially, and their status for the future was questionable. The team fielded German Nick Heidfeld, formerly of Sauber and Prost, and Italian rookie Giorgio Pantano. Ex-F3000 champion Heidfeld showed promise, but could not achieve many good results due to the car&#x27;s initial pace being poor. Pantano&#x27;s season was dogged by sponsorship problems. He missed Canada due to a lack of funding, with Timo Glock stepping in to replace him. Glock managed to score two points on his debut, finishing just ahead of Heidfeld, although these had been earned after the two Toyota and Williams cars had been disqualified for brake duct irregularities. Later in the season, Glock replaced Pantano permanently. As in the previous season, the team finished ahead of only Minardi at the bottom of the constructors standings.

==== Sale to Midland Group and Toyota customer engines ====
After Ford&#x27;s decision to put Cosworth up for sale, Jordan had been left without an engine deal for . However, at short notice, Toyota agreed to supply Jordan with customer RVX-05 engines identical to those in the works Toyota cars as a paid lease agreement instead of free of charge. In 2005 after a constructors’ meeting at Heathrow, Bernie Ecclestone introduced Alex Schnaider to Eddie Jordan. Six weeks later Eddie Jordan had sold the team to the Midland Group for $60 million. The day the deal
was signed Eddie sat in Ian Phillips&#x27; office and was in tears.
The Jordan name was retained for the season, before being changed to Midland MF1 Racing for the season. Throughout 2005, journalists questioned whether Midland were in Formula One for the long haul. Rumours circulated throughout the season that the team was for sale, and that former driver Eddie Irvine was interested in buying them. The year also saw the debut of two new rookie drivers, Narain Karthikeyan and Tiago Monteiro. 2005 merely confirmed Jordan&#x27;s status at the back of the grid. A final podium came in the highly controversial race at Indianapolis, with Monteiro leading home a Jordan 3–4 after most rivals did not start. Monteiro managed an excellent eighth place at Spa in wet conditions to give the team its last point. The final race for the team saw a low-key exit, with Monteiro finishing 11th and Karthikeyan crashing out spectacularly.

== Role in developing driver talent ==

Jordan Grand Prix was notable for providing the debut to a number of drivers who subsequently enjoyed considerable F1 and wider motor-racing careers. This was due to both Eddie Jordan&#x27;s experience managing the careers of drivers (most notably Jean Alesi) before entering his own team to F1, and the team&#x27;s ongoing need for funding which new drivers frequently brought via personal sponsorship. Notably successful drivers who began their F1 careers with Jordan include multiple World Champion Michael Schumacher (1991), Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) Champion Alex Zanardi (1991), F1 race winners Rubens Barrichello (1993), Eddie Irvine (1993), and Ralf Schumacher (1997), and Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato (2002). The close-knit and relaxed atmosphere of the team also allowed drivers who had failed to achieve expectations with other teams to perform at their best. Most notably, Heinz-Harald Frentzen won two races to challenge for the 1999 World Championship, something he had failed to do for the much more competitive Williams team in 1997. Andrea de Cesaris rehabilitated his reputation from that of a &#x27;crasher&#x27; to become a dependable driver during his season with the team in 1991, and Jarno Trulli, Giancarlo Fisichella and Nick Heidfeld each used their time at Jordan Grand Prix to show potential and be recruited by larger teams.

As well as giving both Michael and Ralf Schumacher their F1 debuts, Jordan benefited from Germany&#x27;s growing interest in Formula One during the 1990s and early 2000s, with the other notable German drivers of the era (Frentzen, Heidfeld, and Timo Glock) all driving for the team and Deutsche Post World Net being a major sponsor of the team from 2000 to 2003.

== Sponsorship ==

In 1991, the team was sponsored by soft drink brand 7 Up, but despite the team&#x27;s moderately successful first season and Eddie Jordan saying the team had &quot;more than fulfilled our part of the bargain&quot;, the sponsorship was replaced by South African energy company Sasol until 1994, with Barclay supplementing until 1993. In the team&#x27;s first year with Peugeot engines, fuel supplier Total was the title sponsor in 1995.

From 1996 to 2005, Benson &amp; Hedges was the primary sponsor of Jordan. At races where the ban on cigarette advertising was in force, the name was replaced by &quot;Bitten &amp; Hisses&quot; (in when Jordan&#x27;s mascot was the snake Hissing Sid) or the names of the team&#x27;s drivers, Giancarlo Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher, with additional &#x27;S&#x27;s, &quot;Buzzin Hornets&quot; (while the mascot was an unnamed hornet from to ), &quot;Bitten Heroes&quot; (during , when the team&#x27;s mascot was a shark), and from to &#x27;Be On Edge&#x27; (BENSON &amp; HEDGES). It was in the sponsor&#x27;s first year that the team coloured their cars in the gold of their cigarette packet and then switched to yellow after that.

For , title sponsorship went to delivery company DHL, before reverting to Benson &amp; Hedges (which remained a major sponsor in 2002). At the 2004 and 2005 United States Grands Prix, Sobranie was advertised instead; the team (along with Scuderia Ferrari) had previously run non-tobacco liveries on previous United States Grands Prix due to U.S. Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement requirements, as a clause in the settlement restricted Philip Morris USA (who holds the Benson &amp; Hedges trademark in the United States) to one sponsorship, that of Team Penske in American open-wheel racing.

=== EJ-10 ===

EJ-10 was an energy drink marketed by the Jordan Formula One team. The energy drink was heavily advertised as free of caffeine and taurine to avoid a sugar crash, and as having a fruity flavour and providing energy for up to 90 minutes. It was sold in bright yellow 250 mL and 380 mL bottles, decorated to evoke the image of Jordan&#x27;s Formula One cars. Jordan Grand Prix used the Sutherland Hawes design agency to create and market the energy drink. At the height of its popularity EJ-10 was available around the world, including Ireland, Germany, Colombia, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico.

In 2002, the 380 ml bottles of EJ-10 were recalled in Ireland after it was discovered it contained unacceptable levels of benzene.

V-10 is a spinoff of EJ-10; it retains the basic formula but adds vodka.

=== Honda Civic Jordan ===

To commemorate the team&#x27;s successful 1999 campaign powered by Mugen-Honda engines, Honda sold 500 limited edition Honda Civic models called Civic Jordan in the United Kingdom. Based on the EK4 VTi-S hatchback model, the cars were painted Sunlight Yellow and featured yellow-and-black leather interior, Jordan decals on the sides and rear of the car as well as stitched into the seats and floor carpets, and body kit partially based on the Japanese Type-R model. Apart from a signed Eddie Jordan plaque on the cars&#x27; centre console, the team had no involvement on the development on the car, which performed otherwise similar to a standard VTi model.

== Books ==

Several books have been published that provided a comprehensive understanding of Jordan Grand Prix. The most comprehensive was the 1994 book Race Without End. Authored by Maurice Hamilton, a seasoned Formula 1 professional, this book chronicles the events and experiences of Jordan Grand Prix during the 1993 season.
