<doc id="461838" wikidata="Q1849729" url="?curid=461838" title="List of localities in Victoria">
<text>This is a list of locality names and populated place names in the state of Victoria, Australia, outside the Melbourne metropolitan area. It is organised by region from the south-west of the state to the east and, for convenience, is sectioned by Local Government Area (LGA). Localities are bounded areas recorded on VICNAMES, although boundaries are the responsibility of each council. Many localities cross LGA boundaries, some being partly within three LGAs, but are listed here once under the LGA in which the major population centre or area occurs.

The Registrar of Geographic Names, supported by Geographic Names Victoria, administers the naming or renaming of localities (as well as roads, and other features) in Victoria, and maintains the Register of Geographic Names, referred as the VICNAMES register, pursuant to the &quot;Geographic Place Names Act 1998&quot;. The OGN has issued the mandatory &quot;Naming rules for places in Victoria, Statutory requirements for naming roads, features and localities – 2016&quot; (naming rules), which took effect on 2 February 2017, and which are based on national standards and policies in naming of such places. Detailed maps showing locality boundaries within a LGA are available on the Land Use Victoria website.

==Introduction==
Although the names of localities may in some cases be the same as parishes (surveyed cadastral divisions), their boundaries often differ. For instance the locality of Tyrendarra contains part of the parish of Narrawong to the west of the Fitzroy River, due to the township being established on the western border of the parish and postal services etc.to that area being supplied from Tyrendarra (the first two subscribers to the telephone service in 1925 were resident in the parish of Narrawong). The locality of Tyrendarra East also lies within the parish.

Bracketed behind locality names are the names of official &quot;neighbourhoods&quot; (unbounded areas listed by the Registrar of Geographic Names) that lie generally within the locality. The locality of Ouyen contains eighteen neighbourhoods, five of which once had a railway station and fourteen of which once had a post office. The amalgamation of farm properties, the consequent reduced population, closure of postal and railway facilities has led to the amalgamation of erstwhile localities, although those living there would not consider themselves to be living in Ouyen and their mail would still be addressed accordingly. In contrast, those living in the neighbourhood of Narrawong East would all give their address as Tyrendarra. The reason for the existence of the named neighbourhood was the State School (now closed) of the same name, nearer to Tyrendarra township than the Tyrendarra school, but within Narrawong parish and named accordingly. This is borne out by the official coordinates being those of the school. Neighbourhoods, with geographic coordinates, can be found through the Land Use Victoria via the VICNAMES Register.

Also bracketed are earlier names (or alternative &quot;official&quot; spellings or style) for a locality; few names have changed once established but Boggy Creek, Muddy Creek and Cannibal Creek gained more respectable names when a township was surveyed. The removal of the possessive apostrophe in place names is not recorded, but the more recent possessive to adjectival changes are (Darlot&#x27;s Creek became Darlots Creek and later Darlot Creek).

Names from the extended postcode (mail destination) list are included. When the new Australian postcode system was introduced in Victoria in 1967 all mail destinations were assigned postcodes based on the mail routing. Many localities share postcodes with nearby localities; some named localities have two or three different postcodes because different mail routes traversed their area. Postcodes were assigned outside the (then) metropolitan area along radial lines from Melbourne, from towards the south-west to towards the south-east numbered from 3211 to 3996 in a clockwise direction.

The names of all Post Offices/Receiving Offices (PO/RO), Telegraph/Telephone Offices (TO) open at any time in Victoria have been recorded by Phoenix Auctions History and where the location is accurately known, and where the name of the office is not simply the surname of the operator of the facility, its name has been included.

For (linked) localities with Wikipedia articles further information on the bracketed names may be expected within the articles. For those lacking articles the range of years the locality (or a bracketed area) had a post, telegraph or telephone office are recorded as an approximation of the establishment of the locality as a populated entity, and as some indication of its life as a viable community.

All names &quot;italicised&quot; have never had a post or telegraph office open under the exact name (apostrophisation excluded).

<text>The Iowa Great Lakes, often referred to as Okoboji, is a group of natural lakes in northwestern Iowa in the United States. There are seven lakes in the region totaling with the three principal lakes of the group being Big Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake. They are the largest natural lakes in the state of Iowa. The largest, Spirit Lake, is 5,684 acres (2,300 ha). The lake area extends to the north into Jackson County, Minnesota. The headwaters of Little Sioux River flow past the west side of the lake area.

==History==
The area around the Iowa Great Lakes was not known for permanent settlement by the Sioux but rather for recreation or hunting. When settlers arrived around 1856 it led to conflicts and eventually the Spirit Lake Massacre in 1857.

After the massacre, European settlers slowly returned and by 1900 nearly 8,000 people were living in the area. The Iowa Great Lakes Sanitary District was created in 1939 to protect the lakes from pollution and sanitary issues. Likewise, the Iowa Great Lakes Association was formed in 2008 when the waters were threatened by a large commercial agricultural development.

==Geography==

The Iowa Great Lakes region was formed 13,500 years ago along the southwest edge of the Des Moines lobe ice sheet as it pressed south into Iowa. The deepest part of the lake is in West Okoboji Lake.

The Iowa Great Lakes lie within the Spirit Lake Micropolitan Area and the towns of Spirit Lake and Milford are within the lake area.

<text>The University of Okoboji is a fictional university in the state of Iowa in the United States of America. The university was the creation of three brothers in the early 1970s, who printed T-shirts with an &quot;official&quot; school crest. The word &quot;Okoboji&quot; refers to several lakes, and to the town of Okoboji, in the Iowa Great Lakes region that are popular recreational destinations.

The university is home of the &quot;undefeated&quot; Fighting Phantoms.

It is common among those alumni to display university decor, such as car decals and T-shirts to show their proudness from attending the University. The name is now used in connection with several annual fund-raising events for charity, including bike rides, a marathon, and a winter games competition. A local radio station, KUOO, has joined and refers to itself as the &quot;campus radio.&quot;

<text>Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers) is a compilation album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 14 July 2003 by Sony Music Entertainment. It consists of various B-sides, rarities and cover versions and reached number 11 on the UK Album Chart.

== Content ==
=== Title ===

It is named after the Greil Marcus book &quot;Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the 20th Century&quot; and shares its title with a bootleg album of Manics rarities (more simply titled &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot;).

=== Album cover ===

The sleeve was designed principally by Nicky Wire and contrasted greatly from the simple, graphically precise covers designed by Farrow Design who have done the majority of design work for the band since 1996. Initial copies came in a gatefold sleeve with a basic inlay; further inserts could be downloaded and printed off from the band&#x27;s official website.

== Promotion ==

As part of the promotion for the album, the band did a signing tour around the UK. At the final signing session in London they also played a short set of tracks from the album. A video for &quot;Judge Yr&#x27;self&quot; featuring early self-recorded clips of the band playing live also played on UK music television channels.

== Release ==

&quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; was released on 14 July 2003. It reached number 11 in the UK Albums Chart and spent a total of 3 weeks in the Top 100. The compilation also charted within the top 40 in Finland and Ireland.

== Reception ==
The compilation album received favourable reviews from critics. Sputnikmusic stated that: &quot;But still, if you are willing to go and wade through a B-Side history of the Manic&#x27;s- which I doubt many do- there&#x27;s a genuine albums worth of classics to be found, with the second disc a redundant retread of covers that could have been used to make the collection more expansive and valuable. It&#x27;s a shame the band couldn&#x27;t be more convenient in delivering their secret history to you.&quot;

AllMusic rated the album with a 3 out of 5, saying that: &quot;Some of the Manics&#x27; peers did deliver consistently on their B-sides -- Suede and Oasis have B-sides collections every bit as good as their proper albums -- but they themselves didn&#x27;t. And that&#x27;s fine -- this collection was put out for the sake of completeness, and for completists, it&#x27;s a good buy. But less dedicated fans can pass it by.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; also reviewed the album with a 6.3/10, and said that: &quot;Manic Street Preachers never conquered the world like they wanted to, but it&#x27;s been a good enough ride that I don&#x27;t begrudge them for trying, and this compilation, flawed though it is, is sure to please those who&#x27;d always hoped they would succeed.&quot;

=== From fans ===

The album received a far more positive reception from fans than the &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; greatest hits album, which was heavily criticised for favouring the band&#x27;s more commercially successful singles. The only recurring criticism of &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; was the exclusion of the infamous fan favourite &quot;Patrick Bateman&quot; from the &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; single. The band explained that it was excluded mainly because it was almost seven minutes long and simply would not fit on the album. Bradfield has also been very critical of the song in the past, saying that it had great lyrics but the music was &quot;dreadful&quot;. Fans also missed &quot;Too Cold Here&quot; from the &quot;Revol&quot; single. The song was very successful in fans&#x27; voting on the official site.

<doc id="461856" wikidata="Q472189" url="?curid=461856" title="Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church">
<text>The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) is a major archiepiscopal &quot;sui iuris&quot; (&quot;autonomous&quot;) Eastern Catholic church that is based in Ukraine. As a particular church of the Catholic Church, it is in full communion with the Holy See. It is the third-largest particular church in the Catholic Church after the Latin Church and the Syro-Malabar Church. The major archbishop presides over the entire Church but is not distinguished with the patriarchal title. The incumbent Major Archbishop is Sviatoslav Shevchuk.

The church regards itself as a successor to the metropolis that was established in 988 following the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27; by Grand Prince Vladimir the Great. Following the establishment of the metropolis of Kiev, Galicia and all Rus&#x27;, by the terms of the Union of Brest, the Ruthenian church was transferred from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to the jurisdiction of the Holy See in 1596, thereby forming the Ruthenian Uniate Church. The Union of Brest was a treaty between the Ruthenian Orthodox Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, under the leadership of the metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia and all Rus&#x27;—Michael III—on one part, and the Latin Church under the leadership of Pope Clement VIII on the other part.

Following the partitions of Poland, the eparchies of the Ruthenian Uniate Church () were liquidated in the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. Only the three eparchies that came under Austrian jurisdiction remained of the Brest Union. In 1963, the church was recognized as Ukrainian through the efforts of Yosyf Slipyi.

In 1963, the ordinary (or hierarch) of the church was granted the title of &quot;Major Archbishop&quot;. He currently holds the title of &quot;Major archbishop of Kyiv-Galicia&quot;. However, the hierarchs and faithful of the church acclaim their ordinary as &quot;Patriarch&quot; and have requested Papal recognition of this honour.

== Names ==
In its early years, the church was called the &quot;Ecclesia (Ruthena) unita&quot; in Latin, often anglicized as the Ruthenian Uniate Church, where &quot;Ruthenia&quot; is the anglicization of &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot;, the medieval kingdom that ruled what is now Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia, and &quot;uniate&quot; means &#x27;part of a union&#x27;, in this case the Union of Brest (1595). However, the term &quot;Uniate&quot; became a term of abuse in writings by Orthodox authors, and fell of out favour among Greek Catholics themselves. The people in this church were referred to by the Catholic hierarchy primarily as &quot;Graeci catholici&quot; (Greek Catholics) because they used the &quot;Greek&quot; or Byzantine Rite, as well as more specifically &quot;Rutheni catholici&quot; (Ruthenian Catholics). The leader of the Church was called &quot;Metropolita Kioviensis&quot; or &quot;Metropolitan of Kiev&quot; and sometimes also &quot;of Galicia and all Rus&#x27;&quot; until 1805.

The Austrian Empire later used &quot;Griechisch-katolisch&quot; (German for &#x27;Greek Catholic&#x27;) as a catch-all term for Eastern Catholics under its rule until 1918.

The Ruthenian population of Galicia and Bukovyna began to increasingly identify themselves as Ukrainian, emphasizing the connection to Ukrainians in the Russian Empire, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The papal statistical yearbook Annuario Pontificio began referring to the church as Ukrainian from 1912. In the wake of the creation of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in 1918, the church was also increasingly referred to as Ukrainian in pastoral letters. During the interwar period, the word &quot;Ukrainian&quot; was well established in the diasporan parishes. Most documents from the Vatican did not officially change the church&#x27;s name until 1963.

The first use of various names of the church are listed here.

* Uniate Church ( ) — since 1596, at its foundation;
* Ruthenian Uniate Church (, ) — from the 17th century, in official church documents;
* Greek Catholic Church (, ) — since 1774; by the decision of Empress Maria Theresa, to distinguish it from the Latin Catholic and Armenian Catholic Churches);
* Ukrainian Catholic Church of the Byzantine Rite () — since 1912, in the papal statistical yearbook Annuario Pontificio);
* Ukrainian Catholic Church (, ) —since the early 1960s) ;
* Kyivan Catholic Church () — since 1999, approved by the Synod of Bishops of the UGCC.

==History==

===Ruthenian Orthodox Church to the Union of Brest===

The Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church was created with the Union of Brest in 1595/1596, yet its roots go back to the Christianization of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Byzantine missionaries exercised decisive influence in the area. The 9th-century mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Great Moravia had particular importance as their work allowed the spread of worship in the Old Church Slavonic language. The Byzantine-Greek influence continued, particularly with the official adoption of Byzantine rites by Prince Vladimir I of Kiev in 988 when the metropolis of Kiev within the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople was established. Later at the time of the Great Schism (), the church took sides and remained Orthodox.

Following the devastating Mongol invasions and the sack of Kiev in 1240, Metropolitan Maximos moved to the town of Vladimir-on-Klyazma in 1299. In 1303, at the request of the Ruthenian kings of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople created the separate metropolis of Halych which included the western parishes of the original metropolis of Kiev. The new metropolis did not last for long (inconsistently throughout most of the 14th century), and its new metropolitan, Peter of Moscow, was consecrated as the metropolitan of Kiev, rather than the metropolitan of Halych.

Just before his death, Peter moved his episcopal see from Vladimir to Moscow. During his reign, the Metropolitanate of Lithuania was established in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while the metropolis of Halych was also re-established after his death. In 1445, the metropolitan Isidore, with his see in Moscow, joined the Council of Florence and became the papal legate for all Ruthenia and Lithuania. After Isidore suffered prosecution by the local bishops and royalty of the Grand Principality of Moscow, he was exiled from Moscow, while a council of Russian bishops appointed their own metropolitan, Jonah of Moscow, without the consent of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, leading to the independence of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1448.

For this reason, Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople reorganized the Ruthenian Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Its new primates were styled &quot;Metropolitans of Kiev, Galicia and all Ruthenia&quot;. He appointed Gregory II Bulgarian as the new Greek Catholic primate, who rejoined the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople under Dionysius I of Constantinople in 1470.

===From the Union of Brest to the Partitions of Poland===


This situation continued for some time, and in the intervening years what is now western and central Ukraine came under the rule of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish king Sigismund III Vasa was heavily influenced by the ideals of the Counter-Reformation and wanted to increase the Catholic presence in Ukraine. While the clergy of the Ruthenian lands were technically ruled from Constantinople, the Ruthenian Orthodox bishops were appointed by the Polish Catholic monarch, often with disastrous results. In the Eparchy of Volodymyr, for example, two different lay noblemen were both appointed as bishop by the Polish king. Both &quot;bishops&quot; hired mercenaries and fought a pitched battle over control of the Eparchy, before the Polish king finally stepped in and appointed one of the two candidates to an adjacent Orthodox See.

Meanwhile, the religious renewal caused by the Counter-Reformation among Latin Catholics in Poland and Lithuania drew the envy of Orthodox clergy. With the encouragement of the Society of Jesus, four bishops of the Ruthenian Church signed the Union of Brest in 1595, broke from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and reunited with the Catholic Church under the authority of the Holy See, while continuing to say the Byzantine Rite in Old Church Slavonic. The Union of Brest was also motivated by outrage over the insult to the Primacy of the See of Kiev implicit in the recent promotion of the See of Moscow to a patriarchate by Jeremias II of Constantinople. In 1596, the Ruthenian bishops finalized their agreement with the Holy See.

The union was not accepted by all the members of the Ruthenian Orthodox Church in these lands, and marked the creation of Greek Catholic Church and separate eparchies that continued to stay Orthodox among which were Lviv eparchy, Peremyshel eparchy, Mukachevo eparchy and Lutsk eparchy that at first accepted the union but later oscillated back and forth, depending on who was the Bishop.

There was an attempt to resolve the conflict between Orthodox and Greek Catholics by adopting &quot;Articles for Pacification of Ruthenian people&quot; in 1632. Following that, both churches existed legally in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with Metropolitans of Kyiv, one, Josyf Veliamyn Rutsky, Greek Catholic, and another, Peter Mogila, Orthodox.

Following the Union of Brest, the new Greek Catholic church was widely supported by both the Ukrainian clergy and local Christians. According to Ludvik Nemec, the creation of the Uniate church was a turning point for the development of Ukrainian national awareness – the separation from Russian-dominated Orthodoxy made the Ukrainian population more aware of the linguistic and cultural differences from Russia, and the Ukrainian identity started to sharply develop in the 16th and 17th century. Greek Catholicism became the dominating religion in Ukraine, and &quot;the Ukrainians became almost strangers to the Russians&quot;.

At the same time, the Uniates were not treated on par with Latin Catholics in Poland-Lithuania; Greek Catholics were excluded from the Polish Senate, and bishops were to be supervised by Latin Catholic bishops. The Uniate church was neglected by Polish authorities, causing resentment towards Polish rule as well. As the result of being alienated from both Polish Latin Catholicism and Russian Orthodoxy, the Greek Catholic church in Ukraine had developed its own separate, Ukrainian identity. Greek Catholic bishops of Ukraine such as Josaphat Kuntsevych are considered the precursors of Ukrainian nationalism.

===Impact of the Partitions of the Commonwealth===

After the partitions of Poland, the original diocesan structure of the Ruthenian Uniate Church was split among the three states in the following way:
;To the Russian Empire
* Archeparchy of Polotsk, Metropolitan of all Byzantine Catholics in Russia
* Eparchy of Brest
* Eparchy of Lutsk
* Eparchy of Lithuania

;To the Kingdom of Prussia
* Eparchy of Supraśl

;To the Habsburg monarchy
* Archeparchy of Lviv, Metropolitan of Galicia
* Eparchy of Chełm
* Eparchy of Przemyśl and Sambir

The Habsburg monarchy established the crown land of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and also a territory called West Galicia, which in 1803 was merged with Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1804, the combined entities became a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The Greek Catholic Church was established in 1807 with its metropolitan see based in Lemberg. Its suffragan dioceses included Chelm and Przemyśl. Following the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, the Austrian Empire was forced to cede most of the territory of the former West Galicia to the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, the final decision of Congress of Vienna resulted in the cession of West Galicia to the Russian Empire. The diocese of Chelm, which was located in West Galicia, ended up under the Russian jurisdiction.

The Russian emperor Pavel I of Russia restored the Uniate church, which was reorganized with three eparchies suffragan to metropolitan bishop Joasaphat Bulhak. The church was allowed to function without restraint (calling its adherents Basilians). The clergy soon split into pro-Catholic and pro-Russian, however, with the former tending to convert to Latin Catholicism, while the latter group, led by Bishop Iosif Semashko (1798–1868) and firmly rejected by the ruling Greek-Catholic synod remained largely controlled by the pro-Polish clergy with the Russian authorities largely refusing to interfere.

Following the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire occupied so-called West Galicia (formerly in Austrian Poland) and, temporarily, Tarnopol district, where a separate metropolitan of Galicia was established between 1809 and 1815. The territory of Kholm eparchy along with Central Polish territories became part of Congress Poland. The situation changed abruptly following Russia&#x27;s successful suppression of the 1831 Polish uprising, aimed at overthrowing Russian control of the Polish territories. As the uprising was actively supported by the Greek-Catholic church, a crackdown on the Church occurred immediately.

The pro-Latin members of the synod were removed; and the Church began to disintegrate, with its parishes in Volhynia reverting to Orthodoxy, including the 1833 transfer of the famous Pochaiv Lavra. In 1839 the Synod of Polotsk (in modern-day Belarus), under the leadership of Bishop Semashko, dissolved the Greek-Catholic church in the Russian Empire, and all its property was transferred to the Orthodox state church. The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia says that, in what was then known as &#x27;Little Russia&#x27; (now Ukraine), the pressure of the Russian Government &quot;utterly wiped out&quot; Greek Catholicism, and &quot;some 7,000,000 of the Uniats there were compelled, partly by force and partly by deception, to become part of the Greek Orthodox Church&quot;.

In the years following and preceding the Partitions, Catherine the Great played a huge rule in forcefully dismantling the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine. She expressed disdain towards both Greek and Latin Catholicism while praising Protestant denominations, and was determined to reinstate Orthodoxy as the majority religion in Ukraine. As Russian troops entered Polish-controlled Ukraine to suppress the Bar Confederation, Catherine &quot;unleashed an Orthodox missionary crusade against the Uniate parishes of Ukraine&quot;, and actively incited violence against Latin Catholics, Uniates, and Jews, resulting in atrocities such as the Massacre of Uman.

Greek Catholic parishes were pressured to convert to Russian Orthodoxy, and priests who resisted were expelled. More than a thousand Ukrainian Uniate parishes were taken over by Orthodox priests. According to Larry Wolff of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the years of Polish partitions were &quot;years of lawless bullying in Ukraine, which remained in a state of suspended irregularity while Catherine fought her wars and negotiated the partition&quot;. Following the failure of Kościuszko Insurrection and the final partition of Poland, the persecution of Ukrainian Greek Catholics intensified, and the church was forbidden from accepting converts from Orthodoxy. Russian authorities harassed and arrested Uniate priests, while Russian Orthodox priests accompanied by Russian soldiers visited Ukrainian villages and intimidated the population into converting to Orthodoxy. Wolff notes that despite harsh persecution and heavy pressure, &quot;the great majority of Uniates held fast to the Union.&quot;

Theodosius Rostocki wrote that in response to resistance encountered by Greek Catholics in Ukraine, Russian authorities took over the Uniate churches: &quot;Wherever priests and people, in spite of threats and terrors, remained steadfast, then, even when they [the persecutors] had obtained only a few signatures from the community, they confiscated the church with all its furnishings, took the whole village under their spiritual administration ad drove out the Uniate priests.&quot; A 19th-century historian Edward Likowski commented on Catherine&#x27;s death: &quot;The eternal Judge called her to the justice of His judgment seat so that she might account for the rivers of blood and tears that flowed during her reign from millions of Uniates, solely on account of their religious conviction.&quot;

The dissolution of the Greek-Catholic Church in Russia was completed in 1875 with the abolition of the Eparchy of Kholm. By the end of the century, those remaining faithful to this church began emigrating to the U.S., Canada, and Brazil due to persecution by the Orthodox Church and the Russian Empire, e.g. the Pratulin Martyrs. Despite being once the majority religion in Ukraine, the Uniate church was now mostly confined to Eastern Galicia.

Within the lands of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the largest Eastern Catholic Church, priests&#x27; children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly knit hereditary caste. Numbering approximately 2,000-2,500 by the 19th century, priestly families tended to marry within their group, constituting a tight-knit hereditary caste. In the absence of a significant culturally and politically active native nobility (although there was considerable overlap, with more than half of the clerical families also being of petty noble origin), and enjoying a virtual monopoly on education and wealth within western Ukrainian society, the clergy came to form that group&#x27;s native aristocracy. The clergy adopted Austria&#x27;s role for them as bringers of culture and education to the Ukrainian countryside. Most Ukrainian social and political movements in Austrian-controlled territory emerged or were highly influenced by the clergy themselves or by their children. This influence was so great that western Ukrainians were accused by their Polish rivals of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine.

The territory received by Austria in the partition of Poland included Galicia (modern western Ukraine and southern Poland). Here the Greek-Catholic Ruthenian (Ukrainian) peasantry had been largely under Polish Catholic domination. The Austrians granted equal freedom of worship to the Greek-Catholic Church and removed Polish influence. They also mandated that Uniate seminarians receive a formal higher education (previously, priests had been educated informally by their fathers), and organized institutions in Vienna and Lviv that would serve this function. This led to the appearance, for the first time, of a large, educated class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia. It also engendered a fierce sense of loyalty to the Habsburg dynasty. When Polish rebels briefly took control of Lviv in 1809, they demanded that the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Antin Anhelovych, substitute Napoleon&#x27;s name in the Divine Liturgy for that of Austrian Emperor Francis I. Anhelovych refused, and was imprisoned. When the Austrians retook control over Lviv, Anhelovych was awarded the cross of Leopold by the Emperor.

As a result of the reforms, over the next century the Greek-Catholic Church in Austrian Galicia ceased being a puppet of foreign interests and became the primary cultural force within the Ukrainian community. Most independent native Ukrainian cultural and political trends (such as Rusynophilia, Russophilia and later Ukrainophilia) emerged from within the ranks of the Greek-Catholic Church clergy. The participation of Greek Catholic priests or their children in western Ukrainian cultural and political life was so great that western Ukrainians were accused of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine by their Polish rivals. Among the political trends that emerged, the Christian social movement was particularly linked to the Ukrainian Catholic Church. Many people saw the Austrians as having saved the Ukrainians and their Church from the Poles, though it was the Poles who set into motion the Greek-Catholic cast of their church.
===The Church in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union===


After World War I, Ukrainian Greek Catholics found themselves under the governance of the nations of Poland, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Under the previous century of Austrian rule, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained such a strong Ukrainian national character that in interwar Poland, the Greek Catholics of Galicia were seen by the nationalist Polish and Catholic state as even less patriotic than the Orthodox Volhynians. Extending its Polonization policies to its Eastern Territories, the Polish authorities sought to weaken the UGCC. In 1924, following a visit with Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lwów (the Polish name at the time for Lviv), only being allowed back after a considerable delay. Polish Catholic priests, led by their Latin bishops, began missionary work among Greek Catholics; and administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

After World War II Ukrainian Catholics came under the rule of Communist Poland and the hegemony of the Soviet Union. With only a few clergy invited to attend, a synod was convened in Lviv, which revoked the Union of Brest. Officially all of the church property was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church under the Moscow Patriarchate, Most of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic clergy went underground. This catacomb church was strongly supported by its diaspora in the Western Hemisphere. Emigration to the U.S. and Canada, which had begun in the 1870s, increased after World War II.

According to Karel C. Berkhoff, during the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, the treatment of Christian churches by German authorities varied from denomination to denomination. The Nazi authorities were friendly towards Ukrainian Protestants and treated them with &quot;magnanimity&quot;, and were left unsuppressed; pacifist denominations were specifically favoured as well. Meanwhile, Greek and Latin Catholics were harshly persecuted, something that Berkhoff attributes to &quot;Nazi hostility to the Vatican combined with hostility to the Poles, who in Ukraine constituted the vast majority of these Christians&quot;. Latin Catholic and Uniate churches were closed, and Catholic clergy was a common target of Nazi executions. Nazi anti-Catholic policies were extended to Germans as well – the Catholic church in Mykolaiv was also forcefully closed, despite most of the parishioners being ethnic Germans.

In the winter of 1944–1945, Ukrainian Greek Catholic clergy were summoned to &#x27;reeducation&#x27; sessions conducted by the NKVD. Near the end of the war in Europe, the state media began an anti-Ukrainian-Catholic campaign. The creation of the community in 1596 was discredited in publications, which went to great pains to try to prove the Church was conducting activities directed against Ukrainians in the first half of the 20th century.

In 1945, Soviet authorities arrested, deported, and sentenced to forced-labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere the church&#x27;s metropolitan Yosyf Slipyi and nine other Greek Catholic bishops, as well as hundreds of clergy and leading lay activists. In Lviv alone, 800 priests were imprisoned. All the above-mentioned bishops and significant numbers of clergymen died in prisons, concentration camps, internal exile, or soon after their release during the post-Stalin thaw. The exception was metropolitan Yosyf Slipyi who, after 18 years of imprisonment and persecution, was released in 1963 thanks to the intervention of Pope John XXIII. Slipyi took refuge in Rome, where he received the title of Major Archbishop of Lviv, and became a cardinal in 1965.

The clergy who joined the Russian Orthodox Church were spared the large-scale persecution of religion that occurred elsewhere in the country (see Religion in the Soviet Union). In the city of Lviv, only one church was closed (at a time when many cities in the rest of Ukraine did not have a working church). Moreover, the western dioceses of Lviv-Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk were the largest in the USSR and contained the majority of the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s cloisters (particularly convents, of which there were seven in Ukrainian SSR but none in Russia). Orthodox canon law was also relaxed on the clergy allowing them to shave beards (a practice uncommon to Orthodoxy) and conduct liturgy in Ukrainian as opposed to Church Slavonic.

The Ukrainian Catholics continued to exist underground for decades and were the subject of vigorous attacks in the state media. The clergy gave up public exercise of their clerical duties, but secretly provided services for many lay people. Many priests took up civilian professions and celebrated the sacraments in private. The identities of former priests could have been known to the Soviet police who regularly watched, interrogated and fined them, but stopped short of arrest unless their activities went beyond a small circle of people. New secretly ordained priests were often treated more harshly.

The church even grew during this time, and this was acknowledged by Soviet sources. The first secretary of the Lviv Komsomol, Oleksiy Babiychuk, claimed:

 in this oblast, particularly in the rural areas, a large number of the population adheres to religious practices, among them a large proportion of youth. In the last few years, the activity of the Uniates [Ukrainian Catholics] has grown, that of representatives of the Uniates as well as former Uniate priests; there are even reverberations to renew the overt activity of this Church.

After Stalin died, Ukrainian Catholics hoped this would lead to better conditions for themselves, but such hopes were dashed in the late 1950s when the authorities arrested even more priests and unleashed a new wave of anti-Catholic propaganda. Secret ordinations occurred in exile. Secret theological seminaries in Ternopil and Kolomyia were reported in the Soviet press in the 1960s when their organizers were arrested. In 1974, a clandestine convent was uncovered in Lviv.

During the Soviet era, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church did flourish throughout the Ukrainian diaspora. Cardinal Yosyf Slipyi was jailed as a dissident but named &quot;in pectore&quot; (in secret) a cardinal in 1949; he was freed in 1963 and was the subject of an extensive campaign to have him named as a patriarch, which met with strong support as well as controversy. Pope Paul VI demurred, but compromised with the creation of a new title of major archbishop (assigned to Yosyf Slipyi on 23 December 1963
), with a jurisdiction roughly equivalent to that of a patriarch in an Eastern church. This title has since passed to Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky in 1984 and thereafter to Lubomyr Husar in 2000 and Sviatoslav Shevchuk in 2011; this title has also been granted to the heads of three other Eastern Catholic Churches.

In 1968, when the Greek Catholic Church was legalized in Czechoslovakia, a large-scale campaign was launched to harass recalcitrant clergy who remained illegal. These clergy were subject to interrogations, fines and beatings. In January 1969 the KGB arrested an underground Catholic bishop named Vasyl Velychkovsky and two Catholic priests, and sentenced them to three years of imprisonment for breaking anti-religious legislation.

Activities that could lead to arrest included holding religious services, educating children as Catholics, performing baptisms, conducting weddings or funerals, hearing confessions or giving the last rites, copying religious materials, possessing prayer books, possessing icons, possessing church calendars, possessing religious books or other sacred objects. Conferences were held to discuss how to perfect the methodology in combatting Ukrainian Catholicism in West Ukraine.

At times the Ukrainian Catholics attempted to employ legal channels to have their community recognized by the state. In 1956–1957, there were petitions to the proper authorities to request for churches to be opened. More petitions were sent in the 60s and 70s, all of which were refused. In 1976, a priest named Volodymyr Prokipov was arrested for presenting such a petition to Moscow. The response to these petitions by the state had been to sharpen attacks against the community.

In 1984 a samizdat &quot;Chronicle of the Catholic Church&quot; began to be published by Ukrainian Catholics. The founder of the group behind this publication, Yosef Terelya, was arrested in 1985 and sentenced to seven years imprisonment and five years of exile. His successor, Vasely Kobryn, was arrested and sentenced to three years of exile.

The Solidarity movement in Poland and Pope John Paul II supported the Ukrainian Catholics. The state media attacked John Paul II. The antireligious journal &quot;Liudyna i Svit&quot; (Man and the World) published in Kyiv wrote:

 Proof that the Church is persistently striving to strengthen its political influence in socialist countries is witnessed by the fact that Pope John Paul II gives his support to the emigre hierarchy of the so-called Ukrainian Catholic Church . . .. The current tactic of Pope John Paul II and the Roman Curia lies in the attempts to strengthen the position of the Church in all socialist countries as they have done in Poland, where the Vatican tried to raise the status of the Catholic Church to a state within a state. In the last few years, the Vatican has paid particular attention to the question of Catholicism of the Slavonic nations. This is poignantly underscored by the Pope when he states that he is not only a Pope of Polish origin, but the first Slavic Pope, and he will pay particular attention to the Christianization of all Slavic nations.
By the late 1980s there was a shift in the Soviet government&#x27;s attitude towards religion. At the height of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s liberalization reforms the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was allowed again to function officially in December 1989. But then it found itself largely in disarray with the nearly all of its pre-1946 parishes and property lost to the Orthodox faith. The church, actively supported by nationalist organizations such as Rukh and later the UNA-UNSO, took an uncompromising stance towards the return of its lost property and parishes. According to a Greek-Catholic priest, &quot;even if the whole village is now Orthodox and one person is Greek Catholic, the church [building] belongs to that Catholic because the church was built by his grandparents and great-grandparents.&quot;

The weakened Soviet authorities were unable to pacify the situation, and most of the parishes in Galicia came under the control of the Greek-Catholics during the events of a large scale inter-confessional rivalry that was often accompanied by violent clashes of the faithful provoked by their religious and political leadership. These tensions led to a rupture of relations between the Moscow Patriarchate and the Vatican.

===Current situation===
====Membership====
The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is the second largest Eastern Catholic Church in the world. As of 2022, it had approximately 4.2 million members. In Ukraine, the UGCC is the second largest religious organization in terms of number of communities within the Catholic Church. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church has third most members in allegiance among the population of Ukraine after the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church predominates in three western oblasts of Ukraine, including the majority of the population of Lviv, but constitutes a small minority elsewhere in the country.

The church has followed the spread of the Ukrainian diaspora and has some 40 hierarchs in over a dozen countries on four continents, including three other metropolitan bishops in Poland, the United States, and Canada. The Church in the diaspora including the United States and Canada is largely multi-ethnic. National surveys conducted since 2000 show that between 5.3% and 9.4% of Ukraine&#x27;s total population are of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In surveys, 18.6–21.3% of believers or religious people in Ukraine were Greek Catholic. Worldwide, the faithful now number some 6 to 10 million, forming the second largest particular Catholic Church, after the majority Latin Church.

According to a 2015 survey, followers of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church make up 8.1% of the total population (excluding Crimea) and form the majority in 3 oblasts:

* Lviv Oblast — 59% of the population
* Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast — 57%
* Ternopil Oblast — 52%

====Governance====
Most Ukrainian Catholic Churches have moved away from Church Slavonic; church services are mainly in the Ukrainian language. Many churches also offer liturgies in a country&#x27;s vernacular (i.e. German in Germany or English in Canada). Some parishes continue to celebrate the liturgy in Slavonic even today, however, and services in a mix of languages are not unusual.

In the early first decade of the 21st century, the major see of the Ukrainian Catholic Church was transferred to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The enthronement of the new head of the church Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk took place there on 27 March 2011 at the cathedral under construction on the left bank. On 18 August 2013, the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ was dedicated and solemnly opened.

On 5 July 2019, Pope Francis declared to the church&#x27;s leaders during a meeting in the Vatican &quot;I hold you in my heart, and I pray for you, dear Ukrainian brothers.&quot; He also advocated greater humanitarian aid to Ukraine and warned the Church&#x27;s Bishops to show &quot;closeness&quot; to their &quot;faithful.&quot; The Pope also told the Church leaders to that &quot;fruitful&quot; unity within the Church can be achieved through three important aspects of synodality: listening; shared responsibility; and the involvement of the laity.

====Position on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UGCC has promoted Ukrainian statehood and independence. It opened its churches and cathedrals to use as bomb shelters and warehouses. It has used its social organisations, such as Caritas Ukraine and Caritas-Spes, to provide humanitarian assistance. Several leading prelates, including Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, denounced the invasion and used their connections to the wider Catholic Church to gather support and provide information on the situation on the ground. Despite a few moments of tension between the leadership of the UGCC and Rome, namely over the inclusion of a Russian woman alongside a Ukrainian during the 2022 Good Friday Via Crucis, and the Pope&#x27;s words regarding the assassination of Darya Dugina, Shevchuk often emphasised Francis&#x27; support for Ukraine during the war.

One of the major issues has been the targeting of the Church by Russian forces. Churches have been destroyed, and priests have had to evacuate sacred items to protect them from attacks. Additionally, Russian occupation authorities have banned the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and other Catholic ministries in the occupied regions of Ukraine, such as Zaporizhzhia. This includes organizations like the Knights of Columbus and Caritas. Church leaders have also been targeted for assassination. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, has had to move between safe houses to avoid threats. The ongoing conflict has led to significant damage and threats to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and its members. 

Historical documents from the Soviet era have also shed light on the suppression of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. These documents reveal the extent of Soviet efforts to eradicate the Church&#x27;s influence in western Ukraine during the 1940s. The fate of the Crimean Exarchate of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church after the Russian occupation of the Crimean Peninsula has been particularly challenging. The local branches of the Church were labeled as &quot;agents of foreign influence&quot; and accused of spreading seditious ideas such as &quot;Ukrainian nationalism&quot; and &quot;separatism.&quot; This led to significant restrictions and threats to the Church&#x27;s activities in the region.

Russian and pro-Russian militants in occupied territories have reportedly engaged in systematic persecution of non-Orthodox faiths, often under the guise of the Russian Orthodox Church. Incidents include the torture of detainees by individuals disguised as priests and the abduction of religious leaders such as Ihor Kozlovsky. These actions reflect a broader strategy of using religion to justify violence and exert control, tied to the Kremlin and Moscow Patriarchate&#x27;s promotion of the &quot;Russian World.&quot; Halya Coynash has criticized the Vatican for failing to address these abuses in its 2016 statement with Patriarch Kirill.

The persecution extends to Catholic communities in occupied Ukraine, where Russian forces have intensified their crackdown on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC). According to the Institute for Religious Freedom, Russian militants have closed UGCC churches in the Donetsk region, barring worshippers from entering, and have seized church properties since early 2024. Clergy have been expelled from occupied territories, leaving the UGCC without any clergy in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. Two UGCC priests, Fathers Ivan Levitsky and Bohdan Geleta, were detained in Berdyansk in November 2022 and remain in harsh conditions in Russian custody, facing severe mistreatment, including torture. 

In December 2022, Russian-installed authorities in Zaporizhzhia banned the UGCC and other Catholic groups, labeling them as extremist organizations. This aligns with a pattern of religious repression by Russian forces, who have reportedly damaged or destroyed over 660 religious sites since 2022. Archbishop Borys Gudziak noted that religious institutions in Russia function only if aligned with state policies, a practice now being enforced in occupied Ukrainian regions.

====Calendar reform====
On 24 December 2022, Major archbishop Sviatoslav handed over to Metropolitan Epiphanius for review a letter outlining the considerations of the UGCC hierarchs regarding the , which aims to replace the use of the old Julian calendar with the Revised Julian calendar. The primates decided to create a joint working group on specific proposals for calendar reform. The joint group is initiated on the occasion of the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council, held in Nicaea in 325. In this Council, in particular, the calendar principles of church life were determined.

On 1–2 February 2023 in Lviv-Briukhovychi, the Synod of Bishops of the UGCC decided that from 1 September 2023, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine will switch to a new style (Revised Julian calendar) for fixed holidays with the preservation of the current Paschalion, which was announced by Supreme Archbishop Sviatoslav on February 6, 2023. The calendar reform will have two stages. The first refers to all fixed holidays, and the second to the Easter date which would be kept in the old Julian. Parishes of the UGCC that are not ready to switch to the new style in 2023 have a transition period until 1 September 2025 to make the change.

On 6 February 2023, the Archeparchy of Przemyśl–Warsaw, taking into account the previous decision of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine and the opinion of the Delegates of the Joint Diocesan Council in Porszewice in June 2022, adopted a decree on the transition to the Revised Julian calendar from 1 September 2023.

On 22 March 2023, the Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne, according to the decree of Bishop Mykola Bychok, decided that from 1 September 2023, the UGCC in Australia and Oceania will completely switch to the Gregorian calendar, including Easter.

According to the decree of Bishop Bohdan Dziurakh dated 22 April 2023, from 1 September 2023, the Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Germany and Scandinavia completely switches to the Gregorian calendar, including Paschal, in contrast to the UGCC in Ukraine, in Poland.

On 9 June 2023, the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of the Holy Family of London, according to the decree of Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski, switches from 1 September 2023 to the Gregorian calendar, in particular with Easter.

== Current administrative division ==







The Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo belongs to jurisdiction of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church rather than the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church moved its administrative center from Western Ukrainian Lviv to a new cathedral in Kyiv on 21 August 2005. The title of the head of the UGCC was changed from &quot;The Major Archbishop of Lviv&quot; to &quot;The Major Archbishop of Kyiv and Halych&quot;.

The Patriarchal Curia of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church is an organ of Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the UGCC, Major Archbishop of Kyiv and Halych, which coordinates and promotes the common activity of the UGCC in Ukraine to make influence on society in different spheres: education, policy, culture, etc. The Curia develops action of the Church&#x27;s structures, enables relations and cooperation with other Churches and major public institutions in religious and social areas for implementation of the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church through everyday life.

In 2011 the church introduced territorial subdivisions in Ukraine, metropolia. A metropolitan bishop, an archbishop of main archeparchy, may gather own metropolitan synod, decisions of which shall be approved by the Major Archbishop.

This is a list of the eparchies of the church that are subject to the Major Archbishop:

* Metropolitis of Kyiv – Galicia (2005)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Kyiv (, previously as uniate diocese, 1996)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archiepiscopal Exarchate of Donetsk (2002)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archiepiscopal Exarchate of Odesa (2003)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archiepiscopal Exarchate of Lutsk (previously as uniate diocese, 2008)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archiepiscopal Exarchate of Crimea (2014 as administration in Odesa)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archiepiscopal Exarchate of Kharkiv (2014)
* Metropolis of Lviv (1808–2005, 2011)
** Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv (, 1539–1946, 1989)

==Prison ministry of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church==

In contemporary Ukraine prison ministry of chaplains does not exist &quot;de jure&quot;. The prison pastoral care was at the very heart of the spirituality of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church throughout her history. Prison Pastoral of the UGCC was restored in 1990 after the Church, formerly forbidden, emerged from the underground. Pastoral care has grown steadily from several establishments in the Western Part of Ukraine to more than 40 penal institutions in every region of the country. Since 2001 the UGCC is the co-founder of the Ukrainian Interdenominational Christian Mission &quot;Spiritual and Charitable Care in Prisons&quot; including twelve Churches and Denominations. This Mission is a part of the World Association of Prison Ministry. The most active prison chaplains are the Redemptorist Fathers.

In the year 2006 Lubomyr Husar established in the Patriarchal Curia of the UGCC the Department for Pastoral Care in the Armed Forces and in the Penitentiary System of Ukraine. This structure implements a general management of Prison Ministry. The chief of the Department is Most Rev. Michael Koltun, Bishop of Sokal and Zhovkva. The head of the Unit for penitentiary pastoral care is Rev. Constantin Panteley, who is directly responsible for coordination of activity in this realm. He is in direct contact with 37 priests in 12 eparchies who have been assigned responsibility for prison pastoral care. Those pastors ensure regular attendance of penitentiary facilities, investigatory isolators and prisons.

==Ukrainian diaspora==
The Ukrainian Catholic Church in the United States has limited growth opportunities, because in the United States and in other non-Ukrainian jurisdictions, many parishes choose to focus on immigrants from Ukraine and their children (during the time the children are subject to parental control) as opposed to making new converts. They maintain this characteristic by resisting the use of English in liturgies and, in some parishes, insisting on the use of the Julian Calendar to calculate dates of Christmas, Easter, and other religious holidays, thus placing themselves outside the U.S. mainstream. The Ukrainian Catholic Church considers the descendants of those who migrated from Ukraine to be part of a &quot;diaspora.&quot; Around 40% of the diocesan priests in the diaspora are married, compared to 90% marriage rate of diocesan priests in Ukraine.

By the time the immigrants&#x27; children, and especially the immigrants&#x27; grandchildren, grow up, they have learned English in school, know little to no Ukrainian, and are otherwise fully assimilated into U.S. Most of the children are either members of the Latin Church or join some non-Catholic denomination. To the extent that a Ukrainian Catholic Church in the United States is able to make progress toward adaptation (e.g. the use of English in its liturgies and in the conducting of parish business), the next group of immigrants arrives from the old country and insists that the church maintain its old world characteristics without change and all former progress is reversed. For this reason, many parishes and Eparchies have begun to focus on producing converts.

In Canada, the wave of immigration from Galicia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led to the establishment of a number of Ukrainian Catholic churches in the Prairie provinces. The Ukrainian Catholic Church is also represented in other provinces, for example by the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and Eastern Canada, which includes dioceses in Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, and the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of New Westminster in British Columbia.

==De-Latinization vs. Traditionalism==
===Background===

Even before the Second Vatican Council the Holy See declared it important to guard and preserve the customs and distinct forms for administering the sacraments in use in the Eastern Catholic Churches (Pope Leo XIII, encyclical &quot;Orientalium Dignitas&quot;). After the Russian Revolution of 1905, the underground parish of the Russian Greek Catholic Church in St. Petersburg split between the followers of Pro-Latinisation priest Fr. Aleksei Zerchaninov and those of Pro-Orientalist priest Fr. Ivan Deubner. When asked by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky to make a decision on the dispute, Pope Pius X decreed that Russian Greek Catholic priests should offer the Divine Liturgy &quot;Nec Plus, Nec Minus, Nec Aliter&quot; (&quot;No more, No Less, No Different&quot;) than priests of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Old Believers.

In the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, liturgical de-latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. According to his biographer Cyril Korolevsky, Metropolitan Andrey opposed use of coercion against those who remained attached to Latin liturgical practices, fearing that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek-Catholic equivalent of the 1666 Schism within the Russian Orthodox Church.

Following the 1964 decree &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; during the Second Vatican Council and several subsequent documents, Latinisations were discarded within the Ukrainian diaspora. Meanwhile, among Byzantine Catholics in Western Ukraine, forced into a persecuted and secret existence following the Soviet ban on the UGCC, the latinizations remained, &quot;an important component of their underground practices&quot;, in illegal parishes, seminaries, and religious communities. After proscription of the UGCC was lifted in 1989, priests and hierarchs arrived from the diaspora and began to enforce a liturgical conformity that has been met with considerable opposition.

In response, many priests, nuns, and candidates for the priesthood found themselves, &quot;forced towards the periphery of the church since 1989 because of their wish to &#x27;keep the tradition&#x27;.&quot; In some eparchies, particularly those of Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil-Zboriv, the bishops would immediately suspend any priest who, &quot;displayed his inclination toward &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; practices&quot;.

In the February 2003 issue of &quot;Patriayarkhat&quot;, the official journal of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, an article appeared written by a student at the Ukrainian Catholic University, which since its 1994 foundation has been, &quot;the strongest progressive voice within the Church&quot;. The article named priests and parishes in every eparchy in Ukraine as being involved in &quot;a well-organized movement&quot; and who described themselves as &quot;traditionalists&quot;. According to the article, they constituted &quot;a parallel structure&quot; with connections with the Society of St. Pius X and with a charismatic leader in Fr. Basil Kovpak, the Pastor of St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Church in the suburb of Lviv-Riasne.

According to Vlad Naumescu, &quot;Religious life in a traditionalist parish followed the model of the &#x27;underground church.&#x27; Devotions were more intense, with each priest promoting his parish as a &#x27;place of pilgrimage&#x27; for the neighboring areas, thus drawing larger crowds on Sunday than his local parish could provide. On Sundays and feast days, religious services took place three times a day (in Riasne), and the Sunday liturgy lasted for two and a half to three hours. The main religious celebrations took place outside the church in the middle of the neighborhood, and on every occasion traditionalists organized long processions through the entire locality. The community was strongly united by its common opponent, re-enacting the model of the &#x27;defender of faith&#x27; common to times of repression. This model, which presupposes clear-cut attitudes and a firm moral stance, mobilized the community and reproduced the former determination of the &#x27;underground&#x27; believers.&quot;

===Basil Kovpak and the Society of St. Josaphat===

According to Vlad Naumescu, during the early 1990s, priests of the Society of Saint Pius X began visiting Western Ukraine and made contact with, &quot;a group of Greek Catholic priests and lay members that favored liturgical latinization (an important component of their underground practices) and helped them organize into an active society.&quot;

In 1999, Basil Kovpak and two other traditionalist UGCC priests asked Society of Saint Pius X Superior General Bishop Bernard Fellay to become their spiritual leader. The reasons for this move were that the three priests hoped to obtain both approval and support from fellow Traditionalist Catholics in the West. In September 2000, Bishop Fellay agreed and the Priestly Society of St. Josaphat was founded.

The Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat extends the SSPX&#x27;s criticism of indifferentism and Modernism in the Catholic Church to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. They oppose certain decisions of the Second Vatican Council and aspects of ecumenism and interreligious dialogue practiced by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Hierarchy and the Holy See.

In addition to opposing the banning of pre-Vatican II Latin liturgical practices and devotions, the Society rejects the shortened Divine Liturgy and the mirroring of the Mass of Paul VI that has been introduced from the Ukrainian diaspora, as well as the replacement of the traditional Church Slavonic liturgical language with the vernacular Ukrainian language. As an alternative, Kovpak and his fellow Greek Catholic traditionalists celebrate what they consider the &quot;Pravdyvyi&quot; (&quot;True&quot;) Rite, which often lasts two and a half to three hours.

On 10 February 2004 Cardinal Lubomyr Husar declared Kovpak excommunicated over his links to the SSPX. Kovpak announced his plans to appeal to the Holy See. The Sacra Rota Romana accepted his appeal and declared Kovpak&#x27;s excommunication null and void for lack of canonical form. The process was immediately restarted and Kovpak&#x27;s second decree of excommunication was confirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 21 November 2007. While pro-Kovpak Ukrainian traditionalists have often been accused of having links to the SSPX solely for financial reasons, they would not, according to Vlad Naumescu, have been able to survive as a movement without the money donated to them by Roman Rite traditionalists.

The Society operates a seminary in Lviv, where the seminarians are taught by Kovpak and by SPPX priests visiting from Poland. The Society also consists of a group of Greek Catholic nuns, who were forced to leave the Basilian Order in 1995, &quot;because of their &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; ideas&quot; and who now reside in the house where Blessed Nicholas Charnetsky died following his release from the Gulag. The room in which Kyr Nicholas died is now the convent&#x27;s chapel.

Unlike the Ukrainian orthodox Greek Catholic Church, Kovpak and the PSSJK reject both Sedevacantism and Conclavism.

===Sedevacantism and Conclavism in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church===
In 2008, a group of Basilian priests from Slovakia, after relocating to the Pidhirtsi monastery, declared that four of them had been consecrated bishops without permission of the Pope or the Major Archbishop. The &quot;Pidhirtsi fathers&quot; have claimed they opposed de-latinization, and also further claim that the members of the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek catholic church follows liberal theology due to ecumenism.

Because they had consecrated bishops without the authorization of Rome they were as of consequence officially excommunicated in 2008, in 2009 they constituted themselves as the &quot;Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church&quot;.

Having elected Czech Basilian priest Fr. Anthony Elias Dohnal as &quot;Patriarch Elijah&quot;, they declared on 1 May 2011 that both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI were excommunicated and that the Holy See was vacant (Sedevacantism). They added: &quot;The Byzantine Catholic Patriarchate is now commissioned by God to protect the orthodox doctrine of the Catholic Church, including the Latin Church. Only after an orthodox Catholic hierarchy and an orthodox successor to the Papacy is elected, will the Patriarchate be relieved of this God-given duty.&quot;

On 14 October 2019, the UOGCC broke with their former policy of Sedevacantism and embraced Conclavism. They announced they had elected Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, as their Pope.

In a 2014 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the UOGCC, Patriarch Elijah and his followers were alleged to be Pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian, and violently opposed to the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution. In the same article, Kyr Ihor Vozniak, UGCC Archeparch of Lviv, was quoted as saying that the UOGCC is financed and secretly led by the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR RF) () to introduce anarchy and chaos into the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

According to the Lviv-based newspaper &quot;Ekspres&quot;, Fr. Dohnal, alias Patriarch Elijah, was a KGB informer inside the Latin Diocese of Litoměřice before the Fall of Communism in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. In support of their claims, &quot;Ekspres&quot; published a document identifying Fr. Dohnal as a KGB mole with the code name &quot;Tonek.&quot; The UOGCC denies the accusation.

<text>Charles B. Wang (; August 19, 1944 – October 21, 2018) was a Chinese-American billionaire, businessman, and philanthropist, who was a co-founder and CEO of Computer Associates International, Inc. (later renamed CA Technologies). He was a minority owner (and past majority owner) of the NHL&#x27;s New York Islanders ice hockey team and their AHL affiliate.

In 1976, at age 31, Wang (pronounced &quot;Wong&quot;) launched Computer Associates, using credit cards for funding. Wang then grew Computer Associates into one of the country&#x27;s largest ISVs (independent software vendors). Wang authored two books to help executives master technology: &quot;Techno Vision&quot; (1994, McGraw-Hill) and &quot;Techno Vision II&quot; (1997, McGraw-Hill). Wang retired from Computer Associates in 2002. He was an active philanthropist, working with such organizations as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Islanders Children&#x27;s Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. In January 2022, the new UBS Arena in Belmont, home of the New York Islanders, raised a plaque to honor Wang for all his work and dedication to the team. Wang&#x27;s net worth was estimated to be $17.6 billion.

== Early life ==
Charles B. Wang was born in Shanghai to parents Kenneth and Mary Wang. He has two brothers, Anthony W. Wang and Francis Wang. His father was a Supreme Court judge in the Republic of China. In the closing years of the Chinese Civil War which saw the Nationalist government flee to Taiwan, the Wangs moved to Queens, New York City when he was eight years old. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Wang earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Queens College and began his computer career at Columbia University&#x27;s Riverside Research Institute.

== Business ==

=== Computer Associates ===

Wang and his business partner Russell Artzt established Computer Associates in 1976. By 1989, Computer Associates became the second software-only company to reach US$1 billion in revenues.

Wang&#x27;s tenure as CEO of Computer Associates was marked by rapid growth, frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies. Nearly all of Computer Associates&#x27; managers were promoted from within, so very few acquired managers were kept. Newly hired salespeople had some sales experience, but specifically not in software. A Master&#x27;s Degree in Business Administration held little to no value at CA, so employment candidates and acquired employees with MBAs were typically rejected. It was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because the firm&#x27;s training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling. The pass/fail demarcation was sharp, so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination. All told, Wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with Computer Associates employees.

He was also known for his commitment to a family-oriented management style, and for promoting several women to management positions. In 1979, three years after the company&#x27;s founding, Wang had installed his older brother Tony, a one-time corporate lawyer, as president and COO. Tony held the position until his retirement in 1992 to make way for Sanjay Kumar, who joined the company via its 1987 surprising acquisition of archrival Uccel Corporation. In 1998, Nancy Li, Charles Wang&#x27;s second wife, was named the company&#x27;s Chief Technology Officer (&quot;CTO&quot;). Responding to criticism over his so-called &quot;paternalistic&quot; management style, Wang had argued that the investment community punished Computer Associate&#x27;s stock price because of his refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

In 1998, Wang had initiated a $9 billion hostile takeover for the shares of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported CSC management&#x27;s &quot;concern&quot; about the tender offer by alluding to Computer Associates&#x27; &quot;ties to foreigners.&quot; It was a pointed reference to Wang&#x27;s origin and that certain Chinese government institutions (as well as those in North America, Europe and elsewhere) were Computer Associates clients. The suggestion was that becoming linked with Computer Associates would jeopardize CSC&#x27;s contracts with U.S. government agencies. Blaming what in his view was a witch-hunt with racial motivations, Wang dropped the tender offer.

In 2000, a class-action lawsuit accused Wang, then president Kumar and co-founder Artzt of wrongly reporting more than $2.5 billion in revenue in its 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal (April through March) years in order to artificially inflate the stock price. A previous stock option set in 1995 specified that a certain number of shares would vest when Computer Associates&#x27; shares sustained a target price. The benchmark was met in 1998, and the three executives combined received nearly $1 billion in Computer Associates stock with Wang himself netting $700 million; he had already been the highest paid CEO in the U.S. for the prior four years. Since then, at least four other class-action suits were filed against Computer Associates, all of which had named Wang specifically, and all of which were settled or dismissed without finding any liability on Wang&#x27;s part. As the controversy continued to dog Wang even after he returned a portion of the stock award, he quit as CEO in 2000 and later resigned as chairman of the board in 2002.

Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into the accounting scandal which improperly reported revenue. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Kumar on fraud charges on September 22, 2004. Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006.

=== New York Islanders ===
Wang was a minority owner of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001 to 2016. He later purchased the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island and renaming them the New York Dragons. Wang&#x27;s sometimes unorthodox decisions as owner received a mixture of praise and criticism.

According to former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang &quot;assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler&quot;. Milbury said that &quot;He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island.&quot;

Wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the Islanders competitive; however, recent team payrolls decreased as the Islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the 2006–07 and 2012–13 seasons.

Wang hired Neil Smith as the Islanders&#x27; general manager during the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, but 40 days later Smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the &quot;management by committee&quot; style of Wang. Wang then gave the job to Garth Snow, who subsequently retired from his playing position as the team&#x27;s backup goaltender. Wang said that &quot;philosophical differences&quot; were the basis for firing Smith. This series of personnel moves, combined with Wang&#x27;s approval of long-term contracts for Alexei Yashin and goaltender Rick DiPietro several years later, inspired a critical reaction from hockey journalists. Milbury reported that he had to talk Wang out of giving Michael Peca a ten-year deal.

A &quot;Forbes&quot; article investigated why certain NHL franchises could remain profitable despite poor attendance and overall league unprofitability. They found that several league owners under-reported their cable broadcast revenue; they specifically accused Wang of excluding half of the $17 million paid to the Islanders for the 2003 cable broadcast season. Wang made numerous efforts to build a new arena in Nassau County, as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the second-oldest active arena, and the Islanders lease ended in 2015.

He was the master developer of The Lighthouse Project, a property transformation of the Nassau Coliseum and surrounding . The project was to have included a five-star hotel; condominiums; an athletic complex featuring four ice rinks, a basketball facility, and a state-of-the-art health club that would have served as the Islanders&#x27; practice facility and would have also been open to the public. The development would also have included a sports technology center, open-air plaza, and conference center. The project was deemed to be too large by Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, who made a counter-proposal that was about half the size of what Wang had originally intended. Wang balked at Murray&#x27;s proposal, and decided to try to finance the building of a new arena for the Islanders with public funds, rather than paying for it himself as part of the Lighthouse Project. In May 2011, Wang, along with Nassau County, started an 82-day campaign for a $400 million bond to fund a new arena for the Islanders. On August 1, 2011, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 57% to 43%.

Wang had stated that he would not have bought the team if he knew how difficult it would be, and would not do so if he had the choice over again. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article detailed Wang&#x27;s &quot;desperate&quot; attempts to keep the team on Long Island. Ultimately, however, Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets&#x27; home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens. There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to the Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. In various interviews, Wang said that &quot;it was Brooklyn, or out of town&quot;. Despite the move, the franchise retained the New York Islanders name as they were geographically still on Long Island, and after a short second tenure at the Coliseum moved to the new UBS Arena in Elmont, New York in 2021.

In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell &quot;a substantial minority interest in the team&quot; to a group of investors, including Jon Ledecky and Scott D. Malkin.

== Philanthropy ==

Wang was an active philanthropist and in 1999 established the Charles B. Wang Foundation with the goal of donating to numerous charities that focused on bettering the lives of children and the disenfranchised. He worked with such causes as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. His donation of over $50 million to Stony Brook University for the construction of the Charles B. Wang Center was, at the time, the largest in history to a State University of New York school. He also funded the expansion of the Chinatown Health Clinic which was renamed the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center.

As the co-founder and chairman of Smile Train in 1999, Wang gave a $30 million initial gift to cover all administrative expenses and henceforth remained active in the charity&#x27;s efforts to help children with cleft lip and palates, in more than 80 countries.

One of the more important attributes that Wang brought to his ownership of the Islanders was to expand their community-based programs through the Islanders Children&#x27;s Foundation, which started in 2003 and has become a mainstay. The foundation works with children&#x27;s health, education, and youth hockey development charities. In 2006, the team created Project Hope, which is focused on developing ice hockey in China. Wang recruited women&#x27;s professional hockey player, Angela Ruggiero, to the project as well.

In 2000, Wang and his brothers, Anthony and Francis, donated a new law school to China&#x27;s Soochow University in honor of their father Kenneth Wang and in celebration of the university&#x27;s 100th anniversary, it opened officially in 2003.

== Awards and honors ==
On May 3, 2009, Wang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in &quot;Celebrating Chinese Americans in Sports&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Wang&#x27;s Cove Neck mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island is located near Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s home.

Wang died of lung cancer at his home in Cove Neck on October 21, 2018, at the age of 74.

Wang was survived by his mother; two brothers, Anthony and Francis; his wife, Nancy Li; and three children – Kimberly Dey, with his first wife, Ingrid S. Wang, and Jasmine and Cameron, with Ms. Li. He was also survived by three grandchildren.

<text>Residencial Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas, more commonly known as Residencial Las Casas, Caserio Las Casas or Las Casas, is a public housing complex located in San Juan, Puerto Rico consisting of 417 housing units. It is under the management of the Puerto Rico Housing Authority (&quot;Administración de Vivienda Pública&quot; in Spanish) and is under the federal housing program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was named after the famous Spaniard Roman Catholic Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas, who also has a town named after him in Mexico, namely San Cristóbal de las Casas.

The Complex is located in an area that was used by the United States military beginning in 1908, as a training camp for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry that saw action in World War I and World War II. During that era, the area was known as &quot;Camp Las Casas&quot;. It also was Puerto Rico&#x27;s first commercial air field, with the first Puerto Rican pilot, Félix Rigau Carrera, taking off on the first inter-island flight from the air field, and Aerovías Nacionales de Puerto Rico offering airline service during the 1930s.

Residencial Las Casas was built during the 1950s, after the military had left the area, with middle class customers in mind. Many of San Juan&#x27;s affluent families bought property there. One of its earliest residents was Puerto Rican actress Míriam Colón and activist Antonia Pantoja.

During the late 1970s, on September 26, 1978, resident Luciano Rivera made the headlines nationally, as he was one of a few survivors of an aviation crash, Air Caribbean Flight 309, that happened nearby; six people were killed when a Beech 18 belonging to Air Caribbean airlines crashed in Barrio Obrero, at a bar in front of the residencial, trying to land at Isla Verde after a domestic flight from Aguadilla.

By the early 1980s, salsa singer Cano Estremera, a resident, began bringing his musician friends over to practice at Las Casas. Estremera would go on to become a legendary singer and international super-star who, in 2003, made a CD commemorating his twenty years in the music industry.

<text>Schlumberger NV (), doing business as SLB, also known as Schlumberger Limited, is a French-American oilfield services company. As of 2022, it is both the world&#x27;s largest offshore drilling company and the world&#x27;s largest offshore drilling contractor by revenue.

Schlumberger is incorporated in Willemstad, Curaçao, Kingdom of the Netherlands. and trades on the New York Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, the London Stock Exchange and SIX Swiss Exchange. Its principal executive offices are located in Houston, Texas.

In 2022, the Forbes Global 2000 ranked Schlumberger the 349th largest company in the world.

== History ==

Schlumberger was founded in 1926 in Paris as the Electric Prospecting Company () by two brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from Alsace. Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic data processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction and carbon capture and storage industries.

The Schlumberger brothers had experience conducting geophysical surveys in countries such as Romania, Canada, Serbia, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the United States. The new company sold electrical-measurement mapping services, and recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France, in 1927. The company quickly expanded, logging its first well in the U.S. in 1929 in Kern County, California. In 1934, the Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation was founded in Houston, later evolving into Schlumberger Well Services, and finally Schlumberger Wireline and Testing. Schlumberger invested heavily in research, inaugurating the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Ridgefield, Connecticut, in 1948, contributing to the development of a number of new logging tools. In 1956, Schlumberger Limited was incorporated as a holding company for all Schlumberger Limited businesses, which by now included American testing and production company Johnston Testers.

Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. On February 2, 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. That same year, Schlumberger purchased Daystrom, an electronic instruments manufacturer in South Boston, Virginia, which was making furniture by the time the division was sold to Sperry &amp; Hutchinson in 1971. Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited.

In 1981, Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail. In 1983, Schlumberger opened its Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England.

In 1984, the SEDCO drilling rig company and half of Dowell of North America were acquired, resulting in the creation of the Anadrill drilling segment, a combination of Dowell and The Analysts&#x27; drilling segments. Forex Neptune was merged with SEDCO to create the Sedco Forex Drilling Company the following year, when Schlumberger purchased Merlin and 50% of GECO.

In 1987, Schlumberger completed its purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million.

In 1991, Schlumberger acquired PRAKLA-SEISMOS, and pioneered the use of geosteering to plan the drill path in horizontal wells.

In 1992, Schlumberger acquired software company GeoQuest Systems. With the purchase came the conversion of SINet to TCP/IP and thus internet capable. In the 1990s Schlumberger bought out the petroleum division, AEG meter, and ECLIPSE reservoir study team Intera Technologies Corp. A joint venture between Schlumberger and Cable &amp; Wireless resulted with the creation of Omnes, which then handled all of the company&#x27;s internal IT business. Oilphase and Camco International were also purchased.

In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world&#x27;s largest drilling fluids (mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% by Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture&#x27;s profits during the time the companies were in contempt.

In 2000, the Geco-Prakla division was merged with Western Geophysical to create the seismic data acquisition and processing contracting company WesternGeco, of which Schlumberger held a 70% stake, the remaining 30% belonging to competitor Baker Hughes. Sedco Forex was spun off, and merged with Transocean Drilling company in 2000.

In 2001, Schlumberger acquired the IT consultancy company Sema plc for $5.2 billion. The company was an Athens 2004 Summer Olympics partner, but the venture into IT consultancy did not pay off, and divestiture of Sema to Atos Origin was completed that year for $1.5 billion. The cards division was divested through an IPO to form Axalto, which later merged with Gemplus to form Gemalto, and the Messaging Solutions unit was spun off and merged with Taral Networks to form Airwide Solutions. In 2003, the Automated Test Equipment group, part of the 1979 Fairchild Semiconductor acquisition, was spun off to NPTest Holding, which was sold it to Credence in February 2004.

In 2004, Schlumberger Business Consulting was launched and a decade later was acquired by Accenture.

In 2005, Schlumberger purchased Waterloo Hydrogeologic, which was followed by several other groundwater industry related companies, such as Westbay Instruments, and Van Essen Instruments. Also that year, Schlumberger relocated its U.S. corporate offices from New York to Houston.

In 2006, Schlumberger purchased the remaining 30% of WesternGeco from Baker Hughes for US$2.4 billion. Also that year, the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center was relocated to a newly built research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to replace the Ridgefield, Connecticut, research center. The facility joins the other research centers operated by the company in Cambridge, England; Moscow, Russia; Stavanger, Norway; and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. In March 2022, Schlumberger stopped investing in its projects in Russia because of International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War.

In 2009, Schlumberger acquired Techsia SA, a software company based in Montpellier, France with a product widely used in the oil industry called Techlog. 

In 2010, the acquisition of Smith International in an all-stock deal valued at $11.3 billion was announced. The sale price is 45.84-a-share price was 37.5 percent higher than Smith closing price on 18 February 2010. The deal was the biggest acquisition in Schlumberger history until their acquisition of Cameron International. The merger was completed on August 27, 2010. Also announced in 2010 were Schlumberger plans to acquire Geoservices, a French-based company specializing in energy services, in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, including debt.

In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (&quot;Saxon&quot;), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schlumberger had a minority share in Saxon previously.

In 2015, Schlumberger was indicted by the US Department of Justice for sanction violations of conducting business in Iran and Sudan; the company was fined $233 million, amounting to the largest fine for sanctions to date.

In 2015, due to a downturn in the global oil and gas industry, Schlumberger announced 21,000 layoffs accounting for 15% of the company&#x27;s total workforce.

In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to acquire oilfield equipment manufacturer Cameron International for $14.8 billion.

In 2018, Schlumberger announced that WesternGeco would be exiting the seismic data acquisition business, both onshore and offshore, while retaining its multiclient data processing and interpretation segments. This decision followed the bankruptcy filings of several competitors in the seismic services sector.

In 2020, Schlumberger cut more than 21,000 jobs during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2021, Schlumberger New Energy announced the signature of pilot project agreements between the French state, Genvia and critical-industry leaders on the pathway to net zero in the cement and steel industries. Through these agreements, the goal is to scale up the next generation of electrolyzer technology, developed over the last two decades, to produce clean hydrogen without emissions, accelerating the decarbonization of multiple industrial sectors.

In 2022, Schlumberger completed a corporate rebranding to be known as SLB. According to media statements, the company&#x27;s CEO said the corporate rebranding is not a shift away from fossil fuels.

In August 2022, SLB announced that SLB OneSubsea was going into a joint venture with AkerSolutions and Subsea7. The ownership of SLB OneSubsea is 70% with Schlumberger, 20% with AkerSolutions and Subsea7 owning the last 10% 

In February 2023, SLB announced it had completed the acquisition of the Houston-headquartered gyroscopic wellbore positioning and survey technology company, Gyrodata Incorporated.

In April 2024, SLB announced its intention to acquire smaller rival ChampionX, in an all-stock deal valued at $7.75 billion, its largest purchase since Cameron International.

== Corporate affairs ==

=== France ===
The company has offices in multiple cities and regions in France: Abbeville, Béziers, Clamart, Montpellier, Pau and Paris.

Such sites and entities are as well at the forefront of the SLB New Energy strategy and development. (example: Geothermal with Celsius Energy and Hydrogen with Genvia)

=== United States ===
Schlumberger maintains a campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2017 Schlumberger is the third largest employer in the city. In 2015, Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of of Class A office space and an &quot;amenities&quot; building with of space.

In the 1930s, the North American headquarters were established in Houston. In the 1970s, the company&#x27;s top executives in North America were relocated to New York City. By 2006, the head office had 50 executives and support staff. By that year the company was moving that office to a building near the Houston Galleria.

The company moved its Houston-area offices from 5000 Gulf Freeway in Houston to the Sugar Land campus in 1995.

== Controversies ==

===Radioactive sources===
In 2006, a radioactive canister imported by Schlumberger was recovered in the Western Australian outback desert. The canister had been lost by the company&#x27;s transport partner, when the improperly secured container fell off the trailer on which it was being transported.

In 2010, the Aberdeen Sheriff court fined Schlumberger Oilfield UK £300,000 for losing a radioactive source on the rig floor on the Ensco 101 mobile drilling rig in the North Sea for 4 hours.

===Spills===
In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fined Chesapeake Appalachia LLC and Schlumberger Technology Corp. more than $15,500 each for a hydrochloric acid spill in February 2009 at Chesapeake&#x27;s Chancellor natural gas well site in Asylum Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Officials said the leak did not contaminate groundwater.

===PCB contamination===
In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department&#x27;s Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities.

=== Deepwater Horizon ===

In 2010, Schlumberger was contracted to perform wireline logging on the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. On the day of the explosion, the Schlumberger crew was supposed to perform a cement evaluation test, but the test was cancelled and the crew was released by BP to leave the rig on the same day. The cost-cutting decision to cancel the test is dramatized in the subsequent film by Peter Berg.

=== Business with Iran and Sudan ===
In 2015, Schlumberger pled guilty to violating U.S. sanctions related to Iran and Sudan and agreed to pay a $237 million penalty.

=== Sexual harassment ===
In 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed against Schlumberger, alleging a culture of sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. According to the company&#x27;s pay-gap report for 2018, women composed a mere 5.4% of field roles and 16.2% of roles in the full company. The lawsuit alleges that males regularly documented their harassment of female co-workers and flaunted them on public forums. Male colleagues would also encourage other men to break into a plaintiff&#x27;s room at night and stonewall her if she did not consent to sexual activity. The lawsuit also outlines instances of &quot;sexist and hostile comments&quot;, and one instance in which a plaintiff was groped. Women who complain to HR are told it is all just &quot;oil field talk&quot; and are subsequently ignored. When a plaintiff kept complaining, Schlumberger allegedly terminated the plaintiff. Women who spoke with &quot;The Texas Observer&quot; describe a culture of silence, where women stay silent for fear of being fired in the high turnover company.

=== Russia ===

In October 2022, it was reported that some of Schlumberger&#x27;s more than 9,000 Russian employees based in Russia received military draft notices through the company. Human rights groups such as Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre are watching how the company responds to the concerns. About a week later, the company said it was evaluating unspecified options for its thousands of Russian employees. According to a list maintained by the Chief Executive Leadership Institute at Yale University which tracks company responses about operating in Russia, Schlumberger is noted as &quot;buying time&quot; while it continues to carry out the bulk of its business in the country.

In March 2024, it was reported that SLB has no intentions of withdrawing from Russia, despite western pressure to reduce financial support to the Kremlin’s war efforts.

<text>The prime minister of Bangladesh (, : Bānlādēśēra pradhānamantrī), officially prime minister of the [[Bangladesh|People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh]] (, : Gaṇaprajātantrī bānlādēśēra pradhānamantrī), is the chief executive of the government of Bangladesh. The prime minister and the cabinet are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Parliament, to their political party and ultimately to the electorate. The prime minister is ceremonially appointed by the president of Bangladesh.

The position was taken over by the military during the years of 1975–78, 1982–86 and 1990–91 due to imposed martial law. In each of these periods, the national government leadership was controlled by the military with the executive authority of the president and the prime minister. During the period between 1996 and 2008, the chief adviser of the caretaker government exercised authority as per the constitution as chief executive for 90 days during the transition from one elected government to another. The chief adviser headed an advisory committee comprising ten advisers. With powers roughly equivalent to an elected prime minister, his executive power was constrained by certain constitutional limitations. The system was scrapped in 2011 by the 15th amendment of the constitution to allow any political government to conduct a general election in the future. However, on 17 December 2024, the 15th amendment was declared illegal by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.

Sheikh Hasina was the longest-serving prime minister in the country&#x27;s history until her forced resignation on 5 August 2024, which left the position vacant.

==Appointment==
According to the Constitution, the prime minister is appointed by the president based upon the result of the electorate&#x27;s choice in a parliamentary general election held by the Election Commission. The prime minister will be the leader of the majority party (or coalition) in the &quot;Jatiya Sangsad&quot; and must have the confidence of the &quot;Jatiya Sangsad&quot; to govern. The cabinet is composed of ministers selected by the prime minister and appointed by the president. At least 90% of the ministers must be MPs. The other 10% may be non-MP experts or &quot;technocrats&quot; who are not otherwise disqualified from being elected MPs. According to the constitution, the president can dissolve Parliament upon the written request of the prime minister. The appointments of the prime minister and other ministers of state and deputy ministers shall be made by the president:
At least nine-tenths of their number shall be appointed from among members of parliament, and not more than one-tenth of their number may be chosen from persons qualified for election as members of parliament.

The prime minister is appointed and sworn in by the president:

== Duties of the office ==

The office of the prime minister is located at Tejgaon in Dhaka city. It is considered a government ministry and, among other duties, provides clerical, security, and other support to the prime minister, governs intelligence affairs and NGOs, and arranges protocol and ceremonies.

== History and timeline==
Bangladesh&#x27;s origins lie in Bengal, a province of British India that included present-day West Bengal. Between 1937 and 1947, it was intermittently governed by a popularly elected ministry, whose head was often designated the premier of Bengal. In 1947, the Province of Bengal was partitioned into the Indian State of West Bengal and East Pakistan. All three erstwhile Bengal premiers—A. K. Fazlul Huq, Khawaja Nazimuddin and H. S. Suhrawardy—became Pakistani citizens; the latter two went on to become prime ministers of Pakistan in the 1950s.

East Pakistan&#x27;s history from 1947 to 1971 was marked by political instability and economic difficulties. The nascent democratic institutions foundered in the face of military intervention in 1958, and the government imposed martial law between 1958 and 1962 and again between 1969 and 1971. Between 1947 and 1971, it was intermittently governed by governors and the chief minister of East Pakistan.

=== Independence and first parliamentary era (1971–1975) ===
The modern office of the prime minister was established following the declaration of independence of East Pakistan with the Provisional Government of Bangladesh on 17 April 1971, of which Tajuddin Ahmad became the first prime minister of Bangladesh. Since the adoption of the current Constitution of Bangladesh in 1972 the formal title of the office is the prime minister of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh.

=== Military coups and presidential regimes (1975–1991) ===
From 1975 to 1991, the prime minister was appointed by the president while the president had executive power.

=== Return of parliamentary government (1991–present) ===
In September 1991, the electorate approved changes to the constitution, formally creating a parliamentary system and returning governing power to the office of the prime minister, as in Bangladesh&#x27;s original constitution. In October 1991, members of parliament elected a new head of state, President Abdur Rahman Biswas.

====Premiership of Khaleda Zia (1991–1996, 2001–2006)====
Khaleda Zia served as prime minister of Bangladesh twice from 1991 to 1996 and from 2001 to 2006. Once in power, Khaleda Zia&#x27;s government made substantial changes in education policy, introducing free education for girls up to the 10th grade, a stipend for female students, and food for education programme funds. It also made highest budgetary allocation in the education sector.

She became prime minister for the second consecutive term after the BNP had a landslide victory on 15 February 1996 general election to the sixth Jatiya Sangsad which is widely believed to be rigged voting after bribeing the election commissioner. The election was, however, boycotted by all other major parties who were demanding that the elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, following allegations of rigging in a by-election held in 1994. Turnout was estimated at around 5%, though the government at the time claimed it to be much higher. On 12 June 1996 polls, BNP lost to Hasina&#x27;s Awami League but emerged as the largest opposition party in the country&#x27;s parliamentary history with 116 seats.

Aiming to return to power, the BNP formed a four-party alliance on 6 January 1999 with its former political opinion Jatiya Party, and the Islamic party of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and the Islami Oikya Jot and launched several agitation programmes against the ruling Awami League. In the 2001 general elections BNP won the election with a two-thirds majority of seats in parliament and 46% of the vote (compared to the principal opposition party&#x27;s 40%) and Khaleda Zia was once again sworn in as the prime minister of Bangladesh.

In 2008 election, they faced a landslide defeat. Khaleda led four-party alliance won only 32 seats and emerged as the smallest opposition party in the country&#x27;s parliamentary history. They won only 32% of the total vote where their main rival Awami League won more than 50% of the total vote.

In the Tenth Jatiyo Sangsad election of 2014, the BNP along with its 18 party alliance boycotted and violently protested the election to no avail.

==== 2007 political crisis and caretaker government====

The scheduled 22 January 2007 elections were marred by controversy. The Awami League and its allies protested, saying that the elections would not be fair because of alleged bias by the caretaker government in favour of Khaleda Zia and the BNP. Hasina demanded that the head of the caretaker government, President Iajuddin Ahmed, step down from that position, and on 3 January 2007, she announced that the Awami League and its allies would boycott the elections. Later in the month, the military led by Army chief general Moinuddin Ahmed intervened and President Iajuddin Ahmed was asked to resign as the chief adviser. He was also made to declare a state of emergency. A new military-controlled caretaker government was formed with Fakhruddin Ahmed as the chief adviser. The scheduled parliamentary election was postponed.

On 12 January 2007, President Iajuddin Ahmed swore in Fakhruddin Ahmed as the chief adviser to the interim caretaker government. For a country widely perceived as one of the world&#x27;s most corrupt, the most dramatic aspect of Fakhruddin Ahmed&#x27;s rule is his antigraft campaign against the establishment. So far, more than 160 senior politicians, top civil servants and security officials have been arrested on suspicion of graft and other economic crimes. The roundup has netted former ministers from the two main political parties, including former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina and former adviser Fazlul Haque.

On 11 May 2017, the Office of Bangladesh Prime Minister Hasina Wazed announced that US secretary of state Hillary Clinton called her office in March 2011 to demand that Muhammed Yunus, a 2006 Nobel Peace prize winner, be restored to his role as chairman of microcredit bank, Grameen Bank. The bank&#x27;s nonprofit Grameen America, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative. Grameen Research, which is chaired by Yunus, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website.

==== Premiership of Sheikh Hasina (1996–2001, 2009–2024)====
Sheikh Hasina lost to Khaleda Zia in the 1991 parliamentary election after managing to win 88 seats and her party sat in opposition benches. She boycotted the 1996 February 15 elections giving Khaleda Zia a default victory.

The Awami League won 146 seats in the 1996 June 12 parliamentary elections. The support of the Jatiya Party and a few independent candidates were enough for the 150 or more seats needed for the required majority. Hasina took the oath as the prime minister of Bangladesh. She vowed to create a &quot;Government of National Unity&quot;. Though some smaller parties and a few individuals from BNP did join the government, the distance between the main two political parties as well as their leaders remained as large as ever.

The Awami League was defeated in the 2001 Parliament election. It won only 62 seats in the Parliament, while the Four-Party Alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party won more than 200 seats, giving them a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. Hasina herself was defeated from a constituency in Rangpur, which happened to contain her husband&#x27;s hometown, but won from three other seats. Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the president and the caretaker government. However, the international community was largely satisfied with the elections and the Four-Party Alliance went on to form the government.

In the December 2008 election, the Sheikh Hasina–led Awami League got a landslide victory, winning 230 seats, which gave them the two-thirds majority in the parliament. She made an alliance with JP and left fronts and her grand alliance won 252 seats in the parliament. Sheikh Hasina took oath as prime minister on 6 January 2009. She was the prime minister of Bangladesh after winning a walkover 5 January 2014 election when Khaleda Zia&#x27;s BNP boycotted the general election.

Sheikh Hasina secured a fourth term as prime minister after winning the 2018 general election. Hasina became the longest-serving prime minister of Bangladesh since independence.

After nationwide protests against the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee from Bangladesh to India.

<doc id="461893" wikidata="Q6618709" url="?curid=461893" title="List of elections in the Province of Canada">
<text>The Province of Canada was the union of Canada West (formerly Upper Canada and later Ontario) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada and later Quebec). The new Province had a single bicameral Parliament, replacing the parliaments of Lower Canada and Upper Canada. The new Parliament consisted of the elected lower house, the Legislative Assembly, and the appointed upper house, the Legislative Council.

The Province of Canada lasted from 1841 to 1867, when it was dissolved upon the creation of Canada by the Confederation process. During its existence, there were eight general elections to elect the members of the Legislative Assembly. The first general election was in the spring of 1841, while the eighth and last was in 1863. While party lines were somewhat blurred, there were political parties.

There are many examples of groups of MPs going against the party line, or splitting a party into two. A good example of this is when a number of Liberal MPs supported John A. Macdonald, a Conservative, and his idea for Canadian Confederation, many other Liberal Party members were opposed to Confederation.

After the establishment of the double majority principle, any bill, to be passed, needed a majority of MPs from both Canada West and Canada East. This sometimes led to coalitions between Ontario Liberals and Quebec Tories, or vice versa. The elections listed below are divided into &quot;Left&quot; or &quot;Reformer&quot; camps, and &quot;Right&quot; or &quot;Conservative&quot; camps.

== 1841 ==
The general election began on March 8, 1841, and continued into early April.

Four major parties contested the 1841 election. The Reformers from Canada West were a group of pro-democracy, radical Reformers who wanted to change the government. The Family Compact from Canada West was a group of rich Tories interested in the status quo.
Canada East had two similar groups. Les Patriotes, a reformist group consisting largely of French Canadians, and the Tories, a mostly English group.
==1844==
By 1841, the Family Compact had started calling itself Tories as well. This election also saw the creation of the Liberal Party, made up of pro-Patriot members from Canada East, who spoke English.
==1848==
By 1848, the Reformers were popular once more in Canada West. 
Due to the problems of the last parliament, the Governor General was ordered to sign everything that came from this legislature, marking the birth of responsible government in Canada. This was the celebrated Ministry of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin.

==1851==
Before the 1851 election, the Patriotes changed their name to Ministeralists. After being popular and in power for so long, they began to somewhat favour the status quo, and began to lose their &quot;radical&quot; roots. The remaining Patriotes, became &quot;Rouges&quot;, or &quot;Reds&quot; in English.
==1854==
1854 was unique, seeing a new group rise. Some reformers were unhappy with the slow pace of reforms, and began to oppose the reformist government. They called themselves &quot;Clear Grits&quot; in Canada West, and gained the support of the Liberals and Rouges in Canada East. Also, around this time, the Tories began to refer to their group as the &quot;Conservative Party&quot;.
To stay in government, the moderate reformers formed a coalition with the Conservatives. The better-formed Conservative party, led by Sir John A. Macdonald, took over the Reform Party, and the remaining Reformers left for the Clear Grits, renaming the party, the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is still known as the &#x27;Grits&#x27; in most of English speaking Canada today.

==1858==
1858 saw the birth of the &quot;Bleu&quot; movement in Quebec. Former Ministeralists became French-Canadian Tories, and took on the name &quot;Bleu&quot; or Blue, to oppose the Rouges. The &quot;new&quot; politics were more Liberal vs. Conservative than Reform vs. the status quo as many former Reformers began to sit with the Conservatives. This Ministry was headed by George Brown.
==1861==
The election of 1861 saw the Liberal party finally become united. This election is notable as exactly 29 Liberals were elected from each half of the Province of Canada, and exactly 35 MPs supportive of the Conservative/Centrist movements were elected from each half, which created a regionally balanced government.
== 1863 ==
The final election for the Province of Canada took place in 1863. By this time, most liberals and conservatives were in favour of representation by population and confederation. George Brown led a group of Upper Canadian liberals to form a coalition with the Upper Canadian conservatives and the Lower Canadian Bleus, and began a discussion on confederation of all of the British North America colonies. The confederation project received wide support from Upper Canada, general opposition from the maritimes and Lower Canada was divided. Confederation was eventually achieved when 3 of the 6 colonies joined together to become the first four provinces of Canada.
This election was followed by the first federal election, the 1867 Canadian federal election, and later on the first provincial elections. 1867 marked the beginning of two founding myths: the founding of the Canadian nation in English Canada and the pact between two founding peoples in French Canada.

When Canada became a Dominion of the British Empire, the Conservatives and Liberals retained their names, while the former Reformers became Liberal-Conservatives, and continued to work very closely with the Conservative Party.

<doc id="461896" wikidata="Q735575" url="?curid=461896" title="Prime Minister of Pakistan">
<text>The prime minister of Pakistan (, romanized: Wazīr ē Aʿẓam , ) is the head of government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Executive authority is vested in the prime minister and his chosen cabinet, despite the president of Pakistan serving as the nominal head of executive. The prime minister is often the leader of the party or the coalition with a majority in the lower house of the Parliament of Pakistan, the National Assembly where he serves as &quot; Leader of the House&quot;. Prime minister holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the National Assembly. The prime minister is designated as the &quot;chief executive of the Islamic Republic&quot;.

Pakistan&#x27;s prime minister leads the executive branch of the federal government, oversees the state economy, leads the National Assembly, heads the Council of Common Interests as well as the Cabinet, and is charged with leading the National Command Authority over Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear weapons arsenal. This position places its holder in leadership of the nation and in control over all matters, both internal affairs and foreign policy. The prime minister is elected by the members of the National Assembly and is therefore usually the leader of the majority party in the parliament. The Constitution of Pakistan vests executive powers in the prime minister, who is responsible for appointing the Cabinet as well as running the executive branch, taking and authorizing executive decisions, appointments, and recommendations that require prime ministerial confirmation.

Constitutionally, the prime minister serves as the chief adviser to the president of Pakistan on critical matters; and plays an influential role in appointment in each branch of the military leadership as well as ensuring civilian control of the military through chairman joint chiefs, although this does not necessarily happen in tandem. Prime ministerial powers have significantly grown with a delicate system of check and balance by each branch. The position was absent during the years of 1958–1973, 1977–1985, and 1999–2002 due to imposed martial law. In each of these periods, the military junta led by the president had the powers of the prime minister.

==History==
The office of the prime minister was created on immediate effect after the partition and the establishment of Pakistan in 1947; the prime minister existed alongside the governor-general who was the representative of the British monarchy. The first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, exercised central executive powers until his assassination in 1951. The powers slowly began to be reduced as a result of constant intervention by the governor-general. Despite the first set of the Constitution giving central power in 1956, the next six prime ministers were dismissed by the governor-general from 1951 till 1957. The first set of the Constitution had evolved the governor-general into the president of Pakistan whilst declaring the country an &quot;Islamic republic&quot;. In 1958, President Iskandar Mirza dismissed the seventh prime minister to impose martial law in a mere two weeks, President Mirza was ousted by army chief General Ayub Khan who had for a brief period held the post of prime minister.

In 1962, the second set of the Constitution completely dissolved the office of prime minister as all powers were transferred to the president of Pakistan. Criticism over the presidency after the presidential election held in 1965 over the centralizing of powers. After the general elections held in 1970, the office was established with Nurul Amin becoming the prime minister who was also the vice-president. Negotiations that fall apart between Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Mujibur Rehman, and Yahya Khan that prompted to liberation movement in the East Pakistan. With India intervening in East Pakistan and Pakistan conceding defeat to end the war led to the collapse of the presidential system in 1971.

As the comprehensive Constitution reinstated in 1973, the post was reestablished with more central powers as the constitution provided a parliamentary system with President of Pakistan as figurehead. Amid agitation instigated by the right-wing alliance invited the military intervention in 1977 which suspended the post.

The general elections held in 1985 restored the post, with Muhammad Junejo becoming the prime minister. Later that year, the National Assembly passed the controversial eighth amendment to the Constitution, giving the president the power to dismiss the prime minister and the National Assembly without prior consultation. The general elections in 1988 resulted in the Pakistan Peoples Party&#x27;s Benazir Bhutto becoming the first woman prime minister elected in a Muslim country.

From 1988 to 1993, the power struggle between the prime minister and presidency continued with the president dismissing the National Assembly on three different occasions. At the 1997 elections, the PML(N) secured a two-thirds majority in the Parliament and drafted the XIII and XIV Amendments to reverse the eighth amendment to the Constitution; this allowed Nawaz Sharif to centralize more executive powers. After the draw down of civil-military relations in 1999, Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf staged a coup d&#x27;état against the PML(N)&#x27;s government and held nationwide elections in 2002.

With no party gaining a majority, a coalition was formed with the PML(Q) – a breakaway of the PML(N) and a pro-Musharraf party – leading with MQM. After some political wrangling, Zafarullah Jamali became the prime minister, and passed the XVII amendment which partially restored the power of the president to dissolve the National Assembly, but made the dissolution subject to the Supreme Court of Pakistan&#x27;s approval.

Over the authority issues, Prime Minister Jamali resigned in 2004 and Shaukat Aziz was eventually appointed as prime minister, securing 151 out of 191 votes in the National Assembly. The XVII amendment featured a semi-presidential system allowing the presidency to keep the interference executive and the judiciary. The general elections in 2008 resulted in the PPP coming to power and supporting the movement to oust Pervez Musharraf. A populist intellectual movement leading to the departure of Pervez Musharraf allowed Asif Zardari to become president. In 2010, the XVIII Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan was passed to reverse the XVII amendment; it returned the country to being a parliamentary democratic republic. The XVIII Amendment removed all powers of the presidency to dissolve the Parliament unilaterally and sweep away the powers amassed by the former presidents Pervez Musharraf and Zia-ul-Haq to maintain a delicate check and balance.

Following a contempt of court case, the Supreme Court permanently disqualified Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gillani. Originally, the PPP nomination was Makhdoom Shahbuddin, but he was forced to withdraw after the ANF issued non-bailable arrest warrants against him. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf became the prime minister and remained in office until 2013. The general election held in 2013 saw the PML(N) almost achieve a supermajority. Following this, Nawaz Sharif was elected as prime minister, returning to the post for the third time after a fourteen-year absence, in a democratic transition. In July 2017, Nawaz Sharif was disqualified as prime minister, not on the corruption charges linked to Panama papers leak that he was questioned for in extension due to his sons, but for failing to declare as in his nomination papers, salary from a company owned by his son. His lawyer insisted that though the ousted prime minister &quot;was&quot; designated chairman of the company, he had never drawn any salary from the company, however, the judges consulting Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary chose to disqualify Nawaz Sharif for not paying taxes on an asset he never held but could have.

On 18 August 2018, Imran Khan was sworn in as the country&#x27;s 22nd prime minister. On 10 April 2022, a constitutional crisis culminated in Khan losing a motion of no confidence with 174 votes cast against him, ending his premiership and making him the first Prime Minister of Pakistan to be legitimately removed from office, through a motion of no confidence.

On 11 April 2022, Shehbaz Sharif was elected as the country&#x27;s 23rd Prime Minister. He won by majority 174 votes in the National Assembly of Pakistan. Sharif will serve a term, at most of almost one year to fulfill Imran Khan&#x27;s term until the 2023 Pakistani General Election, though the election may be called earlier.

On 3 March 2024, Shehbaz Sharif was re-elected for the second time as the country&#x27;s 24th Prime Minister. He won by majority in the National Assembly of Pakistan against Omar Ayub Khan in a disputed elections.

==Constitutional law==

The Constitution envisages a scheme of affairs in which the president of Pakistan is the head of state who represents the &quot;unity of the Republic.&quot; The system of government in Pakistan is based on codified constitution which sees the prime minister as &quot;chief executive of the Republic.&quot;

The prime minister is also the chairman of the Council of Common Interests as set by:
As in most of the parliamentary democracies, a head of state&#x27;s duties are mostly ceremonial. The prime minister of Pakistan is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power. With Pakistan following a parliamentary system of government, the Prime minister is generally the leader of a party (or coalition of parties) that has a majority in the National Assembly —the lower house of the Parliament of Pakistan. The prime minister, in common with all other ministers, has to be a member of National Assembly.

===Role and powers===

The principal workplace of the prime minister is the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office located in northeast Islamabad. The official residence, known as Prime Minister Enclave, is near the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The prime minister is the chief executive who heads and exercises the authority of the Government of Pakistan. After obtaining a vote of confidence, the prime minister is invited by the president to take the oath of office and form the government. In practice, the prime minister nominates the members of the Cabinet who supervise the important functions and ministries of the Government of Pakistan and communicates to the president all decisions of the Cabinet relating to the administration of affairs of state and proposals for legislation.

The prime minister, in consultation with the Cabinet, schedules and attends the sessions of the Parliament and is required to answer questions from members of parliament to the ministers.
The prime minister makes appointments on various important positions, including:
* The federal secretaries as head of cabinet-level ministries
* The chief secretaries of the provinces
* Key administrative and military personnel in the Pakistan Armed Forces
* The chairmen of large public sector organisations and corporations such as NHA, PIA, PNSC etc.
* The chairmen and other members of the federal commissions and public institutions
* Ambassadors and High Commissioners to other countries

Some specific ministries are usually allocated to the prime minister:
* Planning Commission
* National Command Authority
* National Security Council
* Economic Coordination Committee
* Cabinet Committee on National Security

The prime minister is vested with command authority over the Pakistani nuclear arsenal and represents the country in various delegations, high-level meetings, and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office and also addresses the nation on various issues of national importance.

===Eligibility===
The Constitution of Pakistan requires that the prime minister be a member of the National Assembly. As well as this, one must:
* be a citizen of Pakistan.
* be a Muslim
* be above 25 years of age
* be able to prove good conduct of character and be not commonly known to violate Islamic injunctions
* have adequate knowledge of Islamic teachings and practice obligatory duties prescribed by Islam, as well as abstaining from major sins
* have not, after the establishment of Pakistan, worked against the integrity of the country or opposed the ideology of Pakistan.

===Selection and removal===
The candidates for the prime minister are members of the National Assembly who were chosen through direct elections by popular vote following campaigning on the party platforms. Usually, the leader of the majority party in the parliament retains the office of prime minister, and forms the government either by coalition or by simple majority. The candidate must retain the vote of confidence of the members of the parliament before being invited by the president to form the government.

The prime minister can be removed before the expiry of the term through a vote of no confidence in the parliament. If the vote of no confidence is passed by the National Assembly by a simple majority, the prime minister ceases to retain the office. In the past, prime ministers (and their governments) have been dismissed by the president exercising the VIII Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (1985), but this was repealed by the XVIII Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan (2010). The prime minister has absolute constitutional immunity from criminal and civil proceedings, and no proceedings can be initiated or continued against him during the term of his office.

In 2012, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has ceased at least one prime minister from retaining the office due to contempt of court after retroactively disqualifying the membership of the parliament permanently.

On 28 July 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan disqualified the prime minister Nawaz Sharif from retaining the office due to his failure in fulfilling the eligibility requirements as enshrined in Articles 62 of the Constitution. This was in the aftermath of the Supreme Court hearing regarding the Panama Papers Case. This also resulted in him being permanently disqualified from membership of the parliament.

The prime minister is elected by the National Assembly. The National Assembly meets on the twenty-first day after a general election (at least every five years) unless the president calls for a vote of no confidence. Whichever member of the National assembly is chosen serves as the prime minister until the next election or until he fails to maintain the confidence of the National Assembly.

===Oath of office===
The prime minister is required to make and subscribe to, in the presence of the president, an oath or affirmation that they shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution as follows:

<text>The prime minister of Pakistan (, ) is the head of the Government of Pakistan. The prime minister is vested with the responsibility of running the administration through his appointed federal cabinet, formulating national and foreign policies to ensure the safeguard of the interests of the nation and its people through the Council of Common Interests as well as making the decision to call nationwide general elections for the bicameral Parliament of Pakistan.

Since 1947, Pakistan has had 20 prime ministers, aside from the appointed caretaker prime ministers who were only mandated to oversee the system until the election process was finished. In Pakistan&#x27;s parliamentary system, the prime minister is sworn in by the president and usually is the chairman or the president of the party or coalition that has a majority in the National Assembly– the lower house of Pakistan Parliament.

After the partition of British India on the midnight of 14/15 August 1947, Pakistan followed the British system by creating the post of prime minister based at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat. The then governor-general of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, took advice from the Founding Fathers of the nation and appointed Liaquat Ali Khan to establish and lead his administration on 15 August 1947. Before the presidential system in 1960, seven prime ministers had served between 1947 until martial law in 1958. In 1971, the office was again revived but ceased to exist shortly. Executive powers and authority was given to the prime minister when the full set of the Constitution of Pakistan was promulgated in 1973 but the post was ceased from its effective operations after another martial law in 1977. After the general elections held in 1985, the office came to its existence. During 1985 to 1997 executive powers were share between presidents and prime ministers due to 8th amendment to Constitution. In 1997, 13th amendment were passed and prime minister again got executive powers. Between 1988 and 1999, the office was held by Benazir Bhutto of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party and Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League (N), each holding the office for two non-consecutive terms between 1988 and 1999: Bhutto during 1988–90 and 1993–96; and Sharif during 1990–93 and 1997–99.

After the general elections held in 2002, Zafarullah Khan Jamali was invited to form his administration as its prime minister. After the Supreme Court of Pakistan&#x27;s ruling to disqualify Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani in 2012, the business of his administration was looked after by Raja Pervez Ashraf until the caretaker administration was setup under Mir Hazar Khan Khoso.

Nurul Amin of the Muslim League had the shortest term, at 13 days. Yusuf Raza Gilani of the Pakistan Peoples Party had the longest consecutive term of 4 years and 86 days. At approximately 9 years and 215 days in total, Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League (N) has been the longest-serving prime minister for a non-consecutive term. Sharif was re-elected for a third non-consecutive term on 5 June 2013, which is a record in the history of Pakistan. No prime minister of Pakistan has yet served their full five-year term.

<doc id="461908" wikidata="Q6679300" url="?curid=461908" title="Lord Gray">
<text>Lord Gray is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. The Barony of Gray was created circa July 1445 for the Scottish diplomat and politician Sir Andrew Gray. The first Lord Gray was a hostage in England for the good conduct of James I of Scotland from 1424 to 1427, and was one of the knights who accompanied Lady Margaret Stewart to France for her marriage to Louis XI of France in 1436. 

He was also a Commissioner to England between 1449 and 1451, Master of the Household to James II of Scotland in 1452, and a Warden of the Marches in 1459. In June 1489 King James IV granted to Andrew, Lord Gray, the lands and Barony of Lundie.

Sir Andrew Gray&#x27;s descendant, the seventh Lord, was granted a new patent with remainder to William Gray, husband of his only daughter Anne, and his heirs male, and in failure thereof to William Gray&#x27;s father Sir William Gray, and his heirs male whatsoever. He was succeeded according to the new patent by his grandson, the eighth Lord, the son of William and Anne Gray. In 1707 he also obtained a new patent, with the precedency of 1445, and with remainder to John Gray, husband of his daughter Marjory, and the heirs of their bodies, and, in failure thereof, to the elder heir female.

Lord Gray was succeeded already in his own lifetime by his son-in-law John Gray, the ninth Lord. His great-grandson, the fourteenth Lord, was a Scottish representative peer from 1812 to 1842. His son, the fifteenth Lord, was also a Scottish Representative Peer and sat in the House of Lords from 1842 to 1867. He died childless and was succeeded according to the patent of 1707 by his sister, Madelina Gray. She never married and on her death the title passed to her niece Margaret Murray. When she died in 1878 the Lordship was inherited by her cousin George Stuart, 14th Earl of Moray, who became the 18th Lord Gray as well. He was a descendant of Hon. Jean Gray, eldest daughter of the eleventh Lord Gray.

However, on his death the earldom and lordship separated, with the earldom being inherited by a male cousin. The lordship of Gray was passed on to (according to a decision by the Committee for Privileges in the House of Lords) Eveleen Smith, daughter of Lady Jane Pounden, daughter of Francis Stuart, 10th Earl of Moray. In 1897 Lady Gray and her husband James McLaren Smith assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Gray. 

She was succeeded by her son, the twentieth Lord, and on his death in 1919 the title passed to his sister Ethel Eveleen Campbell, wife of Henry Tufnell Campbell, who both assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Gray the following year. the title is held by her great-grandson, the twenty-third Lord Gray, who succeeded his father in 2003.

The family seat is Airds Bay House, near Taynuilt, Argyllshire.

<doc id="461911" wikidata="Q180361" url="?curid=461911" title="Gagauz people">
<text>The Gagauz (; ) are a Turkic ethnic group native to southern Moldova (Gagauzia, Taraclia District, Basarabeasca District) and southwestern Ukraine (Budjak). Gagauz are mostly Eastern Orthodox Christians. The term Gagauz is also often used as a collective naming of Turkic people living in the Balkans, speaking the Gagauz language, a language separated from Balkan Gagauz Turkish.

==Etymology==
&quot;Gagauz&quot; is the most widely accepted singular and plural form of the name, and some references use &quot;Gagauzy&quot; (from Ukrainian) or &quot;Gagauzi&quot;. Other variations including &quot;Gagauzes&quot; and &quot;Gagauzians&quot; appear rarely.

Before the Russian Revolution they were commonly referred to as &quot;Turkic-speaking Bulgars&quot;. Gagauz agricultural settlers in Uzbekistan called themselves &quot;Eski Bulgars&quot; (meaning Old Bulgars) in the 1930s.

According to Astrid Menz:

==Geographical distribution==

Outside Moldova, a minority of Gagauz people live in the Ukrainian regions of Odesa and Zaporizhzhia. They are also in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Brazil, Turkmenistan, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Georgia, Turkey, and the Russian region of Kabardino-Balkaria.

The Gagauz people are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Moldova. During the Russian colonization of southern Bessarabia (Budjak), in the early 19th century, the Gagauz people moved from the eastern Balkans, beginning to stabilize their presence on the future territory of the Republic of Moldova. The Gagauz are not equally distributed on the territory of Moldova, living primarily in the southern part of the country, particularly in the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia. They follow a primarily rural lifestyle.

The Gagauz are the third minority ethnic group in the Republic of Moldova, counting 126,010 people according to the 2014 census, i.e. 4.57% of the total population (without Transnistria). Their share in the ethnic composition of the country is gradually increasing. They are the majority of Gagauzia&#x27;s population (83.8%), while in Taraclia District, which is inhabited primarily by Bulgarians, they comprise 9.0% of the total population. In Bessarabsky District they are 7.4% of the district&#x27;s population, but gradually declining. In Cahul district, they have a small presence (2.7% of the district&#x27;s population). In the rest of Moldova their share is lower than 1%. The internal migration of Gagauz in Moldova is low. Most Gagauz who leave Gagauzia migrate to Russia.

Due to their concentration in the areas around the border between Moldova and Ukraine, modern Gagauz people marry primarily with other Gagauz; thus keeping a high degree of ethnic stability. However, in the recent past, the situation was somewhat different. In the early 20th century, the ratio of Gagauz and Bulgarians in the population of Comrat was approximately 2:1. In the late 20th century, due to assimilation and higher fertility rates within the Gagauz, the ratio was 1:14. Nowadays, similar ratios between Gagauz and Bulgarians are preserved in some villages. For practical reasons, a contemporary Gagauz usually speaks at least two languages. In their daily life they use Gagauz and Russian, but many can speak Romanian as well.

==History==

===Origins===
The origin of the Gagauz is obscure. In the beginning of the 20th century, a Bulgarian historian counted 19 different theories about their origin. A few decades later the Gagauz ethnologist M. N. Guboglo increased the number to 21. In some of those theories the Gagauz people are presented as descendants of the Pechenegs, the Cumans-Kipchaks or a clan of Seljuk Turks or a mix of all. Others doubt altogether that the Gagauz are of Turkic origin at all and claimed that they are of Turkified Bulgarian or Greek origin. The fact that their religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity may suggest that their ancestors already lived in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest in the late 14th century.

====Seljuk (Anatolian) hypothesis====
According to the 15th-century &quot;Selçukname&quot; narrative, in 1261 Turkoman dervish Sarı Saltık accompanied a group of Turkomans into Dobruja, where they were settled by the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to protect the northern frontier of the empire. However, Dobruja was occupied by Tatars in the same period. The same source places him in Crimea after 1265, among the Turkomans transferred there by Berke, khaghan of the Golden Horde, and after 1280 mentions him leading the nomads back to Dobruja. After the death of Sarı Saltık, part of the Turkomans returned to Anatolia and became the ancestors of the Karamanlides, while others remained and became Christians. According to A.F. Bajora, this event was a myth brought into Dobruja by the Tatars and not a true historical event. The Seljuk theory has been criticized because archaeologically no &quot;secular and compact&quot; presence of Seljuks has been confirmed. It is also hard to believe that Seljuk Muslims converted to Christianity when their fellow Muslim Tatars lived in the North.

====Steppe hypothesis====
The Steppe hypothesis suggests that the Gagauz may be descendants of other Turkic nomadic tribes than Seljuks: Bulgars and Cumans-Kipchaks from the Eurasian steppes. In the 19th century, before their migration to Bessarabia, the Gagauz from the Bulgarian territories of the Ottoman Empire considered themselves Bulgarians. Ethnological research suggests &quot;Gagauz&quot; was a linguistic distinction and not ethnic. The Gagauz at that time called themselves &quot;Hasli Bulgar&quot; (True Bulgarians) or &quot;Eski Bulgar&quot; (Old Bulgarians) and considered the term Gagauz to be demeaning when applied to them by the Slavic-speaking Bulgarians.

The Gagauz called their language &quot;Turkish&quot; and claimed descent from then-Turkic-speaking Bulgars who in the 7th century established the First Bulgarian Empire on the Danube. Indeed, one modern Gagauz surname is &quot;Qipcakli&quot;. The Russian Empire Census of 1897 did not distinguish the Gagauz as a specific group, but it reported the existence of 55,790 native speakers of a &quot;Turkish language&quot; (presumably the Gagauz language) in the Bessarabia Governorate. According to historian A.F. Bajora, although this theory has many convincing arguments, the main counter-argument to this theory is that the Cuman language and the Gagauz language were languages belonging to different branches of Turkic.

====Greek hypothesis====
According to a version of this hypothesis, the Gagauz immigrated to the Balkans from Anatolia and, while they kept their Greek Orthodox religion, they were linguistically assimilated (Turkified). According to another version, the Ottomans found a native Greek population in Dobruja in the 14th century and, due to their population being lower than the number of Turkish settlers, this Greek population, too, kept their Greek Orthodox religion but got linguistically assimilated (Turkified). In this vein of linguistic assimilation, the Gagauz have been compared to the Karamanlides.

An argument that favors the Greek hypothesis is given by genetic research, which shows that the Gagauz are genetically European. Additionally, during the Greek War of Independence the Gagauz in Bessarabia and Bulgaria enlisted in the armies of Alexander Ypsilantis and fought for the Greek side in the war. The Greek hypothesis was favored most notably by Konstantin Jireček, among others.

====Bulgarian hypothesis====
Bulgarian sources argue that the Gagauz are Turkified Bulgarians because most of the Gagauz people in Bulgaria consider themselves natives (&quot;Erli&quot;). According to this theory, the Gagauz are either direct descendants of the Medieval Bulgars, or of Slavic origin, being no different than the rest of the Bulgarians, before the Turkic language spread among them. According to A.F. Bajora this theory has many strong arguments, but states that the fact that Ottomans did not force their subjects to accept their language and only compelled them to convert to Islam, and that not all Gagauz in Bulgaria consider themselves Bulgarians, are strong counter-arguments.

===Modern history===
Between 1820 and 1846, the Russian Empire allocated land to the Gagauz and gave them financial incentives to settle in Bessarabia in the settlements vacated by the Nogai tribes. They settled in Bessarabia along with Bassarabian Bulgarians, mainly in Avdarma, Comrat (or &quot;Komrat&quot;), Congaz (&quot;Kongaz&quot;), Tomai, Cișmichioi and other former Nogai villages located in the central Budjak region. Originally, the Gagauz also settled in several villages belonging to boyars throughout southern Bessarabia and the Principality of Moldavia, but soon moved to join their kin in the Bugeac. Until 1869, the Gagauz in Bessarabia were described as Bulgarians. During the Romanian rule of southernmost Bessarabia (1856–1878), they supported Bulgarian schools in their settlements and participated in the Bulgarian national movement. Therefore, some ethnologists (Karel Škorpil, Gavril Zanetov (himself a Gagauz), Benyo Tsonev) claim Bulgarian origin for the Gagauz.

In the 1860s, some Gagauz resettled to the vicinity of Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov coast, and in 1908–1914 to Central Asia.

With the exception of a six-day independence in the winter of 1906, when a peasant uprising declared the autonomous Comrat Republic, the Gagauz people have mainly been ruled by the Russian Empire, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Moldova.

The wave of Stolypin agrarian policies carried some Gagauz to Kazakhstan between 1912 and 1914, and later yet another group settled in Uzbekistan during the very troubled years of initial collectivization. So as not to lose their civil rights, they called themselves Bulgarians in the 1930s; the Gagauz of the village of Mayslerge in the Tashkent District retain that designation to this day.

In 1970 the total population of the Gagauz reached 156,600 in the USSR (26,400 of them lived in the Ukrainian SSR and 125,000 in the Moldavian SSR). In 1979, about 173,000 Gagauz lived in the USSR.

Gagauz nationalism remained an intellectual movement during the 1980s but strengthened by the end of the decade as both elites and opposition groups in the Soviet Union began to embrace nationalist ideals. In 1988, activists from the local intelligentsia aligned with other ethnic minorities to create the movement known as the &quot;Gagauz People&quot; (Gagauz: &quot;Gagauz halkı&quot;). A year later, the &quot;Gagauz People&quot; held its first assembly which accepted the resolution to create an autonomous territory in the southern Moldavian SSR, with Comrat designated as capital. The Gagauz nationalist movement increased in popularity when Moldovan was accepted as the official language of the Republic of Moldova in August 1989. In November 1989, the Gagauz ASSR within Moldova was declared.

===Gagauz nationalism in independent Moldova ===
In August 1990, Comrat declared itself as the Gagauz Republic, an autonomous Soviet republic separate from the Moldavian SSR, but the Moldovan government annulled the declaration as unconstitutional. The Gagauz were also worried about the implications for them if Moldova reunited with Romania, as seemed increasingly likely. Support for the Soviet Union remained high, with a local referendum in March 1991 yielding an almost unanimous &quot;yes&quot; vote to stay in the USSR; Moldovans in Gagauzia, however, boycotted the referendum. Many Gagauz supported the Moscow coup attempt, further straining relations with Chişinău. However, when the Moldovan parliament voted on whether Moldova should become independent, six of the twelve Gagauz deputies voted in favor. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gagauzia became a &quot;de facto&quot; independent state.

In February 1994, President Mircea Snegur, opposed to Gagauz independence, promised a Gagauz autonomous region. Snegur also opposed the suggestion that Moldova become a federal state made up of three &quot;republics&quot;: Moldova, Gagauzia, and Transnistria. In 1994, the Moldovan parliament awarded &quot;the people of Gagauzia&quot; the right of &quot;external self-determination&quot; should the status of the country change. This means that in the event that Moldova decided to join another country (by all accounts this referred to Romania), the Gagauz would be entitled to decide whether to remain or not a part of the new state by means of a self-determination referendum.

As a result of a referendum to determine Gagauzia&#x27;s borders, thirty settlements (three towns and twenty-seven villages) expressed their desire to be included in the Gagauz Autonomous Territorial Unit. In 1995, Gheorghe Tabunșcic was elected to serve as the Governor (&quot;Bashkan&quot;) of Gagauzia for a four-year term, as were the deputies of the local parliament, &quot;The People&#x27;s Assembly&quot; (&quot;Halk Topluşu&quot;) and its chairman Petru Pașalî.

==Genetic studies==
In DNA comparisons, the Gagauz were found to be more closely related genetically to neighboring southeastern European groups than to linguistically related Anatolian populations. More considerable distinctions in the distribution of Y chromosome components appeared between the Gagauz and other Turkic peoples.

The similarity to neighboring populations may be due to the lack of social barriers between the local and the Turkic-Orthodox populations of the Balkan Peninsula. Another possibility is language shift in accordance with the dominant minority model, i.e. Turkification.

Gagauz belong to Y-DNA haplogroups I2a (23.6%), R1a (19.1%), G (13.5%), R1b (12.4%), E1b1b1a1 (11.1%), J2 (5.6%) and Haplogroup N (2.2%). Finally, the phylogenetic analysis of Y-DNA situates Gagauz most proximal to Bulgarians, Macedonians, Romanians, Serbs and other Balkan populations, resulting in a high genetic distance from the Turkish people and other Turkic peoples. The analyses showed that Gagauz belong to the Balkan populations, suggesting that the Gagauz language represents a case of language replacement in southeastern Europe. According to a more detailed autosomal analysis of thousands of SNPs, not just of the sex chromosome, Gagauz are most proximal to ethnic Macedonians, followed by Greek Macedonians apart from Thessaloniki, and others such as Bulgarians, Romanians and Montenegrins.

After a genetic comparison between the populations of the Balkans, Anatolia, and Central Asia, the results showed that the Gagauz are part of the Balkan genetic group.

==Language==
The Gagauz language belongs to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages, which also includes the Azerbaijani, Turkish, and Turkmen languages. The Gagauz language is particularly close to the Balkan Turkish dialects spoken in Greece, northeastern Bulgaria, and in the Kumanovo and Bitola areas of North Macedonia. The Balkan Turkic languages, including Gagauz, are a typologically interesting case, because they are closely related to Turkish and at the same time contain a North-Turkic (Tatar or Kypchak) element besides the main South-Turkic (Oghuz) element (Pokrovskaya, 1964). The modern Gagauz language has two dialects: central (or &quot;Bulgar&quot;) and southern (or maritime).

==Culture==

===Music===
In 2013, Ludmila Tukan was selected to represent Gagauzia in the territory&#x27;s debut at the Turkvision Song Contest, with the song Вернись любовь (&quot;Come back love&quot;).

===Economy===
The traditional economy centered on animal husbandry (particularly sheep raising) and agriculture that combined grain and market gardening with viticulture. Even in the recent past, despite the cultural similarity of the Gagauz to the Bulgarians of Bessarabia, there were important differences between them: the Bulgarians were peasant farmers; although the Gagauz also farmed, they were essentially pastoralist in outlook.

===Religion===
The vast majority of Gagauz are Eastern Orthodox Christians. In Turkey the Muslim Gagauz are called Gajal.

There have been a number of attempts from the 1930s into the 21st century to tie the Turkish Orthodox Patriarchate with the ethnically Turkic, Greek Orthodox Gagauz minority in Bessarabia.

===Marriages===
For Gagauz, Moldova was characterized by the predominance of mono-ethnic marriages: out of 100 marriages prisonered in 1970, mono-ethnic were 73, and out of 100 marriages concluded in 2003 were 77. In 2003, Gagauz men of Moldova married with women of their ethnicity (78%), less often with Moldavians (9%), Russians (4%) and Ukrainians (3%). For Gagauz women of Moldova in 2003, these indicators amounted to respectively: 75%, 8%, 5%, 4% and 5%. For Gagauz, Chisinau is characteristic, on the contrary, mainly national-mixed marriages, which in 2000 accounted for 97% of all marriages of the Gagauz of both sexes. For 2018, the number of mono ethnic marriages decreased.

===Names===
The Gagauz name consists of a personal name, patronymic and surname. The most recognizable form of a name usually consists of a given name and a surname. Such a system was established among the Gagauz in the second half of the 20th century. Modern personal Gagauz names belong to different eras. A large part of them is of Greek origin (Лія - Lia, Анатолій - Anatoly, Александр - Alexander, Ірина - Irina, Варвара - Varvara), of Hebrew origin (&quot;Марія&quot; - &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Семен&quot; - &quot;Semyon&quot;, &quot;Анна&quot; - &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Іванна&quot; - &quot;Ivanna&quot;, etc.), of Romance origin (&quot;Домна&quot; - &quot;Domna&quot;, &quot;Константин&quot; - &quot;Constantine&quot;). Sometimes they can also be of Slavic origin (&quot;Віра&quot; - &quot;Vira&quot;, &quot;Володимир&quot; - &quot;Vladimir&quot;) and of Bulgarian origin (&quot;Марин&quot; - &quot;Marin&quot;). Recently, the Gagauz have been increasingly borrowing foreign names.

The name of the child is given in two ways:
* named after grandparents
* by the name of godparents

Gagauz surnames are of Balkan origin. Mostly they are from the Gagauz, Bulgarian, Greek languages. In addition, surnames come from professions, street nicknames, and the father&#x27;s name. When concluding a civil marriage, women take the surname of their spouse.

===Food===

The staple food of Gagauz cuisine is grain, in many varieties. A series of family holidays and rituals was connected with the baking of wheat bread, both leavened loaves (e.g., &quot;kalaches&quot;) and unleavened flatcakes.

The favorite dish was a layered pie stuffed with sheep&#x27;s milk cheese and soaked with sour cream before baking. Other delicacies were pies with crumbled pumpkin and sweet pies made with the first milk of a cow that had just calved. The traditional ritual dish called &quot;kurban&quot; combined bulgar wheat porridge with a slaughtered (or sacrificed) ram and is further evidence of the origins of the Gagauz in both the Balkan world and the steppe-pastoral complex. Peppered meat sauces are especially important: one combines onion and finely granulated porridge, while another is tomato-based. A red house wine is served with dinner and supper. Head cheese is an indispensable component of holiday meals.

===Clothing===

====Women&#x27;s====
Toward the end of the 19th century, in good weather, a Gagauz woman&#x27;s costume consisted of a canvas shirt, a sleeveless dress, a smock, and a large black kerchief. In winter, they donned a dress with sleeves, a cloth jacket, and a sleeveless fur coat. Required features of female dress were earrings, bracelets, beads, and, among wealthy Gagauz, a necklace of gold coins. &quot;So many of their decorations are hung about,&quot; wrote a pre-Revolutionary researcher, &quot;that they cover the entire breast down to the waist.&quot;

====Men&#x27;s====
Traditional male clothing included a shirt, cloth pants, a wide red sash or belt, and a hat. The winter cap was made of Karakul sheep wool. The shepherd&#x27;s costume was the usual shirt combined with sheepskin pants with the fleece turned in, a sleeveless fur coat, and a short sheepskin jacket, the latter sometimes decorated with red-on-green stitching.

==Ukrainian Gagauz==

Since 1991, the Gagauz nation became a trans-border nation located in Budjak and divided between Moldova and Ukraine. In Ukraine, they form a minority and mainly live near the Bessarabian Bulgarians community around the city of Bolhrad. In the 2001 Ukrainian census, the Gagauz population accounted for 31,923 people, with 27,617 (86.51%) of them living in the Budjak area of the Bessarabian region of Odesa Oblast, primarily in and around the cities of Izmail, Reni, and Kiliya, as well as the Bolhrad Raion (district).

In the Odesa region, the Gagauz make up 1.1% of the region&#x27;s population. The number of Gagauz in the period between the 1989 and 2001 censuses increased by 0.9%, and the share of residents of the region - by 0.1%. A notable Ukrainian Gagauz was Mykola Palas (born 1980), who served as a colonel during the Russo-Ukrainian War and is a recipient of the Hero of Ukraine award.

===Distribution===
Regions of Ukraine by the number of Gagauz in 2001:

Gagauz live in the south and southwest of Odesa region in Bolhrad (18.7%), Reni (7.9%), Bessarabske (6.0%), Kiliia (3.8%), and Artsyz (1.8%) areas. The number of Gagauz increased in Ivanivka (+100.0%), Ovidiopol (+100.0%), Bolhrad (+0.7%) districts and the city of Izmail (+14.3%), slightly decreased in Kiliia (−14.8%), Artsyz (−10.0%), Bessarabske (−6.9%), and Reni (−5.9%) districts.

The Gagauz also traditionally lived in the south of the Zaporizhzhia region, where they moved from Budzhak with Bulgarians and Albanians after the Crimean War. There the Gagauz population was present in the villages of Dmytrivka, Oleksandrivka, Kotlovyna, Vynohradivka, and Stari Troyany.

===Language===
The majority of Gagauz (71%) consider Gagauz their mother tongue, a significant proportion (23%) consider Russian their mother tongue.

<doc id="461913" wikidata="Q295713" url="?curid=461913" title="Liaquat Ali Khan">
<text>Liaquat Ali Khan (1 October 189516 October 1951) was a Pakistani lawyer, politician and statesman who served as the first prime minister of Pakistan from 1947 until his assassination in 1951. He was as pivotal to the consolidation of Pakistan as the Quaid-i-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was central to the creation of Pakistan. He was one of the leading figures of the Pakistan Movement and is revered as Quaid-e-Millat (&quot;Leader of the nation&quot;) and later on as &quot;Shaheed e Millat&quot; (Martyr of the nation).

Khan was born in Karnal, Punjab Province to a wealthy family. His grandfather Nawab Ahmad Ali provided significant support to the British during the Mutiny uprising of 1857-1858, earning him substantial rewards in the form of prestigious honors and complete remission of rent. Khan was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University and University of Oxford. After first being invited to the Indian National Congress, he later opted to join the All-India Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, an Indian independence activist who later advocated for a separate Muslim nation-state out of Hindu-majority India. Khan assisted Jinnah in the campaign for what would become known as the Pakistan Movement and was known as his &#x27;right hand&#x27;. He was a democratic political theorist who promoted parliamentarism in British India.

Khan&#x27;s premiership oversaw the beginning of the Cold War, in which Khan&#x27;s foreign policy sided with the United States-led Western Bloc over the Soviet Union-led Eastern Bloc. He promulgated the Objectives Resolution in 1949, which stipulated Pakistan to be an Islamic democracy. He also held cabinet portfolio as the first foreign minister, defence minister, and frontier regions minister from 1947 until his assassination in 1951. Prior to the part, Khan briefly tenured as Finance minister of British India in the Interim Government that undertook independence of Pakistan and India, led by Louis Mountbatten, the then-Viceroy of India.

In March 1951, he survived an attempted coup by left-wing political opponents and segments of the Pakistani military. While delivering a speech in the Company Bagh of Rawalpindi, Khan was shot dead by an Afghan militant Said Akbar for unknown reasons. Khan was posthumously given the title &quot;Shaheed-e-Milat&quot; (&#x27;Martyr of the Nation&#x27;) and is honored as one of Pakistan&#x27;s greatest prime ministers.

==Early life==
Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan was born on 1 October 1895 into a wealthy family in the Karnal, Punjab Province with roots in Talera village of Jansath Tehsil in Muzaffarnagar District of present day-Uttar Pradesh. He was the second of four sons of the wealthy land owner Rukn-ud-Daulah Shamsher Jung Nawab Bahadur Rustam Ali Khan of Karnal and his wife, Mahmoodah Begum, the daughter of Nawab Quaher Ali Khan of Rajpur in Saharanpur&#x27;s He received his early education at home before attending school in Karnal.

Despite being &quot;courteous, affable and socially popular&quot; and coming from an aristocratic family known for its philanthropy, his biographer Muhammad Reza Kazimi notes that little is known of his early life and that which has to be pieced together from snippets of mostly hagiographic writings. The family claimed a Persian origin going back to Nausherwan the Just, the Saasanid king of Persia, although this may be no more than legend, and they were settled in Uttar Pradesh by the time of his grandfather, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan. They had adopted the Urdu language.

According to his family, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan gained sufficient prestige that the British East India Company recognised him with titles such as &quot;Rukun-al-Daulah&quot;, &quot;Shamsher Jang&quot; and &quot;Nawab Bahadur&quot;, which they say were later inherited by his sons. The validity of those titles has been questioned because the family estates in Uttar Pradesh were diminished as a result of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, after which Uttar Pradesh itself ceased to be an autonomous area.

His family had deep respect for the Indian Muslim thinker and philosopher Syed Ahmad Khan, and his father had a desire for the young Liaqat Ali Khan to be educated in the British educational system; therefore, his family sent Ali Khan to the famous Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), where he obtained degrees in law and political science.

In 1913, Ali Khan attended the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College (now Aligarh Muslim University), graduating with a BSc degree in Political science and LLB in 1918, and married his cousin, Jehangira Begum, also in 1918, however the couple later separated. After the death of his father in 1919, Ali Khan, with British Government awarding the grants and scholarships, went to England, attending Oxford University&#x27;s Exeter College to pursue his higher education. In 1921, Ali Khan was awarded the Master of Law in Law and Justice, by the college faculty who also conferred on him a Bronze Medallion. While a graduate student at Oxford, Ali Khan actively participated in student unions and was elected Honorary Treasurer of the Majlis Society—a student union founded by Indian Muslim students to promote the Indian students&#x27; rights at the university. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple of London in 1922 but never practised.

==Political activism in British India==

Ali Khan returned to his homeland India in 1923, entering in national politics, determining to eradicate to what he saw as the injustice and ill-treatment of Indian Muslims under the British Indian Government and the British Government. His political philosophy strongly emphasised a united India, first gradually believing in the Indian nationalism. The Congress leadership approached to Ali Khan to become a part of the party, but after attending the meeting with Jawaharlal Nehru, Ali Khan&#x27;s political views and ambitions gradually changed. Therefore, Ali Khan refused, informing the Congress Party about his decision, and instead joining the Muslim League in 1923, led under another lawyer Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Soon Jinnah called for an annual session meeting in May 1924, in Lahore, where the goals, boundaries, party programmes, vision, and revival of the League, was an initial party agenda and was carefully discussed at the Lahore caucus. At this meeting, Khan was among those who attended this conference, and recommending the new goals for the party.

===United Province legislation===

Ali Khan was elected to the provisional legislative council in the 1926 elections from the rural Muslim constituency of Muzaffarnagar. Ali Khan embarked his parliamentary career, representing the United Provinces at the Legislative Council in 1926. In 1932, he was unanimously elected Deputy President of UP Legislative Council.

During this time, Ali Khan intensified his support in Muslim dominated populations, often raising the problems and challenges faced by the Muslim communities in the United Province. Ali Khan joined hands with academician Sir Ziauddin Ahmed, taking to organise the Muslim students&#x27; communities into one student union, advocating for the provisional rights of the Muslim state. His strong advocacy for Muslims&#x27; rights had brought him into national prominence and significant respect was also gained from Hindu communities whom also he fought for at higher levels of the government. Ali Khan remained the elected member of the UP Legislative Council until 1940, when he was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly; he participated actively, and was the influential member in legislative affairs, where his recommendations would also be noted by other members.

In his parliamentary career, Ali Khan established his reputation as &quot;eloquent, principled and honest spokesman&quot; who would never compromise on his principles even in the face of severe odds. Ali Khan, on several occasions, used his influence and good offices for the resolution of communal tension.

===Allying with Muslim League===

Ali Khan rose to become one of the influential members of the Muslim League and was one of the central figures in the Muslim League delegation that attended the National Convention held at Calcutta. Earlier, the British Government had formed the &quot;Simon Commission&quot; to recommend the constitutional and territorial reforms to the British Government. The commission, compromising seven British Members of Parliament, headed under its Chairman Sir John Simon, met briefly with the Congress Party and Muslim League leaders. The commission had introduced the system of dyarchy to govern the provinces of British India, but these revisions met with harsh criticism and clamour by the Indian public. Motilal Nehru presented his Nehru Report to counter British charges. In December 1928, Ali Khan and Jinnah decided to discuss the Nehru Report. In 1930, Ali Khan and Jinnah attended the First Round Table Conference, but it ended in disaster, leading Jinnah to depart from British India to Great Britain. In 1932, Ali Khan married for a second time to Begum Ra&#x27;ana who was a prominent economist and academic who became an influential figure in the Pakistan movement.

Ali Khan firmed believed in the unity of Hindu-Muslim community and worked tirelessly for that cause. In his party presidential address delivered at the Provisional Muslim Education Conference at AMU in 1932, Ali Khan expressed the view that Muslims had &quot;distinct [c]ulture of their own and had the (every) right to persevere it&quot;. At this conference, Liaquat Ali Khan announced that:

Soon, he and his new wife departed to England but did not terminate his connections with the Muslim League. With Ali Khan departing, the Muslim League&#x27;s parliamentary wing disintegrated, with many Muslim members joining the either Democratic Party, originally organised by Ali Khan in 1930, and the Congress Party. At the deputation in England, Ali Khan made close study of organising the political parties, and would soon return to his country with Jinnah.

In 1930, Jinnah urged Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and his Viceroy Lord Irwin to convene a Round Table Conferences in London. In spite of what Jinnah was expecting, the conference was a complete failure, forcing Jinnah to retire from national politics and permanently settle in London and practise law before the Privy Council.

During this time, Liaquat Ali Khan and his wife joined Jinnah, with Ali Khan practising economic law and his wife joining the faculty of economics at the local college. Ali Khan and his wife spent most of their time convincing Jinnah to return to British India to unite the scattered Muslim League mass into one full force. Meanwhile, Choudhry Rahmat Ali coined the term &quot;Pakstan&quot; in his famous pamphlet &quot;Now or Never; Are We to Live or Perish Forever?&quot;.

==Pakistan movement==

When Jinnah along with his sister Fatima and daughter Dina decided to settle in London and had gone to England in 1930 and the Muslim India and the All India Muslim League became a divided house, Liaquat went to England along with his wife Ra’na Liaquat and met Jinnah along with his family in July 1933 at their Hampstead residence in London and convinced him to return to India to save the Muslims from further division. Jinnah returned to India in December 1934.10 and started to reorganise the Muslim League. In 1936, the annual session of the League met in Bombay (now Mumbai). In the open session on 12 April 1936, Jinnah moved a resolution proposing Khan as the Honorary General Secretary. The resolution was unanimously adopted and he held the office till the establishment of Pakistan in 1947. In 1940, Khan was made the deputy leader of the Muslim League Parliamentary party. Jinnah was not able to take active part in the proceedings of the Assembly on account of his heavy political work. It was Khan who stood in his place. During this period, Khan was also the Honorary General Secretary of the Muslim League, the deputy leader of their party, Convenor of the Action Committee of the Muslim League, Chairman of the Central Parliamentary Board and the managing director of the newspaper &quot;Dawn&quot;.
The Pakistan Resolution was adopted in 1940 at the Lahore session of the Muslim League. The same year elections were held for the central legislative assembly which were contested by Khan from the Barielly constituency. He was elected without contest. When the twenty-eighth session of the League met in Madras (now Chennai) on 12 April 1941, Jinnah told party members that the ultimate aim was to obtain Pakistan. In this session, Khan moved a resolution incorporating the objectives of the Pakistan Resolution in the aims and objectives of the Muslim League. The resolution was seconded and passed unanimously.

In 1945–46, mass elections were held in India and Khan won the Central Legislature election from the Meerut Constituency in the United Provinces. He was also elected Chairman of the League&#x27;s Central Parliamentary Board. The Muslim League won 87% of seats reserved for Muslims of British India. He assisted Jinnah in his negotiations with the members of the Cabinet Mission and the leaders of the Congress during the final phases of the Freedom Movement and it was decided that an interim government would be formed consisting of members of the Congress, the Muslim League and minority leaders. When the Government asked the Muslim League to send five nominees for representation in the interim government, Khan was asked to lead the League group in the cabinet. He was given the portfolio of finance. The other four men nominated by the League were Ibrahim Ismail Chundrigar, Ghazanfar Ali Khan, Abdur Rab Nishtar, and Jogendra Nath Mandal. By this point, the British government and the Indian National Congress had both accepted the idea of Pakistan and therefore, on 14 August 1947, Pakistan came into existence.

==Prime Minister of Pakistan (1947-51)==
===Ali Khan administration: Immigration and census===
After independence, Khan was appointed as the first Prime Minister of Pakistan by the founding fathers of Pakistan. The country was born during the initial beginning of the extensive competition between the two world superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union. Khan faced with mounted challenges and difficulties while trying to administer the country. Khan and the Muslim League faced dual competitions with socialists in West-Pakistan and, the communists in East Pakistan. The Muslim League found it difficult to compete with socialists in West Pakistan, and lost considerable support in favor of socialists led by Marxist leader Faiz Ahmad Faiz. In East Pakistan, the Muslim League&#x27;s political base was eliminated by both the newly-formed All-Pakistan Awami Leagueled by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy and the Communist Party of Pakistan led by Sajjad Zaheer.

On the internal front, Khan, faced with socialist nationalist challenges and different religious ideologies saw the country fall into more unrest. Problems with Soviet Union and Soviet bloc further escalated after Khan failed to make a visit to Soviet Union, despite his intentions. Khan envisioned a non-aligned foreign policy, however despite some initiatives, the country became more dependent on the United States and this ultimately influenced Khan&#x27;s policy towards the Western bloc.

His government faced serious challenges including the dispute over Kashmir with India, forcing Khan to approach his counterpart the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru. A settlement was reached to end the fighting, while Nehru also referred the issue to the United Nations. Ali Khan sent the recommendation to Jinnah to appoint Abdul Rashid as the country&#x27;s first Chief Justice, and Justice Abdur Rahim as President of the Constitutional Assembly, both of them were also founding fathers of Pakistan. Some of the earliest reforms Khan took were to centralise the Muslim League, and he planned and prepared the Muslim League to become the leading authority of Pakistan.

The &quot;Daily Times&quot;, a leading English-language newspaper, held Liaquat Ali Khan responsible for mixing religion and politics, pointing out that &quot;Liaquat Ali Khan had no constituency in the country, his hometown was left behind in India. Bengalis were a majority in the newly created state of Pakistan and this was a painful reality for him&quot;. According to the &quot;Daily Times&quot;, Liaquat Ali Khan and his legal team restrained from writing down the constitution, the reason being simple: The Bengali demographic majority would have been granted political power and, Liaquat Ali Khan would have been sent out of the prime minister&#x27;s office. The Secularists also held him responsible for promoting the Right-wing political forces controlling the country in the name of Islam and further politicised the Islam, despite its true nature.

===Economic and education policy===

As Prime Minister Ali Khan took initiatives to develop educational infrastructure, science and technology in the country, with the intention of carrying the vision of successful development of science and technology to aid the essential foreign policy of Pakistan. In 1947, with Jinnah inviting physicist Rafi Muhammad Chaudhry to Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan called upon chemist Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, awarding him citizenship, and appointing him as his first government science adviser in 1950. During this same time, Khan also called physicist and mathematician Raziuddin Siddiqui, asking him to plan and establish educational research institutes in the country. Khan asked Ziauddin Ahmed to draft the national educational policy, which was submitted to his office in November 1947, and a road map to establishing education in the country was quickly adopted by Khan&#x27;s government.

Khan&#x27;s government authorised the establishment of the Sindh University. Under his government, science infrastructure was slowly built but he continued inviting Muslim scientists and engineers from India to Pakistan, believing it essential for Pakistan&#x27;s future progress.

In 1947, Khan and his Finance minister Malick Ghulam proposed the idea of Five-Year Plans, by putting the country&#x27;s economic system on investment and capitalism grounds. Focusing on an initial planned economic system under the directives of private sector and consortium industries in 1948, economic planning began to take place during his time in office, but soon collapsed partly because of unsystematic and inadequate staffing. Khan&#x27;s economic policies were soon heavily dependent on United States aid to the country. In spite of planning an independent economic policy, Khan&#x27;s economic policies focused on the United States&#x27; aid programme, on the other hand, Nehru focused on socialism and went on to be a part of Non Aligned Movement. An important event during his premiership was the establishment of a National Bank in November 1949, and the installation of a paper currency mill in Karachi. Unlike his Indian counterpart Jawaharlal Nehru, under Khan Pakistan&#x27;s economy was planned, but also an open free market economy.

=== Constitutional annex ===
During his early days in office, Khan first adopted the Government of India Act 1935 to administer the country, although his lawmakers and legislators continued to work on a different document of governance. Finally in 1949 after Jinnah&#x27;s death, Prime Minister Khan intensified his vision to establish an Islamic-based system in the country, presenting the Objectives Resolution—a prelude to future constitutions, in the Constituent Assembly. The house passed it on 12 March 1949, but it was met with criticism from his Law Minister Jogendra Nath Mandal who argued against it. Severe criticism were also raised by MP Ayaz Amir On the other hand, Liquat Ali Khan described as this bill as the &quot;Magna Carta&quot; of Pakistan&#x27;s constitutional history. Khan called it &quot;the most important occasion in the life of this country, next in importance, only to the achievement of independence&quot;. Under his leadership, a team of legislators also drafted the first report of the Basic Principle Committee and work began on the second report.

===War with India===

At a meeting of the Partition Council, Liaquat Ali Khan had rejected an offer from Vallabhbhai Patel regarding Kashmir and Hyderabad State. Patel had offered Kashmir to Pakistan in exchange for Pakistan relinquishing its claim to Hyderabad. Ali rejected this offer, preferring to keep Hyderabad, ignoring that the distance between the two would prevent Hyderabad&#x27;s accession to Pakistan in any case. Pakistani statesman Shaukat Hayat Khan resigned in protest of this folly; Hyderabad went to India anyway; and the two nations went to war over Kashmir.

Soon after appointing a new government, Pakistan entered a war with India over Kashmir. The British commander of the Pakistan Army General Sir Frank Walter Messervy refused to attack the Indian army units. When General Douglas Gracey was appointed the commander in chief of the Pakistan Army, Liaquat Ali Khan ordered the independent units of the Pakistan Army to intervene in the conflict. On the Kashmir issue, Khan and Jinnah&#x27;s policy reflected &quot;Pakistan&#x27;s alliance with U.S and United Kingdom&quot; against &quot;Indian imperialism&quot; and &quot;Soviet expansion&quot;. However, it is revealed by historians that differences and disagreement with Jinnah arose over the Kashmir issue. Jinnah&#x27;s strategy to liberate Kashmir was to use military force. Thus, Jinnah&#x27;s strategy was to &quot;kill two birds with one stone&quot;, namely decapitate India by controlling Kashmir, and to find a domestic solution through foreign and military intervention.

On Khan&#x27;s personal accounts and views, the prime minister preferred a &quot;harder diplomatic&quot; and &quot;less military stance&quot;. The prime minister sought a dialogue with his counterpart, and agreed to resolve the dispute of Kashmir in a peaceful manner through the efforts of the United Nations. According to this agreement a ceasefire was effected in Kashmir on 1 January 1949. It was decided that a free and impartial plebiscite would be held under the supervision of the UN. The prime minister&#x27;s diplomatic stance was met with hostility by the Pakistan Armed Forces and the socialists and communists, notably the mid-higher level command who would later sponsor an alleged coup led by the communists and socialists against his government.

===Soviet Union and United States===

In 1949, the Soviet Union&#x27;s leader, Joseph Stalin, sent an invitation to Ali Khan to visit the country, followed by a U.S. invitation after they learned of the Soviet move. In May 1950, Khan paid a state visit to the United States after being persuaded to snap ties with the Soviet Union, and set the course of Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy toward closer ties with the West, despite it being the Soviet Union who sent its invitation of Khan to visit the country first. The visit further cemented strong ties between the two countries and brought them closer. According to many sources, Khan&#x27;s formulated policies were focused on Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, and his trip to U.S. in 1950, Khan had made clear that Pakistan&#x27;s foreign policy was neutrality. Being a newly born nation with trouble in planning the economy, Khan asked the U.S. for economic and moral support to enable it to stand on its feet. The United States gladly accepted the offer and continued its aid throughout the years. But ties deteriorated after the United States asked Khan to send two combat divisions to support U.S. military operations in the Korean War. Khan wanted to send the divisions, but asked the U.S. for assurances on Kashmir and the Pashtunisation issue, which the U.S. declined to give. Khan decided not to send the divisions, a clear indication that Pakistan was working towards the Non-Aligned Movement. The United States began work on a policy to keep Pakistan impartial, and India on the other hand, remained a keystone to bringing stability in South Asia. By June and July 1951, Pakistan&#x27;s relations with U.S. deteriorated further, with Nehru visiting the United States, pressuring Pakistan to recall her troops from Kashmir.

Khan began to develop tighter relations with the Soviet Union, China, Poland, and Iran under its Premier Mohammed Mossadegh as well. Khan sent invitations to Stalin and the Polish Communist leader Władysław Gomułka to visit the country. However, the visits never happened after Khan was assassinated and Stalin died. In 1948, Pakistan established relations with the Soviet Union, and an agreement was announced a month later. The offing of U.S. trade had frustrated Khan, therefore, Khan sent career Foreign service officer Jamsheed Marker as Pakistan Ambassador to the Soviet Union, a few months later, a Soviet Ambassador arrived in Pakistan, with her large staff and accompanied military attaches. In 1950, Ali Khan established relations with China by sending his ambassador, making Pakistan to become first Muslim country to establish relations with China, a move which further dismayed the United States. While in Iran, Liaquat Ali Khan talked to the Soviet Ambassador and Moscow promptly extended an invitation to him to visit the Soviet Union.

===Struggle for control===

Ali Khan&#x27;s ability to run the country was put in doubt and great questions were raised by the communists and socialists active in the country. In 1947–48 period, Ali Khan-Jinnah relations was contentious, and the senior military leadership and Jinnah himself became critical of Khan&#x27;s government. In his last months, Jinnah came to believe that his Prime Minister Khan was a weak prime minister—highly ambitious—and not loyal to Jinnah and his vision in his dying days.

The death of Jinnah was announced in 1948, as a new cabinet was also re-established. Ali Khan faced the problem of religious minorities during late 1949 and early 1950, and observers feared that India and Pakistan were about to fight their second war in the first three years of their independence. At this time, Ali Khan met Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to sign the Liaquat-Nehru Pact in 1950. The pact was an effort to improve relations and reduce tension between India and Pakistan, and to protect the religious minorities on both sides of the border.

Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan did not take over the office of Governor-General, instead appointing Khawaja Nazimuddin, a Bengali statesman from East-Pakistan. When Jinnah died, he had held three major positions: Governor-General; President of Muslim League; and the Constituent Assembly of which he served both its president and legal adviser. Although Ali Khan was a legislator and lawyer, he lacked Jinnah&#x27;s political stature.

Differences and problems also leveled up with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and a local and native section of Pakistan Army was completely hostile towards Ali Khan&#x27;s diplomatic approach with India. The existence of high level opposition was revealed in the Rawalpindi conspiracy, sponsored by Chief of General Staff Major-General Akbar Khan, and headed by communist leader Faiz Ahmad Faiz. Another difference came when Khan also intensified policies to make the country a parliamentary democracy and federal republic. During his tenure, Khan supervised the promulgation of the &quot;October Objectives&quot; in 1949 which passed by the Constituent Assembly. The document was aimed as an Islamic, democratic and federal constitution and government. Disagreement existed about the approach and methods to realise these aims.

The third major difference was itself in the Muslim League; the party had weak political structure with no public base ground or support. Its activities reveled in high factionalism, low commitment to resolve public problems, corruption and incompetency of planning social and economics programmes. In East Pakistan, Ali Khan&#x27;s lack of attention for the development of the Bengali section of the state brought about a bad juncture for the prime minister and his party, where its ideology was vague. In terms of its political base, it was both weak and narrow, and could not compete in West-Pakistan as well as in East-Pakistan where traditional families were endowed with enormous political power. In West Pakistan, the Muslim League failed to compete against the socialists, and in East Pakistan the communists.

===1951 military scandal===

Ali Khan&#x27;s relation with General Sir Douglas Gracey deteriorated, prompting General Gracey to retire soon after the conflict. In January 1951, Ali Khan approved the appointment of General Ayub Khan to succeed Gracey as the first native Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army.

During this time the socialists gained a significant amount of support. Senior military leaders and prominent socialists plotted to overthrow the government of Ali Khan. Those involved reportedly included Chief of General Staff Major General Akbar Khan and Marxist-socialist politician Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the leaders of the coup plot. The Military Police arrested many in the military services; more than 14 officers were charged for plotting the coup. The Rawalpindi Conspiracy, as it became known, was the first attempted coup in Pakistan&#x27;s history. The arrested conspirators were tried in secret and given lengthy jail sentences.

==Assassination==

On 16 October 1951, Khan was shot twice in the chest while he was addressing a gathering of 100,000 at Company Bagh (Company Gardens), Rawalpindi. The police immediately shot the presumed murderer who was later identified as professional assassin Said Akbar. Khan was rushed to a hospital and given a blood transfusion, but he succumbed to his injuries. 
Said Akbar Babrak was an Afghan national from the Pashtun Zadran tribe. He was known to Pakistani police prior to the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan. The exact motive behind the assassination has never been fully revealed and much speculation surrounds it. An Urdu daily published in Bhopal, India, saw a US hand behind the assassination.

Upon his death, Khan was given the honorific title of &quot;Shaheed-e-Millat&quot;, or &quot;Martyr of the Nation&quot;. He is buried at Mazar-e-Quaid, the mausoleum built for Jinnah in Karachi. The Municipal Park, where he was assassinated, was renamed Liaquat Bagh (&quot;Bagh&quot; means Garden) in his honor. It is the same location where ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in 2007.

==Legacy==
He is Pakistan&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister spending 1,524 days in power. His legacy was built up as a man who was the &quot;martyr for democracy&quot; in the newly founded country. Many in Pakistan saw him as a man who sacrificed his life to preserve the parliamentary system of government. After his death, his wife remained an influential figure in the Pakistani foreign service, and was also the Governor of Sindh Province in the 1970s. Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s assassination remains an unsolved mystery, and all traces leading to the conspirator were removed. Popularly, he is known as Quaid-i-Millat (Leader of the Nation) and Shaheed-i-Millat (Martyr of the Nation), by his supporters. His assassination was a first political murder of any civilian leader in Pakistan, and Liaqat Ali Khan is remembered fondly by most Pakistanis. In an editorial written by &quot;Daily Jang&quot;, the media summed up that &quot;his name will remain shining forever on the horizon of Pakistan&quot;.

In Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan is regarded as Jinnah&#x27;s &quot;right hand man&quot; and heir apparent, as Jinnah once had said. His role in filling in the vacuum created by Jinnah&#x27;s death is seen as decisive in tackling critical problems during Pakistan&#x27;s fledgling years and in devising measures for the consolidation of Pakistan. After his death, the government of Pakistan released a commemorative stamp and his face is printed on postage stamps across the country.

Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s former personal residence is located at Jansath Tehsil of Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh about 80 km from his ancestral estate and is now being considered by the Uttar Pradesh government to be opened as a tourist destination. His family had strong ties with the British Government.

==Assessment of foreign policy==

Others argue that Khan had wanted Pakistan to remain neutral in the Cold War, as declared three days after Pakistan&#x27;s independence when he declared that Pakistan would take no sides in the conflict of ideologies between the nations. Former serviceman Shahid M. Amin has argued that the Soviets themselves could not settle convenient dates for a visit, and that, even during his visit to the United States, Liaquat had declared his intention to visit the Soviet Union. Amin also notes that &quot;Failure to visit a country in response to its invitations has hardly ever become the cause of long-term estrangement&quot;.

==Popular culture==
In Pakistan alone, many documentaries, stage and television dramas have been produced to enlighten Liaqat Ali Khan&#x27;s struggle. Internationally, Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s character was portrayed by Pakistan&#x27;s stage actor Yousuf &quot;Shakeel&quot; Kamal in the 1998 film &quot;Jinnah&quot;.

<text>The superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus) is a passerine bird in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae, and is common and familiar across south-eastern Australia. It is a sedentary and territorial species, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; the birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.

The superb fairywren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and Brisbane. The superb fairywren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds.

The superb fairywren was named &#x27;Australian Bird of the Year&#x27; for 2021, after a survey conducted by Birdlife Australia saw the species narrowly defeat the tawny frogmouth with a margin of 666 votes (over 400,000 votes were cast in total).

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The superb fairywren is one of eleven species of the genus &quot;Malurus&quot;, commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland New Guinea. Within the genus, the superb fairywren&#x27;s closest relative is the splendid fairywren; these two &quot;blue wrens&quot; are also related to the purple-crowned fairywren of northwestern Australia.

William Anderson, surgeon and naturalist on Captain James Cook&#x27;s third voyage, collected the first superb fairywren specimen in 1777 while traveling off the coast of eastern Tasmania, in Bruny Island&#x27;s Adventure Bay. He classified it in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot; because its tail reminded him of the European wagtails. Anderson did not live to publish his findings, although his assistant William Ellis described the bird in 1782. The genus &quot;Malurus&quot; was later described by Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816, giving the bird its current scientific name.

Shortly after the First Fleet&#x27;s arrival at Port Jackson, Sydney, the bird gained the common name superb warbler. In the 1920s came common names &quot;wren&quot; and &quot;wren-warbler&quot;—both from its similarity to the European wren—and &quot;fairywren&quot;. The bird has also been called Mormon wren, a reference to observations of one blue-plumaged bird accompanied by many brown-plumaged birds, which were incorrectly assumed to be all female. The Ngarrindjeri people of the Murray River and Coorong regions call it &quot;waatji pulyeri&quot;, meaning &quot;little one of the &quot;waatji&quot; (lignum) bush&quot;, and the Gunai call it &quot;deeydgun&quot;, meaning &quot;little bird with long tail&quot;. Both it and the variegated fairywren are known as &quot;muruduwin&quot; to the local Eora and Darug inhabitants of the Sydney basin. Other alternative names for the superb fairywren include the Australian fairywren, blue wren, superb blue fairywren, and superb blue wren.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is unrelated to the true wren. It was previously classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae and later as a member of the warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones and allies) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. To help resolve this a high-quality 1.07‐Gb reference genome was sequenced in 2019.

===Subspecies===
Six subspecies are currently recognized:

*&quot;M. c. cyaneus&quot; – (: The nominate subspecies, it is found throughout Tasmania. Birds are larger and darker than the mainland subspecies, with males having a deeper azure blue coloration. Some authorities have also reclassified subspecies &quot;elizabethae&quot; and &quot;samueli&quot; under &quot;M. c.&quot; &quot;cyaneus&quot;.
*&quot;M. c. samueli&quot; – : Endemic to Flinders Island and has males that are of intermediate colour between the King Island and Tasmanian subspecies.
*&quot;M. c. elizabethae&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species. Is endemic to King Island Males have a deeper blue colour than Tasmanian birds. King Island birds also have longer tarsi (lower legs).
*&quot;M. c. cyanochlamys&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species. Found on mainland Australia. In general, birds are smaller and paler than those of Tasmania, with Queensland male birds bearing a pale silvery blue crown, ear tufts and mantle.
*&quot;M. c. leggei&quot; – : Found in eastern South Australia. Males in breeding plumage differ from those of subspecies &quot;cyanochlamys&quot; by having blue tinges on their belly below the chest band and on their wing remiges.
*&quot;M. c. ashbyi&quot; – : Found on Kangaroo Island, and has been separated from the mainland subspecies for around 9000 years. Birds of this subspecies are larger, have narrower bills and darker plumage than birds on nearby mainland South Australia. Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds.

===Evolutionary history===
In his 1982 monograph, Schodde proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At some time in the past it was split into south-western (splendid) and south-eastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected with the rest of the continent via a land bridge. This gave rise to the subspecies &quot;cyaneus&quot; as it became isolated when the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.

==Description==
The superb fairywren is long and weighs , with males on average slightly larger than females. The average tail length is , among the shortest in the genus. Averaging in subspecies &quot;cyaneus&quot; and in subspecies &quot;cyanochlamys&quot;, the bill is relatively long, narrow and pointed and wider at the base. Wider than it is deep, the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs.

Like other fairywrens, the superb fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting with black and grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males&#x27; blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.

=== Vocalisations ===
Vocal communication among superb fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and mobbing, or defending a territory. The basic, or Type I, song is a 1–4 second high-pitched reel consisting of 10–20 short elements per second; it is sung by both males and females. Males also possess a peculiar song-like Type II vocalization, which is given in response to the calls of predatory birds, commonly grey butcherbirds. The purpose of this behaviour, which does not elicit a response from other nearby wrens, remains unknown. It is not a warning call, but in fact gives away the location of the vocalizing male to the predator. It may serve to announce male fitness, but this is far from certain. The superb fairywrens&#x27; alarm call is a series of brief sharp &quot;chit&quot;s, universally given and understood by small birds in response to predators. Females also emit a &quot;purr&quot; while incubating. The bird appears to also use vocalisations as a password for its chicks to give it a chance to avoid cuckoo parasites.

==Distribution and habitat==

The superb fairywren is common throughout most of the relatively wet and fertile south-eastern corner of the continent, from the south-east of South Australia (including Kangaroo Island and Adelaide) and the tip of the Eyre Peninsula, through all of Victoria, Tasmania, coastal and sub-coastal New South Wales and Queensland, through the Brisbane area and extending inland – north to the Dawson River and west to Blackall; it is a common bird in the suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. It is found in wooded areas, generally with plenty of undergrowth, and has also adapted to urban existence and can be found in gardens and urban parks as long as there is an undergrowth of native plants nearby. Lantana (&quot;Lantana camara&quot;), a prolific weed in Australia, has also been beneficial in providing shelter in disturbed areas, as has the introduced and invasive blackberry Unlike other fairywrens, it appears to benefit from the urban environment and has out-competed the introduced house sparrow in one study on the grounds of the Australian National University in Canberra. Colonies of wrens can be found in Hyde Park and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney&#x27;s urbanized centre. It is not found in dense forest nor in alpine environments. Forestry plantations of pine and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.

==Behaviour==

Like all fairywrens, the superb fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright, and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.

The superb fairywren is a cooperative breeding species, with pairs or groups of 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group consists of a social pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.

Major nest predators include Australian magpies, butcherbirds, laughing kookaburra, currawongs, crows and ravens, shrike-thrushes as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox, cat and black rat. Superb fairywrens may utilise a &#x27;rodent-run&#x27; display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners did not respond to miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species&#x27; vocalisations.

===Courtship===

Several courtship displays by superb fairywren males have been recorded. The &#x27;sea horse flight&#x27;, named for its seahorse-like undulations, is one such display. During this exaggerated flight, the male—with his neck extended and his head feathers erect—tilts his body from horizontal to vertical, and descends slowly and springs upwards by rapidly beating his wings after alighting on the ground. The &#x27;face fan&#x27; display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.

During the reproductive season, males of this and other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren&#x27;s own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though both males and females will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair&#x27;s female assisting.

===Breeding===

Breeding occurs from spring through to late summer; the nest is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side generally close to the ground, under , and in thick vegetation. Two or more broods may be laid in an extended breeding season. A clutch of three or four matte white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring . The eggs are incubated for 14 days, after which they hatch within 24 hours. Newborn chicks are blind, red and featherless, though quickly darken as feathers grow. Their eyes open by day five or six and are fully feathered by day 10. All group members feed and remove fecal sacs for 10–14 days. Fledglings are able to feed themselves by day 40 but remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods and repel cuckoos or predators. Superb fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite Horsfield&#x27;s bronze cuckoo and, less commonly, the shining bronze cuckoo and fan-tailed cuckoo.

===Diet===

Superb fairywrens are predominantly insectivorous. They eat a wide range of small creatures (mostly insects such as ants, grasshoppers, shield bugs, flies, weevils and various larvae) as well as small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. Their foraging, termed &#x27;hop-searching&#x27;, occurs on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres high. Because this foraging practice renders them vulnerable to predators, birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups. During winter, when food may be scarce, ants are an important &#x27;last resort&#x27; food, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Nestlings, in contrast to adult birds, are fed a diet of larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers.

==Cultural depictions==
The superb fairywren breeding male is used as an emblem by the Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia. On 12 August 1999, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated for an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope meant to depict a splendid fairywren. Called the blue wren as it was then known, it had previously featured on a 2s.5d. stamp, released in 1964, which was discontinued with the advent of decimal currency.

<text>Frank Forrester Church III (July 25, 1924 – April 7, 1984) was an American politician and lawyer. A Democrat, from 1957 to 1981 he served as a U.S. Senator from Idaho, and is currently the last Democrat to do so. He was the longest serving Democratic senator from the state and the only Democrat from the state who served more than two terms in the Senate. He was a prominent figure in American foreign policy and established a reputation as a member of the party&#x27;s liberal wing.

Born and raised in Boise, Idaho, he enrolled at Stanford University in 1942 but left to enlist in the Army, where he served as a military intelligence officer in the China Burma India Theater of World War II. Following the end of the war, he completed his law degree from Stanford Law School and returned to Boise to practice law. Church became an active Democrat in Idaho and ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the state legislature in 1952. In 1956, he was elected to the United States Senate, defeating former Senator Glen Taylor in a closely contested primary election and incumbent Herman Welker in the general election.

As a senator, he was a protégé of then-Senate majority leader Lyndon B. Johnson, and was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 1960, Church received national exposure when he gave the keynote speech at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Considered a strong progressive and environmental legislator, he played a major role in the creation of a system of protected wilderness areas. Church was highly critical of the Vietnam War, despite initially supporting it; he co-authored the Cooper–Church Amendment of 1970 and the Case–Church Amendment of 1973, which sought to curtail the war. In 1975, he chaired the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee, laying the groundwork for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.

Church belatedly sought the 1976 Democratic nomination for president, and announced his candidacy on March 18, 1976. Although he won primaries in Nebraska, Idaho, Oregon, and Montana, he withdrew in favor of former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. Church was re-elected continuously to the Senate, defeating his Republican opponents in 1962, 1968, and 1974, until his defeat during the Republican wave of 1980. Following the end of his term, he practiced international law in Washington, D.C., specializing in Asian issues. Church was hospitalized for a pancreatic tumor on January 12, 1984, and he died less than three months later at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on April 7, 1984.

== Early life ==

=== Youth, family, and early education ===

Frank Forrester Church III was born on July 25, 1924, in Boise, Idaho. He traced his ancestry from the East Coast of the United States, with his grandfather, Frank Forrester Church I, moving to Idaho during the height of the gold rush that followed the end of the Civil War. Church III was the younger of two sons of Frank Forrester Church II and Laura Bilderback Church. His older brother Richard Church became a career officer in the United States Marine Corps, and retired as a colonel. Another branch of the Church family included Rear Admiral Albert T. Church II, as well as Vice Admiral Albert T. Church III, the author of the Church Report.

His father co-owned a sporting goods store and took the sons on fishing, hunting, and hiking outings in the Idaho mountains. The family was reportedly very Catholic and conservative, with Church attending St. Joseph&#x27;s School as a youngster, where he went by the nickname &quot;Frosty.&quot; In his youth, Church admired William Borah, who represented Idaho in the United States Senate from 1907 until his death in 1940. When Borah died, Church walked by the open coffin in the rotunda of the State Capitol. He stated that &quot;Because he was a senator, I wanted to become one, too.&quot; Church graduated from Boise High School in 1942, where he served as student body president. As a junior in 1941, he won the American Legion National Oratorical Contest, which resulted in him receiving sufficient funds to provide for his four-year enrollment at Stanford University in California, where he joined the Theta Xi fraternity.

=== Military service and education ===

Church left Stanford in 1942, at the age of 18, and enlisted in the Army following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was called up the following year and attended officer candidate training at Fort Benning in Georgia. He trained at Camp Ritchie, as one of the Ritchie Boys, and was commissioned a lieutenant on his 20th birthday. In the army, he served as a military intelligence officer in the China Burma India Theater. He was inducted to the Infantry Hall of Fame at Fort Benning. Following the end of the war, he was discharged in 1946.

In June 1947 he married Bethine Clark, daughter of Chase Clark, a former Democratic governor of Idaho and the federal judge for the state. The wedding took place at the secluded Robinson Bar Ranch (), the Clark family&#x27;s ranch in the mountains east of Stanley (and now owned by singer Carole King, since 1981). The two had a happy marriage and often showed their affection in public. He entered Harvard Law School that fall and after one year, Church transferred to Stanford Law School, when he thought the cold Massachusetts winter was the cause of a pain in his lower back. The pain did not go away and the problem was soon diagnosed as testicular cancer. After one of his testicles and glands in his lower abdomen were removed, Church was given only a few months to live. However, he rebounded from the illness after another doctor started X-ray treatments. This second chance led him to later reflect that &quot;life itself is such a chancy proposition that the only way to live is by taking great chances.&quot; In 1950, Church graduated from Stanford Law School and returned to Boise to practice law and teach public speaking at Boise Junior College (now Boise State University).

Frank and Bethine Church had two sons, Frank Forrester Church IV, who died in 2009, and Chase Clark Church, who lives in Boise. Both boys were named for their grandfathers.

== Career ==

===1956 election ===

Following his return to Idaho, he became active in Democratic Party politics, and he became the chairman of the Young Democrats of Idaho. In 1952, he ran for a seat in the then-Republican dominated Idaho state legislature, but lost the election. In 1956, Church ran for the Class-3 Senate seat held by Herman Welker, who had alienated many Republicans for his opposition to President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s programs and his alleged affiliation with McCarthyism. Church entered the primary race, which was described as &quot;the most colorful primary in the history of the state&quot;. He faced a number of opponents, including Ricks College professor Claude Burtenshaw, bureaucrat Alvin McCormack, and former senator Glen H. Taylor.

When the primary came, Church won the Democratic nomination, with only 37.75% of the vote, narrowly edging out Taylor by 200 votes. Though Church won the nomination, Taylor refused to concede, and claimed a number of voting irregularities in the canvassing of the primary. During the general election campaign, Church and his campaign hit the road. Church shook around 75,000 hands over the entire course of the campaign. Church also conducted an astute campaign, by contrasting his fitness with that of Welker. His slogan, &quot;Idaho Will Be Proud of Frank Church&quot;, was a major asset to his campaign. Church also campaigned on an internationalist plank, in favor of a publicly owned Hells Canyon Dam and was conservative on money matters.

This was in stark contrast to Welker&#x27;s campaign, which focused heavily on anti-Communism, a decision that proved to be a weak political foundation. The Welker campaign also ran on his record, as well as the &quot;Herman letter&quot;, in which President Eisenhower endorsed Welker&#x27;s candidacy. Glen Taylor also ran in the general election as a write-in candidate, labeling Church as a candidate of the &quot;corporate interests&quot;. Church won the race, defeating both Welker and Taylor, with a plurality of 46,315 votes. This was despite a number of factors that might have inhibited Church&#x27;s campaign, including the Republican&#x27;s fundraising advantage and Eisenhower&#x27;s large victory in the presidential election.

===First term (1957–1963)===
Upon entering the Senate in January 1957, Church voted against a procedural motion on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 against the wishes of Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson. This angered Johnson, who punished Church by all but ignoring him for the next six months. However, Church managed to find his way into Johnson&#x27;s good graces by voting for an amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 that would grant the right to a trial by jury to anyone charged with violating the act. Church also added a provision to that amendment requiring that juries in such cases be desegregated. Johnson was so grateful he made the young Idahoan a veritable protégé, rewarding him with plum assignments, such as a seat on the prestigious Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position which allowed Church to follow in the footsteps of his idol, William Borah. Recently declassified documents show that the young veteran also challenged his mentor, behind closed doors, after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, making this prescient warning: &quot;In a democracy you cannot expect the people, whose sons are being killed and who will be killed, to exercise their judgment if the truth is concealed from them.&quot;

Church was reelected in 1962, defeating former state representative Jack Hawley. To date, he is the only Idaho Democrat to be popularly elected for more than one term in the Senate.

===Attempted recall and election of 1968===
In 1967, a recall campaign was waged against Church by Ron Rankin, a Republican county commissioner in the northern Idaho county Kootenai who co-founded the Victory in Vietnam Committee to coordinate the recall. Rankin unsuccessfully sued Idaho&#x27;s secretary of state to accept recall petitions. The U.S. District Court for Idaho ruled that the state&#x27;s recall laws did not apply to U.S. senators and that such a recall would violate the U.S. Constitution. State attorney general Allan Shepard, a future chief justice of the state supreme court, agreed with the court&#x27;s decision.

In the 1968 Senate election, Church won with over 60 percent of the vote against Republican challenger and U.S. Representative George V. Hansen, in contrast with the concurrent presidential election where Republican candidate Richard Nixon got nearly 57 percent of the popular vote in Idaho. James Risen attributes Church&#x27;s victory to the 1967 recall effort backfiring: &quot;Most Idaho voters were angered by the recall effort, and it generated sympathy for Church throughout the state.&quot;

===Third term (1969–1975): Vietnam War and Church Committee===

Church was a key figure in American foreign policy during the 1970s, and served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1979 to 1981. Following the instinct that led him to ask questions early on (see above), Church was one of the first senators to publicly oppose the Vietnam War in the 1960s, although he had supported the conflict earlier. He was the co-author of two legislative efforts to curtail the war: the Cooper–Church Amendment of 1970, and the Case–Church Amendment of 1973.

In September 1970, Church announced on television and in speeches across the country that &quot;the doves had won.&quot; Author David F. Schmitz states that Church based his assertion on the fact that two key propositions of the anti-war movement, &quot;A negotiated peace and the withdrawal of American troops,&quot; were now official policy. The only debate that remained would be over when to withdraw, not whether to withdraw, and over the meaning of the war. Church concluded:

Church argued that the opponents of the Vietnam War needed to prevent the corruption of the nation and its institutions. To Church, the anti-war opposition was the &quot;highest concept of patriotism—which is not the patriotism of conformity—but the patriotism of Senator Carl Schurz, a dissenter from an earlier period, who proclaimed: &#x27;Our country right or wrong. When right, to be kept right: when wrong, to be put right.&quot; 

Church gained national prominence during his service in the Senate through his chairmanship of the U.S. Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities from 1975 through 1976, more commonly known as the Church Committee, which conducted extensive hearings investigating extra-legal FBI and CIA intelligence-gathering and covert operations. The committee investigated CIA drug smuggling activities in the Golden Triangle and secret U.S.-backed wars in Third World countries.
Together with Senator Sam Ervin&#x27;s committee inquiries, the Church Committee hearings laid the groundwork for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.

Daniel Ellsberg quoted Church as speaking of the NSA as follows: &quot;I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.&quot; More specifically on August 17, 1975, Senator Frank Church stated on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; without mentioning the name of the NSA about this agency:

====NSA monitoring of Senator Church&#x27;s communications====
In a secret operation code-named &quot;Project Minaret,&quot; the National Security Agency (NSA) monitored the communications of leading Americans, including Senators Church and Howard Baker, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and others, including prominent U.S. journalists and athletes, who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by NSA of the NSA&#x27;s Minaret program concluded that Minaret was &quot;disreputable if not outright illegal.&quot;

===Environmental record and other issues===
Church is also remembered for his voting record as a strong progressive and environmental legislator, and he played a major role in the creation of the nation&#x27;s system of protected wilderness areas in the 1960s. In 1964, Church was the floor sponsor of the national Wilderness Act. In 1968, he sponsored the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and gained passage of a ten-year moratorium on federal plans to transfer water from the Pacific Northwest to California. Working with other members of Congress from northwestern states, Church helped establish the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area along the Oregon-Idaho border, which protected the gorge from dam building. He was also the primary proponent in the establishment of the Sawtooth Wilderness and National Recreation Area in central Idaho in 1972.

Church also was instrumental in the creation of Idaho&#x27;s River of No Return Wilderness in 1980, his final year in the Senate. This wilderness comprised the old Idaho Primitive Area, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive Area, plus additional lands. At 2.36 million acres (9,550 km2), over , it is the largest wilderness area in the nation outside of Alaska. It was renamed the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in 1984, shortly after the diagnosis of his pancreatic cancer. Idaho Senator Jim McClure introduced the measure in the Senate in late February, and
President Reagan signed the act on March 14, less than four weeks before Frank Church&#x27;s death on April 7.

Frank Church was considered a progressive (remarkable considering that he represented one of the most conservative states in the nation), though he was a strong opponent of gun control and was pro-life. In 1979, he was the first in Congress to disclose and protest the presence of Soviet combat troops in Cuba. According to the Christian Science Monitor, this stance somewhat disarmed his opponent&#x27;s charge in the 1980 campaign that Church&#x27;s performance on the Foreign Relations Committee had helped to weaken the US militarily.
In 1974, Church joined Senator Frank Moss, D-Utah, to sponsor the first legislation to provide federal funding for hospice care programs. The bill did not have widespread support and was not brought to a vote. Congress finally included a hospice benefit in Medicare in 1982.

In late 1975 and early 1976, a sub-committee of the U.S. Senate led by Church concluded that members of the Lockheed board had paid members of friendly governments to guarantee contracts for military aircraft in a series of illegal bribes and contributions made by Lockheed officials from the late 1950s to the 1970s. In 1976, it was publicly revealed that Lockheed had paid $22 million in bribes to foreign officials in the process of negotiating the sale of aircraft including the F-104 Starfighter, the so-called &quot;Deal of the Century.&quot;

Church also sponsored, along with Pennsylvania Republican John Heinz, the &quot;conscience clause,&quot; which prohibited the government from requiring church-affiliated hospitals to perform abortions.

===Late political career===
In 1976, Church belatedly sought the Democratic nomination for president and announced his candidacy on March 18 from rustic Idaho City, his father&#x27;s birthplace. Although he won primaries in Nebraska, Idaho, Oregon, and Montana, he withdrew in favor of the eventual nominee, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. Church remains the only Idahoan to win a major-party presidential primary election following the reforms of the McGovern–Fraser Commission. Prior to the primary elections of 1972, William Borah had won several contests in the 1936 Republican primaries.

By June, Carter had the nomination sufficiently locked up and could take time to interview potential vice-presidential candidates. The pundits predicted that Church would be tapped to provide balance as an experienced senator with strong liberal credentials. Church promoted himself, persuading friends to intervene with Carter in his behalf. If a quick choice had been required as in past conventions, Carter later recalled, he would probably have chosen Church. But the longer period for deliberation gave Carter time to worry about his compatibility with the publicity-seeking Church, who had a tendency to be long-winded. Instead, Carter invited Senators Edmund Muskie, John Glenn, and Walter Mondale to visit his home in Plains, Georgia, for personal interviews, while Church, Henry M. Jackson, and Adlai Stevenson III would be interviewed at the convention in New York. Of all the potential candidates, Carter found Mondale the most compatible. As a result, Carter selected Mondale as his running mate.

In the late 1970s, Church was a leading congressional supporter of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which proposed to return the Panama Canal to Panama. The scheme proved to be widely unpopular in Idaho, and led to the formation of the &quot;Anybody But Church&quot; (ABC) committee, created by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), based in Washington, D.C. ABC and NCPAC had no formal connection with the 1980 Senate campaign of conservative Republican congressman Steve Symms, which permitted them, under former Federal election law, to spend as much as they could raise to defeat Church.

Church lost his bid for a fifth term to Symms by less than one percent of the vote. His defeat was blamed on the activities of the &quot;Anybody But Church Committee&quot; and the national media&#x27;s early announcement in Idaho of Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan&#x27;s overwhelming win. These predictions were broadcast before polls closed statewide, specifically in the Pacific Time Zone in the north. Many believed that this caused many Democrats in the more politically moderate Idaho Panhandle to not vote at all. , Church is the last Democrat to represent Idaho in the U.S. Senate.

===Election results===
Following his 24 years in the Senate, Church practiced international law with the Washington, D.C., firm of Whitman and Ransom, specializing in Asian issues.

==Death==
Three years after leaving the Senate, Church was hospitalized for a pancreatic tumor on Less than three months later, he died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on April 7 at age 59.
A memorial service was held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and then his body was flown home to Idaho, where he lay in state beneath the rotunda of the Idaho State Capitol. His funeral was held in downtown Boise at the Cathedral of the Rockies on April 12 and televised throughout Idaho. Church was buried at Morris Hill Cemetery near his boyhood hero, Senator William Borah.

==Legacy==
Church received an honorary doctorate from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Elizabethtown College in 1983 to honor his work for the American people during his career in public office. His papers, originally given to his alma mater Stanford University in 1981, were transferred to Boise State University at his request in 1984.

, Church remains the last Democrat to serve in the U.S. Senate from Idaho; his final election victory was in 1974, .

===Warning about the NSA===
Church was stunned by what the Church Committee learned about the immense operations and electronic monitoring capabilities of the National Security Agency (NSA), an agency whose existence was unknown to most Americans at the time. Church stated in 1975:

That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn&#x27;t matter. There would be no place to hide.

He is widely quoted as also stating regarding the NSA:

I don&#x27;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge... I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.

Commentators such as Glenn Greenwald have praised Church for his prescient warning regarding this turning around by the NSA to monitor the American people, arguing that the NSA undertook such a turn in the years after the September 11 attacks.

<doc id="461930" wikidata="Q4669849" url="?curid=461930" title="Absolutely (TV series)">
<text>Absolutely is a British comedy sketch show. The cast and crew are mainly Scottish; the principal writers and performers are Moray Hunter, Jack Docherty, Peter Baikie, Gordon Kennedy (all of whom had performed together as The Bodgers for many years), Morwenna Banks (Cornish) and John Sparkes (Welsh). The original television series, produced by Absolutely Productions, aired on Channel 4 for four series between May 1989 and February 1993. Following an award-winning one-off radio reunion special for BBC Radio 4 in 2013, the show returned for a new four-part radio series with most of the original cast in September 2015. A second Radio 4 series of four programmes was broadcast from 25 June 2017, and a third in July 2019.

== Recurring characters ==
* Stoneybridge Town Council (played by the entire cast) were the council of the fictional small Scottish town of Stoneybridge. Originally meant to be a one-off mocking the plague of promotional videos and adverts done by many British towns during the 1980s and 1990s, the characters proved so popular that they snowballed into a regular parody of small town and village councils run by the parochial minded with jarring grandiose aspirations for themselves and the people they are trying to serve (for example, bidding to host the Olympic Games). 
* Frank Hovis (played by Sparkes) was a character described as a club host, who first appeared in series three in a series of monologues, which he self-titled as &quot;On the Lavatory (once replaced by &#x27;The Lavatory Express&#x27;) with Frank Hovis&quot;. These were set in an unpleasant public toilet cubicle with no toilet paper, where Frank would draw upon his own personal experiences in a slurred northern English accent, usually involving toilet humour. Outside of &quot;Absolutely&quot;, Hovis featured in his own panel game show for BBC Wales entitled &quot;Pub Quiz&quot;.
* McGlashan (played by Docherty) was an extreme Scottish nationalist and playwright, who frequently espoused anglophobia. 
*Calum Gilhooley (played by Hunter) was introduced as the most boring man in the world. Well-meaning but extremely dull, he talked endlessly about his anorak (&quot;it has pockets, which is good, &#x27;cos you can keep things in them, and they open and close&quot;) and Suzuki motorbikes.
* Denzil and Gwynedd (played by Sparkes and Banks) were a dysfunctional Welsh married couple. Denzil, a DIY enthusiast without the skill to match, was supercilious and dismissive of his wife, whilst Gwynedd was ambitious but simple - later reappeared post-&quot;Absolutely&quot; in &quot;Barry Welsh Is Coming&quot;. Some of their TV sketches had Welsh subtitles, and the two characters spoke cod-Welsh or in English with exaggerated Welsh accents (&quot;and what in Swansea are going on here?&quot;).
* The Little Girl (played by Banks) would enthusiastically describe her understanding of a topic such as death, dentists, going on an aeroplane, or the government in an overexcited bluster. The sketches often ended with her exclaiming, &quot;It is, it&#x27;s true!&quot; Morwenna would later perform this character after she was hired on Saturday Night Live and again in several episodes of her own comedy sketch show THE MORWENNA BANKS SHOW...
* The Nice Family (played by the entire cast) was a parody of a straight-laced middle-class family, none of whom have names, but were referred to by their titles of &quot;Father&quot; (Docherty), &quot;Mother&quot; (Kennedy, always with his back to the audience, cleaning), &quot;Eldest son&quot; (Sparkes), &quot;Daughter&quot; (Banks), &quot;First twin&quot; (Baikie) and &quot;Second twin&quot; (Hunter). The Father was the dominant figure of the family, with everyone else looking exactly like him, wearing beige jumpers, white collar shirts, brown ties, brown slacks (except the women who wear brown skirts) and black shoes. A framed photograph of John Major was sometimes seen on their wall.
* George and Donald McDiarmid (played by Docherty and Hunter) were a surreal duo who would appear in almost every episode. George McDiarmid was dressed in a black pinstripe suit and tie, while Don McDiarmid (no relation) was dressed in tweed, a bow tie, and an unusual pair of glasses with one lens at a right angle. The two characters would go on to get their own sit-com Mr Don &amp; Mr George.
* Peter and Jennifer Wells (played by Docherty and Banks) were a well-off couple introduced in series two, who were keen to support charities but often let their own prejudices get in the way. 
* Bert Bastard (played by Sparkes) was a very rude and profane old man who was very feeble and not able to perform many day-to-day tasks such as cooking and eating.
* The Musical Sections featured in every episode, but by series two Baikie developed a character of a smug piano man - Mr Muzak. The piano player would often be used to link sketches together by playing his piano across the set. Another regular musical character was created in series four - The Laughing Man who had the habit of laughing at not very amusing bumper stickers and signs.
* Gwyn (played by Sparkes) is a Welshman who would often give monologues to camera. Gwyn suffered from a constant nervous twitch which resulted in his body shaking all over the place and whistling while he talked. The character was first performed by Sparkes when he performed stand-up comedy before &quot;Absolutely&quot;. Gwyn reappeared in Sparkes&#x27; post-&quot;Absolutely&quot; series, &quot;Barry Welsh Is Coming&quot;.

== History ==

=== Television ===
The original television run of &quot;Absolutely&quot; ran for four series, with a total of 28 episodes:
* Series 1: Six episodes transmitted between 23 May 1989 and 27 June 1989
* Series 2: Eight episodes transmitted between 22 August 1990 and 10 October 1990
* Series 3: Eight episodes transmitted between 17 May 1991 and 5 July 1991
* Series 4: Six episodes transmitted between 22 January 1993 and 26 February 1993

The characters of Don and George subsequently featured in their own spin-off series &quot;Mr. Don and Mr. George&quot;, which ran for six episodes.

In 1995, a pilot was shown on BBC2 for a series called &quot;Mac&quot;, a sitcom based around MacGlashan and his long-suffering brother Finley (played by Gordon Kennedy). Finley ran a small shop selling the sort of stereotypical Scottish kitsch for tourists that inflamed Mac&#x27;s senses, his assistant Aileen (played by Elaine Collins of &quot;City Lights&quot;) acted as Mac&#x27;s love interest, while Nick Hancock played his Londoner love rival Van Webster.

All four series of &quot;Absolutely&quot; were released as a DVD boxset entitled &quot;Absolutely Everything&quot; on 5 May 2008. Upon authoring the DVD, it was discovered that the master tape for Series 1, Episode 2 no longer exists in Channel 4&#x27;s archives and thus an off-air copy is used on the boxset instead. Whether the episode was deliberately wiped or just improperly archived is unknown. 

=== Radio ===
A reunion show was aired as part of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Sketchorama&quot; series, first broadcast on 20 May 2013. An extended version of the show was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in August 2013. A year later, the special won a BBC Audio Drama award for best live scripted comedy.

&quot;Absolutely&quot; returned as a four-part radio series for BBC Radio 4 in September 2015, again featuring the original cast without Jack Docherty. The new series, a co-production between Absolutely Productions Ltd and The Comedy Unit, was recorded on two evenings in August and September 2015 at Òran Mór in Glasgow. The first episode was broadcast on Sunday 6 September 2015.

A second four-part series aired on BBC Radio 4 during the summer of 2017, with a third following in July 2019.

=== Live ===
In the early 1990s, Pete Baikie and Gordon Kennedy briefly toured as comedy band, &quot;The Hairstyles&quot;.

In the mid-90s, following the success of TV spin-off &quot;Mr. Don &amp; Mr. George&quot;, Moray Hunter and Jack Docherty toured together as &quot;Hunter and Docherty&quot;.

<doc id="461933" wikidata="Q715213" url="?curid=461933" title="Carmelit">
<text>The Carmelit ( Arabic: كرمليت) is an underground funicular railway in Haifa, Israel. Construction started in 1956 and ended in 1959. It is the oldest underground transit system in the Middle East and was the only underground transit system in Israel until the 2023 opening of Tel Aviv Light Rail. The Carmelit has closed down for repair on three occasions.

==System==
The Carmelit, named after Mount Carmel through which it runs, is an underground funicular railway in Haifa. The difference in elevation between the first and last stations is . Carmelit cars have a slanted design, with steps within each car and on the station platform. Since the grade varies along the route, the floor of each car is never quite level, and slopes slightly &quot;uphill&quot; or &quot;downhill&quot; depending on the location, the only exception being Masada station.

The Carmelit is the smallest subway system in the world, having only four cars, six stations and a single tunnel long. The four cars operate as two two-car trains, which run on single-track with a short passing loop to allow the trains to pass each other.

The technology used in the system forces it to have an even number of stations at approximately equal distances. This means that some stations are not close to major centers, but were situated for technical reasons.

==History==

A rail-based solution to connect Mount Carmel with downtown Haifa was envisioned by the British mandatory authorities. However, practical talks only began in 1955 under the auspices of then-mayor Abba Hushi. The French company Compagnie Dunkerquoise d&#x27;Entreprises created a detailed plan and proposed a generous loan for a large part of the project, and an agreement was signed in 1956. The plan was for a funicular system, and the inauguration took place in 1959, attended by Israeli prime minister David Ben Gurion and the French transport minister Robert Buron among others.

The Israeli company Solel Boneh carried out the works, which proceeded at a pace of three meters a day, other than a geologically difficult section where a speed of 1.5 meters a day was achieved.

===Shutdowns===
The Carmelit was shut down for intensive renovation on December 19, 1986, after 27 consecutive years. The old rolling stock was taken to a scrapyard near Kfar Masaryk in 1991, after being offered to the Israel Railway Museum which refused it due to high transport costs. After several delays and failed attempts, renovation work started on October 29, 1990. The Carmelit finally reopened to the public in early September 1992.

In March 2015, the Carmelit was closed again due to a faulty cable, and subsequently reopened in July 2015. At the same time new ticket machines were installed to accommodate the Rav-Kav ticketing system.

On Saturday, February 4, 2017, a fire erupted in the Paris Square station after working hours. One of the two trainsets was heavily damaged, as well as parts of the tunnel. As a result, the line was once more shut down and underwent an upgrade that included replacing both trainsets with new ones (supplied by Doppelmayr&#x27;s Swiss subsidiary which built the original trainsets), a new control center, and a major refurbishing of the systems and infrastructure. It reopened in October 2018.

==Today==
The small number of stations means that the Carmelit serves only a small part of Haifa – which was the important population and business center when it was designed. Nowadays, the vast majority of the city&#x27;s population does not live near any of the stations, making it used by few only. There have been talks of extending the tunnels to reach more people, but this has not been done, primarily for economic reasons. The most widely used public transportation system in the Haifa area consists of Egged buses, which serve most of the city.

Haifa&#x27;s comptroller wrote in his 2004 report (published in 2005) about the declining use of the Carmelit. According to the report, the system is used by only 2,000 passengers a day, and has been losing money ever since its reopening in 1992. The accrued losses between 1992 and 2003 are over ₪191 million.

Since October 31, 2010, taking a bicycle on the Carmelit has been allowed at no additional cost.

An extensive BRT system called Metronit began operating in Haifa in late 2013. It was hoped the stops at some of the Carmelit stations would increase ridership on the line.

When the Carmelit reopened at the end of 2018, it experienced a surge in ridership, with 4,000 people taking it per day, the highest figure in 20 years.

, the Carmelit is the only fully underground railway in Israel. However, much of the Tel Aviv Light Rail is underground as well.

<text>The University of Wollongong (UOW) is an Australian public research university located in the coastal city of Wollongong, New South Wales, approximately south of Sydney. , the university had an enrolment of more than 33,000 students (including over 12,300 international students), an alumni base of more than 176,000 [LC1] and over 2,400 staff members including 16 Distinguished professors.

In 1951, a division of the New South Wales University of Technology (known as the University of New South Wales from 1958) was established in Wollongong for the conduct of diploma courses. In 1961, the Wollongong University College of the University of New South Wales was constituted and the college was officially opened in 1962. In 1975 the University of Wollongong was established as an independent institution. Since its establishment, the university has conferred more than 120,000 degrees, diplomas and certificates. Its students, originally predominantly from the local Illawarra region, are now from over 150 countries, with international students accounting for more than 37 percent of total.

The University of Wollongong has developed into a multi-campus institution, both domestically and globally. The Wollongong campus, the university&#x27;s main campus, is on the original site north-west of the city centre, and covers an area of with 94 permanent buildings. In addition, there are regional university campuses in Bega, Batemans Bay, Moss Vale and Shoalhaven, as well as three Sydney campuses, including the UOW Sydney Business School, UOW Liverpool and UOW Sutherland. Beyond Australia, UOW has campuses in Dubai, Hong Kong and cities in Malaysia. UOW has also established partnerships with a number of international education institutions in China and Singapore.

==History==
Over 60 years, the university has grown from a provincial feeder college with 300 students to an international university with over 33,000 students spread across nine domestic campuses and four international centres.

===Establishment===
The University of Wollongong traces its origins to 1951. The foundation of the university was in 1951 when a division of The New South Wales University of Technology (currently known as the University of New South Wales, UNSW) was established in Wollongong. In 1962, the division became the Wollongong College of the University of New South Wales.

On 1 January 1975, the New South Wales Parliament incorporated the University of Wollongong as an independent institution of higher learning consisting of five faculties (including engineering, humanities, mathematics, sciences and social sciences) with Michael Birt as its inaugural vice chancellor. In 1976, Justice Robert Marsden Hope was installed as chancellor of the university. As of 1982, the university amalgamated the Wollongong Institute of Higher Education which had begun life in 1962 as the Wollongong Teachers&#x27; College; thus the merger formed the basis for a period of rapid growth in the 1980s.

===History===
In 1951, a foundation of the University of Wollongong was founded as a division of the New South Wales University of Technology in Wollongong. A decade later, the division became the Wollongong College of the University of New South Wales.

In 1972, the library was three storeys high and could fit 280 students. In 1975, the University of Wollongong gained its autonomy as an independent institution of higher learning by the Parliament of New South Wales. In 1976, the library expanded and could fit 530 students.

In 1977, the Faculty of Computer Science (currently known as the Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences) developed a version of Unix for the Interdata 7/32 called UNSW 01, this was the first non-PDP Unix. In the late 70s, Tim Berners-Lee sourced TCP/IP software, an integral element of the World Wide Web, from the University of Wollongong.

In 1981, Ken McKinnon was appointed Vice-Chancellor, overseeing the amalgamation of the university with the Wollongong Institute of Education (also known as WIE) in 1982. The Wollongong Institute of Education had originated in 1971 as the Teachers College (renamed the Wollongong Institute of Education in 1973). This merger formed the basis of the contemporary university. In 1983, the Faculty of Commerce was established along with the School of Creative Arts, followed by the creation of the Faculty of Education in 1984. Also in 1984 the commencement of the new Wollongong University building program began, which led to the construction and opening of the Illawarra Technology Centre (1985), Kooloobong (1985, 1986, 1990), Weerona College (1986), Administration, Union Mall (now known as UniCentre), URAC (1987), multi-storey carpark (1990) and heated swimming pool (1990).

In 1993, the University of Wollongong Dubai Campus in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates was established.

In 2000, the Shoalhaven campus was opened at Nowra on the South Coast. The Bega campus was also opened. In 2001, the Southern Highlands campus opened at Moss Vale.

In 2008, the university opened the first building at Wollongong Innovation Campus (abbreviated as iC) on a 20-hectare site at Brandon Park in Wollongong. In August, the Faculty of Science Dean, Rob Whelan, took up a new role as president of the University of Wollongong in Dubai.

In October 2009 Chancellor Mike Codd retired as chancellor after three four-year terms. He was succeeded by Jillian Broadbent.

In July 2010, the New South Wales Health Minister, Carmel Tebbutt, opened the $30 million Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute. In August, a $20 million building housing the Sydney Business School and the UOW/TAFE Digital Media Centre opened at the Innovation Campus. The centre was named the Mike Codd Building in honour of a former chancellor. In 2014, work began on the $20 million iAccelerate building at the Innovation Campus (iC), which offers space for up to 200 budding entrepreneurs to develop their ideas.

In 2017, the University of Wollongong South Western Sydney campus opened on Moore Street in Liverpool.

In October 2020 Christine McLoughlin succeeded Jillian Broadbent as chancellor. Michael Still took over the role in 2024.

===Overseas expansion===
In 1993 the University of Wollongong in Australia opened what was to become the University of Wollongong in Dubai (UOWD) in the United Arab Emirates. Initially called the Institute of Australian Studies (IAS), this centre made UOW the first foreign university to open a campus in the UAE, and the first Australian tertiary institution represented in the Persian Gulf region, as well as one of the earliest tertiary institutions founded in the UAE. IAS initially offered English language programs, before becoming a &quot;feeder college&quot; by 1995, where students completed part of a degree in business or IT in Dubai before coming to Australia to complete their studies. In 1999, it was the first foreign-owned institution in the world to be issued a licence from the federal government of the United Arab Emirates, and was formally opened as University of Wollongong, Dubai Campus in October 2000. It was officially incorporated as University of Wollongong in Dubai in 2004 and at present it has over 4,000 students from almost one hundred countries.

Although a large number of alumni live in Wollongong and Sydney, and a significant number also live in Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong, Bangkok, London, New York and Washington, D.C.

== Controversies ==
In 2016, the university awarded a controversial PhD to Judith Wilyman, in which she was alleged to advocate a vaccine conspiracy theory. The university received criticism over this decision, but the university cited the need to permit &#x27;freedom of opinion&#x27;, and noted that the thesis passed the university&#x27;s assessment procedures.

The university has been criticised for their handling of reported sexual assaults. One case highlighted the way in which the university claimed to &quot;assist&quot; a student after the student alleged sexual assault by another student. News Limited reported that the university did not take any disciplinary action against the alleged perpetrator, instead advising the victim to change behaviour, with the victim adding: &quot;Nothing happened to him. Instead I was told to make all the changes&quot;. For self-protection the victim independently succeeded in taking out an Apprehended Violence Order via the courts against the alleged. Karen Willis, the executive officer of Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, described the actions of the university as &quot;disgraceful&quot;, as it placed the &quot;onus and responsibility on the person who has experienced violence&quot;. The university responded that its instructions are &quot;standard procedure&quot;, it &quot;does not comment on specific allegations&quot;, and it is not able to investigate sexual assault claims, as those must be investigated by the NSW Police. Another alleged victim considers their sexual assault and UoW&#x27;s &quot;response to be equally despicable.&quot;

Between 2011 and 2016, there were 40 officially reported cases of sexual assault, harassment or misconduct on campus, resulting in no expulsions, one suspension and three reprimands. Freedom of information investigations reported by News Limited suggest this may represent &quot;just the tip of the iceberg ... due to under-reporting&quot;. In contrast, the 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission report on sexual assault and harassment found reported figures substantially higher than this.

<text>Tertangala is the student magazine of the University of Wollongong. It is published by Wollongong Undergraduate Students&#x27; Association, and &quot;Tertangala&quot; is older than the university itself.

==Content==
The magazine features student investigative and feature articles, news, artwork, opinion, film and music reviews, as well as interviews and editorials. Submissions from staff and students (including student association representatives) makes up the bulk of the magazines content, however submissions from other members of the community are also accepted.

From time to time, the Tertangala has been known to use themes as a way to source content and spark interest amongst the student population. However, themes are not at all restrictive and content is accepted even if it does not conform to the set theme.

==History==
&quot;Tertangala&quot; was first published in September 1962, when the school was still an external campus of the University of New South Wales, making it older than the University of Wollongong itself. Colloquially referred to as &quot;The Tert&quot; by students, the paper was formerly edited by the elected Media Coordinator of WUSA. The Media Coordinator was elected by a popular vote open to all WUSA members.

&quot;Tertangala&quot; has a radical editorial tradition and many of its former editors have transitioned into active political and artistic life. Past editors and staff members have also gone on to write for other publications, such as The New York Times, The Guardian, Rolling Stone, The Australian and Vogue.

Throughout the years, &quot;Tertangala&quot; has won multiple awards, including a merit award for cover design and an investigative journalism award for a feature article about the re-opening of a copper smelter in Port Kembla. &quot;Tertangala&quot; was also named one of the top five student publications in the country.

&quot;Tertangala&quot; editors and contributors have also been regularly involved as presenters and organisers of the This is Not Art festival.

&quot;Tertangala&quot; was originally printed by the Illawarra Mercury.

All copies of &quot;Tertangala&quot; are archived by the University of Wollongong library, and many are available online.

===Name===
The name &quot;Tertangala&quot; was thought to mean &quot;smoke signals&quot; in an Indigenous language. The name originated when the University of Wollongong was a campus of UNSW, and was chosen to correspond with its then-sister paper &quot;Tharunka&quot;, whose name was thought to mean &quot;message stick&quot; However, an investigation in 2000 found that &quot;Tertangala&quot; was simply a nonsense word and had no roots in any recorded Indigenous languages, although this was not revealed until 2017. Some people suggest that the name was also chosen to parody the atmosphere of Wollongong&#x27;s industrial city.

===First edition===
The first edition was a four-page newspaper put together for the Wollongong University College Students&#x27; Union and featured a number of satirical and journalistic articles. It also included advertisements for &quot;Lance&#x27;s&quot; (a David Jones&#x27; store) &quot;Maloufs Men&#x27;s Wear&quot; and &quot;Rural Bank&quot; (which opened on campus for &quot;two hours every pay day&quot;).

===Controversies===
A constitutional provision in the Wollongong Undergraduate Students&#x27; Association constitution, designed to check the Media Coordinator&#x27;s editorial power, provides the right of veto over the content of the paper by the President of WUSA. The right of editorial control versus the censorial privilege of the WUSA President has ofttimes been a source of controversy and tension on the University of Wollongong campus. In early 2004, then-Editor Anneliese Constable fought the then-President Michael Szafraniec for the right to publish reports critical of his administration of WUSA.

There has always been tension between &quot;Tertangala&quot; and its auspice the Wollongong Undergraduate Students&#x27; Association, usually around issues of right to free press and free speech when reporting on WUSA actions. Robert Bruce Keanan Brown (aka b2) (Editor 1988–1990) resigned in an open letter in &quot;Tertangala&quot; citing the &quot;bureaucratisation&quot; of the magazine as his main reason for leaving. He stated that:

&quot;Tertangala&quot; has also been accused of being depraved, pornographic, obscene and offensive by residents and local media on more than one occasion. The first was following a Commem Week edition of the publication called &quot;Daily Moron&quot; in 1974. Locals took issue with the magazine&#x27;s liberal use of the word &#x27;fuck&#x27;.

During 2009, the WUSA Queer Collective produced the &quot;Sexuality and Gender&quot; edition of Tertangala, without the consent of the Tertangala Collective. The edition received some student criticism relating to &#x27;offensive&#x27; material. The Queer Collective confirmed that the publication was intentionally offensive, consistent with a long tradition of subversive student journalism at UOW.

In 2019 the magazine was accused by UOW that their most recent edition of the magazine titled &quot;The Debauchery Edition&quot; was incompatible with the university&#x27;s &quot;Safe and Respectful Communities&quot; policy. The then Coordinator of the magazine issued a statement instead pointing the finger at the administration which had refused to introduce compulsory consent courses and to combat sexual assault off-campus. UOW subsequently removed their statement following condemnation from local media and the student populace.

===Student journalism===
Not all controversies have been created by &quot;Tertangala&quot;, and the magazine has a well-documented history of recording controversial decisions of University of Wollongong administration. In 1999, the magazine reported the student uproar that followed a university decision to invite conservative commentator Piers Akerman to speak at a graduation ceremony.

===Notable contributors===
Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki used to write for &quot;Tertangala&quot; while studying at the University of Wollongong in the 1960s, and he ran for the position of editor in 1966 but was unsuccessful. He wrote to congratulate &quot;Tertangala&quot; on reaching 45 years in 2007.

Van Badham edited the magazine in 1997. Van is now an award-winning Australian playwright.

===Quoted in Federal Parliament===
&quot;Tertangala&quot; was quoted in federal parliament, in a speech made by former Australian Greens Member for Cunningham Michael Organ.

===Funding===
Throughout its history, &quot;Tertangala&quot; was funded by WUSA through membership fees collected from students. The introduction of voluntary student unionism significantly reduced the capacity of WUSA to continue to fund the publication. Following a long campaign in 2007 by the students involved, the University of Wollongong guaranteed $24,000 funding a year until 2010 in an effort to support the publication.

The magazine also uses advertising to supplement its funding base. The editor of the &quot;Tertangala&quot; reserves the right to determine who can and cannot advertise in the paper.

<text>was a town located in Tsuna District, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan.

On April 1, 2005, Ichinomiya, along with the towns of Awaji, Higashiura, Hokudan and Tsuna (all from Tsuna District), was merged to create the city of Awaji and no longer exists as an independent municipality. The town has no special relationship with another Ichinomiya in Hyogo Prefecture.

Ichinomiya literally means &quot;the first shrine&quot; of the province. In case of this town, it is the Izanagi Shrine of the Awaji Province.

<text>State Route 57 (SR 57), also known as the Orange Freeway for most of its length, is a north–south state highway in the Greater Los Angeles Area of the U.S. state of California. It connects the interchange of Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 22 near downtown Orange, locally known as the Orange Crush, to the Glendora Curve interchange with I-210 and SR 210 in Glendora. The highway provides a route across several spurs of the Peninsular Ranges, linking the Los Angeles Basin with the Pomona Valley and San Gabriel Valley.

A predecessor to this road ran through Brea Canyon by the early 20th century and was added to the state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR 57 was designated as part of the 1964 state highway renumbering. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid-1970s. The latest piece of SR 57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR 210 was legislatively extended to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed extension from Santa Ana south to Huntington Beach remains in the legal definition of SR 57, and has been studied as a toll road above the Santa Ana River.

==Route description==
SR 57 begins at the Orange Crush interchange near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to the west side of the Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR 57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR 57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR 57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, right on the edge of the San Gabriel Valley.

A short overlap carries SR 57 traffic on the same roadway as SR 60. The two routes head northeast through an arm of the San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR 57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR 57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its highest elevation before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.

High-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) exist in the median of SR 57 south of SR 60 in Diamond Bar. Elevated ramps allow HOV traffic bound to or from Brea Canyon to connect with I-5 towards the southeast, SR 91 towards the west, or SR 60 towards the east without entering the main lanes.

SR 57 is legally eligible for the State Scenic Highway System through Brea Canyon, between SR 90 and SR 60, though it has not officially been designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The entire route is in the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is a freeway for its entire constructed length. SR 57 is also part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways that are essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. The highway from SR 1 to SR 60 in Diamond Bar is officially designated as the Orange Freeway. In 2013, SR 57 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 129,000 between SR 60 and Sunset Crossing Road in Diamond Bar, and 278,500 between SR 91 in Anaheim and Orangethorpe Avenue in Placentia, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

==History==

The road through Brea Canyon was oiled dirt by the late 1910s, providing a good connection across an outbranching of the Peninsular Ranges between the Los Angeles Basin and Pomona Valley. This road left the main coast highway (Harbor Boulevard) at Fullerton and followed the present Brea Boulevard and Brea Canyon Road, merging with the Valley Boulevard from Los Angeles near Walnut and continuing east to Pomona via Valley and Pomona Boulevards. Los Angeles County paved the road in concrete in early 1923, and in 1931 it was added to the state highway system as a branch of Route 19. Until then, Route 19 had connected Route 9 near Claremont with Riverside, following Garey Avenue and Mission Boulevard through Pomona.

The state built a bypass of the Valley Boulevard portion of the route in the early-to-mid-1930s, leaving the old road near Diamond Bar and heading northeast through the foothills, along the present freeway alignment and Mission Boulevard. To the south, the legislature added then-unrelated Route 180 along State College Boulevard in 1933, connecting Route 2 (I-5) near the Santa Ana River with Route 175 (Orangethorpe Avenue, later replaced by SR 91) near Placentia. By 1955, the Brea Canyon Freeway was proposed to begin at the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) near La Veta Avenue in Santa Ana and head north, paralleling Routes 180 and 19 to Pomona. The portion northeast of Diamond Bar into Pomona soon became part of the planned Pomona Freeway, and the name of the remainder was changed to Orange Freeway. The state legislature altered the definition of Route 19 to reflect this in 1957 by moving its south end to Santa Ana.

Then, in 1957, the northernmost part of present SR 57 was added to the state highway system as part of Route 240, which the legislature designated along the route planned for I-210. This became part of the proposed Temescal Freeway, later the Corona Freeway; a southerly extension of the Orange Freeway to Legislative Route 60 (SR 1) near Huntington Beach was added in 1959 as Route 273. Also in 1959, the legislature created Route 272, extending the line of the Orange Freeway north from the Pomona Freeway to the Temescal Freeway, completing the proposed freeway corridor that is now SR 57. When the entire route, except Route 240 which was still part of I-210, was redesignated SR 57 in the 1964 renumbering, none of these proposed freeways had been built; the only constructed segment was the old surface road from Fullerton towards Pomona. The part of old Route 19 east of Route 272 became part of SR 60. As part of the same renumbering, Route 180 on State College Boulevard became Route 250, which was amended the next year to provide for its deletion once that portion of the SR 57 freeway was completed (between I-5 and SR 91).
A groundbreaking ceremony was held in Placentia on January 30, 1967, to begin construction of the Orange Freeway. The first portion was dedicated on May 16, 1969, and opened soon after, extending north from the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) to Nutwood Avenue in Fullerton. Over the next few years, the freeway was completed from SR 91 north to I-10, and I-210 was built north to the present end of SR 57; the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), which overlaps it through Diamond Bar, was constructed at the same time. The last pieces of that portion were the freeway through Brea Canyon, which opened March 13, 1972, and the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange at I-10, which was dedicated May 1, 1972, and opened soon thereafter. Finally, the Orange Freeway was extended south from SR 91 to I-5 in the mid-1970s, allowing Route 250 to be turned back to local governments, though the subsequent deletion from the Streets and Highways Code did not take place until 1981. With the extension of SR 210 around San Bernardino in 1998, the former easternmost piece of I-210 to the Kellogg Hill Interchange instead became a northerly extension of SR 57, though it remains officially part of the Interstate Highway System.

==Future==
The southerly extension to Huntington Beach remains unconstructed. In 1986, Orange County&#x27;s plans were for a toll road elevated above the Santa Ana River rather than through existing neighborhoods, only extending south to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) in Costa Mesa with connections to the Corona del Mar Freeway (SR 73); this was largely inspired by congestion on SR 55 through the Santa Ana area. The extension was considered by Caltrans as two , two-lane viaducts that would cost $950 million. The toll road franchise that the American Transportation Development (ATD) held for this portion of SR 57 expired in January 2001, after a request to delay the expiration until January 2007. Following this, ATD sued to restore the franchise, and this case lasted until November 2003. The termination was due to ATD not beginning the construction during the first ten years of the franchise, after it had been enacted by the state legislature.

In April 2009, the Orange County Transportation Authority continued to study the extension of SR 57, where the freeway would travel along the Santa Ana River and terminate at I-405 in Fountain Valley.

The northbound widening between Katella Avenue and SR 91 was finished in 2014. To keep the flow of the northbound fifth lane which ends after the Orangewood Avenue exit and resumes after the Katella Avenue exit, Caltrans and OCTA plan to widen that 0.5 mile strip of road to add one more lane in the northbound direction.

<text>In non-Euclidean geometry, the Poincaré half-plane model is a way of representing the hyperbolic plane using points in the familiar Euclidean plane. Specifically, each point in the hyperbolic plane is represented using a Euclidean point with coordinates whose coordinate is greater than zero, the upper half-plane, and a metric tensor (definition of distance) called the Poincaré metric is adopted, in which the local scale is inversely proportional to the coordinate. Points on the -axis, whose coordinate is equal to zero, represent ideal points (points at infinity), which are outside the hyperbolic plane proper.

Sometimes the points of the half-plane model are considered to lie in the complex plane with positive imaginary part. Using this interpretation, each point in the hyperbolic plane is associated with a complex number.

The half-plane model can be thought of as a map projection from the curved hyperbolic plane to the flat Euclidean plane. From the hyperboloid model (a representation of the hyperbolic plane on a hyperboloid of two sheets embedded in 3-dimensional Minkowski space, analogous to the sphere embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space), the half-plane model is obtained by orthographic projection in a direction parallel to a null vector, which can also be thought of as a kind of stereographic projection centered on an ideal point. The projection is conformal, meaning that it preserves angles, and like the stereographic projection of the sphere it projects generalized circles (geodesics, hypercycles, horocycles, and circles) in the hyperbolic plane to generalized circles (lines or circles) in the plane. In particular, geodesics (analogous to straight lines), project to either half-circles whose center has coordinate zero, or to vertical straight lines of constant coordinate, hypercycles project to circles crossing the -axis, horocycles project to either circles tangent to the -axis or to horizontal lines of constant coordinate, and circles project to circles contained entirely in the half-plane.

Hyperbolic motions, the distance-preserving geometric transformations from the hyperbolic plane to itself, are represented in the Poincaré half-plane by the subset of Möbius transformations of the plane which preserve the half-plane; these are conformal, circle-preserving transformations which send the -axis to itself without changing its orientation. When points in the plane are taken to be complex numbers, any Möbius transformation is represented by a linear fractional transformation of complex numbers, and the hyperbolic motions are represented by elements of the projective special linear group .

The Cayley transform provides an isometry between the half-plane model and the Poincaré disk model, which is a stereographic projection of the hyperboloid centered on any ordinary point in the hyperbolic plane, which maps the hyperbolic plane onto a disk in the Euclidean plane, and also shares the properties of conformality and mapping generalized circles to generalized circles.

The Poincaré half-plane model is named after Henri Poincaré, but it originated with Eugenio Beltrami who used it, along with the Klein model and the Poincaré disk model, to show that hyperbolic geometry was equiconsistent with Euclidean geometry.

The half-plane model can be generalized to the Poincaré half-space model of -dimensional hyperbolic space by replacing the single coordinate by distinct coordinates.

==Metric==

The metric of the model on the half-plane, formula_1 is:

:formula_2

where &quot;s&quot; measures the length along a (possibly curved) line.
The &quot;straight lines&quot; in the hyperbolic plane (geodesics for this metric tensor, i.e., curves which minimize the distance) are represented in this model by circular arcs perpendicular to the &quot;x&quot;-axis (half-circles whose centers are on the &quot;x&quot;-axis) and straight vertical rays perpendicular to the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

=== Distance calculation ===

If formula_3 and formula_4 are two points in the half-plane formula_5 and formula_6 is the reflection of formula_7 across the &quot;x&quot;-axis into the lower half plane, the &quot;distance&quot; between the two points under the hyperbolic-plane metric is:

formula_8

where formula_9 is the Euclidean distance between points and , formula_10formula_11 is the inverse hyperbolic sine, and formula_12formula_13 is the inverse hyperbolic tangent. This formula_14 formula can be thought of as coming from the chord length in the Minkowski metric between points in the hyperboloid model, formula_15 analogous to finding arclength on a sphere in terms of chord length. This formula_16 formula can be thought of as coming from Euclidean distance in the Poincaré disk model with one point at the origin, analogous to finding arclength on the sphere by taking a stereographic projection centered on one point and measuring the Euclidean distance in the plane from the origin to the other point.

If the two points formula_7 and formula_18 are on a hyperbolic line (Euclidean half-circle) which intersects the &quot;x&quot;-axis at the ideal points formula_19 and formula_20 the distance from formula_7 to formula_18 is:

formula_23

Cf. Cross-ratio.

Some special cases can be simplified. Two points with the same coordinate:

formula_24

Two points with the same formula_25 coordinate:

formula_26

One point at the apex of the semicircle formula_27 and another point at a central angle of .

formula_28

where is the inverse Gudermannian function.

==Special points and curves==

Ideal points (points at infinity) in the Poincaré half-plane model are of two kinds: the points on the -axis, and one imaginary point at formula_29 which is the ideal point to which all lines orthogonal to the -axis converge.

Straight lines, geodesics (the shortest path between the points contained within it) are modeled by either half-circles whose origin is on the x-axis, or straight vertical rays orthogonal to the x-axis.

A circle (curve equidistant from a central point) with center formula_30 and radius formula_31 is modeled by a circle with center and radius .

A hypercycle (a curve equidistant from a straight line, its axis) is modeled by either a circular arc which intersects the -axis at the same two ideal points as the half-circle which models its axis but at an acute or obtuse angle, or a straight line which intersects the -axis at the same point as the vertical line which models its axis, but at an acute or obtuse angle.

A horocycle (a curve whose normals all converge asymptotically in the same direction, its center) is modeled by either a circle tangent to the -axis (but excluding the ideal point of intersection, which is its center), or a line parallel to the -axis, in which case the center is the ideal point at .

=== Euclidean synopsis===

A Euclidean circle with center formula_32 and radius formula_33 represents: 
* when the circle is completely inside the halfplane a hyperbolic circle with center formula_34 and radius formula_35 
* when the circle is completely inside the halfplane and touches the boundary a horocycle centered around the ideal point formula_36
* when the circle intersects the boundary orthogonal formula_37 a hyperbolic line
* when the circle intersects the boundary non- orthogonal a hypercycle.

== Compass and straightedge constructions ==

Here is how one can use compass and straightedge constructions in the model to achieve the effect of the basic constructions in the hyperbolic plane.
For example, how to construct the half-circle in the Euclidean half-plane which models a line on the hyperbolic plane through two given points.

=== Creating the line through two existing points ===

Draw the line segment between the two points. Construct the perpendicular bisector of the line segment. Find its intersection with the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Draw the circle around the intersection which passes through the given points. Erase the part which is on or below the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

Or in the special case where the two given points lie on a vertical line, draw that vertical line through the two points and erase the part which is on or below the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

=== Creating the circle through one point with center another point ===

If the two points are not on a vertical line: Draw the radial &quot;line&quot; (half-circle) between the two given points as in the previous case. Construct a tangent to that line at the non-central point. Drop a perpendicular from the given center point to the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Find the intersection of these two lines to get the center of the model circle. Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

If the two given points lie on a vertical line and the given center is above the other given point: Draw a circle around the intersection of the vertical line and the &quot;x&quot;-axis which passes through the given central point. Draw a horizontal line through the non-central point. Construct the tangent to the circle at its intersection with that horizontal line. The midpoint between the intersection of the tangent with the vertical line and the given non-central point is the center of the model circle. Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

If the two given points lie on a vertical line and the given center is below the other given point: Draw a circle around the intersection of the vertical line and the &quot;x&quot;-axis which passes through the given central point. Draw a line tangent to the circle which passes through the given non-central point. Draw a horizontal line through that point of tangency and find its intersection with the vertical line. The midpoint between that intersection and the given non-central point is the center of the model circle.
Draw the model circle around that new center and passing through the given non-central point.

=== Given a circle find its (hyperbolic) center ===

Drop a perpendicular &quot;p&quot; from the Euclidean center of the circle to the &quot;x&quot;-axis. Let point &quot;q&quot; be the intersection of this line and the &quot;x&quot;- axis. Draw a line tangent to the circle going through &quot;q&quot;. Draw the half circle &quot;h&quot; with center &quot;q&quot; going through the point where the tangent and the circle meet. The (hyperbolic) center is the point where &quot;h&quot; and &quot;p&quot; intersect.

=== Other constructions ===

Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing lines, if they intersect: Find the intersection of the two given semicircles (or vertical lines).

Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect): Find the intersection of the given semicircle (or vertical line) with the given circle.

Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect): Find the intersection of the two given circles.

==Symmetry groups==
The projective linear group PGL(2,C) acts on the Riemann sphere by the Möbius transformations. The subgroup that maps the upper half-plane, H, onto itself is PSL(2,R), the transforms with real coefficients, and these act transitively and isometrically on the upper half-plane, making it a homogeneous space.

There are four closely related Lie groups that act on the upper half-plane by fractional linear transformations and preserve the hyperbolic distance.

* The special linear group SL(2,R) which consists of the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals +1. Note that many texts (including Wikipedia) often say SL(2,R) when they really mean PSL(2,R).
* The group S*L(2,R) consisting of the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals +1 or −1. Note that SL(2,R) is a subgroup of this group.
* The projective special linear group PSL(2,R) = SL(2,R)/{±&quot;I&quot;}, consisting of the matrices in SL(2,R) modulo plus or minus the identity matrix.
*The group PS*L(2,R) = S*L(2,R)/{±&quot;I&quot;}=PGL(2,R) is again a projective group, and again, modulo plus or minus the identity matrix. PSL(2,R) is contained as an index-two normal subgroup, the other coset being the set of 2×2 matrices with real entries whose determinant equals −1, modulo plus or minus the identity.

The relationship of these groups to the Poincaré model is as follows:
* The group of all isometries of H, sometimes denoted as Isom(H), is isomorphic to PS*L(2,R). This includes both the orientation preserving and the orientation-reversing isometries. The orientation-reversing map (the mirror map) is formula_38.
* The group of orientation-preserving isometries of H, sometimes denoted as Isom+(H), is isomorphic to PSL(2,R).

Important subgroups of the isometry group are the Fuchsian groups.

One also frequently sees the modular group SL(2,Z). This group is important in two ways. First, it is a symmetry group of the square 2x2 lattice of points. Thus, functions that are periodic on a square grid, such as modular forms and elliptic functions, will thus inherit an SL(2,Z) symmetry from the grid. Second, SL(2,Z) is of course a subgroup of SL(2,R), and thus has a hyperbolic behavior embedded in it. In particular, SL(2,Z) can be used to tessellate the hyperbolic plane into cells of equal (Poincaré) area.

==Isometric symmetry==
The group action of the projective special linear group formula_39 on formula_40 is defined by

:formula_41

Note that the action is transitive: for any formula_42, there exists a formula_43 such that formula_44. It is also faithful, in that if formula_45 for all formula_46 then &quot;g&quot; = &quot;e&quot;.

The stabilizer or &quot;isotropy subgroup&quot; of an element formula_47 is the set of formula_48 which leave &quot;z&quot; unchanged: &quot;gz&quot; = &quot;z&quot;. The stabilizer of &quot;i&quot; is the rotation group

:formula_49

Since any element formula_47 is mapped to &quot;i&quot; by some element of formula_51, this means that the isotropy subgroup of any &quot;z&quot; is isomorphic to SO(2). Thus, formula_52. Alternatively, the bundle of unit-length tangent vectors on the upper half-plane, called the unit tangent bundle, is isomorphic to formula_51.

The upper half-plane is tessellated into free regular sets by the modular group formula_54

==Geodesics==

The geodesics for this metric tensor are circular arcs perpendicular to the real axis (half-circles whose origin is on the real axis) and straight vertical lines ending on the real axis.

The unit-speed geodesic going up vertically, through the point &quot;i&quot; is given by

:formula_55

Because PSL(2,R) acts transitively by isometries of the upper half-plane, this geodesic is mapped into the other geodesics through the action of PSL(2,R). Thus, the general unit-speed geodesic is given by

:formula_56

This provides a basic description of the geodesic flow on the unit-length tangent bundle (complex line bundle) on the upper half-plane. Starting with this model, one can obtain the flow on arbitrary Riemann surfaces, as described in the article on the Anosov flow.

== The model in three dimensions ==

The metric of the model on the half- space formula_57 is given by

formula_58

where &quot;s&quot; measures length along a possibly curved line.
The &quot;straight lines&quot; in the hyperbolic space (geodesics for this metric tensor, i.e. curves which minimize the distance) are represented in this model by circular arcs normal to the &quot;z = 0&quot;-plane (half-circles whose origin is on the &quot;z = 0&quot;-plane) and straight vertical rays normal to the &quot;z = 0&quot;-plane.

The &quot;distance&quot; between two points formula_59 and formula_60 measured in this metric along such a geodesic is:

formula_61

== The model in &quot;n&quot; dimensions ==
This model can be generalized to model an formula_62 dimensional hyperbolic space by replacing the real number &quot;x&quot; by a vector in an &quot;n&quot; dimensional Euclidean vector space.

==History==
The area of present-day Ichinomiya has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The area takes its name from the Tamasaki Shrine, the &quot;Ichinomiya,&quot; or first shrine of Kazusa Province. During the Sengoku period, the Satomi clan, the virtually independent rulers of the Bōsō Peninsula, established a castle at Ichinomiya. The area was devastated by the 1703 Genroku earthquake, during which a tsunami extended 1.5 kilometers inland from the coast. During the Edo period, a 13,000 &quot;koku&quot; feudal domain called Ichinomiya Domain ruled the area. After the start of the Meiji period, the area rapidly developed as a summer health resort, with many noted politicians, military figures, artists and writers establishing summer residences. Ichinomiya Town was created within Chōsei District with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Ichinomiya merged with the neighboring village of Torami on November 3, 1953.

<doc id="461944" wikidata="Q931026" url="?curid=461944" title="Cornovii (Midlands)">
<text>The Cornovīī (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Cornowī&quot;) were a Celtic people of the Iron Age and Roman Britain, who lived principally in the modern English counties of Cheshire, Shropshire, north Staffordshire, north Herefordshire and eastern parts of the Welsh counties of Flintshire, Powys and Wrexham. Their capital in pre-Roman times was probably a hillfort on the Wrekin. Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century &quot;Geography&quot; names two of their towns: Deva Victrix (Chester) and Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter), which became their capital under Roman rule.

Their territory was bordered by the Brigantes to the North, the Corieltauvi to the East, the Dobunni to the South, and the Deceangli and Ordovices to the West.

The people who inhabited the very north of the British mainland (modern Caithness), and Cornwall were also known by the same name, but according to mainstream or academic opinion were quite separate and unrelated peoples. (see list of ancient Celtic peoples and tribes).

==Nomenclature==
The first mention of the tribe occurs in the works of Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D.:
*&quot;From these¹ toward the east are the Cornavi, among whom are the towns: Deva,² Legio XX Victrix 17*30 56°45, Viroconium³ 16*45 55°45.&quot; (Ptolemy Geographia II.ii)

The name may mean &quot;People of the Horn&quot;. Graham Webster in &quot;The Cornovii&quot; (1991) cites Anne Ross&#x27;s hypothesis that the tribal name(s) may be totemic cult-names referring to a &quot;horned god&quot; cult followed by the tribe(s) and although there is no direct evidence of this, Webster points out that it is interesting that at Abbot&#x27;s Bromley the &quot;Horn Dance&quot; which he believes survived from pagan ritual (something questioned by other folklorists)—Abbot&#x27;s Bromley being only 35 miles (55 km) north east of the old tribal centre at Wroxeter (Virconium Cornoviorum). In addition, Webster quotes Professor Charles Thomas as having made a &quot;good case&quot; for such totemic ethnonyms in Scotland.

==Archaeological evidence==
Webster (1991) states that the Cornovii produced little in the way of identifiable ceramic wares. However, recent research at Poulton, Cheshire, has found large amounts (10 kg; 22 lb) of very coarse pottery (VCP), or briquetage. Such pottery is associated with the production, storage and transport of salt. Their sites are identified by construction details of their hillforts and metalwork artefacts. The Cornovii built numerous hill forts, including Titterstone Clee near Bitterley. Old Oswestry hill fort is also thought to have been inhabited by the Cornovii. One of these hill forts is probably that referred to by the historian Tacitus as the last refuge of the resistance led by Caratacus in 50 AD.

===The tomb of Vedica, a Cornovian woman===
The tombstone of a thirty-year-old woman of the Cornovii called Vedica was found at Ilkley in Yorkshire outside known Cornovii territory.

:DIS MANIBVS VEDIC [...] RICONIS FILIA ANNORVM XXX C CORNOVIA H S E
:&quot;To the spirits of the departed and to Vedica,¹ thirty years old, daughter of Virico² of the Cornovii;³ she lies here.&quot;

This is the only epigraphic evidence of civilian occupation at Ilkley (Roman Verbeia). Vedica may possibly have been the daughter of a chieftain &quot;Viroco&quot; of the Cornovii, who was killed during the western expansion of early 47 AD commanded by Publius Ostorius Scapula.

==Pre-Roman history==
Prior to the Roman invasion of Cornovian territory in 47 AD the most significant Cornovian hillforts known were those at Titterstone Clee near Bitterley, being the only one excavated to date, Chesterton Walls near Romsley and Bury Walls near Weston-under-Redcastle. Other hillforts of Iron Age Cornovii include the Wrekin hillfort near Wellington, Caynham Camp near Poughnhill and Old Oswestry. All of these camps are in the county of Shropshire but there was another significant settlement at the Breiddin hillfort in Powys.

Some suggest that a lack of metal and fine pottery finds may be indicative that the Cornovii were not a particularly wealthy or sophisticated British tribe and that they depended mostly on a pastoral economy even though some cultivation of cereal crops appears to have occurred in the river valley areas. However, archaeological evidence from the lowland site at Poulton has shown extensive evidence of metal working and ceramics. In particular, a fine example of the ritual deposition of an iron adze in the ditch of a round house, suggests a significant disposable wealth. These aforesaid lowland areas seem to have been populated by rural peasants who were obliged to pay tribute in cattle and grain to the local chieftains resident in the hillforts.

==Roman period==

The tribal civitas capital was Viroconium Cornoviorum (or simply &quot;Viroconium&quot;), the fourth largest town in Roman Britain. It started life as a legionary fortress in the mid-1st century, possibly garrisoned by the XIV Legion then the XX Legion. The main section of Watling Street runs from Dubrium (Dover) to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The place-name itself is suggestive of the Wrekin hillfort, overlooking the site from the east. The Cornovii seem to have had many hillforts, the largest and most populous being that at the Wrekin near the site of the Romano-British tribal capital.

The eventual size of Viroconium is inconsistent with the estimated population size, taken from the number of known pre-Roman settlements in the area; the archaeological evidence suggests a sparsely populated region. Perhaps the majority of the population lived in timber hut-dwellings without stone foundations, making it more difficult to find archaeological trace. There are, however, impressive standing Roman ruins from Viroconium just outside the modern day village of Wroxeter.

By the time the city had become fully established as a civitas capital, Viroconium had seen great expansion, with all the usual trappings of a classical Roman settlement including the forum basilica, shops and, of course, the baths. Both the massive structural remains of the baths and exercise yard found during archaeological excavations and subsequent research indicate that Viroconium&#x27;s most prosperous era was between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and demonstrate the success of this regional economic centre. Nevertheless, it appears that by the 4th century the area was already starting to decline.

Viroconium Cornoviorum and Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) seem to be the only major Roman settlements in Britain that, subsequently, did not grow into larger towns or cities in the post-Roman period. This may have been due to the foundation of Shrewsbury (probably in the 9th century) nearby, which was more easily defended, although the village of Wroxeter still continued to grow.

Owing to little development in the Wroxeter area, much of the Roman material has survived reasonably intact compared to other parts of Britain. This has led to the town becoming a favourite among archaeologists and students of Roman Britain.

===Cohors Primae Cornoviorum===

The Cohors Primae Cornoviorum was the only recorded native British unit known to have served in Britannia. The I Cohort of Cornovii were recruited from the tribe itself, thus bearing the name &quot;Cornoviorum&quot;, i.e. &quot;of the Cornovii&quot;. The strength of this military unit is unknown. The cohort was an infantry unit and is likely to have numbered only 500. The units formed the late-4th-century garrison of Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne) at the eastern terminus of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. This is recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum.

===Posting stations, settlements and military stations===

*Bovium Name could refer to minor settlement near (Tilston, Cheshire) – Named in the Antonine Itinerary. Other candidate for Bovium is the site of the large potteries and tile factory of Legio XX Valeria, at Holt across the river Dee from Farndon, 7 miles south of Chester, in Wales. 
*Wilderspool (near Warrington, Cheshire) – Minor settlement on the south bank of the River Dean near its confluence with the Mersey.
*Heronbridge (Cheshire) – On the west bank of the River Dee immediately south of Chester.
*Ffridd (Clwyd) – Fort and substantial Roman constructions near the border with the Deceangli.
*Bravonium (Leintwardine, Herefordshire) – Small roadside town and important military complex on Watling Street West, S of Wroxeter in the Welsh Marches.
*Uxacona (Red Hill, near Oakengates, Shropshire) – Small settlement on Watling Street, east of Wroxeter.
*Pennocrucium (Water Eaton) – Small town and military complex on Watling Street, S of Penkridge.
*Letocetum (Wall, near Lichfield, South Staffordshire) – Small town and military complex S of Lichfield, near the crossing of the Watling and Icknield Streets. Evidently the centre of an administrative pagus, with a substantial public bath-house and a mansio.
*Knighton – It is possible this settlement was created when pre Offa&#x27;s Dyke earth mounds were built by the Romans.
*Rutunium (Harcourt Park, Shropshire) – A small settlement and posting station on the road north between the military bases at Wroxeter and Chester, at the crossing of the River Roden.
*Mediolanum (Whitchurch) (Shropshire) – Romano-British settlement, whose modern street plan suggests a small walled town.
*Salinae (Middlewich, Cheshire) – Salt-manufacturing town.
*Condate (Northwich, Cheshire) – Salt works probable.
*Levobrinta (Forden Gaer, Powys) – This military site possibly marked the SW border of the Cornovian canton.
*Chesterton (near Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire) – Small town built on the site of a possible earlier Neronian fort, on the road from Middlewich to Derby.
*Rocester (North Staffordshire) – Small town built on the site of an earlier Flavian fort on the Cornovian borders, with the Brigantes to the north and the Corieltauvi to the east.
*Malpas, Cheshire – Small settlement on the Whitchurch–Chester road.

==Post-Roman history==
After Roman occupation, the lands of the Cornovii became a centre of military and economic operations. Viroconium Cornoviorum became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain, where Legio XIV Gemina was garrisoned for some time. The Romans also exploited metals such as copper, lead and silver in the area. Some Romanised Cornovii are known to have served as Roman legionaries.

The 5th century saw continued town life in Viroconium but many of the buildings fell into disrepair. However, between 530 and 570 there was a substantial rebuilding programme in timber with most of the old basilica being demolished and replaced with new buildings. These probably included a very large two-storey timber-framed building and a number of storage buildings and houses. In all, 33 new buildings were constructed. The archaeologists responsible for the most recent excavations comment that &quot;their construction was carefully planned and executed... and &quot;were skillfully constructed to Roman measurements using a trained labour force&quot;. Who instigated this rebuilding program is not known, although it may have been a bishop. Some of the buildings were renewed three times and the community probably lasted about 75 years until for some reason many of the buildings were dismantled.

==Dark Age period==
After this period, and with the relentless expansion of Anglian power in the English Midlands, the Cornovian tribal area came under the rule of the Kingdom of Pengwern, although the tribe may have survived into this period as a distinctive polity. Following a period of military alliance with Mercian rulers, particularly King Penda, Pengwern was absorbed by neighbouring Mercia after 642 AD. The local Cornovian people may have continued to reside in the area, perhaps as the Wrekensaete, under Mercian rule.

The site of the Roman city of Viroconium Cornoviorum is known in Old Welsh as Caer Guricon. As Caer Guricon it may have served as capital of the Kingdom of Powys during the sub-Roman period until Anglo-Saxon pressures in the form of Mercian encroachment forced the British to relocate to Mathrafal castle sometime before 717 AD. Pengwern and Powys themselves may have been later divisions of the pre-Roman Cornovii tribal territory whose civitas was Viroconium Cornoviorum. With the passage of time the lesser Magonsæte sub-kingdom also emerged in this area during the period between Powys and Mercian rule.

Although not widely accepted by modern scholarship, John Morris&#x27;s theory deals with the hypothetical link between the Midlands Cornovii and later Cornwall. In &quot;The Age of Arthur&quot;, 1973, Morris discussed the Wroxeter dynasty of Constantine whose name is found, albeit indirectly, in a reference by Gildas to Constantine as &quot;tyrant whelp of the filthy lioness of Dumnonia&quot; i.e. the current areas of Cornwall, Devon and part of Somerset. According to this theory, the principal Cornovian families of Viroconium may have moved to Dumnonia, sometime around 430 AD.

Morris goes on to mention one Ducco, who is also known as Congar, (d. 473 AD) as a monk on the estate that he had also established there. Morris asserts that the latter name is that which is preserved in the modern name of Congresbury, Somerset, south of Bristol. The Cadbury-Congresbury fortification is the only major fortification in Wales and &quot;Dumnonia&quot; to have produced reasonable evidence for continuous occupation from the 3rd century to the sixth.

==Wanborough, Wiltshire==

In Roman times the settlement at Wanborough was known as Durocornovium and was a little north west of the current position, at a road junction mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary. Being the last &quot;vicus&quot; on Ermin Way before the scarp slope of the Marlborough Downs, Durocornovium was a site where horses were watered before the steep climb off the Oxfordshire plain. It is not obvious why this name was used as it is a long way from the territories of the two Cornovii tribes.

<text>The Dobunni were one of the Iron Age tribes living in the British Isles prior to the Roman conquest of Britain. There are seven known references to the tribe in Roman histories and inscriptions.

Various historians and archaeologists have examined the Dobunni, including Stephen J. Yeates in his book &quot;The Tribe of Witches&quot; (2008), where he suggests that the latter part of the name possibly derives from *&quot;bune&quot;, a cup or vessel, with a similar meaning to the later tribal name Hwicce; both being related to the recognisable cult of a Romano-British goddess. This view has been sharply criticised by several archaeologists. Archaeologist Miles Russell suggests that their original name may have been &quot;Bodunni&quot;, connecting this with the Celtic word &quot;*bouda&quot; meaning &quot;Victorious&quot;, in the sense of &quot;The Victorious Ones&quot;.

==Territory==

The tribe lived in central Britain in an area that today broadly coincides with the English counties of Bristol, Gloucestershire and the north of Somerset, although at times their territory may have extended into parts of what are now Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, and Warwickshire. Their capital acquired the Roman name of &quot;Corinium Dobunnorum&quot;, which is today known as Cirencester.

Their territory was bordered by the Cornovii and Corieltauvi to the North; the Catuvellauni to the East; the Atrebates and Belgae to the South; and the Silures and Ordovices to the West. Some of these suggestions are, however, speculative.

There is evidence for a cult associated with the tribe in the Romano-British period; the evidence being coterminous with the tribe&#x27;s territory. Sculpture has been found at Gloucester, Cirencester, Nettleton, Bath, Wellow, and Aldsworth.

==Iron Age period==
The Dobunni were a large group of farmers and craftspeople, living in small villages concentrated in fertile valleys. A major study of the Iron Age material was carried out by Tom Moore.

Remnants of several fortified camps, otherwise known as hillforts, thought to have been occupied by the Dobunni can be seen in the Bristol area at Maes Knoll, Clifton Down, Burwalls and Stokeleigh – all overlooking the Avon Gorge – and at Kingsweston Down and Blaise Castle.

In the late Iron Age period, southern Britain saw the development of sites generally referred to as &quot;oppida&quot; (towns). An example of such a site has been recognised for some time at Bagendon, near Cirencester. It has now been realised that the Bagendon site was not as important as first thought, as other extensive sites are now known to have existed at places such as Salmonsbury.

==Roman period==
Dio Cassius referred to the tribe as &quot;Bodunni&quot;, probably a misspelling of the Dobunni. Tributary to the Catuvellauni, they capitulated to the invading Romans when Caratacus and Togodumnus withdrew.

Unlike the Silures, their neighbours in what later became southeast Wales, they were not a warlike people and submitted to the Romans even before they reached their lands. Afterwards they readily adopted the Romano-British lifestyle.

Even though the Dobunni were incorporated into the Roman Empire in AD 43, their territory was probably not formed into Roman political units until AD 96–98. The tribal territory was divided into a &quot;civitas&quot; centred on Cirencester, and the &quot;Colonia&quot; at Gloucester. The &quot;Colonia&quot; was established during the reign of the emperor Nerva (AD 96–98).

At the beginning of the 4th century, Britain was reorganised into, initially, four and then five provinces. The Dobunnic territory lay in the province of Britannia Prima, as described in an inscription found at the base of a Jupiter column. The area remained a Roman &quot;civitas&quot; until approximately 409.

The Dobunnic territory contained two large towns (Corinium Dobunnorum now Cirencester, and Colonia Nerviana Glevum now Gloucester). Besides this there were numerous smaller towns, and many rich villas.

Stephen Yeates asserts that a study of the religion of the Dobunni has shown that there was a focus on the worship of the natural world. It is possible to identify deities associated with the landscape, for example *Cuda, a mother goddess associated with the Cotswold Hills and its rivers and springs, and Sulis Minerva at Bath. Other cults were defined by social action, such as mining, for example at Lydney Park, and hunting, for example at Pagan&#x27;s Hill near Chew Stoke.

==Sub-Roman period==
After the collapse of the Roman provincial government, the core of this area retained its territorial identity until the Battle of Deorham in 577 (regarded by some as a dubious event), when the Saxons made advances as far as the River Severn. These gains were reversed 50 years later when Penda of Mercia fought the West Saxons at the Battle of Cirencester, and the area came under the influence of Mercia as the sub-kingdom of the Hwicce. It has been suggested that the area retained a distinct identity as a Christian sub-kingdom, instead of being simply absorbed into pagan Mercia, as a reward for an alliance against the West Saxons; and that this is evidence of a cultural continuity between the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Dobunni and the kingdom of Hwicce.

==Coinage==

The Dobunni were one of the tribes believed to have issued coins before Roman arrival and the introduction and adoption of Roman currency. Numismatic evidence suggests that the Dobunni kings subdivided their land between a north and south zone, sometimes becoming unified under a single ruler.

A repeated theme of coins ascribed to the Dobunni is a branched emblem appearing on the obverse. The symbol&#x27;s significance and origins are unclear although corn, ferns and a derivative of the wreath on the British Q stater have all been suggested.

<text>The Corieltauvi (also the Coritani, and the Corieltavi) were a Celtic tribe living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a &quot;civitas&quot; of Roman Britain. Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands. They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east. Their capital was called &quot;Ratae Corieltauvorum&quot;, known today as Leicester.

==Late Iron Age==
The Corieltauvi were a largely agricultural people who had few strongly defended sites or signs of centralised government. They appear to have been a federation of smaller, self-governing tribal groups. From the beginning of the 1st century, they began to produce inscribed coins: almost all featured two names, and one series had three, suggesting they had multiple rulers. The names on the earliest coins are so abbreviated as to be unidentifiable. Later coins feature the name of Volisios, apparently the paramount king of the region, together with names of three presumed sub-kings, Dumnocoveros, Dumnovellaunus and Cartivelios, in three series minted ca. 45 AD. The Corieltauvi had an important mint, and possibly a tribal centre, at Sleaford.

The discovery in 2000 of the Hallaton Treasure more than doubled the total number of Corieltauvian coins previously recorded. In 2014 26 gold and silver Corieltauvian coins were found in Reynard&#x27;s Kitchen Cave in Derbyshire. Coins attributed to the Corieltavi have been unearthed in Llangoed on Anglesey in Wales; fifteen gold staters were found by metal detectorists between July 2021 and March 2022.

==Roman times==
There is little evidence that the Corieltauvi offered resistance to Roman rule: Ratae was captured c. AD 44, and it may have had a Roman garrison.

The Fosse Way, a Roman road, passed through their territory.

==Name==
Their name appears as &quot;Coritani&quot; and &quot;Coritavi&quot; in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geography&quot;. However, the Ravenna Cosmography gives the name of their capital, in apparently corrupt form, as &quot;Rate Corion Eltavori&quot;, and an inscribed tile found in Churchover calls the administrative district &quot;Civitas Corieltauvorum&quot;, indicating that the true form should be &quot;Corieltauvi&quot;.

Manley Pope, author of an early English translation of the Welsh chronicle &quot;Brut y Brenhinedd&quot;, associated the Coritani of the Roman writers with the magical race called the Coraniaid in the medieval Welsh tale &quot;Lludd and Llevelys&quot;, however this is not supported by modern historical linguistics.

The name has been adopted by the athletics club, Leicester Coritanian A.C.

== The Barnetby bull rider ==
A detectorist found a small figure of a woman riding a bull in a field in Barnetby le Wold, Lincolnshire in 2016. The piece was handed over to the British Museum&#x27;s Portable Antiquities Scheme, and experts declared it to be of regional importance. Adam Staples, from Essex Coin Auctions, said it was thought to be the only recorded example of a figure riding a bull and probably dated from the early 1st century AD. The figure was auctioned for £7,800 on 9 November 2022.

<doc id="461953" wikidata="Q2941844" url="?curid=461953" title="Catherine Callbeck">
<text>Catherine Sophia Callbeck (born July 25, 1939) is a retired Canadian politician and the current and ninth Chancellor of the University of Prince Edward Island.

She was the 28th premier of Prince Edward Island from 1993 to 1996, the third female premier in Canadian history, and the first to win a general election (the first female premier, Rita Johnston of British Columbia, became premier after winning the party leadership but lost the subsequent election; the second, Nellie Cournoyea of the Northwest Territories, was elected premier by MLAs following a non-partisan consensus government election). She was subsequently a member of the Senate of Canada from 1997 until her retirement in 2014.

== Early life and career ==

Callbeck was born in Central Bedeque, Prince Edward Island, the daughter of Ralph R. Callbeck and Ruth Campbell. She received a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mount Allison University in 1960 and a Bachelor of Education degree from Dalhousie University in 1962. She took post-graduate courses in business administration from Syracuse University.

Callbeck was a business teacher in New Brunswick and Ontario before returning to the island to enter the family retail business.

== Early political career ==

A Liberal, Callbeck was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island in 1974. She was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister Responsible for Disabled Persons. She decided not to seek re-election in 1978 in order to work in the family business.

==Member of Parliament==

Callbeck returned to politics in 1988 when she was elected to the federal House of Commons as an MP for the Liberal Party of Canada. She was the MP for Malpeque during the 34th Canadian Parliament.

During her time in the House of Commons, Callbeck sat on numerous legislative committees, the Standing Committee on Energy, Mines and Resources and the Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Government Operations.

She held various Critic responsibilities in the national Liberal caucus of Liberal Party Leader John Turner (1988-1989) and Jean Chrétien (1990-1993). Callbeck was Critic for Finance (Financial Institutions), Critic for Consumer and Corporate Affairs (Co-operatives), Assistant Critic for Treasury Board (Privatization and Regulatory Affairs), and Critic for Energy, Mines and Resources.

== Premier of Prince Edward Island ==
In January 1993, Callbeck returned to provincial politics to successfully run for the leadership of the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party and was appointed Premier on 25 January. Under her leadership the Liberals won the 1993 provincial election, making her the first female leader of a political party in Canada to lead her party to victory in a general election while winning her own seat.

Callbeck was premier at the same time as the other three most important public offices in the province were also held by women: Elizabeth II was Sovereign in Prince Edward Island, Marion Reid was the Lieutenant Governor, and Patricia Mella was the Leader of the Official Opposition. In addition, the two most elected senior roles within the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island were held by women during Callbeck&#x27;s time in office: Nancy Guptill was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island and Elizabeth Hubley as Deputy Speaker.

Callbeck&#x27;s time in office was marked by significant progress. Spurred by new investments in food processing, manufacturing, aerospace and information technology, the rate of economic growth between 1993 and 1996 was the second highest in Canada. The number of people working in the province reached a record high. The unemployment rate dropped by a whopping seven per cent, the largest reduction of any province in Canada.

Coming into office, the Callbeck government pledged to bring the high budget deficit under control. Under her predecessor, the deficit had risen to an all-time high of $89 million. Through a combination of rising revenues due to the stronger economy, and what a national accounting firm called one of the most aggressive deficit-cutting strategies in the country, the Callbeck government brought in a surplus budget in 1995–96. it was the first budget surplus in a decade.

Reaching a surplus budget, however, did not come without a political cost. Public service salary rollbacks were widely opposed by public service unions - but no jobs were cut.

There were other accomplishments. A new agreement on electricity with New Brunswick resulted in lower electrical costs. A new waste management project put Prince Edward Island as a leader in Canada in reducing the amount of waste going into landfills. In keeping with Callbeck&#x27;s commitment to strengthen social programs, new investments were made in health and education.

There were significant reforms. Municipal amalgamation reduced duplication and overlap in the province&#x27;s larger municipalities. The number of government departments, agencies and crown corporations was reduced. A new electoral system replaced the previous 16 dual-member ridings with 27 single-member ridings. It was the first significant electoral reform in more than a century.

Callbeck&#x27;s time in office saw the beginning of construction of the Confederation Bridge linking Prince Edward Island to New Brunswick. When Callbeck came into office, the project was stalled because of an impasse between federal and provincial officials. She worked closely with the federal public works minister to resolve the issues, and the resulting constitutional change paved the way for the largest capital project in the history of the province.

===Resignation===
Callbeck resigned in October 1996 after only three and a half years as PEI&#x27;s premier. The Liberal party lost the provincial election in November 1996 as well as the next two general elections, only returning to power in the 2007 election.

==Senator==
On September 22, 1997, Callbeck was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien.

She sat on numerous Standing Committees and held membership on others. She initiated the motion that led to the Senate&#x27;s first study on post-secondary education in more than 20 years.

In January 2014, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau announced that all Liberal senators were removed from the national Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. The Senators referred to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they were no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. She left the senate at the mandatory retirement age of 75.

==Chancellor==
On September 29, 2018, Callbeck was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI) by the university&#x27;s Board of Governors. She is the ninth chancellor in the history of UPEI.

==Awards and recognition==
Callbeck was named a member of the Order of Canada in 2015 and a member of the Order of PEI in 2017. She holds honorary degrees from Mount Allison University and the University of Prince Edward Island.

<text>Megami Tensei, marketed internationally as Shin Megami Tensei (formerly &quot;Revelations&quot;), is a Japanese media franchise created by Aya Nishitani, Kouji &quot;Cozy&quot; Okada, Ginichiro Suzuki, and Kazunari Suzuki. Primarily developed and published by Atlus, and owned by Sega, the franchise consists of multiple subseries and covers multiple role-playing video game genres including tactical role-playing, action role-playing, and massively multiplayer online role-playing. The first two titles in the series were published by Namco (now Bandai Namco Entertainment), but have been almost always published by Atlus in Japan and North America since the release of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;. For Europe, Atlus publishes the games through third-party companies.

The series was originally based on &quot;Digital Devil Story&quot;, a science fiction novel series by Aya Nishitani. The series takes its name from the first book&#x27;s subtitle. Most &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; titles are stand-alone entries with their own stories and characters. Recurring elements include plot themes, a story shaped by the player&#x27;s choices, and the ability to fight using and often recruit creatures (demons, Personas) to aid the player in battle. Elements of philosophy, religion, occultism, and science fiction have all been incorporated into the series at different times.

While not maintaining as high a profile as series such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, it is highly popular in Japan and maintains a strong cult following in the West, finding critical and commercial success. The series has become well known for its artistic direction, challenging gameplay, and music, but raised controversy over its mature content, dark themes, and use of Christian religious imagery. Additional media include manga adaptations, anime films, and television series.

In Japan, some games in the series do not use the &quot;&quot;Megami Tensei&quot; title, such as the &quot;Persona&quot; sub-series. Many of the early games in the series were not localized due to potentially controversial content including religious references, and later due to their age. English localizations have used the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;&quot; moniker since the release of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne&quot; in 2003.

==Titles==
===Games===
The first installment in the franchise, &quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei&quot;, was released on September 11, 1987. The following entries have nearly always been unrelated to each other except in carrying over thematic and gameplay elements. The &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; games, and the later &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; titles form the core of the series, while other subseries such as &quot;Persona&quot;, &quot;Devil Children&quot;, and &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; are spin-offs marketed as part of the franchise. There are also stand-alone spin-off titles.

====Main series====
Two entries were released for the Famicom: &quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei&quot; in 1987, and &quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II&quot; in 1990. The two titles are unrelated to each other in terms of story, and each introduced the basic gameplay and story mechanics that would come to define the series. Two entries were released for the Super Famicom: &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; in 1992, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot; in 1994.

After a nine-year gap, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne&quot; was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2. Its &quot;Maniax Edition&quot; director&#x27;s cut was released in Japan and North America in 2004, and in Europe in 2005. The numeral was dropped for its North American release, and its title changed to &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer&#x27;s Call&quot; in Europe. The next entry, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2009 in Japan and 2010 in North America. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2013 in Japan and North America, and a year later in Europe as a digital-only release. Another game set in the same universe, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot;, was released for the 3DS in February 2016 in Japan. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei V&quot; was released on the Nintendo Switch in 2021. An enhanced version of the game titled &quot;Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&quot; was released in June 2024 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. 

In addition to the main series, there are &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; spin-off games. The first is &quot;Shin Megami Tensei If...&quot;, released in the same year and on the same system as &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;. The second, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nine&quot;, was released for the Xbox in 2002. Originally designed as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), it was later split into a dual single-player and multiplayer package, and the single-player version released first. The online version was delayed and eventually cancelled as the developers could not manage the required online capacities using Xbox Live. A true MMORPG, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Imagine&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows in 2007 in Japan, 2008 in North America, and 2009 in Europe. Western service was terminated in 2014 when Marvelous USA, the game&#x27;s then-handlers, shut down their PC Online game department. Its Japanese service ended in May 2016. A smartphone game, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation Dx2&quot;, was released in 2018.

====&quot;Persona&quot;====

The &quot;Persona&quot; series is the largest and most popular spin-off from the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series. The first entry in the series, &quot;Megami Ibunroku Persona&quot; (originally released overseas as &quot;&quot;), was released in 1996 in Japan and North America. The first &quot;Persona 2&quot; title, &quot;Innocent Sin&quot;, was released in 1999 in Japan. The second game, &quot;Eternal Punishment&quot;, was released in 2000 in Japan and North America. &quot;Persona 3&quot; was released in 2006 in Japan, 2007 in North America, and 2008 in Europe. Its sequel, &quot;Persona 4&quot;, was released in 2008 in Japan and North America, and in 2009 in Europe. A sixth entry in the series, &quot;Persona 5&quot;, was released in Japan on September 15, 2016, and was released in North America and Europe on April 4, 2017, to critical acclaim. In addition to the main &quot;Persona&quot; games are spin-offs, so far focused on &quot;Persona 3&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot;: the canon spin-offs &quot;Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth&quot;, two fighting games &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot; and its sequel &quot;Arena Ultimax&quot; as well as the crossover fighting game &quot;&quot;, and rhythm games &quot;Persona 4: Dancing All Night&quot;, &quot;Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight&quot;, and &quot;Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight&quot;. While &quot;Persona 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; used the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; moniker in the West, it was dropped for the &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot; duology and &quot;Persona 4 Golden&quot; as it would have made the titles too long to be practical.

====&quot;Devil Summoner&quot;====

The &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; subseries began in 1995 with the release of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers&quot; in 1997, which itself is followed by &quot;Soul Hackers 2&quot;, released in 2022. Two action role-playing prequels set in 1920s Tokyo were also developed, which revolve around demon summoner Raidou Kuzunoha: &quot;Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&quot; was released in 2006, and &quot;Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon&quot; was released in 2008.

====Other spin-offs====
Aside from &quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Devil Summoner&quot;, there are other spin-off series covering multiple genres. After the release of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, Atlus began focusing work on building spin-offs and subseries that would form part of the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise. Shortly after &quot;Nocturne&quot;″s release, a duology titled &quot;Digital Devil Saga&quot; (&quot;Digital Devil Saga: Avatar Tuner&quot; in Japan) was created based around similar systems to &quot;Nocturne&quot;, and was also intended as a more accessible gaming experience. Two tactical role-playing games have been developed by Atlus for the DS under the &quot;Devil Survivor&quot; moniker: the original &quot;Devil Survivor&quot; and &quot;Devil Survivor 2&quot;. Both have received expanded ports for the 3DS. Other subseries include &quot;Last Bible&quot;, a series aimed at a younger audience and using a pure fantasy setting; &quot;Devil Children&quot;, which was inspired by the popular &quot;Pokémon&quot; series; and &quot;Majin Tensei&quot;, a series of strategy games. Two notable stand-alone spin-offs are action spin-off &quot;Jack Bros.&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE&quot;, a crossover with Intelligent Systems&#x27; &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series.

===Related media===
Several titles in the franchise have received anime and manga adaptations: &quot;Persona 3&quot; received both a four-part theatrical adaptation (&quot;#1 Spring of Birth&quot;, &quot;#2 Midsummer Knight&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;#3 Falling Down&quot;, &quot;#4 Winter of Rebirth&quot;), and a spin-off series titled &quot;&quot;. &quot;Persona 4&quot; received two adaptations: &quot;Persona 4: The Animation&quot;, based on the original game, and &quot;Persona 4: The Golden Animation&quot;, based on its expanded PlayStation Vita port. A live-action television series based on the original &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; was broadcast between 1997 and 1998. &quot;Devil Survivor 2&quot; also received an anime adaptation of the same name, while the &quot;Devil Children&quot; series received two anime adaptations. Multiple &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; titles have received manga and CD drama adaptations. Action figures and merchandise related to &quot;Persona&quot; have also been produced.

==Common elements==
Despite most games in the series taking place in different continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions of it from the past. The &quot;Persona&quot; series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.

&quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot; is one of the notable early exceptions to the series&#x27; common setting, as it is set in a science fiction-styled future despite still including fantasy elements. The &quot;Last Bible&quot; series also shifted to a full fantasy setting. Two more recent notable departures were &quot;Strange Journey&quot;, which shifted the focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;, which included a medieval-stage society existing separately from a modern-day Tokyo. The &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; games take the form of modern-day detective stories as opposed to post-apocalyptic settings.

The series title translates as &quot;Reincarnation of the Goddess&quot;: this has carried over into the current &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series, which has been officially translated as &quot;True Goddess Metempsychosis&quot;. The word &quot;Metempsychosis&quot; refers to the cycle of reincarnation that ties into many &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; stories. The reborn goddess of the title has multiple meanings: it refers to a female character in each game that could be interpreted as the goddess, and is also representative of the drastic changes a location undergoes during a game. The concept of reincarnation was also included in narratives and gameplay mechanics to tie in with these themes. The series&#x27; overarching title has been truncated to &quot;MegaTen&quot; by series fans. Originating in Japan, the abbreviation has become a common term for the series among its fans. Its subseries &quot;Persona&quot; is named as &quot;Nǚshén Yìwénlù&quot; () in Chinese, originating from the Japan version of &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series used this term as subtitles in early spin-offs.

===Gameplay===

The gameplay in the series has become notable for its high difficulty, along with several mechanics that have endured between games. A key element present since the first &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; is the ability to recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle, alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together to create a more powerful demon. Equivalents to these systems appear in the later &quot;Persona&quot; titles. The game&#x27;s most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system, first introduced in &quot;Nocturne&quot;. The Press Turn System is a turn-based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies, where either party are rewarded an extra turn for striking an enemy&#x27;s weakness or landing critical hits, but can also lose turns if attacks miss or are blocked. A Moon Phase System or equivalent, in which phases of the moon or changes in the weather affected the behavior of enemies, is also featured in multiple games.

The layouts of the first two &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; games were noticeably different from later games: &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; used a 3D first-person perspective, while &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot; used a combination of first-person 3D displays for battle and top-down 2D displays for navigation. The change was suggested by staff members who did not want players getting lost in a large 3D environment. The 2D/first person viewpoint continued until &quot;Nocturne&quot;, which switched to a third-person perspective. This was done due to a condition similar to car sickness called &quot;3D sickness&quot; with first person shooters in Japan at the time: the developers wanted something for players to focus on. A first-person perspective was reintroduced in &quot;Strange Journey&quot;, and incorporated into &quot;IV&quot;″s battles along with navigable 3D environments.

===Plots and themes===
Each title focuses on the extraordinary invading the ordinary world, though the two main &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series focus on different things: &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed to survive in a world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while &quot;Persona&quot; focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. The protagonist is generally male within the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead&#x27;s gender is not out of the question, some staff feel that &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, goth, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.

The stories of the core &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; titles frequently include fighting against a tyrannical God. The method of story-telling in the series can involve traditional use of cutscenes and spoken dialogue (&quot;Persona&quot;, &quot;Digital Devil Saga&quot;), or a text-based minimalist approach that places emphasis on atmosphere (&quot;Nocturne&quot;). A tradition within the core &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series is to focus on a single playable character as opposed to a group. Alongside other recurring characters is Lucifer, the fallen angel who stands against God and is portrayed in multiple forms to represent his omnipotence. Since &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;, the series has used a morality-based decision system, where the player&#x27;s actions affect the outcome of the story. In &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;, the alignments were first defined as &quot;Law&quot; (the forces of God) and &quot;Chaos&quot; (the army of Lucifer). In future games, an additional &quot;Neutral&quot; route was included where the player could reject both sides. Selected games have been thematically or otherwise linked to a particular alignment. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, due to events prior to the story, focuses on the &quot;Law&quot; alignment. For &quot;Nocturne&quot;, all the characters were roughly aligned with &quot;Chaos&quot;, which was done both to bring variety to the series and allow the development team more creative freedom. &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot; is restricted to a &quot;Neutral&quot; alignment while still having multiple endings. The three-tiered alignment was used in &quot;Strange Journey&quot;, and continued into &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;.

==Development and history==
===Origins===
The &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series began life as a media expansion of the &quot;Digital Devil Story&quot; series, a trilogy of science-fantasy novels written by Aya Nishitani during the 1980s. The media expansion was handled by Nishitani and his publisher Tokuma Shoten. The game was developed at Atlus and published by Bandai Namco (then Namco). Although they wanted to incorporate as much of the original story as possible, the limited capabilities of the Famicom made this goal nearly impossible. The series&#x27; creators were Kouji Okada (credited as Cozy Okada in English), Ginichiro Suzuki, and Ginichiro&#x27;s son Kazunari. The game proved popular in Japan, and effectively launched the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise, with its more ambitious sequel following in 1990. During the development of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, which was driven by the concept of a Super Famicom game with the company&#x27;s brand on it, the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then-current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content. Despite this attitude, the staff considered &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; to be a remake of &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;. In many of these earlier games, staff members at Atlus had cameos.

The majority of the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series is developed by Atlus&#x27; R&amp;D Department 1. Other developers have been involved with the series: these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer (&quot;Last Bible&quot; series), Lancarse (&quot;Strange Journey&quot;), CAVE (&quot;Imagine&quot;) and Nex Entertainment (&quot;Nine&quot;), and Arc System Works (&quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot;). Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada, but when he departed to form his own company Gaia, Kazuma Kaneko became the series&#x27; creative director. There are two main writers in the franchise: Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito. Ito first worked on &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;, joining the team after development to write the script, along with working with the script and being part of the debug team. Isogai&#x27;s first work for the series was the script for &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;. The next entry &quot;If...&quot; was also written by Ito, and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games, instead being set within a cloistered school environment. His final work for the series was the first &quot;Devil Summoner&quot;. Isogai also worked on &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot; and &quot;If...&quot;, and later worked on multiple &quot;Devil Summoner&quot; games, &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Strange Journey&quot;. The music for the first five main &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. For &quot;Nocturne&quot;, Shoji Meguro, who had done work on earlier spin-off titles, was brought in. He later became well known for his work on the &quot;Persona&quot; titles.

===Art design===

The &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; art styles have been defined by two different artists: Kazuma Kaneko and Shigenori Soejima. Kaneko had a long history with the series, having done some work on the original &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; titles. His first prominent work for the series was on &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot;, who worked on both the sprite art and promotional artwork for the game&#x27;s characters and demons. He was also responsible for suggesting many of the game&#x27;s darker features, defining the series&#x27; eventual identity. Before designing each demon, Kaneko looks up his chosen subject to get their mythological background, and uses that in their design. Many of Kaneko&#x27;s demon designs were influenced by both creatures and deities from world mythology, and monsters from popular culture like Godzilla. Alongside working on &quot;Shin Megami Tensei II&quot;, &quot;If...&quot; and &quot;Nocturne&quot;, he also did character designs for the first three &quot;Persona&quot; games. Kaneko&#x27;s style has been described as &quot;cold [and] stoic&quot;, evolving into that state over time to keep the artwork as close as possible to the in-game render. He states that he mainly does line drawings for the artwork. He starts his artwork with pencil, and then scans them onto a computer so other artists can work on them digitally.

Soejima&#x27;s first work for the series was as part of the digital coloring team for the first &quot;Devil Summoner&quot;. He later had minor roles in artwork and character design in the first &quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Soul Hackers&quot;. He later did the secondary characters for the &quot;Persona 2&quot; duology, and was also part of the team checking over the PlayStation ports of the first three &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; games, as well as minor work on &quot;Nocturne&quot;. Soejima was chosen as the lead designer for &quot;Persona 3&quot; by Kaneko, as Kaneko wanted the younger staff members to gain experience. &quot;Persona 3&quot; proved challenging for Soejima as he needed to refine his drawing style and take the expectations of series fans into account. He would go on to design for &quot;Persona 3/FES&quot; and &quot;Portable&quot;, &quot;Persona 4&quot;, and &quot;Persona 5&quot;. Soejima&#x27;s drawing style is recognized as being lighter-toned than Kaneko&#x27;s work on the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; games.

Other designers have also worked on the series. For &quot;Nine&quot;, the developers wanted to have a new style to suit the game&#x27;s original vision, so the characters were designed by animator Yasuomi Umetsu. the new main designer for the series is Masayuki Doi, who had made a name for himself with the &quot;Trauma Center&quot; series; and designed the main characters for &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;. Inspired in his work by Kaneko&#x27;s designs, he created the main characters&#x27; clothing to be a blend of Japanese and western fashions while incorporating design elements from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. After the success of IV, he went on to become the main demon designer for &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei V&quot;, while still retaining his job as lead character designer. For the &quot;Devil Survivor&quot; games, Atlus were aiming to appeal to a wider audience and reinvigorate the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise, hiring Suzuhito Yasuda as character designer for this purpose. Some monsters in the second &quot;Devil Survivor&quot; were designed by manga artist Mohiro Kitoh.

===Localization===
For a long time, the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise was not exported to western territories despite there being a recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo&#x27;s strict content guidelines for overseas releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age, which would have put them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America&#x27;s then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was &quot;Jack Bros.&quot;; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first &quot;Persona&quot; game. This was done to give Atlus&#x27; North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete with the likes of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Suikoden&quot; and &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of &quot;Persona&quot; to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas, the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. This, and other changes were fixed in the re-release on the PlayStation Portable. The first &quot;Persona 2&quot; title, &quot;Innocent Sin&quot;, needed to be passed over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title, &quot;Eternal Punishment&quot;.

&quot;Nocturne&quot; was the first release in the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series to be released overseas. After the release of &quot;Nocturne&quot;, Atlus&#x27; overseas branches decided to add the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; moniker to future releases within the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise to help market the games. Despite many of the original games not bearing the moniker, it ultimately worked in Atlus&#x27; favor as, regardless of title differences, the games chosen for localization were all part of the larger &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; franchise, and using the core &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; moniker kept all the titles under a single banner. Before this decision was made, the series was given the localized title &quot;Revelations&quot;, used for the first &quot;Persona&quot; and the first &quot;Last Bible&quot;. Later, changes to titles were made to make them less unwieldy, such as with &quot;Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&quot;. Called &quot;Raidō Kuzunoha vs. The Super-Powered Army&quot; in Japan, the title was altered as it sounded &quot;goofy&quot; in English. By the time &quot;Strange Journey&quot; was in development, the franchise had a strong presence overseas, so the team created &quot;Strange Journey&quot; with localization in mind: the two aspects actively linked with this were the game&#x27;s setting in Antarctica as opposed to modern-day Japan, and the fact that it was not given a numeral. Starting with &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;, the company decided to actively promote the franchise overseas to North America, Europe and mainland Asia. After 2016, due to Atlus USA&#x27;s merger with Sega of America, Sega took over North American publishing duties, although the Atlus brand remained intact.

In general, Atlus publishes &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; games in Japan and North America, but as they lack a European branch, they publish titles in the region through third-party companies such as Ghostlight and NIS America. Their latest partnership, after their deal with NIS America ended with the publication of &quot;Odin Sphere Leifthrasir&quot;, was with European publishing firm Deep Silver to publish multiple titles in the region, including &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot; and &quot;Persona 5&quot;. Atlus has occasionally published titles digitally in Europe.

==Reception==
Prior to its popularity in the west, the game was a major franchise in Japan, having sold over four million copies by 2003. Excluding the &quot;Persona&quot; series, the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series sold approximately 7.2 million copies by October 2017. By October 2018, the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; main series has shifted approximately 12.4 million packaged and digital copies (including DL of free-to-play titles) of games worldwide. In addition, the &quot;Persona&quot; sub-series sold 9.3million copies, bringing total franchise numbers to 21.7million units (including DL of free-to-play titles) by 2018. Excluding the &quot;Persona&quot; series, the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series had supplied 19.2 million copies by 2023, including free-to-play titles. , the &quot;Persona&quot; series has sold 22.6 million units worldwide. Based on a December 16, 2023 survey conducted by &quot;Nikkei Entertainment&quot;, the combined fanbase of the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; series within Japan has an average age of 32 years, and a male-to-female ratio that skews 40:60.

Japanese website 4Gamer.net referred to the series as one of Japan&#x27;s biggest role-playing franchises. UGO Networks writer K. Thor Jensen cited the first &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; game as the first successful use of cyberpunk aesthetics in video games, saying that the series&#x27; mix of science fiction elements and the occult &quot;create a truly unique fictional cyberpunk world&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; has noted that Atlus always mixes &quot;familiar gameplay&quot; with surprising settings when creating games for the series, citing &quot;Persona&quot;, with its &quot;modern-day horror stories&quot; and &quot;teams of Japanese high-school kids&quot;, as the perfect example. The editor also added that &quot;Strange Journey&quot; followed a similar system, calling it a &quot;science-fiction makeover&quot; of the series. In an article about the interaction of Japanese and Western gaming culture, 1UP.com mentioned the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; subseries alongside Nippon Ichi Software&#x27;s &quot;Disgaea&quot; series. Kurt Kalata wrote: &quot;[They] may not be big sellers, but they&#x27;ve garnered underground success and attracted thousands of obsessed fans.&quot; GameSpot writer Andrew Vestal referred to the series as the third biggest RPG series in Japan after &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; Matt Coleman mentioned &quot;Nocturne&quot; in the article &quot;A History of Console RPGs&quot;, referring to its content as &quot;challenging stuff for a genre that used to be all about princess saving and evil cleansing&quot;.

&quot;Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II&quot; and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; both appeared on &quot;Famitsu&quot; 2006 &quot;Top 100 Favorite Games of All Time&quot; audience poll at No. 58 and No. 59, respectively. RPGFan&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 RPGs of the Past Decade&quot; list was topped by the two &quot;Digital Devil Saga&quot; games, followed by &quot;Persona 3&quot; in second place, while &quot;Persona 4&quot; ranked fourth place. Kalata, writing for Gamasutra, referred to &quot;Nocturne&quot; as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. GameTrailers cited the Press Turn system as one of the best JRPG battle systems in existence, with particular reference to the version used in &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;.

Alongside its critical acclaim, the series has garnered controversy both in Japan and overseas. Amongst the material cited are its demon negotiation mechanic, depictions of suicide and cannibalism, religious criticism, its use and mixture of Christian and occult imagery, political references, depictions of homosexuality, and its sometimes-strange demon designs. Specific examples have been cited by western journalists. The original release of &quot;Persona&quot; caused concern due to the title&#x27;s religious implications. 1UP.com&#x27;s 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Persona 3&quot; was given the &quot;Most controversial game that created no controversy&quot; award: the writers said &quot;Rockstar&#x27;s Hot Coffee sex scandal and &quot;Bully&quot;″s boy-on-boy kissing&#x27;s got nothing on this PS2 role-player&#x27;s suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating.&quot; GamesRadar included the series on its list of &quot;Controversies Waiting to Happen&quot;, saying that the lack of public outcry was due to its niche status when compared to other series with similar content. Writing for 1UP.com in a later article, Kalata traced this use of controversial content back to the &quot;Digital Devil Story&quot; novels, which depicted violence and rape committed by demons, and said that &quot;Such violence is not particularly rare in the land of Japanese animation, but it became even more disturbing in &quot;Megami Tensei II&quot;. A Chinese game regulation document in 2021 cited &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot; as an example of unsuitable depictions of religious figures.

In a review of the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Josh Bycer said &quot;the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series is very similar to &quot;Pokémon&quot;, in the use of an ever changing party roster. However &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; did come first and is more mature, both in terms of design and storytelling.&quot;

<text>&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; (originally &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;) is a song by the American folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel, written by Paul Simon. The duo&#x27;s studio audition of the song led to a record deal with Columbia Records, and the original acoustic version was recorded in March 1964 at Columbia&#x27;s 7th Avenue Recording Studios in New York City for their debut album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, released that October to disappointing sales. An overdubbed electric remix was released the following year and went to number one on the Billboard singles chart.

In 1965, the song began to attract airplay at radio stations in Boston and throughout Florida. The growing airplay led Tom Wilson, the song&#x27;s producer, to remix the track, overdubbing electric instruments and drums. This remixed version was released as a single in September 1965. Simon &amp; Garfunkel were not informed of the song&#x27;s remix until after its release. The remix hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week ending January 1, 1966, leading the duo to reunite and hastily record their second album, which Columbia titled &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; in an attempt to capitalize on the song&#x27;s success. The remixed single version of the song was included on this follow-up album. Later, it was featured in the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot; and was included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. It was additionally released on the &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; EP in 1968, along with three other songs from the film: &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, &quot;April Come She Will&quot;, and &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot;.

&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; was a top-ten hit in multiple countries worldwide, among them Australia, Austria, West Germany, Japan and the Netherlands. Since its release, the song was included in later compilations, beginning with the 1972 compilation album &quot;Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

==Background==
===Origin and original recording===
Simon and Garfunkel had become interested in folk music and the growing counterculture movement separately in the early 1960s. Having performed together previously under the name Tom and Jerry in the late 1950s, their partnership had dissolved by the time they began attending college. In 1963, they regrouped and began performing Simon&#x27;s original compositions locally in Queens. They billed themselves &quot;Kane &amp; Garr&quot;, after old recording pseudonyms, and signed up for Gerde&#x27;s Folk City, a Greenwich Village club that hosted Monday night performances. In September 1963, the duo&#x27;s performances caught the attention of Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson, a young African-American jazz musician who was also helping to guide Bob Dylan&#x27;s transition from folk to rock. Simon convinced Wilson to let him and his partner have a studio audition; their performance of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; got the duo signed to Columbia.

The song&#x27;s origin and basis are unclear, with some thinking that the song commented on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as the song was recorded three months after the assassination, although Simon &amp; Garfunkel had performed the song live as Kane &amp; Garr two months before the assassination. Simon wrote &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; when he was 21 years old, later explaining that the song was written in his bathroom, where he turned off the lights to better concentrate. &quot;The main thing about playing the guitar, though, was that I was able to sit by myself and play and dream. And I was always happy doing that. I used to go off in the bathroom, because the bathroom had tiles, so it was a slight echo chamber. I&#x27;d turn on the faucet so that water would run (I like that sound, it&#x27;s very soothing to me) and I&#x27;d play. In the dark. &#x27;Hello darkness, my old friend / I&#x27;ve come to talk with you again.&#x27;&quot; According to Garfunkel, the song was first developed in November 1963, but Simon took three months to perfect the lyrics, which were entirely written on February 19, 1964. Garfunkel, introducing the song at a live performance (with Simon) in Haarlem (Netherlands), in June 1966, summed up the song&#x27;s meaning as &quot;the inability of people to communicate with each other, and not particularly internationally but especially emotionally, so that what you see around you is people who are unable to love each other.&quot;

Garfunkel&#x27;s college roommate, Sandy Greenberg, wrote in his memoir that the song reflected the strong bond of friendship between Simon and Garfunkel, who had adopted the epithet &quot;Darkness&quot; to empathise with Greenberg&#x27;s sudden-onset blindness.

To promote the release of their debut album, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;, released on October 19, 1964, the duo performed again at Folk City, as well as two shows at the Gaslight Café, which went over poorly. Dave Van Ronk, a folk singer, was at the performances, and noted that several in the audience regarded their music as a joke. Sounds of Silence&#x27; actually became a running joke: for a while there, it was only necessary to start singing &#x27;Hello darkness, my old friend ... &#x27; and everybody would crack up.&quot; &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 AM&quot; sold only 3,000 copies upon its October release, and its dismal sales led Simon to move to London. While there, he recorded a solo album, &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot; (1965), which features a rendition of the song, titled &quot;The &quot;Sound&quot; of Silence&quot; (instead of &quot;The &quot;Sounds&quot; of Silence&quot;, as on &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot;).

The original recording of the song is in D♯ minor, using the chords D♯m, C♯, B and F♯. Simon plays a guitar with a capo on the sixth fret, using the shapes for Am, G, F and C chords. He provides the lower vocals for harmony while Garfunkel sings the melody. The vocal span goes from C♯3 to F♯4 in the song.

===Remix===

&quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.&quot; had been a commercial failure before producer Tom Wilson was alerted that radio stations had begun to play &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; in spring 1965. A late-night disc jockey at WBZ in Boston began to spin &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;, where it found a college student audience. Those at Harvard and Tufts University responded well, and the song made its way down the east coast pretty much &quot;overnight&quot;, &quot;all the way to Cocoa Beach, Florida, where it caught the students coming down for spring break.&quot; A promotional executive for Columbia went to give away free albums of new artists, and beach-goers were interested only in the artists behind &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. He phoned the home office in New York, alerting them of its appeal. An alternate version of the story states that Wilson attended Columbia&#x27;s July 1965 convention in Miami, where the head of the local sales branch raved about the song&#x27;s airplay.

Folk rock was beginning to make waves on pop radio, with songs such as the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; charting high. Wilson listened to the song several times, thinking it too soft for a wide release. He had strong feelings about editing the song with explicit rock overtones. As stated by Geoffrey Himes, &quot;If Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson hadn&#x27;t taken the initiative, without the singers&#x27; knowledge, to dub a rock rhythm section over their folk rendition, the song never would have become a cultural touchstone—a generation&#x27;s shorthand for alienation.&quot; Wilson had also experimented the previous December with overdubbing an electric band over acoustic tracks by Bob Dylan; these recordings were never officially released, as Dylan and Wilson opted to record new tracks with a live band for what would become the album &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;.

On June 15, 1965, following sessions for Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, Wilson retained guitarist Al Gorgoni and drummer Bobby Gregg from the Dylan sessions, adding guitarist Vinnie Bell and bassist Bob Bushnell. The tempo on the original recording was uneven, making it difficult for the musicians to keep the song in time. Engineer Roy Halee employed a heavy echo on the remix, which was a common trait of the Byrds&#x27; hits. The single was first provided to college FM rock stations, and a commercial single release followed on September 13, 1965. The lack of consultation with Simon and Garfunkel on the remix was because, although the duo was still contracted to Columbia Records, the duo was no longer a &quot;working entity&quot;. It was not unusual for producers to add instruments or vocals to previous releases and re-release them as new products.

In the fall of 1965, Simon was in Denmark, performing at small clubs, and picked up a copy of &quot;Billboard&quot;, as he had routinely done for several years. Upon seeing &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, he bought a copy of &quot;Cashbox&quot; and saw the same thing. Several days later, Garfunkel excitedly called Simon to inform him of the single&#x27;s growing success. A copy of the 7-inch single arrived in the mail the next day, and according to friend Al Stewart, &quot;Paul was &quot;horrified&quot; when he first heard it ... [when the] rhythm section slowed down at one point so that Paul and Artie&#x27;s voices could catch up.&quot; Garfunkel was far less concerned about the remix, feeling conditioned to the process of trying to create a hit single: &quot;It&#x27;s interesting, I suppose it might do something, It might sell,&quot; he told Wilson.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of the song are written in five stanzas of seven lines each. Each stanza begins with a couplet describing the setting of the scene, followed by a couplet driving the action forward and another couplet expressing the climactic thought of the verse, and closes with a one-line refrain referring to &quot;the sound of silence&quot;. This structure is supported by a melodic contour, where the first and second lines are paired with the arpeggio A-C-E-D and a repeat a step lower, respectively. The arpeggio is then stretched to become C-E-G-A-G and repeated twice in the second couplet. For the last three lines, the contour then leaps from C to the higher A, rises to the higher C, and then falls back to the A before singing the stretched arpeggio in reverse and finally retreating to the lower A. The progress of the lyrics through its five stanzas places the singer into an incrementally increasing tension with an increasingly ambiguous &quot;sound of silence&quot;. The irony of using the word &quot;sound&quot; to describe silence in the title lyrics suggests a paradoxical symbolism being used by the singer, which the lyrics of the fourth stanza eventually identifies as &quot;silence like a cancer grows&quot;. The &quot;sound of silence&quot; is symbolically taken also to denote the cultural alienation associated with much of the 1960s. 

The first stanza presents the singer as taking some relative solace in the peacefulness he associates with &quot;darkness&quot; which is submerged &quot;within&quot; the ambiguous sound of silence. The second stanza has the effect of breaking into the silence with &quot;the flash of a neon light&quot; which leaves the singer &quot;touched&quot; by the enduring ambiguity of the sound of silence. In the third stanza, a &quot;naked light&quot; emerges as a vision of 10,000 people all caught within their own solitude and alienation without any one of them daring to &quot;disturb&quot; the recurring sound of silence.

In the fourth stanza, the singer proclaims in a declarative voice that &quot;silence like a cancer grows,&quot; though his words &quot;like silent raindrops fell&quot; without ever being heard against the by now cancerous sound of silence. The fifth stanza appears to culminate with the urgency raised by the declarative voice in the fourth stanza through the apparent triumph of a false &quot;neon god&quot;. The false neon god is only challenged when a &quot;sign flashed out its warning&quot; that only the words of the indigent written on &quot;subway walls and tenement halls&quot; could still &quot;whisper&quot; their truth against the recurring and ambiguous form of &quot;the sound of silence&quot;. The song has no lyrical bridge or change of key, and was written without any lyrical intro or outro.

===Charts history===
&quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; first broke in Boston, where it became one of the top-selling singles in early November 1965; it spread to Miami and Washington, D.C. two weeks later, reaching number one in Boston and debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Throughout the month of January 1966 &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; had a one-on-one battle with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; for the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; was number one for the weeks of January 1 and 22 and number two for the intervening two weeks. &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; held the top spot for the weeks of January 8, 15, and 29, and it was number two for the two weeks that &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; was number one. Overall, &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; spent 14 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

In the wake of the song&#x27;s success, Simon promptly returned to the United States to record a new Simon &amp; Garfunkel album at Columbia&#x27;s request. He later described his experiences learning the song went to number one, a story he repeated in numerous interviews:

For his part, Garfunkel had a different memory of the song&#x27;s success:

A cover by Peaches &amp; Herb reached #88 in Canada, July 24, 1971.

==Disturbed version==
51 years after its original release, a cover version of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; was released by American heavy metal band Disturbed on December 7, 2015. A music video was also released. Their cover hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hard Rock Digital Songs and Mainstream Rock charts, and is their highest-charting song on the Hot 100, peaking at number 42. It is also their highest-charting single in Australia, peaking at number four. David Draiman sings it in the key of F♯m. His vocal span goes from F#2 to A4 in scientific pitch notation.

In April 2016, Paul Simon endorsed the cover. Additionally, on April 1, Simon sent Draiman an email praising Disturbed&#x27;s performance of the rendition on American talk show &quot;Conan&quot;. Simon wrote, &quot;Really powerful performance on &quot;Conan&quot; the other day. First time I&#x27;d seen you do it live. Nice. Thanks.&quot; Draiman responded, &quot;Mr. Simon, I am honored beyond words. We only hoped to pay homage and honor to the brilliance of one of the greatest songwriters of all time. Your compliment means the world to me/us and we are eternally grateful.&quot; As of September 2017, the single had sold over 1.5 million digital downloads and had been streamed over 54 million times, estimated Nielsen Music. As of September 2024, the music video has over 1 billion views on YouTube, while the live performance on &quot;Conan&quot; has over 154 million, making it the most watched YouTube video from the show.

==Paul Simon solo versions==
Paul Simon released a solo acoustic version of &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; in the spring of 1974. His version reached No. 84 in Canada and No. 97 on the US &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cash Box Top 100 1/29/66&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a minor Adult Contemporary hit (US No. 50, Canada No. 42).

Simon had previously recorded a solo acoustic version of the song on his debut solo album &quot;The Paul Simon Songbook&quot;, released in 1965 in the UK only, and not widely available in the U.S. until its release as part of a retrospective box set in the 1980s.

==Legacy==
In 1999, BMI named &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; as the 18th most-performed song of the 20th century. In 2004, it was ranked No. 156 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, one of the duo&#x27;s three songs on the list. The song is now considered &quot;the quintessential folk rock release&quot;. 

In 2004, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

== In popular culture ==

When director Mike Nichols and Sam O&#x27;Steen were editing the 1967 film &quot;The Graduate&quot;, they initially timed some scenes to this song, intending to substitute original music for the scenes. However, they eventually concluded that an adequate substitute could not be found and decided to purchase the rights for the song for the soundtrack. This was an unusual decision, as the song had charted more than a year earlier, and recycling established music for film was not commonly done at the time.

The Canadian band Rush alluded to the song lyrics in the last lines of their 1980 song &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;.

In 2017, the song re-emerged on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Rock Songs Chart at no. 6, due to its use in a YouTube video and meme involving Ben Affleck&#x27;s facial expression during an interview about his film &quot;Batman v Superman&quot;, dubbed &quot;Sad Affleck.&quot;

<doc id="461964" wikidata="Q617650" url="?curid=461964" title="Battle of the Medway">
<text>The Battle of the Medway took place in 43 AD, probably on the River Medway in the lands of the Iron Age tribe of the Cantiaci, now the English county of Kent. Other locations for the battle have been suggested but are less likely. This was an early battle in the Claudian invasion of Britain, led by Aulus Plautius.

== Background ==
On the news of the Roman landing, the British tribes united to fight them under the command of Togodumnus and his brother Caratacus of the Catuvellauni tribe. After losing two initial skirmishes in eastern Kent, the natives gathered on the banks of a river further west to face the invaders.

At the same time, the Romans received the surrender of the Dobunni tribe in western Britain. The Dobunni were subjects of the Catuvellauni, and this diplomatic gain was probably a blow to native morale and manpower.

== Chronology ==

There was no bridge over the river where the battle was fought, so a detachment of specially-trained Roman auxiliaries (described by Cassius Dio, the only contemporary source for the battle, as &quot;Keltoi&quot;, &quot;Celtic&quot;) swam across the river and attacked the natives&#x27; chariot horses. In the chaos that followed, the bulk of the invasion force, spearheaded by Legio II Augusta under Vespasian, crossed the river, under the overall command of Titus Flavius Sabinus. The natives were surprised that fully armed legionaries were able to cross the river, and Peter Salway has stated even Dio seems taken aback. The Romans were unable to press on to victory immediately, and the first day of fighting ended without a result. During the second day, a daring attack led by Gnaeus Hosidius Geta almost led to the Roman officer being captured. His troops retaliated, however, and put the Britons to flight. Geta was awarded a triumph for securing victory, a rare honour for someone who had not been consul. Given the primary roles taken by Geta and Sabinus on different days, it has been suggested by the historian Malcolm Todd that the Romans were operating as two, or possibly three, battle groups. The invasion force was large, at least one and possibly three legions with auxiliaries. Such a long battle was unusual in ancient warfare.

The Britons fell back to the Thames, a larger river more difficult to cross.

== Location ==

Dio does not name the battle&#x27;s location, nor the river, but its site is claimed to be on the Medway. The Romans would have used existing trackways as they moved west from Richborough, and the best-travelled prehistoric trackway would have been the route of the later Pilgrims&#x27; Way, which forded the Medway at Aylesford. Other theories, however, note that the river is narrow enough at Aylesford not to pose significant difficulties in crossing, and place the battle closer to Rochester, where a large Iron Age settlement stood at the time. Further evidence of a more northerly possible location is at Bredgar, where a hoard of Roman coins from the period was found and has been interpreted as a Roman officer&#x27;s savings buried for safekeeping before a battle. This hoard could, however, post-date the battle by as much as 20 years. Possibly the Romans followed the future route of Watling Street to the battle, although its role as a pre-Roman communications route is not certain.

<text>The Alberta Act (), effective September 1, 1905, was the act of the Parliament of Canada that created the province of Alberta. The act is similar in nature to the &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot;, which established the province of Saskatchewan at the same time. Like the &quot;Saskatchewan Act&quot;, the &quot;Alberta Act&quot; was controversial because (sec. 21) it allowed the Government of Canada to maintain control of all of Alberta&#x27;s natural resources and public lands. Alberta did not win control of these resources until the passage of the &quot;Natural Resources Acts&quot; in 1930.

The &quot;Alberta Act&quot; defined the boundaries for the electoral districts of the first Alberta general election in 1905.

The &quot;Alberta Act&quot; is part of the &quot;Constitution of Canada&quot;.

<doc id="461971" wikidata="Q452243" url="?curid=461971" title="Ebba Brahe">
<text>Ebba Magnusdotter Brahe (16 March 1596 – 5 January 1674) was a Swedish countess, landowner, and courtier. 
She is foremost known for being the love object of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and because he wished to marry her prior to his marriage, plans which were however never realized. Their love affair has been famous in the Swedish romantic history and the subject of fiction, and are documented in their preserved correspondence. 

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Ebba Brahe was born to Magnus Brahe and Britta Stensdotter Leijonhuvud. She was the cousin of Margareta Brahe, Nils Brahe and Per Brahe the Younger. After the death of her mother, she was sent to the royal court to finish her upbringing. She served as maid of honor to Queen Dowager Christina of Holstein-Gottorp, who had been a personal friend to her mother, in 1611–1614, and to the elder queen dowager, Catherine Stenbock, in 1614–1618. She was described as a beauty, and John, Duke of Östergötland, was among her admirers. 

At the royal court, she met King Gustavus Adolphus, who was her second cousin, once removed and they fell in love and wished to marry each other. It is not known exactly when their love affair started. By the letters exchanged between them, it seems that they were both equally in love with each other. Their first preserved love letters are from 6 March 1613, when their relationship was apparently already long established. In this letter, the king asked her to inform her father of his wish to marry her and give them their blessing. The marriage plans were however opposed by the queen dowager, who was the de facto ruler during her son&#x27;s first years. She wished for her son to enter an arranged dynastic marriage of political convenience, and she regarded a marriage to a member of the national nobility politically risky and regarded the late queen Gunilla Bielke, who had been criticized for using her position to benefit her family, as a bad example of such a marriage. The dispute between the dowager queen, the king and Ebba Brahe about the marriage continued until 1615, and has been the subject of romantic plays, stories and poems for centuries. The queen dowager harassed her maid of honor Brahe and told her not to trust the promises of the king, which made the father of Brahe unwilling to give his blessing. The king tried to convince his mother with his half-sister Princess Catherine, Duke Henry Julius of Saxony, and chancellor Nils Chesnecopherus with messengers. 

The queen dowager promised to consider the marriage if they agreed to a couple of years consideration, and the couple corresponded during his absence in the war. In 1614, she was moved from the court of Queen Dowager Christina to that of Queen Dowager Catherine to place her further away from the king. The 10 October, she wrote: &quot;It is not suited from me as a humble lady to desire the person of Your Majesty&quot;. In spring 1615, it was made clear that the Queen dowager would never give her permission. During this time, the king himself had an affair with Margareta Slots during his absence in the war, which was to have helped Brahe to make her mind. The most famous trivia about this dispute, if indeed it happened, is believed to have taken place shortly after this, and is as follows. The queen dowager passed a window at the Stockholm Palace, followed by Ebba Brahe. On the windowpane, the queen dowager wrote with a diamond ring: &quot;One thing you want, one thing you shall; that is the way in cases such as this&quot;, and left. Ebba Brahe stepped forward and wrote in reply: &quot;I am happy with what I have, and thank my God for the grace of that&quot;. By this, Ebba Brahe accepted that the relationship with the monarch could never be official.

The same year, she received a proposal from Count Jacob De la Gardie, which she accepted two years later: 11 November 1617, her engagement was celebrated at the court of Queen Dowager Catherine, and 24 June 1618, Ebba Brahe married Jacob De la Gardie in the presence of the two queen dowagers and the brother of the king in Stockholm.

===Later life===

On 24 June 1618 she married Count Jacob De la Gardie. After the marriage, she moved with him to Swedish Estonia, where he served as governor, and lived with him there from 1619 until 1628. The relationship between Ebba Brahe and De la Gardie is described as happy, and the couple had fourteen children. Because of the frequent absence of her spouse in service she was given the responsibility of the family finances, and she moved extensively between Sweden and Estonia to manage the family estates. In 1628, the couple settled in Sweden. Ebba Brahe became known for her extravagant way of living and her taste for luxury. 

Brahe also played a part at the royal court. In 1651, the historian Arnold Johan Messenius and his son accused her of having persuaded queen Christina not to marry by the use of witchcraft. Such an accusation could not be accepted about a noble, and the accusation eventually led to the accusers being decapitated for treason. 

She favored her son Magnus Gabriel, and was said to have spoiled him and attending to his career. She was proud over his position as favourite to Queen Christina of Sweden, and supported his marriage to the Queen&#x27;s cousin Princess Maria Eufrosyne von Zweibrücken-Kleeburg. When Magnus Gabriel lost his position as favorite with the queen in 1653, Ebba Brahe fell upon her knees before the queen to ask him to forgive him, and she also sought the help of Axel Oxenstierna to reinstate him in favor, though she privately blamed the Oxenstierna party for having caused the fall of Magnus Gabriel. During the minor regency of Charles XI in 1660–1672, her son Magnus Gabriel was one of the leading members and rulers of Sweden. Ebba Brahe actively used her influence over her son to put forward both her own and various supplicants demands, recommendations and suggestions. 

Ebba Brahe also became known as a business person. As a widow, Ebba Brahe became one of the many powerful female land holders, who occupy a significant place in the local legends of Sweden during the 16th and 17th centuries, such as Barbro Påle, Sophia Drake, Margareta Huitfeldt and Margareta von Ascheberg. She became a successful land holder, managed her estates and expanded them. She acquired new estates from the formerly Danish province Skåne, which became a Swedish province in 1658 and had many large estates which were left behind by the Danish nobility. 

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1652 she successfully petitioned Queen Christina I of Sweden to found the city of Jakobstad in Finland, named in honor of her late husband. A street in Jakobstad, Ebba Brahe Esplanaden, has been named after her.

== In fiction ==
A play, &quot;Gustav Adolf och Ebba Brahe&quot;, was written about Ebba Brahe by Gustav III of Sweden, composed by Johan Henric Kellgren, which was performed in the Gripsholm Castle Theatre in 1785; the play presents her son Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie as the son of the king. The play was performed at the Royal Swedish Opera in 1787 with Franziska Stading as Ebba Brahe.

<doc id="461973" wikidata="Q187076" url="?curid=461973" title="Trackback">
<text>A trackback allows one website to notify another about an update. It is one of four types of linkback methods for website authors to request notification when somebody links to one of their documents. This enables authors to keep track of who is linking to their articles. Some weblog software, such as SilverStripe, WordPress, Drupal, and Movable Type, supports automatic pingbacks where all the links in a published article can be pinged when the article is published. The term is used colloquially for any kind of linkback.

==History==
The TrackBack specification was created by Six Apart, which first implemented it in its Movable Type blogging software in August 2002. The TrackBack has since been implemented in most other blogging tools. Six Apart started a working group in February 2006 to improve the Trackback protocol with the goal to eventually have it approved as an Internet standard by the IETF. One notable blogging service that does not support trackback is Blogger. Instead, Blogger provides &quot;backlinks&quot;, which allow users to employ Google&#x27;s search infrastructure to show links between blog entries.

==Function==
A trackback is an acknowledgment. This acknowledgment is sent via a network signal (XML-RPC ping) from the originating site to the receiving site. The receptor often publishes a link back to the originator indicating its worthiness. Trackback requires both sites to be trackback-enabled in order to establish this communication.

Trackbacks are used primarily to facilitate communication between blogs; if a blogger writes a new entry commenting on, or referring to, an entry found at another blog, and both blogging tools support the TrackBack protocol, then the commenting blogger can notify the other blog with a &quot;TrackBack ping&quot;; the receiving blog will typically display summaries of, and links to, all the commenting entries below the original entry. This allows for conversations spanning several blogs that readers can easily follow.

==Software support==
Blogging software that supports the TrackBack protocol displays a &quot;TrackBack URL&quot; with every entry. This URL is used by the commenting blogger, whose software will send XML-formatted information about the new entry to this URL. Some blogging tools are able to discover these TrackBack URLs automatically, others require the commenting blogger to enter them manually.

==Spam==

Some individuals or companies have abused the TrackBack feature to insert spam links on some blogs. This is similar to comment spam but avoids some of the safeguards designed to stop the latter practice. As a result, TrackBack spam filters similar to those implemented against comment spam now exist in many weblog publishing systems. Many blogs have stopped using trackbacks because dealing with spam became too much of a burden.

<doc id="461980" wikidata="Q196724" url="?curid=461980" title="Tutayev">
<text>Tutayev () is a town in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia. It was established in 1822 as Romanov-Borisoglebsk from two much older towns on opposite sides of the Volga River: &quot;Romanov&quot; and &quot;Borisoglebsk&quot;.

Tutayev&#x27;s population is 39,643 . In comparison, population totals from past censuses were: 
==History==

Before 1918, the town was called &quot;Romanov-Borisoglebsk&quot; (); the Bolshevik government of the USSR renamed it &quot;Tutayev&quot;, after a Red Army officer. Until 1822, when an order of the Tsar united them, there were two separate towns: Romanov, founded in the late-14th century, and Borisoglebsk, established in the 15th century. The right bank of the town is still referred to by locals as the &quot;Borisoglebsk side&quot;, and the left as the &quot;Romanov side&quot;.
==Geography==
The majority of the population lives on the Borisoglebsk side, on the right bank of the river. The areas of town nearest to the Volga&#x27;s right bank have many old wooden houses and historical buildings —including the Cathedral of the Resurrection— but further away from the river, Soviet-era apartment buildings predominate. There is no bridge across the Volga in Tutayev, so people have to use a ferry or, alternatively, travel north to Rybinsk or south to Yaroslavl to cross.

==Paleontology==
Fossils of Early Triassic temnospondyls are known from Tutayev. Remains of &quot;Thoosuchus yakovlevi&quot; and &quot;Benthosuchus korobkovi&quot; were found in the Lower Olenekian deposits of this location.

==Architecture and sights==
===Historic churches===

On the right, Borisoglebsk, riverbank:
* (1652–1678)
Churches located on the left, Romanov, bank of the river:
* (1658)
* Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Romanov-Borisoglebsk) (1660)
* Saviour-Archangel Church (; 1746–1751)
* (1758)
* Church of the Intercession (; first mentioned in historical records, 1781)
* Church of the Life-Giving Trinity on Pogost (on the &#x27;country church-grange&#x27;, or simply &quot;Trinity Church&quot;; ; 1783)
* Leontievskaya Church of the Ascension (; 1795)
* Church of St. Tikhon (; 1911–1913)
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tutayev serves as the administrative center of Tutayevsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Tutayev—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Tutayev is incorporated within Tutayevsky Municipal District as Tutayev Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
Tutayev is home to the Tutayev Motor Plant, which is one of the largest producers of diesel engines for automobiles and tractors in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

<doc id="461981" wikidata="Q739885" url="?curid=461981" title="Yukon Party">
<text>The Yukon Party, formerly the Yukon Progressive Conservative Party is a conservative political party in Yukon, Canada. 

== History ==
The Yukon Progressive Conservative Party was founded in April 1978. Long time Yukon legislator Hilda Watson was elected as the party&#x27;s first leader defeating Yukon MP Erik Nielsen by one vote. Watson had been a member of the territorial Legislative Council since 1970, and became the first woman in Canadian history to lead a political party into a general election. However, she was unable to win a seat in the 1978 election, and consequently resigned. Chris Pearson then became the leader of the party and was able to get a position in the government.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1985 election by the Yukon New Democratic Party (NDP) led by Tony Penikett. With the increasing unpopularity of the Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative in the federal government, the Yukon Progressive Conservatives decided to sever their relations with the federal Conservatives. Later on, they renamed themselves the &quot;Yukon Party&quot; prior to the 1992 election.

The party&#x27;s first leadership convention as the Yukon Party was held in June 1991 and won by Chris Young, a 21-year-old former president of the Yukon Progressive Conservatives&#x27; youth chapter. However, two Progressive Conservative MLAs, Bea Firth and Alan Nordling, quit the party within days of his victory, and formed the Independent Alliance Party. 

By August, however, Young resigned as leader on the grounds that he felt the voters of Yukon were not prepared to support a party whose leader was so young and politically inexperienced, and John Ostashek was acclaimed as his successor in November after his sole challenger, Daniel Lang, dropped out of the race.

The Yukon Party won the 1992 election, and Ostashek became Premier of Yukon. He won only a minority government, and Nordling, Firth and Willard Phelps were all reelected as independents, but all three opted to support the Yukon Party on confidence and supply. Ostashek&#x27;s government became very unpopular by increasing taxes and cutting services. The party was defeated in the 1996 election, winning only three seats and falling to third place for the first time behind the Yukon Liberal Party.

In the 1996 election Nordling returned to the party, and was defeated as a Yukon Party candidate, while Firth retired from politics.

==Since 2000==
The party&#x27;s fortunes continued to decline at the 2000 general election. The Yukon Party was reduced to a single seat in the legislature as the right wing vote moved to the Yukon Liberal Party, putting the Liberals in power for the first time in the territory&#x27;s history.

Liberal Premier Pat Duncan&#x27;s government was plagued with internal dissent, however, and despite having won an outright majority of seats in the general election, defections and resignations reduced the Liberals to a minority government within two years. Premier Duncan called a snap election for 4 November 2002, in an effort to regain her majority, but the early election call backfired.

The Yukon Party had elected Dennis Fentie, a rural Member of the Yukon Legislative Assembly (MLA), who had defected from the Yukon New Democratic Party (NDP), as its new leader in June 2002. Despite being caught by surprise by the election call, the party was able to win a majority government with 12 seats compared to five for the NDP. The Liberals were reduced to a single seat. Fentie became the second Yukon Premier from a rural riding.

On 10 October 2006, the Yukon Party was re-elected, holding 10 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Yukon Liberals won five seats and the Yukon New Democrats won three.

The party was defeated in the 2016 Yukon general election and served as the Official Opposition.

Currie Dixon led the party into the 2021 territorial election, the Yukon Party won 8 seats and won the popular vote overall. Dixon was personally elected in the district of Copperbelt North. On April 23, the incumbent Liberals were sworn in with a minority government. On April 28, the NDP announced that they had entered into a formal confidence and supply agreement with the Liberals.

==Leadership elections==
===2011 leadership election===
On May 28, 2011, a leadership election was held to replace Dennis Fentie. Darrell Pasloski was chosen after only one ballot.

===2020 leadership election===

On November 20, 2019, the party announced that it would hold a leadership election on May 23, 2020. On March 25, party president Mark Beese announced that the voting will take place over phone and online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currie Dixon was elected with 50.44% of the vote on the second ballot. Dixon took 752 votes to 682 for Brad Cathers. On the first ballot, Dixon fell short of a majority, with 694 votes to Cathers&#x27; 637. Longtime party staffer Linda Benoit finished third with 160 votes.

<doc id="461986" wikidata="Q7914952" url="?curid=461986" title="Vanish at infinity">
<text>In mathematics, a function is said to vanish at infinity if its values approach 0 as the input grows without bounds. There are two different ways to define this with one definition applying to functions defined on normed vector spaces and the other applying to functions defined on locally compact spaces. 
Aside from this difference, both of these notions correspond to the intuitive notion of adding a point at infinity, and requiring the values of the function to get arbitrarily close to zero as one approaches it. This definition can be formalized in many cases by adding an (actual) point at infinity.

== Definitions ==

A function on a normed vector space is said to if the function approaches formula_1 as the input grows without bounds (that is, formula_2 as formula_3). Or,

:formula_4

in the specific case of functions on the real line.

For example, the function 
:formula_5 

defined on the real line vanishes at infinity.

Alternatively, a function formula_6 on a locally compact space formula_7 , if given any positive number formula_8, there exists a compact subset formula_9 such that 

:formula_10

whenever the point formula_11 lies outside of formula_12 In other words, for each positive number formula_8, the set formula_14 has compact closure. 
For a given locally compact space formula_7 the set of such functions

:formula_16

valued in formula_17 which is either formula_18 or formula_19 forms a formula_20-vector space with respect to pointwise scalar multiplication and addition, which is often denoted formula_21 

As an example, the function

:formula_22

where formula_11 and formula_24 are reals greater or equal 1 and correspond to the point formula_25 on formula_26 vanishes at infinity.

A normed space is locally compact if and only if it is finite-dimensional so in this particular case, there are two different definitions of a function &quot;vanishing at infinity&quot;. 
The two definitions could be inconsistent with each other: if formula_27 in an infinite dimensional Banach space, then formula_6 vanishes at infinity by the formula_29 definition, but not by the compact set definition.

== Rapidly decreasing ==
Refining the concept, one can look more closely to the of functions at infinity. One of the basic intuitions of mathematical analysis is that the Fourier transform interchanges smoothness conditions with rate conditions on vanishing at infinity. Using big &quot;O&quot; notation, the test functions of tempered distribution theory are smooth functions that are 

:formula_30

for all formula_31, as formula_32, and such that all their partial derivatives satisfy the same condition too. This condition is set up so as to be self-dual under Fourier transform, so that the corresponding distribution theory of will have the same property.
