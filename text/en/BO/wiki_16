<text>The Provisional Government of Ireland () was the provisional government for the administration of Southern Ireland from 16 January 1922 to 5 December 1922. It was a transitional administration for the period between the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the establishment of the Irish Free State. Its legitimacy was disputed by the Anti-Treaty members of Dáil Éireann.

==Legal formation==

Article 17 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty begins:
On 14 January 1922 a meeting of the members elected to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland was held at the Mansion House, Dublin. At the meeting the Anglo-Irish Treaty was ratified by the Irish side in accordance with the Treaty and a Provisional Government was elected for the purposes of Article 17 of the Treaty. Michael Collins was appointed its chairman. The Provisional Government took up office two days later on 16 January 1922 when British administration handed over Dublin Castle to Collins in person. At this time, Westminster had not formally appointed the new Irish ministers or conferred their government with any powers.

These gaps were addressed through the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 of the British Parliament passed on 31 March 1922. It gave the force of law to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was scheduled to the Act. Section 1(2) of the Act provided that for the purposes of giving effect to Article 17 of the Treaty:

* the British Government could by Orders in Council transfer powers to the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland;

* the Parliament of Southern Ireland would be dissolved within four months from the passing of the Act; and

* elections would be held for &quot;the House of the Parliament&quot; to which the Provisional Government would be responsible.

The Act did not give a name to that Parliament but said that in matters within the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government (i.e. only certain matters concerning Southern Ireland), it would have power to make laws in like manner as the Parliament of the Irish Free State when constituted.

By Order in Council under the Act, the British Government formally transferred powers to the Provisional Government on 1 April 1922. The relevant Order in Council signed on 1 April was the &quot;Provisional Government (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1922&quot;. This Order passed on the full authority of the state within Southern Ireland to the Provisional Government, including, for the time being, all the laws that applied to Southern Ireland when under British rule. The Ministerial appointments became official and were announced in Iris Oifigiúil No.19 of 4 April 1922.

==Name==

The government is generally referred to simply as &quot;the Provisional Government&quot;. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Provisional Government of Ireland&quot;, or &quot;the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State&quot;. In article 17 of the Treaty, under which it was set up, it was referred to merely as &quot;a provisional Government&quot;, although Article 15, dealing with discussions between North and South, referred to &quot;the provisional Government of Southern Ireland hereinafter constituted&quot;. The Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, which implemented the Treaty in British law, referred to it only as &quot;the Provisional Government established under that Article [Article 17]&quot;. Similarly, the Mansion House meeting at which the government was constituted resolved that &quot;a Provisional Government be and is hereby constituted&quot;. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; story on the meeting referred to it as &quot;the Irish Free State Provisional Government&quot;, while its editorial of the same date referred to it as &quot;the Provisional Government of Ireland&quot;. A committee set up to deal with Irish affairs, headed by Winston Churchill, was called the &quot;Provisional Government of Ireland Committee&quot;.

The Provisional Government styled itself &#x27; (Provisional Government of Ireland) in Irish. It overprinted its postage stamps accordingly. &#x27; also appeared at the head of High Court proceedings, with the approval of the British government (and to the chagrin of Sir Thomas Molony, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland). 
Several Acts of the post-1922 Oireachtas of the Irish Free State and the post-1937 Oireachtas refer to the &quot;Provisional Government of Ireland&quot;.

==Concurrent Dáil administration==
Under the Irish Republic&#x27;s Dáil Constitution adopted in 1919, Dáil Éireann continued to exist after it had ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In protest at the ratification, Éamon de Valera resigned the presidency of the Dáil then sought re-election from among its members (to clarify his mandate), but Arthur Griffith defeated him in the vote and assumed the presidency.

Most of the Dáil Ministers became concurrently Ministers of this Provisional Government. Michael Collins became Chairman of the Provisional Government, while also serving as Minister for Finance in Griffith&#x27;s Dáil ministry.

The members of the Provisional Government were also members of the Republican Dáil and that parliament held meetings into June. The Dáil had no legitimacy in British law and under its own laws was the parliament to which the Ministry of Dáil Éireann was accountable.

==Handover of Dublin Castle ==

One of the earliest and most remarkable events in the short life of the Provisional Government was the handover of Dublin Castle to the Provisional Government. For centuries Dublin Castle was the symbol, as well as the citadel, of British rule in Ireland. The transfer of the Dublin Castle administration to the representatives of the Irish people was greatly welcomed in Dublin. It was regarded as a significant outward and visible sign that British rule was ending. The handover of Dublin Castle occurred on 16 January 1922. The following is a summary of the account of what happened provided by &quot;The Times&quot;:
The following officiaI communique was afterwards issued from the Castle:
On leaving the Castle the members of the Provisional Government again received a great ovation from a largely augmented crowd. They returned to the Mansion House from where the Chairman of the Provisional Government, Michael Collins issued the following statement (referring to nothing less than a &quot;surrender&quot; of the Castle):
At the end of the day&#x27;s events, the following telegram was sent from the King to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland:
==Accountability==

There was never again &quot;a meeting of members of the Parliament elected for constituencies in Southern Ireland&quot; after 14 January 1922 and neither the Treaty nor the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 provided that the Provisional Government was or would be accountable to any such body. On 27 May 1922 Lord FitzAlan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in accordance with the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922 formally dissolved the Parliament of Southern Ireland and by proclamation called &quot;a Parliament to be known as and styled the Provisional Parliament&quot;. Under the terms of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922, the Provisional Government did become accountable to that Provisional Parliament. Therefore, between its formation on 14 January 1922 and 9 September 1922, when the Provisional Parliament or Third Dáil first met, the Provisional Government was responsible to no parliament at all.

In November 1922, when refusing a writ of for Erskine Childers and eight other IRA men who had been sentenced to death by a court-martial established by the Provisional Government, the Master of the Rolls in Ireland, Charles O&#x27;Connor, considered the existence of a Provisional Government and its authority to act as proposed and execute the nine.
Lord Fitzalan remained in office during the period of the Provisional Government. In the summer of 1922 he frequently held military reviews of departing British soldiers in the Phoenix Park outside the then Viceregal Lodge.

==Civil War==

Anti-treatyites, having opposed the Treaty in the Dáil, mostly withdrew from the assembly and, having formed an opposition &quot;republican government&quot; under Éamon de Valera, began a political campaign from March 1922. At the same time the powerful IRA Army Executive divided, and its anti-Treaty members refused to be bound by the Dáil vote that had ratified it. Barracks that were being evacuated by the British army, in line with the Treaty, were sometimes taken over by anti-Treaty forces. The Dunmanway killings in April emphasised the government&#x27;s lack of control. In May 1,200 Garda Síochána recruits mutinied. A force led by Rory O&#x27;Connor occupied four central buildings in Dublin on 14 April. The Provisional Government ignored this challenge to its authority, hoping that the occupiers would realise that they had achieved nothing, and leave. Instead some incidents at the Four Courts in late June led to the open outbreak of the Irish Civil War on 28 June.

A general election was held on 16 June 1922, held just before the civil war. By mid-1922, Collins in effect laid down his responsibilities as President of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, a formal structured uniformed army that formed around the pro-Treaty IRA. As part of those duties, he travelled to his native County Cork. On his way home on 22 August 1922, he was killed in an ambush at Béal na mBláth (an Irish language placename that means &#x27;the Mouth of Flowers&#x27;). He was 31 years old. The Second Irish Provisional Government took office on 30 August 1922 until the creation of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. After Collins&#x27; and Griffith&#x27;s deaths in August 1922, W. T. Cosgrave became both Chairman of the Provisional Government and President of Dáil Éireann, and the distinction between the two posts became irrelevant.

On 6 December 1922, the Irish Free State came into being, and the Provisional Government was succeeded by the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, presided over by a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council.

==Northern Ireland==

The Provisional Government covertly supplied arms to the IRA in Northern Ireland in an attempt to maintain IRA support elsewhere. This undeclared conflict was formally ended by the &quot;Craig-Collins Agreement&quot; of 30 March 1922, but Collins continued to supply arms until shortly before his death in August 1922. Provisional Government policy changed between trying to persuade the Government of Northern Ireland to join a re-united Ireland and trying to overthrow it. A major concern was the welfare of Catholics in Northern Ireland, who were distrustful of the Ulster Special Constabulary that was formed in late 1921 to deal with the IRA there. Collins&#x27;s support for the IRA was limited to defensive actions from 2 August. The Government lifted, then re-imposed and then lifted the &quot;Belfast Boycott&quot;, designed to end the sale of Northern Irish goods in the south.

On 7 December the House of Commons of Northern Ireland unanimously exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the Free State.

<doc id="449531" wikidata="Q202014" url="?curid=449531" title="The Blue Marble">
<text>The Blue Marble is a photograph of Earth taken on December 7, 1972, by either Ron Evans or Harrison Schmitt aboard the Apollo 17 spacecraft on its way to the Moon. Viewed from around from Earth&#x27;s surface, a cropped and rotated version has become one of the most reproduced images in history.

In the original NASA image, named AS17-148-22727 and centered at about with the South Pole facing upwards, &quot;The Blue Marble&quot; shows Earth from the Mediterranean Sea to Antarctica. This was the first time the Apollo trajectory made it possible to photograph the south polar ice cap, despite the Southern Hemisphere being heavily covered in clouds. In addition to the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar, almost the entire coastline of Africa and most of the Indian Ocean are clearly visible, a cyclone in the Indian Ocean is also visible, the South Asian mainland and Australia is on the eastern limb, and the eastern part of South America lies on the western limb.

NASA has also applied the name to a 2012 series of images which cover the entire globe at relatively high resolution. These were created by looking through satellite pictures taken over time in order to find as many cloudless photographs as possible to use in the final images. NASA has verified that the 2012 &quot;blue marble&quot; images are composites, made from multiple images taken in low Earth orbit. Likewise, these images do not fit together properly and due to lighting, weather and cloud interference it is impossible to collect cohesive or fully clear images of the entire Earth simultaneously.

== Photograph ==
The photograph, taken on December 7, 1972, is one of the most widely distributed photographic images in existence. The astronauts had the Earth&#x27;s South Pole facing upwards and the Sun above them (in spatial navigation terms, to their zenith) when they took the image. To the astronauts, the Earth had the appearance and size of a glass marble.

=== History ===
====Context====
&quot;The Blue Marble&quot; was not the first clear color image taken of an illuminated face of Earth, since such images by satellites had already been made and released as early as 1967, and is the second time such a photo was taken by a person after the 1968 photograph &quot;Earthrise&quot; taken by William Anders of Apollo 8.

Before the &quot;Blue Marble&quot; a picture of the fully illuminated Earth by the ATS-3 satellite was used in 1968 by Stewart Brand for his &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;, after campaigning since 1966 to have NASA release a then-rumored satellite image of the entire Earth as seen from space. He got inspired during an LSD trip, seeing a &quot;psychedelic illusion&quot; of the Earth&#x27;s curvature, convincing him that a picture of the entire planet would change how humans related to it. He sold and distributed buttons for 25 cents each that asked: &quot;Why haven&#x27;t we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?&quot; During this campaign, Brand met Buckminster Fuller, who offered to help Brand with his project. Several of the pins made their way to NASA employees.

The Apollo 17 image, however, released during a surge in environmental activism during the 1970s, became a symbol of the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth&#x27;s fragility, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.

Today, as speculated by NASA archivist Mike Gentry, &quot;The Blue Marble&quot; is among the most widely distributed images in history.

====Circumstances====
The photograph&#x27;s official NASA designation is AS17-148-22727. It is the third of a series of shots which were taken just before and are nearly identical, NASA photograph AS17-148-22725 and AS17-148-22726, the second also having been used as a full-Earth image. The widely published versions are cropped and chromatically adjusted from the original photographs.

According to the photograph description by NASA it was taken at 05:39 a.m. EST, 5 hours 6 minutes after launch of the Apollo 17 mission, and about 1 hour 54 minutes after the spacecraft left its parking orbit around Earth to begin its trajectory to the Moon. Alternatively, Eric Hartwell has identified it as having been taken slightly earlier at 5 hours 3 minutes, when one crew member states having changed the f-number, presumably between AS17-148-22725, the first of the series of photos, and the following less exposed images like the Blue Marble. At that time, Africa was in noon daylight and with the December solstice approaching, Antarctica was also illuminated.

The photograph is at times oriented with Earth&#x27;s south pointing up, relative to the capsule.

The picture shows many weather systems, featuring a Shapyro–Keyser cyclone near to the center of the image. Cyclone Sixteen (16B) can be seen in the upper right of the image. This storm had brought flooding and high winds to the Indian state of Tamil Nadu on December 5, two days before the photograph was taken. This image has also been used to validate state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis fifty years after it was taken.

The photographer used a 70-millimeter Hasselblad camera with an 80-millimeter Zeiss lens. NASA generally credits images to the whole crew of a mission. All crew members, Gene Cernan, Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt, took photographs during the mission with the onboard Hasselblad. They have largely avoided definitively answering the question of the photographer&#x27;s identity by each member claiming to have taken it. However, interviews and evidence examined by Eric Hartwell after the mission suggest that Schmitt was the photographer.

Apollo 17 was the last crewed lunar mission. No human since has been far enough from Earth to photograph a whole-Earth image such as &quot;The Blue Marble&quot;, but whole-Earth images have been taken by many uncrewed spacecraft missions.

== Subsequent &quot;Blue Marble&quot; images ==
Subsequent similar images of Earth (including composites at much higher resolution) have also been termed &quot;Blue Marble&quot; images, and the phrase &quot;blue marble&quot; (as well as the picture itself) is frequently used, as in the Earth flag by environmental activist organizations or companies attempting to promote an environmentally conscious image. There has also been a children&#x27;s television program called &quot;Big Blue Marble&quot;. Poet-diplomat Abhay Kumar penned an Earth anthem inspired by the Blue Marble which contains &quot;all the peoples and the nations of the world, one for all, all for one, united we unfurl the blue marble flag&quot;.

=== Imaging series 2001–2004 ===
In 2002, NASA released an extensive set of satellite-captured imagery, including prepared images suitable for direct human viewing, as well as complete sets suitable for use in preparing further works. At the time, 1 km/pixel was the most detailed imagery available for free, and permitted for reuse without a need for extensive preparatory work to eliminate cloud cover and conceal missing data, or to parse specialized data formats. The data also included a similarly manually assembled cloud-cover and night-lights image sets, at lower resolutions.

A subsequent release was made in 2005, named &quot;Blue Marble Next Generation&quot;. This series of digital image mosaics was produced with the aid of automated image-sifting upon images from NASA&#x27;s Earth Observatory, which enabled the inclusion of a complete, cloud-free globe for each month from January to December 2004, at even higher resolution (500 m/pixel). The original release of a single-image set covering the entire globe could not reflect the extent of seasonal snow-and-vegetative cover across both hemispheres, but this newer release closely modeled the changes of the seasons.

A number of interactive viewers for these data have also been released, among them a music visualization for the PlayStation 3 that is based on the texture data.

=== &quot;Blue Marble 2012&quot; ===
On January 25, 2012, NASA released a composite image of the Western Hemisphere of Earth titled &quot;Blue Marble 2012&quot;. Robert Simmon is most notable for his visualization of the Western Hemisphere. The picture logged over 3.1 million views on the Flickr image hosting website within the first week of release. On February 2, 2012, NASA released a companion to this new &quot;Blue Marble&quot;, showing a composite image of the Eastern Hemisphere from data obtained on January 23, 2012.

The picture is composed of data obtained by the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the Suomi NPP satellite on January 4, 2012. The data was obtained from six orbits of the Earth by the Suomi NPP over an eight-hour period. The image was created using a near-sided perspective projection with the viewing point placed 2,100 km (1,300 miles) above 20° North by 100° West. This projection results in a very wide-angle presentation such as one might get with a fish-eye lens, and it does not include the whole hemisphere.

=== &quot;Black Marble 2012&quot; ===
On December 5, 2012, NASA released a nighttime view of Earth called &quot;Black Marble&quot; during an annual meeting of Earth scientists held by the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The images display all the human and natural matter that glows and can be detected from space. The data was acquired by the Suomi NPP satellite in April and October 2012 and then mapped over existing &quot;Blue Marble&quot; imagery of Earth to provide a realistic view of the planet. The Suomi NPP satellite completed 312 orbits and gathered 2.5 terabytes of data to get a clear shot of every parcel of the Earth&#x27;s land surface. Named for satellite meteorology pioneer Verner Suomi, the satellite flies over any given point on Earth&#x27;s surface twice each day and flies above the surface in a polar orbit.

The nighttime views were obtained with the new satellite&#x27;s &quot;day-night band&quot; of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared, and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights, gas flares, auroras, wildfires, and reflected moonlight. Auroras, fires, and other stray light have been removed in the case of the &quot;Black Marble&quot; images to emphasize the city lights. The images have been used to study the spatial distribution of economic activity, to select sites for astronomical observatories, and to monitor human activities around protected areas.

=== DSCOVR ===

On July 21, 2015, NASA released a new &quot;Blue Marble&quot; photograph taken by a U.S. Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), a solar weather and Earth observation satellite that was launched in February 2015 and provided a near-continuous view of the entire sunlit-side of the Earth. The image was taken on July 6, 2015. The photograph, of the Western Hemisphere, is centered over Central America. The Western United States, Mexico and the Caribbean are visible, but much of South America is hidden beneath cloud cover. Greenland can be seen at the upper edge of the image.

The EPIC science team plans to upload 13 new color images per day on their website. The color balance has been adjusted to approximate an image that could be seen with the average human eye. In addition to images, scientific information will be uploaded as it becomes available after in-flight calibration is complete. The science information will be ozone and aerosol amounts, cloud reflectivity, cloud height, and vegetation information. The EPIC instrument views the Earth from sunrise in the west to sunset in the east 12 to 13 times per day as the Earth rotates at 15 degrees of longitude per hour. Clearly visible are storms forming over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, major slowly moving &quot;cloud rivers&quot;, dust aerosol plumes from Africa, the Sun&#x27;s reflection in the oceans, ship exhaust tracks in the clouds, rivers and lakes, and the variegated land surface patterns especially in the African deserts. The spatial resolution of the color images is about 10 km (6 miles), and the resolution of the science products will be about 20 km (10 miles). Once every three months, lunar images are obtained that are the same as those viewed from Earth during a full Moon. On occasion, the other side of the Moon will appear in the Earth images as the Moon crosses in front of the Earth.

== Cultural reception ==
The picture has been identified as one of the most widely publicised and influential images since its release, particularly in the advocacy for environmental protection.

&quot;The Blue Marble&quot;, and other images from space, have been in parts critically analyzed as distracting from human geographic issues and from being a technological product produced by a dominant spacefaring country, which developed the image and its overview effect as a boundless worldview instead of as an image inviting an intricate and critical overview.

<doc id="449532" wikidata="Q402915" url="?curid=449532" title="Rosenhan experiment">
<text>The Rosenhan experiment or Thud experiment was an experiment regarding the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. For the experiment, participants submitted themselves for evaluation at various psychiatric institutions and feigned hallucinations in order to be accepted, but acted normally from then onward. Each was diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and given antipsychotic medication. The study was arranged by psychologist David Rosenhan, a Stanford University professor, and published by the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 1973 with the title &quot;On Being Sane In Insane Places&quot;.

It is considered an important and influential criticism of psychiatric diagnosis, and broached the topic of wrongful involuntary commitment. The experiment is said to have &quot;accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible&quot;. Rosenhan claimed that he, along with eight other people (five men and three women), entered 12 hospitals in five states near the west coast of the US. Three of the participants were admitted for only a brief period of time, and in order to obtain sufficient documented experiences, they re-applied to additional institutions.

Respondents defended psychiatry against the experiment&#x27;s conclusions, saying that as psychiatric diagnosis relies largely on the patient&#x27;s report of their experiences, faking their presence no more demonstrates problems with psychiatric diagnosis than lying about other medical symptoms. It has been alleged that at least part of the published results were distorted or falsified.

==Pseudopatient experiment==
While listening to a lecture by Ronald D. Laing, a psychiatrist associated with anti-psychiatry claims, Rosenhan conceived of the experiment as a way to test the reliability of psychiatric diagnoses. The study concluded &quot;it is clear that we cannot distinguish the sane from the insane in psychiatric hospitals&quot; and also illustrated the dangers of dehumanization and suggestion in psychiatric institutions. It suggested that the use of community mental health facilities which concentrated on specific problems and behaviors rather than psychiatric terminology might be a solution, and recommended education to make psychiatric workers more aware of the social psychology of their facilities.

Rosenhan himself and seven mentally healthy associates, termed &quot;pseudopatients&quot;, attempted to gain admission to psychiatric hospitals by telephoning for an appointment and feigning auditory hallucinations. The hospital staff were not informed of the experiment. The pseudopatients included a psychology graduate student aged in his twenties, three psychologists, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a painter, and a housewife. None had a history of mental illness. Pseudopatients used pseudonyms, and those who were mental health professionals were given false jobs in a different sector to avoid invoking any special treatment or scrutiny. Apart from giving false names and employment details, further biographical details were reported truthfully.

During their initial psychiatric assessment, the pseudopatients claimed to be hearing voices of the same sex as the patient which were often unclear, but which seemed to pronounce the words &quot;empty&quot;, &quot;hollow&quot;, or &quot;thud&quot;, and nothing else. These words were chosen as they vaguely suggest some sort of existential crisis and for the lack of any published literature referencing them as psychotic symptoms. No other psychiatric symptoms were claimed according to Rosenhan&#x27;s publication, but medical records have indicated that, at least in the case of one pseudopatient, more were shared to the hospital such as not being able to sleep, feeling cold all over, being unable to work for six months, being sensitive to radio signals, having suicidal thoughts, etc. Grimacing and twitching were also observed by the doctor who examined one of the pseudopatients. If admitted, the pseudopatients were instructed to &quot;act normally&quot;, reporting that they felt fine and no longer heard voices. Hospital records obtained after the experiment indicate that all pseudopatients were characterized as friendly and cooperative by staff.

All were admitted, to 12 psychiatric hospitals across the United States, including underfunded public hospitals in rural areas, urban university-run hospitals with excellent reputations, and one expensive private hospital. Though presented with identical symptoms, seven were diagnosed with schizophrenia at public hospitals, and one with manic-depressive psychosis, a more optimistic diagnosis with better clinical outcomes, at the private hospital. Their stays ranged from 7 to 52 days, and the average was 19 days. All but one were discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia &quot;in remission&quot;, which Rosenhan considered as evidence that mental illness is perceived as an irreversible condition creating a lifelong stigma rather than a curable illness.

Despite openly and frequently taking extensive notes on the behavior of the staff and other patients, none of the pseudopatients were identified as impostors by the hospital staff, although many of the other psychiatric patients seemed to be able to correctly identify them as impostors. In the first three hospitalizations, 35 of the total of 118 patients expressed a suspicion that the pseudopatients were sane, with some suggesting that the patients were researchers or journalists investigating the hospital. Hospital notes indicated that staff interpreted much of the pseudopatients&#x27; behavior in terms of mental illness. For example, one nurse labeled the note-taking of one pseudopatient as &quot;writing behavior&quot; and considered it pathological. The patients&#x27; normal biographies were described in hospital records consistent with what was expected of schizophrenics by the then-dominant theories of its cause.

The experiment required the pseudopatients to get out of the hospital on their own by getting the hospital to release them, though a lawyer was retained to be on call for emergencies when it became clear that the pseudopatients would not ever be voluntarily released on short notice. Once admitted and diagnosed, the pseudopatients were not able to obtain their release until they agreed with the psychiatrists that they were mentally ill and began taking antipsychotic medications, which they flushed down a toilet. No staff member reported that the pseudopatients were flushing their medication down the toilets.

Rosenhan and the other pseudopatients reported an overwhelming sense of dehumanization, severe invasion of privacy, and boredom while hospitalized. Their possessions were searched randomly, and they were sometimes observed while using the toilet. They reported that though the staff seemed to be well-meaning, they generally objectified and dehumanized the patients, often discussing patients at length in their presence as though they were not there, and avoiding direct interaction with patients except as strictly necessary to perform official duties. Some attendants were prone to verbal and physical abuse of patients when other staff were not present. A group of patients waiting outside the cafeteria half an hour before lunchtime were said by a doctor to his students to be experiencing &quot;oral-acquisitive&quot; psychiatric symptoms. Contact with doctors averaged 6.8 minutes per day.

==Non-existent impostor experiment==
For this experiment, Rosenhan used a well-known research and teaching hospital, the staff of which had learned of the results of the initial study but claimed that similar errors could not be made at their institution. Rosenhan arranged with them that during a three-month period, one or more pseudopatients would attempt to gain admission and the staff would rate every incoming patient as to the likelihood they were an impostor. Of 193 patients, 41 were considered to be impostors and a further 42 were considered suspect. In reality, Rosenhan had sent no pseudopatients; all patients suspected as impostors by the hospital staff were ordinary patients. This resulted in a conclusion that &quot;any diagnostic process that lends itself too readily to massive errors of this sort cannot be a very reliable one&quot;.

==Impact==

Rosenhan published his findings in &quot;Science&quot;, in which he criticized the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis and the disempowering and demeaning nature of patient care experienced by the associates during the study. Additionally, he described his work in a variety of news appearances, including to the BBC:

The experiment is said to have &quot;accelerated the movement to reform mental institutions and to deinstitutionalize as many mental patients as possible&quot;.

===Criticisms===
Many respondents to the publication defended psychiatry, saying that as psychiatric diagnosis relies largely on the patient&#x27;s report of their experiences, faking their presence no more demonstrates problems with psychiatric diagnosis than lying about other medical symptoms. In this vein, psychiatrist Robert Spitzer quoted Seymour S. Kety in a 1975 criticism of Rosenhan&#x27;s study:
If I were to drink a quart of blood and, concealing what I had done, come to the emergency room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.
Kety also said that psychiatrists should not necessarily be expected to assume that a patient is pretending to have mental illness, thus the study lacked realism. Instead of considering realistic problems in diagnosis, such as comorbidity or differential diagnosis between disorders with similar symptoms, Rosenhan dismissed the criticism as further examples of the &quot;experimenter effect&quot; or &quot;expectation bias,&quot; and evidence for his interpretation that he had discovered genuine problems of diagnosis rather than being fooled by his method.

===Accusation of fraud===
In &quot;The Great Pretender&quot;, a 2019 book on Rosenhan, author Susannah Cahalan questions the veracity and validity of the Rosenhan experiment. Examining documents left by Rosenhan after his death, Cahalan finds apparent distortion in the &quot;Science&quot; article: inconsistent data, misleading descriptions, and inaccurate or fabricated quotations from psychiatric records. Moreover, despite an extensive search, she is only able to identify two of the eight pseudopatients: Rosenhan himself, and a graduate student whose testimony is allegedly inconsistent with Rosenhan&#x27;s description in the article. Due to Rosenhan&#x27;s seeming willingness to alter the truth in other ways regarding the experiment, Cahalan questions whether some or all of the six other pseudopatients might have been simply invented by Rosenhan. In February 2023, Andrew Scull of the University of California at San Diego published an article in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;History of Psychiatry&quot; in support of Cahalan&#x27;s allegations.

==Related experiments==
In 1887, American investigative journalist Nellie Bly feigned symptoms of mental illness to gain admission to a lunatic asylum and report on the terrible conditions therein. The results were published as &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot;.

In 1968, Maurice K. Temerlin split 25 psychiatrists into two groups and had them listen to an actor portraying a character of normal mental health. One group was told that the actor &quot;was a very interesting man because he looked neurotic, but actually was quite psychotic&quot; while the other was told nothing. Sixty percent of the former group diagnosed psychoses, most often schizophrenia, while none of the control group did so.

In 1988, Loring and Powell gave 290 psychiatrists a transcript of a patient interview and told half of them that the patient was black and the other half white; they concluded of the results that &quot;clinicians appear to ascribe violence, suspiciousness, and dangerousness to black clients even though the case studies are the same as the case studies for the white clients.&quot;

In 2004, psychologist Lauren Slater claimed to have performed an experiment very similar to Rosenhan&#x27;s for her book &quot;Opening Skinner&#x27;s Box&quot;. Slater wrote that she had presented herself at 9 psychiatric emergency rooms with auditory hallucinations, resulting in being diagnosed &quot;almost every time&quot; with psychotic depression. However, when challenged to provide evidence of actually performing her experiment, she could not. The serious methodological and other concerns regarding Slater&#x27;s work appeared as a series of responses to a journal report, in the same journal.

In 2008, the BBC&#x27;s science television series &quot;Horizon&quot; performed a similar experiment for two episodes entitled &quot;How Mad Are You?&quot;. The experiment involved ten subjects, five with previously diagnosed mental health conditions, and five with no such diagnosis. They were observed by three experts in mental health diagnoses and their challenge was to identify the five with mental health problems solely from their behavior, without speaking to the subjects or learning anything of their histories. The experts correctly diagnosed two of the ten patients, misdiagnosed one patient, and incorrectly identified two healthy patients as having mental health problems. Unlike the other experiments listed here, however, the purpose of this journalistic exercise was not to criticize the diagnostic process, but to minimize the stigmatization of the mentally ill. It was intended to show that people with a previous diagnosis of a mental illness could live normal lives with their health problems not obvious to observers from their behavior.

One of the main claims of the Rosenhan experiment was that clinicians could be negatively biased in their first clinical impression, which would negatively affect further clinical decisions. Christoph Flückiger and colleagues conducted two experiments in 2024 (N = 56 and 64) in which psychotherapists were asked to give their first clinical impressions in two consecutive cases after a brief presentation of the case (case description and video excerpt) and a short recall task on the information provided. The attentional focus in the recall task served as an independent variable: therapists had to adopt either a symptom-focused or a strength-focused attentional focus to recall the cases, i.e. therapists rated their first case in either the symptom-focused or the strength-focused condition and the second case in the opposite condition. In both studies, the therapists in the symptom-focused conditions rated the patients as slightly more distressed, less resilient and less psychosocially integrated compared to the strength-focused conditions. However, these effects, although statistically significant, were rather small to clinically negligible. These preliminary results suggest that the first clinical impressions of contemporary psychotherapists in both experiments may be slightly, but not as dramatically, distorted as the Rosenhan experiment suggested at the time.

<doc id="449537" wikidata="Q453583" url="?curid=449537" title="Julian Bream">
<text>Julian Alexander Bream (15 July 193314 August 2020) was an English classical guitarist and lutenist. Regarded as one of the most distinguished classical guitarists of the 20th century, he played a significant role in improving the public perception of the classical guitar as a respectable instrument. Over the course of a career that spanned more than half a century, Bream also helped revive interest in the lute.

==Early years==
Bream was born in Battersea, London, to Henry and Violet Jessie (née Wright) Bream. At the age of two he moved with his family to Hampton in London, where he was brought up in a musical environment. His father was a commercial artist and an amateur jazz guitarist, who was unable to read music but had a finely attuned ear and could play a lot of popular music. His mother, of Scottish descent, had a warm and loving personality, but no interest in music. His parents divorced when he was 14. His grandmother owned a pub in Battersea, and Bream spent much time there during his youth. The young Bream was impressed by the playing of Django Reinhardt; he later named his dog &quot;Django&quot;. Bream played the piano and cello as a child and Reinhardt inspired Bream to take up guitar.

Bream began his lifelong association with the guitar by strumming along on his father&#x27;s jazz guitar at an early age to dance music on the radio. He became frustrated with his lack of knowledge of jazz harmony, so read instruction books by Eddie Lang to teach himself. His father taught him the basics. The president of the Philharmonic Society of Guitarists, Boris Perott, gave Bream further lessons, while his father became the society librarian, giving young Bream access to a large collection of rare music.

On his 11th birthday, Bream was given a small gut-strung Spanish guitar by his father. He became something of a child prodigy, at 12 winning a junior exhibition award for his piano playing, enabling him to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music. He made his debut guitar recital at Cheltenham on 17 February 1947, aged 13; in 1951, he debuted at Wigmore Hall.

Bream&#x27;s father had reservations about Julian pursuing classical guitar. He claimed Bream would find it difficult to earn a living unless he played jazz or something similarly modern. His father&#x27;s remarks made Bream more persistent and committed to becoming a professional classical guitarist. Bream played the guitar first, then the piano for his audition at the Royal College of Music, even though the guitar was not taught at the institution at the time. When the college accepted Bream, he was advised not to bring his guitar. Bream brought along his guitar regardless as he played for late-night performances. When the school&#x27;s director discovered he was playing the guitar in one of the school&#x27;s practice rooms, Bream was asked again to leave his guitar at home. Bream&#x27;s response to the request was to leave the college.

Leaving the RCM in 1952, Bream was called up into the army for national service. He was originally drafted into the Pay Corps, but managed to sign up for the Royal Artillery Band after six months. This required him to be stationed in Woolwich, which allowed him to moonlight regularly in London with the guitar.

== Career ==

After three and half years in the army, he took any musical jobs that came his way, including background music for radio plays and films. Recording sessions and work for the BBC were important to Bream throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s. He played part of a recital at the Wigmore Hall on the lute in 1952. Bream pursued a busy career playing around the world. His first European tours took place in 1954 and 1955, followed (beginning in 1958) by extensive touring in the Far East, India, Australia, the Pacific Islands and many other parts of the world. His first North America tour was in 1959. 1960 saw the formation of the Julian Bream Consort, a period-instrument ensemble with Bream as lutenist. The consort led a great revival of interest in the music of the Elizabethan era. In 1963, Bream performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston with the US debut of his Consort.

In addition to master classes, Bream was a tutor of the music summer school at Dartington.

==Later career==
In 1984, Bream seriously injured his right arm in a car accident.

In 1991, BBC Radio and TV broadcast Bream&#x27;s BBC Prom performance of Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s Guitar Concerto. He also participated in a recital and concerto performances of works by Toru Takemitsu at the Japan Festival in London with the London Symphony Orchestra.

During the 1992–93 season he performed on two occasions at the Wigmore Hall – at their Gala Re-opening Festival, and at a special concert celebrating his 60th birthday. In the same period, he toured the Far East, visiting Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, and performed the premiere of Leo Brouwer&#x27;s arrangement for guitar and orchestra of Albéniz&#x27;s &quot;Iberia&quot; at the Proms. In 1994 Bream made debuts in both Turkey and Israel to great acclaim, and the following year played for the soundtrack to the Hollywood film &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot;.

In 1997, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of his debut, he performed a recital at Cheltenham Town Hall. A few weeks later, the BBC dedicated a television tribute &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; programme to Bream, filmed after a commemorative concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London.

Other engagements around that time included a gala solo performance at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; a Kosovo Aid concert at St. John&#x27;s, Smith Square, London, with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; recitals at the Snape Proms, Aldeburgh, and at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival; and a tour of National Trust properties in summer and autumn 2000.

In November 2001 he gave an anniversary recital at Wigmore Hall, celebrating 50 years since his debut there in 1951. His final recital was at Maddermarket Theatre, Norwich, on 6 May 2002.

==Style and influences==
Bream&#x27;s recitals were wide-ranging, including transcriptions from the 17th century, many pieces by Bach arranged for guitar, popular Spanish pieces, and contemporary music, for much of which he was the inspiration. He stated that he was influenced by the styles of Andrés Segovia and Francisco Tárrega. Bream had some &quot;sessions&quot; with Segovia but did not actually study with him. Segovia provided a personal endorsement and scholarship request to assist Bream in taking further formal music studies. Bream&#x27;s work showed that the guitar could be capably utilized in English, French, and German music.

Bream&#x27;s playing can be characterised as virtuosic and highly expressive, with an eye for details, and with strong use of contrasting timbres. He did not consistently hold his right-hand fingers at right angles to the strings, but used a less rigid hand position for tonal variety.

Bream met Igor Stravinsky in Toronto, Canada, in 1965. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade the composer to write a composition for the lute and played a pavane by Dowland for him. The meeting between Bream and Stravinsky, including Bream&#x27;s impromptu playing, was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada in making a documentary about the composer.

==Recordings==
Bream recorded extensively for RCA Victor and EMI Classics. These recordings won him several awards, including four Grammy Awards, two for Best Chamber Music Performance and two for Best Classical Performance. RCA also released &quot;The Ultimate Guitar Collection&quot;, a multi-CD set commemorating his birthday in 1993.

Despite his importance as a classical guitarist, many of his RCA recordings (including the series of 20th-century guitar music) were out of print for several years. In 2011, RCA released &quot;My Favorite Albums&quot;, a 10-CD set of albums chosen by Julian Bream himself. In 2013, RCA issued &quot;Julian Bream: The Complete RCA Album Collection&quot;, a 40-CD set which also includes two DVDs with &quot;The Lively Arts – Julian Bream: A Life in the Country&quot;, the 1976 BBC film; and four BBC shows: &quot;Omnibus: Anniversary of Sir William Walton&quot; [1982], &quot;The Julian Bream Consort (1961)&quot;, &quot;Monitor – Film Profile of Julian Bream&quot; [1962], and &quot;The Julian Bream Consort (1964)&quot;.

== Television and video ==
A film, &quot;A Life in the Country&quot;, was first shown on BBC TV in 1976. In it, the narrator and Bream discuss his beginnings and his life as a concert guitarist. Bream also presented a series of four master-classes for guitarists on BBC TV.

In 1984 he made eight film segments on location in Spain for Channel 4. The collection of segments &quot;¡Guitarra! A Musical Journey Through Spain&quot; explored historical perspectives of Spanish guitar music.

The 2003 DVD video profile &quot;Julian Bream: My Life in Music&quot; contains three hours of interviews and performances. It has been declared by Graham Wade &quot;the finest film contribution ever to the classic guitar&quot; and it became &quot;&quot;Gramophone&quot; DVD of the year&quot;.

==Dedications and collaborations==

Many composers worked with Bream, and among those who dedicated pieces to him were Malcolm Arnold, Richard Rodney Bennett, Benjamin Britten, Leo Brouwer, Peter Racine Fricker, Hans Werner Henze, Humphrey Searle, Toru Takemitsu, Michael Tippett, William Walton and Peter Maxwell Davies. Britten&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnal&quot; is one of the most famous pieces in the classical guitar repertoire and was written with Bream specifically in mind. It is an unusual set of variations on John Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Come, Heavy Sleep&quot; (which is played in its original form at the close of the piece).

Bream also took part in many collaborations, including work with Peter Pears on Elizabethan music for lute and voice, and three records of guitar duets with John Williams.

==Personal life==
Bream&#x27;s first wife was Margaret, daughter of the writer Henry Williamson, with whom he adopted a son. After their divorce he married Isabel Sanchez in 1980. That marriage also ended in divorce.

He lived for over 40 years at Broad Oak House, a Georgian farmhouse in Semley, Wiltshire from 1966 until 2008. In 2009 he moved to a smaller house in the neighbouring village of Donhead St Andrew. Bream was keen on the game of cricket and was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Bream died on 14 August 2020, at his home at Donhead St Andrew, at the age of 87.

<text>Portalegre () is a municipality in Portugal. The population was 22,368, in an area of . The municipality is located by the Serra de São Mamede in the Portalegre District.

Its name comes from the Latin (meaning &quot;cheerful port&quot;). The municipal holiday is 23 May. According to the 2001 census the city of Portalegre had 15,768 inhabitants in its two parishes (Sé and São Lourenço). These two parishes, plus the eight rural parishes, had a total of 25,608 inhabitants. The current mayor is Adelaide Teixeira, who was elected as an independent.

==History==
According to a frequently mentioned legend, described by Friar Amador Arrais in his 1589 work, &quot;Diálogos&quot;, Portalegre was founded by Lísias in the 12th century BC, following the disappearance of his daughter Maia. She was walking with Tobias when she is coveted by a vagabond, Dolme, who kidnaps and murders Tobias.

Lísias is desperate for his daughter&#x27;s disappearance and goes in search of her, eventually finding her dead by a stream that today is named Ribeiro de Baco. Lísias will die of joy when she thinks she has seen her daughter extend her arms to her. The city that was founded in the meantime was given the name of Ammaia. Lysias would also have built a fortress and a temple dedicated to Bacchus on the site where the Church of São Cristóvão stands today. According to Friar Amador Arrais, ruins of this temple still existed in the 16th century.

It is believed the legend resulted from fantasies somehow supported by the existence of a tombstone with a dedication to the Roman emperor Commodus (161-192), which was probably brought from the ruins of the Roman city at São Salvador da Aramenha, near Marvão, which is now commonly accepted as the Roman Ammaia referred to in various historical sources. 

The location of this and other cities mentioned in sources from the Roman period, Medóbriga, was the subject of controversy until, at least, the beginning of the 20th century, with speculation until that time whether there were any important ancient settlements in the area currently occupied by the city or in its surroundings.

The name of Portalegre comes from &quot;Portus Alacer&quot; (meaning &quot;happy&quot; port or crossing point). It is likely that in the 12th century there was a village in the valley to the east of Serra da Penha. The name of Portalegre, where one of the important activities would be to provide shelter and food for travelers (hence the name of port, crossing point or supply). The contrast of its green slopes and valleys with the more arid and monotonous landscape to the south and north may have contributed to its name. The village prospered. In 1129, it was a village in the municipality of Marvão, becoming the seat of the municipality in 1253, having been awarded the first charter in 1259 by Afonso III, who ordered the construction of the first fortifications, which were never completed.

Along with Marvão, Castelo de Vide and Arronches, Portalegre was donated by Afonso III to his second son, Afonso.
The next king ordered the construction of the first walls in 1290, which he himself would surround for 5 months in 1299, following the civil war that opposed him to his brother, who asserted the throne claiming that Denis was an illegitimate child. 

That same year, Denis would grant Portalegre the privilege of not being assigned the lordship of the village &quot;neither the infant, nor the rich man, nor the rich lady, but being of the King and of his first heir son&quot;.

After Ferdinand I died in 1383 without leaving any male heirs, Leonor Teles assumed the regency of the Kingdom at the same time that she became acquainted with Count Andeiro, a Galician nobleman. This situation upset a large part of the people, the bourgeoisie and a part of the nobility, as it was feared that this situation would reinforce the claims to the Portuguese throne of John I of Castile, who was married to Beatrice, the daughter of Ferdinand and Leonor. 

This dynastic crisis, which involved a warlike civil war between Portugal and Castile, would come to be known as the 1383-1385 Crisis. The strongest party among those who opposed the claims to the throne of John I of Castile and D. Beatrice supported the coronation of John of Aviz. 

Among the nobles who supported John of Aviz was Nuno Álvares Pereira, brother of the then mayor of Portalegre, Pedro Álvares Pereira, Prior of Crato, who was a staunch supporter of Leonor. This position of the mayor provoked the revolt of the people of Portalegre, which surrounded the castle and forced Dom Pedro to flee to Crato. The former mayor would die in 1385 at the Battle of Aljubarrota, where he fought on the opposite side of his brother, Nuno.

The town grew in importance and on August 21, 1549 the Diocese of Portalegre was created, by a bull of Pope Paul III, following steps in this direction by John III, who would elevate Portalegre to the city on 23 May 1550.

The importance of the city at that time was reflected, for example, in the volume of revenue from the tax on Jewish quarters, which was similar to that of Porto, and only surpassed by those of Lisbon, Santarém and Setúbal. It was also one of the most important fabric industry centers in the country, along with Estremoz and Covilhã.

Owing to its proximity to the border with Spain, over the years Portalegre endured many invasions by foreign troops. 

In 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession, it was attacked and conquered by the army of Felipe V; again in 1801 during the War of the Oranges, it surrendered to the Spanish Army, in an attempt to counter the French dominion. In 1847, it was occupied by forces of the Spanish General Concha.

Portalegre becomes capital of the homonymous district when the districts were formed on 18 July 1835.

== Geography ==

Although the landscape of the municipalities north of Portalegre is still typically Alentejo, with relatively flat areas alternating with mostly relatively low hills, Portalegre is often described as a transition zone between the drier, flat Alentejo and the Beiras, wetter and mountainous. The terrain is more varied than in the rest of Alentejo in general, which contributes to the landscape having its own peculiar characteristics.

The city is located at an altitude of between , in the transition zone between the relatively flat landscape, but with many low hills to the south and west, and the mountainous system of Serra de São Mamede, which surrounds it to the north, east and southeast.

The geology is varied, which translates into the variety of soils, with zones of schist, greywacke, limestone and quartzite.

The unique characteristics of the landscape, flora and fauna are at the base of the creation of the Serra de São Mamede Natural Park, which includes a considerable part of the municipality&#x27;s area.

===Climate===
Portalegre has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot, dry summers and mild winters. Its position at the foot of Serra de São Mamede gives it cooler day temperatures, higher precipitation and lower insolation than the surrounding municipalities.

===Parishes===
The municipality is composed of 7 parishes:

* Alagoa
* Alegrete
* Ribeira de Nisa e Carreiras
* Fortios
* Reguengo e São Julião
* Sé e São Lourenço
* Urra

==Other features==

The house-museum of José Régio, a famous Portuguese poet, was installed in his home, in which he lived for 34 years. When Régio was accepted at the high school of Mouzinho da Silveira, in Portalegre, this place was a hostel. It was previously an annex of the convent of S. Brás, of which there are still some vestiges, namely the chapel. It served as a headquarters when the peninsular wars were fought, but it was later named &quot;Pensão 21&quot;.

Régio rented a humble room and, as he needed more space (he collected several works of art, amongst which more than 400 representations of Christ), he would rent more space. So, as time went by, he finally became the only inhabitant of the hostel.

In 1965, he sold his collection to the municipality of Portalegre with the condition of it buying his house, restore it and transform it into a museum. He lived there until he died, in 1969. The museum was opened to public in 1971.

<text>Viana do Castelo () is a municipality and seat of the district of Viana do Castelo in the Norte Region of Portugal. The population in 2021 was 85,778, in an area of . The urbanized area of the municipality, comprising the city, has a population of approximately 36,148 inhabitants, although the extended densely populated region reaches surrounding municipalities like Caminha and Ponte de Lima with a population above 150,000 inhabitants. It is located at the mouth of the Lima river, on the Portuguese Way path, an alternative path of the Camino de Santiago.

==History==
Human settlement in the region of Viana began during the Mesolithic era, from discoveries and archaeological excavations. Settlements in the Mount of Santa Luzia date back to the Iron age, extending into the Roman occupation the area.

The settlement of &quot;Viana da Foz do Lima&quot;, which it was called when King Afonso III of Portugal issued a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) on 18 July 1258, was a formalization of the 1253 &quot;Viana&quot; that the area was named.

The port in Viana do Castelo played an important role in the city&#x27;s development. In the 15th century, it was on the trade routes between the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic, when textiles, fruits, wood and iron were headed south while salt and agricultural products were northbound. In 1455, a cathedral was inaugurated in Viana do Castelo. During the later part of the century, the city became an important supplier of textiles to the newly established colonies in Madeira and the Azores.

However, the port&#x27;s importance grew substantially from the 16th century, during the age of discoveries, when the sugar trade from Brazil emerges in Viana. Merchants from Northern Europe establish themselves in the city, trading in sugar and selling bread from the Baltic. In parallel, the fishing industry developed, due to cod fishing off the coast of Newfoundland and Greenland, an important foodstuff for cross Atlantic voyages.

During this period of prosperity, a number of religious institutions installed themselves in the city and a via sacra (sacred way) was created, through the city&#x27;s northern edge. In 1576, a Dominican convent and church is inaugurated to São Domingos (St. Dominic), designed by monk Julião Romero. In 1612, a Franciscan convent to St. Anthony was founded to the north of the city by the Order of Friars Minor. The parish of Nossa Senhora de Monserrate (Our Lady of Monserrat) was founded in 1621 next to the old barracks named Batalhão de Caçadores 9. In 1627 a decision was taken to establish a monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine to St. Theotonius. The monastery was inaugurated in 1630, but construction work continued for several years. In 1678, a chapel was built to the Holy Sepulchre, which by 1744 had originated a Marian devotion to Nossa Senhora da Agonia (Our Lady of Agony), a large worship figure in Viana, especially among fishermen.

Viana do Castelo had coastal defenses on its western side, at the mouth of the river since the reign of Alfonso III in the 13th century. During the 15th century, these would be upgraded, including Torre da Roqueta (tower of Roqueta), to protect from pirates. In the 16th century, defenses were again boosted, to protect the prosperous city, with the start of the construction of Fort Santiago da Barra.

After the maritime discoveries and trade, the commercial life of Viana reached its greatest proportions during the reign of Queen Maria II of Portugal, when the monarch established the &quot;Associação Comercial de Viana do Castelo&quot; in 1852 (the fourth oldest public company of its type). The queen, in order to reward the loyalty of its citizens, who did not surrender to the Count of Antas, elevated the town to the status of city on 20 January 1848, renaming the settlement with its current name.

In 1878, the railway line Linha do Minho reached Viana do Castelo connecting it to Porto to the south. The railway crossed the Lima river on a new railway bridge, Ponte Eiffel, designed by Gustave Eiffel. In 1882, the line was completed, reaching the border with Spain to the north and Viana&#x27;s railway station was completed. During the construction process, the monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine was demolished to make way for the project and much of its stonework was repurposed for viaducts and the station building.

In 1884, the veneration of Santa Luzia (St. Lucy) strengthened after a cavalry commander Luis de Andrade e Sousa founded the Confraternity of Santa Luzia. It was founded after his poor eyesight improved following two years visiting a chapel atop the mountain of Santa Luzia. The confraternity improved the state of the chapel and its accessibility.

In 1904, construction started on the Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, commonly referred to as the church or sanctuary of Santa Luzia, on top of the mountain of Santa Luzia. Construction on its exterior ended in 1943, but works continue on its interior until 1959. The cult in Viana do Castelo dates back to 1743, but it grew in popularity during a pandemic in 1918. In 1926, the chapel of Santa Luzia would be demolished and its image transferred to the sanctuary.

During the Estado Novo dictatorship, a shipbuilding industry was established in the city&#x27;s port. On June 4, 1944, the Estaleiros Nacionais de Viana do Castelo (ENVC) were founded as part of a government program to modernize the country&#x27;s fishing fleet. The shipyard was initially focused on constructing long-distance fishing vessels, such as those for cod fishing, but diversified its portfolio throughout the 20th century. The shipyard ran into financial difficulties in the 2000s, leading to a bankruptcy and restructuring in 2013.

===Climate===
Viana do Castelo has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;; Thornthwaite: &quot;ArB&#x27;2a&quot;&#x27;) with substantial oceanic influences characterized by warm, relatively dry summers and mild, rainy winters. It is also one of the rainiest cities in Continental Portugal.

Temperatures above 30 °C are relatively rare during summertime, happening on about 20 days per year on average; while in the cold months there are on average 29 days with frost.

==Economy==

Home to a modern service based economy, the city, along with its region, has a seaport with naval repairing facilities. Industry is a cornerstone of Viana do Castelo&#x27;s economy, benefiting from its strategic location along Atlantic trade routes and investments in industrial parks. Key sectors include shipbuilding, forestry, metal products, machinery, and seafood processing. The municipality hosts one of Portugal&#x27;s shipyards, the West Sea Shipyard (formerly &quot;Estaleiros Navais de Viana do Castelo&quot;), although the shipbuilding industry has faced challenges, including bankruptcy and restructuring in 2013.

In the forestry sector, Viana do Castelo ranks among the top five exporters in the Norte region, driven by its robust pulp and paper industry, which generated €249 million in exports in 2020. The machinery industry is also expanding, highlighted by BorgWarner&#x27;s €90 million investment in 2023 to establish a factory for producing electric motors and components for hybrid and electric vehicles. Additionally, Viana do Castelo plays a prominent role in high-technology exports, contributing 10.1% of the North Region&#x27;s exports in this category.

Renewable energy has also become a key driver of the local economy. The WindFloat Atlantic offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Viana do Castelo, has been operational since 2020. With three floating turbines, it has consistently supplied electricity to over 25,000 homes annually, avoiding over 33,000 tons of CO₂ emissions. As of 2024, it supported 1,500 direct and indirect jobs throughout its development, construction, and operation phases.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
Since the early 1990s the city started a wide urban renewal plan, pioneering the &quot;Polis program&quot;, and including enlarging the pedestrian areas, building new modern architecture and creating new public spaces and parks. Architects such as Siza Vieira, Eduardo Souto de Moura and Fernando Távora have participated in the construction of a modern, well preserved and lively city center.

==Culture==

The Festa de Nossa Senhora d&#x27;Agonia (Festivity of Our Lady of Agony), is held in Viana do Castelo and it is one of Portugal&#x27;s largest and oldest religious festivals. The event spans several days and includes a wide variety of activities, both religious and secular. These range from processions and ethnographic parades to performances featuring music, traditional dances, and large figures such as &quot;cabeçudos&quot; and &quot;gigantones&quot;. Other attractions include a craft fair, fireworks displays, and musical concerts. The festivity has become an important cultural and economic event, stimulating tourism and local commerce.

Since 1985 the Teatro Sá de Miranda has been owned by the municipality, which has restored it to its former glory as one of the leading theatres in the provinces of Portugal. Viana do Castelo has the headquarters of Portugal&#x27;s second oldest newspaper, A Aurora do Lima.

Viana do Castelo is renowned for its traditional pastries, such as the sidónio and the Torta de Viana. The sidónio, an almond-flavored pastry shaped like a coffin, is closely associated with the city&#x27;s oldest bakery, Pastelaria Brasileira. Its name and design pay homage to Sidónio Pais, a prominent Portuguese statesman. The Torta de Viana, also known as Torta Real, is a sweet with origins dating back to 1505, linked to the Convent of Santa Ana in Viana do Castelo. It was historically reserved for special occasions and is recognized today as an iconic symbol of the city’s gastronomy. It was certified in 2021 to ensure adherence to its original recipe.

==Sport==
SC Vianense is the local football club. Founded in 1898, it is one of the oldest clubs in Portugal. They play their home matches at the 3000 capacity Estádio do Dr. José de Matos.

<text>Rahmon Nabiyevich Nabiyev, also spelled Rakhmon Nabiev (; ; 5 October 1930 – 11 April 1993), was a Tajik politician who served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 1982 to 1985 and twice as the 2nd President of Tajikistan from 23 September 1991 to 6 October 1991 and from 2 December 1991 to 7 September 1992. He was also partly responsible for the Tajik Civil War. Rising out of the regional nomenklatura, Nabiyev ascended to power in 1982 as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan. In 1985, he was ousted in a corruption scandal.

After Tajik leaders declared independence on 9 September 1991, Nabiyev orchestrated his way back into power on 23 September, only to step down on 6 October as pressure mounted for him to leave office during the presidential campaign. Nabiyev won the elections, and on 2 December 1991, he became the first elected President of Tajikistan.

==Early years==
Nabiyev was born on 5 October 1931 in a Tajik family of ordinary farmers, in the Khojent District (now the Ghafurov District) of the Leninabad Oblast. Starting in high school, in 1946, at the age of 16, he began to work as an accountant on a collective farm. In the same year he entered the Leninabad Agricultural College, which he graduated in 1949 to continue his studies in Tashkent, entering the Tashkent Institute of Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Engineers. After graduating from this university in 1954, he began to work for two years as the chief engineer of the machine-tractor station in Isfisor.

==Political activity==
In 1961, Nabiyev joined the Communist Party of the Tajik SSR (the republican branch of the CPSU) and began working as a department head. From 1971 to 1973, he was the Minister of Agriculture of the Tajik SSR and in 1973, he became the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tajik SSR, becoming &quot;de facto&quot; head of government. In 1982, Nabiyev was appointed the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, becoming the head of the republic. In 1985 he was dismissed from his post “for addiction to revelry and alcohol”. From 1986 to 1991, he was the Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Council of the Nature Conservation Society of the Tajik SSR. In 1990, he was elected a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR, and on 23 September 1991 he became its chairman.

== Leader of Tajikistan ==
=== Foreign affairs ===
On 21 December 1991, Nabiyev in Alma-Ata, together with the heads of some other former Soviet republics, signed the Alma-Ata Protocol on the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On 2 March 1992, he attended the raising of the flag of Tajikistan near the UN headquarters in New York. On 15 May of that year, he signed the Collective Security Treaty (CST) in Tashkent. Despite pressure from the political opposition, the Russian 201st Military Base at his insistence did not leave Tajikistan. He would later demand that the divisional command staff and junior staff be citizens of the republic. Nabiyev was seen as being pro-Russian and pro-Uzbek position, which saw him see support from Russia&#x27;s Boris Yeltsin, Uzbekistan&#x27;s Islam Karimov, and Kazakhstan&#x27;s Nursultan Nazarbayev respectively.

=== Presidential turmoil ===
Disputes concerning the election led to opposition street demonstrations, which developed into a civil war in May 1992. On 7 September 1992, Nabiyev and an entourage of his were on their way to Dushanbe airport when they were ambushed by opposition forces. At the terminal, Nabiyev was forced to resign at gunpoint. After a meeting and discussions with the armed opposition in the airport&#x27;s VIP lounge, Nabiyev was released.

By December 1992 the Kulyab province&#x27;s former apparatchik turned paramilitary-leader, Emomali Rahmon, was in power.

==Death==
He died on 11 April 1993. The cause of Rahmon Nabiev&#x27;s death is not clear. Officially, he died of a heart attack, but in other versions of the story, he shot himself or was killed. His family, including his daughter Munavvara Nabiyeva, have cast doubt on the official version of his death.

Nabiyev was buried in Khujand, where a state funeral was organized. The funeral commission was headed by Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov and was attended by almost all members of the leadership and government of the republic, including the chairman Emomali Rakhmonov, as well as foreign guests and ambassadors of foreign states.

In his memory, streets, schools and some other state institutions and objects are named after him throughout Tajikistan.

==Personal life==
Nabiyev&#x27;s widow, former First Lady Mariam Nabieva, died in a house fire in December 2017. Rahmon and Mariam had three children: two sons, Rashid and Rustam, as well as a daughter, Munavvara. The eldest son, Rashid, died in 1997 under unclear circumstances. The youngest son Rustam lives in Saint Petersburg and deals with business. Munavvara lives in Dushanbe.

Rakhmon Nabiev loved football, and was a fan of the CSKA Pamir Dushanbe. In addition to the Tajik language, he was fluent in Russian and Uzbek, and understood and spoke a little Persian and Dari.

<doc id="449544" wikidata="Q226887" url="?curid=449544" title="Noh">
<text>is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama that has been performed since the 14th century. It is the oldest major theater art that is still regularly performed today. Noh is often based on tales from traditional literature featuring a supernatural being transformed into a human hero who narrates the story. Noh integrates masks, costumes and various props in a dance-based performance, requiring highly trained actors and musicians. Emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures while the iconic masks represent specific roles such as ghosts, women, deities, and demons. Having a strong emphasis on tradition rather than innovation, Noh is highly codified and regulated by the &quot;iemoto&quot; system.

Although the terms Noh and &quot;nōgaku&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, &quot;nōgaku&quot; encompasses both Noh and &quot;kyōgen&quot;. Traditionally, a full &quot;nōgaku&quot; program included several Noh plays with comedic &quot;kyōgen&quot; plays in between; an abbreviated program of two Noh plays with one &quot;kyōgen&quot; piece has become common today. 

== History ==

===Origins===
The kanji for means &quot;skill&quot;, &quot;craft&quot;, or &quot;talent&quot;, particularly in the field of performing arts in this context. The word Noh may be used alone or with &quot;gaku&quot; (; entertainment, music) to form the word &quot;nōgaku&quot;. Noh is a classical tradition that is highly valued by many today. When used alone, Noh refers to the historical genre of theatre that originated from &quot;sarugaku&quot; in the mid 14th century and continues to be performed today.

One of the oldest forerunners of Noh and &quot;kyōgen&quot; is &quot;&quot;, which was introduced to Japan from China in the 8th century. At the time, the term &quot;sangaku&quot; referred to various types of performance featuring acrobats, song and dance as well as comic sketches. Its subsequent adaptation to Japanese society led to its assimilation of other traditional art forms.&quot; Various performing art elements in &quot;sangaku&quot; as well as elements of &quot;dengaku&quot; (rural celebrations performed in connection with rice planting), &quot;sarugaku&quot; (popular entertainment including acrobatics, juggling, and pantomime), &quot;shirabyōshi &quot;(traditional dances performed by female dancers in the Imperial Court in the 12th century), &quot;gagaku&quot; (music and dance performed in the Imperial Court beginning in the 7th century), and &quot;kagura&quot; (ancient &quot;Shinto&quot; dances in folk tales) evolved into Noh and &quot;kyōgen&quot;.

Studies on the genealogy of the Noh actors in 14th century indicate they were members of families specializing in the performing arts. According to legend, the Konparu School, which is considered to be the oldest tradition of Noh, was founded by Hata no Kawakatsu in the 6th century. However, the founder of the Konparu school, which is widely accepted among historians, was Bishaō Gon no Kami (Komparu Gonnokami) during Nanboku-chō period in the 14th century. According to the genealogical chart of the Konparu school, Bishaō Gon no Kami is a descendant after 53 generations of Hata no Kawakatsu. The Konparu school was descended from the &quot;sarugaku&quot; troupe which had played active roles in Kasuga-taisha and Kofuku-ji in Yamato Province.

Another theory, by Shinhachirō Matsumoto, suggests Noh originated from outcastes struggling to claim higher social status by catering to those in power, namely the new ruling &quot;samurai&quot; class of the time. The transfer of the shogunate from Kamakura to Kyoto at the beginning of Muromachi period marked the increasing power of the samurai class and strengthened the relationship between the shogunate and the court. As Noh became the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s favorite art form, Noh was able to become a courtly art form through this newly formed relationship. In 14th century, with strong support and patronage from &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was able to establish Noh as the most prominent theatre art form of the time.

=== The establishment of Noh by Kan&#x27;ami and Zeami ===

In the 14th century, during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573), Kan&#x27;ami Kiyotsugu and his son Zeami Motokiyo reinterpreted various traditional performing arts and completed Noh in a significantly different form from the traditional one, essentially bringing Noh to the present form. Kan&#x27;ami was a renowned actor with great versatility playing roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong men. When Kan&#x27;ami first presented his work to the 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu fell in love with Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.

Konparu Zenchiku, who was the great-grandson of Bishaō Gon no Kami, the founder of the Konparu school, and the husband of Zeami&#x27;s daughter, incorporated elements of waka (poetry) into Zeami&#x27;s Noh and further developed it.

By this period, among the five major schools of Noh, four were established: the Kanze school, established by Kan&#x27;ami and Zeami; the Hōshō school established by Kan&#x27;ami&#x27;s eldest brother; the Konparu school; and the Kongō school. All of these schools were descendants of the &quot;sarugaku&quot; troupe from Yamato Province. The Ashikaga Shogunate supported only the Kanze school among the four schools.

===Tokugawa era===
During the Edo period, Noh continued to be an aristocratic art form supported by the &quot;shōgun&quot;, the feudal lords (&quot;daimyōs&quot;), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While &quot;kabuki&quot; and &quot;joruri&quot; popular to the middle class focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.

In this era, the Tokugawa shogunate appointed Kanze school as the head of the four schools. Kita Shichidayū (Shichidayū Chōnō), a Noh actor of the Konparu school who served Tokugawa Hidetada, founded the Kita school, which was the last established of the five major schools.

=== Modern Noh after Meiji era ===

The fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868 and the formation of a new, modernized government resulted in the end of financial support by the state, and the entire field of Noh experienced major financial crisis. Shortly after the Meiji Restoration both the number of Noh performers and Noh stages greatly diminished. The support from the imperial government was eventually regained partly due to Noh&#x27;s appeal to foreign diplomats. The companies that remained active throughout the Meiji era also significantly broadened Noh&#x27;s reach by catering to the general public, performing at theatres in major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka.

In 1957 the Japanese Government designated &quot;nōgaku&quot; as an Important Intangible Cultural Property, which affords a degree of legal protection to the tradition as well as its most accomplished practitioners. The National Noh Theatre founded by the government in 1983 stages regular performances and organizes courses to train actors in the leading roles of &quot;nōgaku&quot;. Noh was inscribed in 2008 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO as Nōgaku theatre.

Although the terms &quot;nōgaku&quot; and Noh are sometimes used interchangeably, the Japanese government&#x27;s definition of &quot;nōgaku&quot; theatre encompasses both Noh plays and &quot;kyōgen&quot; plays. &quot;Kyōgen&quot; is performed in between Noh plays in the same space. Compared to Noh, &quot;&quot;kyōgen&quot; relies less on the use of masks and is derived from the humorous plays of the &quot;sangaku&quot;, as reflected in its comic dialogue.&quot;

=== Women in Noh ===
During the Edo period, the guild system gradually tightened, which largely excluded women from Noh, except for some women (such as courtesans) performing songs in marginal situations. Later, in the Meiji era, Noh performers taught wealthy people and nobles, and this led to more opportunities for female performers because women insisted on female teachers. In the early 1900s, after women were allowed to join Tokyo Music School, the rules forbidding women from joining various schools and associations in Noh were relaxed. In 1948, the first women joined the Nohgaku Performers&#x27; Association. In 2004, the first women joined the Association for Japanese Noh Plays. In 2007, the National Noh Theatre began to annually present regular programs by female performers. In 2009, there were about 1200 male and 200 female professional Noh performers.

==&quot;Jo-ha-kyū&quot;==

The concept of &quot;jo-ha-kyū&quot; dictates virtually every element of Noh including compiling of a program of plays, structuring of each play, songs and dances within plays, and the basic rhythms within each Noh performance. &quot;Jo&quot; means beginning, &quot;ha&quot; means breaking, and &quot;kyū&quot; means rapid or urgent. The term originated in &quot;gagaku&quot;, ancient courtly music, to indicate gradually increasing tempo and was adopted in various Japanese traditions including Noh, tea ceremony, poetry, and flower arrangement.

&quot;Jo-ha-kyū&quot; is incorporated in the traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is &quot;jo&quot;, the second, third, and fourth plays are &quot;ha&quot;, and the fifth play is &quot;kyū&quot;. In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the program would represent &quot;jo-ha-kyū&quot; when one play from each category is selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at &quot;jo&quot;, gets slightly faster at &quot;ha&quot;, then culminates in &quot;kyū&quot;.

== Roles and Training ==
=== Roles ===
There are four major categories of Noh performers: &quot;shite&quot;, &quot;waki&quot;, &quot;kyōgen&quot;, and &quot;hayashi&quot;.

# &quot;Shite&quot; (仕手, シテ). &quot;Shite&quot; is the main protagonist, or the leading role in plays. In plays where the &quot;shite&quot; appears first as a human and then as a ghost, the first role is known as the &quot;mae-shite&quot; and the later as the &quot;nochi-shite&quot;.
#* &quot;Shitetsure&quot; (仕手連れ, シテヅレ). The &quot;shite&#x27;s&quot; companion. Sometimes &quot;shitetsure&quot; is abbreviated to &quot;tsure&quot; (連れ, ツレ), although this term refers to both the &quot;shitetsure&quot; and the &quot;wakitsure&quot;.
#* &quot;Kōken&quot; (後見) are stage hands, usually one to three people.
#* &quot;Jiutai&quot; (地謡) is the chorus, usually comprising six to eight people.
# &quot;Waki&quot; (脇, ワキ) performs the role that is the counterpart or foil of the &quot;shite&quot;.
#* &quot;Wakitsure&quot; (脇連れ, ワキヅレ) or &quot;Waki-tsure&quot; is the companion of the &quot;waki&quot;.
# &quot;Kyōgen&quot; (狂言) perform the &quot;aikyōgen&quot; (間狂言), which are interludes during plays. &quot;Kyōgen&quot; actors also perform in separate plays between individual Noh plays.
# &quot;Hayashi&quot; (囃子) or &quot;hayashi-kata&quot; (囃子方) are the instrumentalists who play the four instruments used in Noh theatre: the transverse , or , the , and the . The flute used for Noh is specifically called .

A typical Noh play always involves the chorus, the orchestra, and at least one &quot;shite&quot; and one &quot;waki&quot; actor.

=== Training ===
Actors begin their training as young children, traditionally at the age of three.

Zeami identified nine levels or types of Noh acting. Lower levels emphasize movement. Higher levels are metaphorically compared with the opening of a flower and involve spiritual prowess.

There are five extant schools training &quot;shite&quot; actors: Kanze (観世), Hōshō (宝生), Komparu (金春), Kongō (金剛), and Kita (喜多). Each school has its own &quot;iemoto&quot; family that carries the name of the school and is considered the most important. The &quot;iemoto&quot; holds the power to create new plays or modify lyrics and performance modes. 

&quot;Waki&quot; actors are trained in the schools Takayasu (高安), Fukuou (福王), and Hōshō (宝生). 

Two schools train &quot;kyōgen&quot; actors: Ōkura (大蔵) and Izumi (和泉). 

Eleven schools train instrumentalists, each school specializing in one to three instruments.

The Nohgaku Performers&#x27; Association (&quot;Nōgaku Kyōkai&quot;), with which all professionals are registered, strictly protects the traditions passed down from performers&#x27; ancestors (see &quot;iemoto&quot;). However, several secret documents of the Kanze school written by Zeami, as well as materials by Konparu Zenchiku, have been diffused throughout the community of scholars of Japanese theatre.

==Performance elements==
Noh performance combines a variety of elements into a stylistic whole, with each particular element the product of generations of refinement according to the central Buddhist, Shinto, and minimalist aspects of Noh&#x27;s aesthetic principles.

===Masks===

Noh masks (能面 &quot;nō-men&quot; or 面 &quot;omote&quot;) are carved from blocks of Japanese cypress (檜 &quot;hinoki&quot;), and painted with natural pigments on a neutral base of glue and crushed seashell. There are approximately 450 different masks mostly based on sixty types, all of which have distinctive names. Some masks are representative and frequently used in many different plays, while some are very specific and may only be used in one or two plays. Noh masks signify the characters&#x27; gender, age, and social ranking, and by wearing masks the actors may portray youngsters, old men, female, or nonhuman (divine or demonic) characters. Only the &quot;shite&quot;, the main actor, wears a mask in most plays, although the &quot;tsure&quot; may also wear a mask in some plays.

Even though the mask covers an actor&#x27;s facial expressions, the use of the mask in Noh is not an abandonment of facial expressions altogether. Rather, its intent is to stylize and codify the facial expressions through the use of the mask and to stimulate the imagination of the audience. By using masks, actors are able to convey emotions in a more controlled manner through movements and body language. Some masks utilize lighting effect to convey different emotions through slight tilting of the head. Facing slightly upward, or &quot;brightening&quot; the mask, will let the mask to capture more light, revealing more features that appear laughing or smiling. Facing downward, or &quot;clouding&quot; it, will cause the mask to appear sad or mad.

Noh masks are treasured by Noh families and institutions, and the powerful Noh schools hold the oldest and most valuable Noh masks in their private collections, rarely seen by the public. The most ancient mask is supposedly kept as a hidden treasure by the oldest school, the Konparu. According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask was carved by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572–622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku&#x27;s mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami&#x27;s &quot;Style and the Flower&quot; written in the 14th century. Some of the masks of the Konparu school belong to the Tokyo National Museum, and are exhibited there frequently.

===Stage===

The traditional Noh stage (&quot;butai&quot;) has complete openness that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience throughout the performance. Without any proscenium or curtains to obstruct the view, the audience sees each actor even during the moments before they enter (and after they exit) the central &quot;stage&quot; (&quot;honbutai&quot;, &quot;main stage&quot;). The theatre itself is considered symbolic and treated with reverence both by the performers and the audience.

One of the most recognizable characteristic of Noh stage is its independent roof that hangs over the stage even in indoor theatres. Supported by four columns, the roof symbolizes the sanctity of the stage, with its architectural design derived from the worship pavilion (&quot;haiden&quot;) or sacred dance pavilion (&quot;kagura-den&quot;) of Shinto shrines. The roof also unifies the theatre space and defines the stage as an architectural entity.

The pillars supporting the roof are named &quot;shitebashira&quot; (principal character&#x27;s pillar), &quot;metsukebashira&quot; (gazing pillar), &quot;wakibashira&quot; (secondary character&#x27;s pillar), and &quot;fuebashira&quot; (flute pillar), clockwise from upstage right respectively. Each pillar is associated with the performers and their actions.

The stage is made entirely of unfinished &quot;hinoki&quot;, Japanese cypress, with almost no decorative elements. The poet and novelist Tōson Shimazaki writes that &quot;on the stage of the Noh theatre there are no sets that change with each piece. Neither is there a curtain. There is only a simple panel (&quot;kagami-ita&quot;) with a painting of a green pine tree. This creates the impression that anything that could provide any shading has been banished. To break such monotony and make something happen is no easy thing.&quot;

Another unique feature of the stage is the &quot;hashigakari&quot;, a narrow bridge at upstage right used by actors to enter the stage. &quot;Hashigakari&quot; means &quot;suspension bridge&quot;, signifying something aerial that connects two separate worlds on a same level. The bridge symbolizes the mythic nature of Noh plays in which otherworldly ghosts and spirits frequently appear. In contrast, &quot;hanamichi&quot; in Kabuki theatres is literally a path (&quot;michi&quot;) that connects two spaces in a single world, thus has a completely different significance.

===Costumes===

Noh actors wear silk costumes called &quot;shozoku&quot; (robes) along with wigs, hats, and props such as the fan. With striking colors, elaborate texture, and intricate weave and embroidery, Noh robes are truly works of art in their own right. Costumes for the &quot;shite&quot; in particular are extravagant, shimmering silk brocades, but are progressively less sumptuous for the &quot;tsure,&quot; the &quot;wakizure,&quot; and the &quot;aikyōgen&quot;.

For centuries, in accordance with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street clothing for a peasant or commoner. But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and &quot;samurai&quot; in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.

The musicians and chorus typically wear formal &quot;montsuki&quot; &quot;kimono&quot; (black and adorned with five family crests) accompanied by either &quot;hakama&quot; (a skirt-like garment) or &quot;kami-shimo&quot;, a combination of &quot;hakama&quot; and a waist-coat with exaggerated shoulders. Finally, the stage attendants are garbed in virtually unadorned black garments, much in the same way as stagehands in contemporary Western theatre.

===Props===
The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most commonly used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the &quot;obi &quot;(the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer&#x27;s side when he or she takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing brush. The fan may represent various objects over the course of a single play.

When hand props other than fans are used, they are usually introduced or retrieved by &quot;kuroko&quot; who fulfill a similar role to stage crew in contemporary theatre. Like their Western counterparts, stage attendants for Noh traditionally dress in black, but unlike in Western theatre they may appear on stage during a scene, or may remain on stage during an entire performance, in both cases in plain view of the audience. The all-black costume of &quot;kuroko&quot; implies they are not part of the action on stage and are effectively invisible.

Set pieces in Noh such as the boats, wells, altars, and bells, are typically carried onto the stage before the beginning of the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed to conceal the actor and to allow a costume change during the &quot;kyōgen&quot; interlude.

===Chant and music===
Noh theatre is accompanied by a chorus and a &quot;hayashi&quot; ensemble (&quot;Noh-bayashi&quot; 能囃子). Noh is a chanted drama, and a few commentators have dubbed it &quot;Japanese opera&quot;. However, the singing in Noh involves a limited tonal range, with lengthy, repetitive passages in a narrow dynamic range. Texts are poetic, relying heavily on the Japanese seven-five rhythm common to nearly all forms of Japanese poetry, with an economy of expression, and an abundance of allusion. The singing parts of Noh are called &quot;&quot;Utai&quot; and the speaking parts &quot;Kataru&quot;&quot;. The music has many blank spaces (&quot;ma&quot;) in between the actual sounds, and these negative blank spaces are in fact considered the heart of the music. In addition to &quot;utai&quot;, Noh &quot;hayashi&quot; ensemble consists of four musicians, also known as the &quot;hayashi-kata&quot;, including three drummers, which play the &quot;shime-daiko&quot;, &quot;ōtsuzumi&quot; (hip drum), and &quot;kotsuzumi&quot; (shoulder drum) respectively, and a &quot;nohkan&quot; flutist.

The chant is not always performed &quot;in character&quot;; that is, sometimes the actor will speak lines or describe events from the perspective of another character or even a disinterested narrator. Far from breaking the rhythm of the performance, this is actually in keeping with the otherworldly feel of many Noh plays, especially in those characterized as &quot;mugen&quot;.

==Plays==
Of the roughly 2000 plays created for Noh that are known today, about 240 make up the current repertoire performed by the five existing Noh schools. The current repertoire is heavily influenced by the taste of aristocratic class in Tokugawa period and does not necessarily reflect popularity among the commoners. There are several ways to classify Noh plays.

=== Subject ===
All Noh plays can be classified into three broad categories.
* &quot;Genzai&quot; Noh (現在能, &quot;present Noh&quot;) features human characters and events unfold according to a linear timeline within the play.
* &quot;Mugen&quot; Noh (夢幻能, &quot;supernatural Noh&quot;) involves supernatural worlds, featuring gods, spirits, ghosts, or phantasms in the &quot;shite&quot; role. Time is often depicted as passing in a non-linear fashion, and action may switch between two or more timeframes from moment to moment, including flashbacks.
* &quot;Ryōkake&quot; Noh (両掛能, &quot;mixed Noh&quot;), though somewhat uncommon, is a of the above with the first act being &quot;Genzai&quot; Noh and the second act &quot;Mugen&quot; Noh.
While &quot;Genzai&quot; Noh utilizes internal and external conflicts to drive storylines and bring out emotions, &quot;Mugen&quot; Noh focuses on utilizing flashbacks of the past and the deceased to invoke emotions.

===Performance style===
Additionally, all Noh plays may be categorized by their style.
* &quot;Geki&quot; Noh (劇能) is a drama piece based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action.
* &quot;Furyū&quot; Noh (風流能) is little more than a dance piece characterized by elaborate stage action, often involving acrobatics, stage properties, and multiple characters.

===Theme===
All Noh plays are divided by their themes into the following five categories. This classification is considered the most practical, and is still used in formal programming choices today. Traditionally, a formal 5-play program is composed of a selection from each of the groups.
# &quot;Kami mono&quot; (神物, god plays) or &quot;waki Noh&quot; (脇能) typically feature the &quot;shite&quot; in the role of a deity to tell the mythic story of a shrine or praise a particular god. Many of them structured in two acts, the deity takes a human form in disguise in the first act and reveals the real self in the second act. (e.g. &quot;Takasago&quot;, &quot;Chikubushima&quot;)
# &quot;Shura mono&quot; (修羅物, warrior plays) or &quot;ashura Noh&quot; (阿修羅能) takes its name from the Buddhist underworld. The protagonist appearing as a ghost of a famous &quot;samurai&quot; pleads to a monk for salvation and the drama culminates in a glorious re-enactment of the scene of his death in a full war costume. (e.g. &quot;Tamura&quot;, &quot;Atsumori&quot;)
# &quot;Katsura mono&quot; (鬘物, wig plays) or &quot;onna mono&quot; (女物, woman plays) depict the &quot;shite&quot; in a female role and feature some of the most refined songs and dances in all of Noh, reflecting the smooth and flowing movements representing female characters. (e.g. &quot;Basho&quot;, &quot;Matsukaze&quot;)
# There are about 94 &quot;miscellaneous&quot; plays traditionally performed in the fourth place in a five-play program. These plays include subcategories &quot;kyōran mono&quot; (狂乱物, madness plays), &quot;onryō mono&quot; (怨霊物, vengeful ghost plays), &quot;genzai mono&quot; (現在物, present plays), as well as others. (e.g. &quot;Aya no tsuzumi&quot;, &quot;Kinuta&quot;)
# &quot;Kiri Noh&quot; (切り能, final plays) or &quot;oni mono&quot; (鬼物, demon plays) usually feature the &quot;shite&quot; in the role of monsters, goblins, or demons, and are often selected for their bright colors and fast-paced, tense finale movements. Kiri Noh is performed the last in a five-play program. There are roughly 30 plays in this category, most of which are shorter than the plays in the other categories.

In addition to the above five, &quot;Okina&quot; (翁) (or &quot;Kamiuta&quot;) is frequently performed at the very beginning of the program, especially at New Year, holidays, and other special occasions. Combining dance with Shinto ritual, it is considered the oldest type of Noh play.

=== Famous plays ===

The following categorization is that of the Kanze school.
== Influence in the West ==
Many Western artists have been influenced by Noh.

===Theatre practitioners===
* Eugenio Barba – Between 1966 and 1972, Japanese Noh Masters Hideo Kanze and Hisao Kanze gave seminars on Noh at Barba&#x27;s Theater Laboratory of Holstebro. Barba primarily studied the physical aspects of Noh.
* Samuel Beckett – Yoshihiko Ikegami considers Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; a parody of Noh, particularly &quot;Kami&quot; Noh, in which a god or a spirit appears before a secondary character as the protagonist. Ikegami argues that &quot;the dramatic conflict which was much in evidence in Yeats is so completely discarded that Beckett&#x27;s theatre (where &#x27;nothing happens&#x27;) comes to look even closer to Noh than Yeats&#x27;s did.&quot;
* Bertolt Brecht – According to Maria P. Alter, Brecht began reading Japanese plays during the middle twenties and have read at least 20 Noh plays translated into German by 1929. Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Der Jasager&quot; is an adaptation of a Noh play &quot;Taniko&quot;. Brecht himself identified &quot;Die Massnahme&quot; as an adaptation of Noh play.
* Peter Brook – Yoshi Oida, a Japanese actor with training in Noh, began working with Brook in their production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; in 1968. Oida later joined Brook&#x27;s company.
* Paul Claudel – According to John Willett, Paul Claudel learned about Noh during the time he served as French Ambassador to Japan. Claudel&#x27;s opera &quot;Christophe Colomb&quot; shows an unmistakable influence of the Noh.
* Jacques Copeau – In 1923, Copeau worked on a Noh play, &quot;Kantan,&quot; along with Suzanne Bing at Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, without ever having seen a Noh play. Thomas Leabhart states that &quot;Jacques Copeau was drawn instinctively by taste and tendency to a restrained theatre which was based in spirituality.&quot; Copeau praised Noh theatre in writing when he finally saw a production in 1930.
* Guillaume Gallienne - &quot;Deguchinashi&quot; (Huis-Clos) by Jean-Paul Sartre, a Noh version of Sartre&#x27;s play directed by Guillaume Gallienne at the Noh Tessenkai theatre, Tokyo in 2006.
* Jacques Lecoq – Physical theatre taught at L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq founded by Lecoq is influenced by Noh.
* Eugene O&#x27;Neill – O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s plays &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, and &quot;Hughie&quot; have various similarities to Noh plays.
* Thornton Wilder – Wilder himself expressed his interest in Noh in his &quot;Preface” to &quot;Three Plays&quot; and his sister Isabel Wilder also confirmed his interests. Wilder&#x27;s work &quot;Our Town&quot; incorporates various elements of Noh such as lack of plot, representative characters, and use of ghosts.

===Composers===
* William Henry Bell – An English composer Bell wrote music for modern presentation of several Noh plays, including &quot;Komachi&quot; (1925), &quot;Tsuneyo of the Three Trees&quot; (1926), &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; (1934), &quot;The Pillow of Kantan&quot; (1935), and &quot;Kageyiko&quot; (1936).
* Benjamin Britten – Britten visited Japan in 1956 and saw for the first time Japanese Noh plays, which he called &quot;some of the most wonderful drama I have ever seen.&quot; The influences were seen and heard in his ballet &quot;The Prince of the Pagodas&quot; (1957) and later in two of the three semi-operatic &quot;Parables for Church Performance&quot;: &quot;Curlew River&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1968).
* David Byrne – Byrne encountered Noh when he was on tour in Japan with Talking Heads and he was inspired by the highly stylized practices of Noh, completely different from its Western counterparts that focus on naturalism. According to Josh Kun, &quot;Japanese Noh theatre inspired him to design the oversize business suit that became a visual staple of Talking Heads live shows.&quot;
* Alan Watts – 20th century philosopher, the liner notes from his third song off the 1962 album &#x27;This is IT&#x27; state &quot;Watts in a Japanese no-noh.&quot;
* Harry Partch – Partch called his work &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot; &quot;a ritualistic web&quot;. Kate Molleson wrote for &quot;&#x27;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;the narrative is a bleary mix of Japanese Noh theatre, Ethiopian folk mythology, Greek drama and his own wacky imagination&quot;. Will Salmon cites Partch himself writing, &quot;Noh has been for centuries a fine art, one of the most sophisticated the world has known.&quot; &quot;Delusion of the Fury&quot; incorporates two Noh plays, &quot;Atsumori&quot; by Zeami and &quot;Ikuta&quot; by Zenbō Motoyasu, into its story.
* Karlheinz Stockhausen – The essentially plotless libretto of Stockhausen&#x27;s grand operatic cycle &quot;Licht&quot; (&quot;Light&quot;) is based on &quot;a mythology drawing on multiple cultural traditions, from Japanese Noh theatre to German folklore&quot;.
* Iannis Xenakis – Xenakis &quot;admired Noh, the venerable theatrical form known for its ritualistic formality and gestural complexity.&quot; Electronic Music Foundation presented &quot;Xenakis &amp; Japan&quot; in March 2010, &quot;a dance/music event highlighting Xenakis&#x27; lifelong interest in Japanese music and theatre&quot;. The event featured a female Noh performer, Ryoko Aoki.

=== Classicists ===
* Scholar Akiko Kiso collaborated with Mae J. Smethurst, writing and translating several works that compared compared the Greek tragedy form of theatre with noh.

===Poets===
* W. B. Yeats – Yeats wrote an essay on Noh titled &quot;Certain Noble Plays of Japan&quot; in 1916. As much as he tried to learn Noh, there were limited resources available in England at the time. The lack of complete understanding of Noh led him to create innovative works guided by his own imagination and what he fantasized Noh to be. Yeats wrote four plays heavily influenced by Noh, using ghosts or supernatural beings as the central &quot;dramatis personae&quot; for the first time. The plays are &quot;At the Hawk&#x27;s Well&quot;, &quot;The Dreaming of the Bones&quot;, &quot;The Words upon the Window-Pane&quot;, and &quot;Purgatory&quot;.

==Aesthetic terminology==
Zeami and Zenchiku describe a number of distinct qualities that are thought to be essential to the proper understanding of Noh as an art form.
* Hana (花, flower): In the &quot;Kadensho&quot; (Instructions on the Posture of the Flower), Zeami describes &quot;hana&quot; saying &quot;after you master the secrets of all things and exhaust the possibilities of every device, the &quot;hana&quot; that never vanishes still remains.&quot; The true Noh performer seeks to cultivate a rarefied relationship with his audience similar to the way that one cultivates flowers. What is notable about &quot;hana&quot; is that, like a flower, it is meant to be appreciated by any audience, no matter how lofty or how coarse his upbringing. &quot;Hana&quot; comes in two forms. Individual &quot;hana&quot; is the beauty of the flower of youth, which passes with time, while &quot;true &quot;hana&quot;&quot; is the flower of creating and sharing perfect beauty through performance.
* Yūgen (幽玄, profound sublimity): &quot;Yūgen&quot; is a concept valued in various forms of art throughout Japanese culture. Originally used to mean elegance or grace representing the perfect beauty in &quot;waka&quot;, &quot;yūgen&quot; is invisible beauty that is felt rather than seen in a work of art. The term is used specifically in relation to Noh to mean the profound beauty of the transcendental world, including mournful beauty involved in sadness and loss.
* Rōjaku (老弱): &quot;Rō&quot; means old, and &quot;jaku&quot; means tranquil and quiet. Rōjaku is the final stage of performance development of the Noh actor, in which he eliminates all unnecessary action or sound in the performance, leaving only the true essence of the scene or action being imitated.
* Kokoro or shin (both 心): Defined as &quot;heart,&quot; &quot;mind,&quot; or both. The kokoro of noh is that which Zeami speaks of in his teachings, and is more easily defined as &quot;mind.&quot; To develop hana the actor must enter a state of no-mind, or mushin.
* Myō (妙): the &quot;charm&quot; of an actor who performs flawlessly and without any sense of imitation; he effectively becomes his role.
* Monomane (物真似, imitation or mimesis): the intent of a Noh actor to accurately depict the motions of his role, as opposed to purely aesthetic reasons for abstraction or embellishment. &quot;Monomane&quot; is sometimes contrasted with &quot;yūgen&quot;, although the two represent endpoints of a continuum rather than being completely separate.
* Kabu-isshin (歌舞一心, &quot;song-dance-one heart&quot;): the theory that the song (including poetry) and dance are two halves of the same whole, and that the Noh actor strives to perform both with total unity of heart and mind.

==Existing Noh theatres==
Noh is still regularly performed today in public theatres as well as private theatres mostly located in major cities. There are more than 70 Noh theatres throughout Japan, presenting both professional and amateur productions.

Public theatres include National Noh Theatre (Tokyo), Nagoya Noh Theater, Osaka Noh Theater, and Fukuoka Noh Theater. Each Noh school has its own permanent theatre, such as Kanze Noh Theater (Tokyo), Hosho Noh Theater (Tokyo), Kongo Noh Theater (Kyoto), Nara Komparu Noh Theater (Nara), and Taka no Kai (Fukuoka). Additionally, there are various prefectural and municipal theatres located throughout Japan that present touring professional companies and local amateur companies. In some regions, unique regional Noh such as Ogisai Kurokawa Noh have developed to form schools independent from five traditional schools.

==Audience etiquette==
Audience etiquette is generally similar to formal Western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow along in the libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.

At the end of the play, the actors file out slowly (most important first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (&quot;hashigakari&quot;), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in Western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the &quot;shite&quot; character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in &quot;Kokaji,&quot; for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.

During the interval, tea, coffee, and &quot;wagashi&quot; (Japanese sweets) may be served in the lobby. In the Edo period, when Noh was a day-long affair, more substantial &quot;makunouchi&#x27; bentō&quot; (幕の内弁当, &quot;between-acts lunchbox&quot;) were served. On special occasions, when the performance is over, お神酒 (&quot;o-miki,&quot; ceremonial &quot;sake&quot;) may be served in the lobby on the way out, as it happens in Shinto rituals.

The audience is seated in front of the stage, to the left side of the stage, and in the corner front-left of stage; these are in order of decreasing desirability. While the &quot;metsuke-bashira&quot; pillar obstructs the view of the stage, the actors are primarily at the corners, not the center, and thus the two aisles are located where the views of the two main actors would be obscured, ensuring a generally clear view regardless of seating.

<doc id="449546" wikidata="Q117676" url="?curid=449546" title="Viseu">
<text>Viseu () is a city and municipality in the Centro Region of Portugal and the capital of the district of the same name, with a population of 100,105 inhabitants in the entire municipality, and center of the Viseu Dão Lafões intermunipical community, with 267,633 inhabitants.

Settled during the period of the early Iberian Castro culture, the territory of Viseu was populated by a series of cultures including the Romans, Suebs, Visigoths and Moors. During the Roman occupation of Iberia, Viriathus, the rebel leader of the Lusitanians, is assumed to have lived for a time in the vicinity. During the Middle Ages, the city often served as a seat for Visigothic nobles (such as King Roderic), and is considered one of the probable birthplaces of Afonso Henriques, first King of Portugal.

Viseu is a regional economic hub with a strong wine industry and is the seat of the international conglomerate Visabeira. The city is also a cultural center, home to the nationally acclaimed Grão Vasco Museum, the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Viseu, and a center for higher learning institutions, namely the Catholic University of Portugal and the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu.

==History==
The origins of the city of Viseu date back to the pre-Roman period, with its name being reconstructed from the indigenous word &quot;&#x27;Vissaîegobor&quot;&#x27; as *Vissaium, perhaps with a latinised suffix.

With its Romanisation the settlement gained importance, being at the intersection of a series of Roman roads linking Mérida, Lisbon, and Galicia.

Viseu is associated with Viriathus, since it is thought that the Lusitanian hero may have been born in this region. After the Roman occupation of the peninsula, under the Visigoths, the settlement was elevated to the status of city and to the seat of a diocese by at least the 6th century.

===Middle Ages===
The origins of Viseu extend to proto-history, when migrating groups settled the territory, including the Celts and Lusitanians. Roman colonists settled in these territories during eras of prosperity and peace, leading eventually to Suebic, Gothic and Muslim cultures. The Suebic peoples, by the middle of the 6th century, had already established a community, with a bishop that existed at the suffrage of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Braga. With the arrival of North African Muslims, the Visigoths escaped the territory to the distant mountains of Asturias.

The lands of Viseu frequently switched hands between the Christians and Moors, who referred to Viseu as Bazu, and was definitely taken in 1058, due to the victory of Ferdinand I of León. But, his siege left such destruction that only in 1147–1148, during the Reconquista, that the Diocese of Viseu had the conditions to support a bishop. For many years it had been absorbed by the Bishopric of Coimbra, due to the intervention of the priors, including S. Teotónio. Viseu began recuperating its importance as an urban centre; &quot;rapidly, [it] recuperated its lost transitory brilliance or worsened its activities and differentiation social&quot;. It was another three centuries of laborious peace that allowed Viseu to grow once more. It was following the death of King Ferdinand I, the Castilians sought to enforce (by force-of-arms), its rights to the lands/territories of the County of Portugal.

During Countship of Portugal, Viseu served as the seat of the Corte of Henry, Count of Portugal and Countess Teresa, who granted a foral to the city in 1123. Viseu is one of the possible birthplaces of their son Afonso Henriques in 1109. Following the successful defense of his hereditary rights, and supported by nobles and clergy, Afonso Henriques founded the kingdom of Portugal. Viseu was granted a new charter 1187, that was later reinforced by his grandson, King Afonso II of Portugal, in 1217.

During the 1383–85 Crisis, the city was besieged by the forces of Juan I of Castile, leading to King John I of Portugal starting construction on a series of defensive fortifications which would continue being built until the reign of King Afonso V of Portugal.

The city became part of a fiefdom, when Prince Henry the Navigator, son of King John I of Portugal, was made Duke of Viseu, in 1415.

In 1475, Vasco Fernandes, a famed artist of the Portuguese Renaissance, was born in the city,

In 1513, King Manuel I of Portugal renewed the charter of Viseu and a series of works were taken on throughout the city, with the opening of the first square of the city, the &quot;Rossio&quot;.

In the 19th century, a new Municipal Palace was built in the Rossio, significantly altering the flow of the city, moving it away from the medieval center to newer parts of the city.

==Geography==

Viseu is approximately East of the Atlantic Ocean. Surrounded by a number of mountains – Leomil, Montemuro, Lapa, Arada, Estrela and Caramulo – the tops of which are covered with thick layers of snow in Winter time, the district is crossed by a network of rivers and streamlets.

The city of Viseu has an almost central position in relation to the District lying on the so-called Viseu Plateau (in Portuguese &quot;Planalto de Viseu&quot;). It is surrounded by a mountainous system constituted to the north by the Leonil, Montemuro, and Lapa hills, to the northeast by the Arado hills, to the south and southeast by the &quot;Serra da Estrela&quot; and the Lousã hills and to the west by the Caramulo hills.

The Municipality is characterized by an irregular surface with altitudes ranging between . With rough terrain, it has numerous water courses. These are found in three basins: the Vouga, the Dão and the Paiva.

===Climate===
Situated in a zone of transition, the &quot;concelho&quot; has several micro-climates. The Serra do Caramulo, located to the west of the city, plays an important role in climatic terms by lessening the influences of the western air masses (although the Mondego River&#x27;s basin makes the penetration easier). Consequently, Viseu&#x27;s climate is characterized by the existence of high temperature extremes, with cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.

Viseu has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot;, bordering &quot;Csa&quot;), with the 1981–2010 averages indicating it just below the isotherm. Its inland position and relative altitude contribute to cooler winters than in coastal areas of the country, with an average of 31 days with frost per year; as well as a relatively large diurnal temperature variation and lower averages than more low-lying inland cities in the central-north area of the country such as Castelo Branco. In spite of its inland position, the maritime influence is strong enough for there to be a seasonal lag resulting in September averaging similar temperatures as June for the 1981–2010 reference period. This also applies to October and May. However, temperatures drop sharply in November, resulting in a smaller lag for the winter season. July and August are the driest and hottest months, with daytime highs averaging for both months. Winters are much wetter with an average December precipitation of .



===Human geography===

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 25 civil parishes:

* Abraveses
* Barreiros e Cepões
* Boa Aldeia, Farminhão e Torredeita
* Bodiosa
* Calde
* Campo
* Cavernães
* Cota
* Couto de Baixo e Couto de Cima
* Faíl e Vila Chã de Sá
* Fragosela
* Lordosa
* Mundão
* Orgens
* Povolide
* Ranhados
* Repeses e São Salvador
* Ribafeita
* Rio de Loba
* Santos Evos 
* São Cipriano e Vil de Souto
* São João de Lourosa
* São Pedro de France
* Silgueiros
* Viseu
Due to migration in the 1960s, Viseu suffered a great decline in its population. After the end of the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), with the return of refugees from the Portuguese African colonies that achieved independence, and resulting economic and demographic growth, starting at the end of the 1970s, the municipality increased its population by about 10 percent, giving it an estimated population of 83,261 people. Afterwards, a stagnation set in, confirmed by the 1991 census which showed a population of 83,601.

==International relations==

As of 2023, Viseu is twinned with:

* Abidjan, Ivory Coast
* Arezzo, Italy
* Campinas, Brazil
* Cantagalo, São Tomé and Príncipe
* Elvas, Portugal
* Haskovo, Bulgaria
* Lublin, Poland
* Marly-le-Roi, France
* Matola, Mozambique
* Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
* São Filipe, Cape Verde
* Taiyuan, China
==Economy==
The city and the region are famous for its wine (Dão Wine) and the Dão Wine Institute, the &quot;Solar do Vinho do Dão&quot; can be found in the city. There is also an annual fair, the &quot;Feira de São Mateus&quot;. Furthermore, Viseu is also known for local handicrafts which include black pottery, bobbin lace, embroidery, and copper and wrought iron articles. With the good connections to major industrial centers and to the ports of Aveiro and Leixões, several industries have been installed in Viseu. Visabeira, a Portugal-based international conglomerate with interests in telecommunications, construction, industry, tourism, real estate and diversified services is headquartered in the city. Viseu also hosts a central hospital (Hospital of São Teotónio), two shopping &amp; cinema complexes (the &quot;Fórum&quot; (2005) and the &quot;Palácio do Gelo&quot; (2008)), and numerous hostels and hotels in all categories.

==Transportation==
The city of Viseu has a bus network – MUV – which operates several lines within the entire municipality and a recently installed funicular connecting the lower city with the upper city. The A25 motorway (formerly called IP5) connects Viseu to the seaport of Aveiro and Guarda and then on to Salamanca in Spain. The IP3 and A24, connecting Coimbra with Chaves on the Spanish border, cross Viseu from south to north. Until the nineteen eighties Viseu had railway connections with the coast, but these were closed.

Viseu is now one of the largest cities in Europe without a railway connection. Once it was connected to Aveiro (via the Vouga line, a narrow gauge railway), and Santa Comba Dão (on the Dão line, another narrow gauge railway), where it had a connection to the Linha da Beira Alta (broad gauge; international). The Dão line closed to passengers in 1988.

The municipality has an airfield – the Viseu Airport (code VSE) also known as Lobato, parish of Lordosa, Viseu – that offers scheduled commercial flights to some domestic destinations with Aero VIP.

==Education==
Viseu is the location of the state-run &quot;Instituto Politécnico de Viseu&quot; which has higher education polytechnic schools of education, technology and management, and agronomy. The city&#x27;s political and civic groups have been pressuring the national government to upgrade this school into a university, but its desire was never achieved. However, there are 2 private university institutions, the &quot;Universidade Católica Portuguesa&quot; and the &quot;Instituto Piaget&quot;. Furthermore, since the Bologna process, the difference between universities and polytechnics is less relevant, with the exception of some degrees like medicine, economics or law, that are only awarded in universities.

There are three secondary education (the Portuguese equivalent of High School) establishments: the &quot;Escola Secundária de Viriato&quot;, &quot;Escola Secundária Alves Martins&quot; and &quot;Escola Secundária Emídio Navarro&quot;.

<text>Licence to Kill is a 1989 spy film, the sixteenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions, and the second and final film to star Timothy Dalton as the MI6 agent James Bond. In the film, Bond resigns from MI6 in order to take revenge against the drug lord Franz Sanchez who ordered an attack against Bond&#x27;s friend and CIA agent Felix Leiter and the murder of Felix&#x27;s wife after their wedding.

&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was the fifth and final Bond film directed by John Glen and the last to feature Robert Brown as M and Caroline Bliss as Miss Moneypenny. It was also the last to feature the work of screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder and producer Albert R. Broccoli, who all died in the following years.

&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was the first Bond film to &quot;not&quot; use the title of an Ian Fleming story. Originally titled &quot;Licence Revoked&quot;, the name was changed during post-production due to American test audiences associating the term with driving licence. Although the plot is largely original, it contains elements of the Fleming novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and the short story &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, interwoven with a sabotage premise influenced by Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

For budget reasons, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; became the first Bond film shot entirely outside the United Kingdom: principal photography took place on location in Mexico and the United States, while interiors were filmed at Estudios Churubusco instead of Pinewood Studios. The film earned over $156 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews but criticism for the darker tone.

==Plot==

DEA agents collect MI6 agent James Bond and his friend, CIA agent Felix Leiter, on their way to Leiter&#x27;s wedding in Key West, to have them assist in capturing drug lord Franz Sanchez. Bond and Leiter capture Sanchez by attaching a hook and cord to Sanchez&#x27;s plane and pulling it out of the air with a Coast Guard helicopter. Afterwards, Bond and Leiter parachute down to the church in time for the ceremony.

Sanchez bribes DEA agent Ed Killifer and escapes while he is being transported. Meanwhile, Sanchez&#x27;s henchman Dario and his crew ambush Leiter and his wife Della (murdering her in the process) and take Leiter to an aquarium owned by one of Sanchez&#x27;s accomplices, Milton Krest. Sanchez has Leiter lowered into a tank holding a great white shark. When Bond learns that Sanchez has escaped, he returns to Leiter&#x27;s house to find that Leiter has been tortured and that Della has been murdered. Bond, with Leiter&#x27;s friend Sharkey, start their own investigation. They discover a marine research centre run by Krest, where Sanchez has hidden cocaine and a submarine for smuggling.

After Bond kills Killifer using the same shark tank used for Leiter, M meets Bond in Key West&#x27;s Hemingway House and orders him to an assignment in Istanbul. Bond resigns after turning down the assignment, but M suspends Bond instead and revokes his licence to kill. Bond becomes a agent, although he later receives unauthorised assistance from Q.

Bond boards Krest&#x27;s ship &quot;Wavekrest&quot; and stops Sanchez&#x27;s latest drug shipment, stealing $5 million in cash in the process. He discovers that Sharkey has been killed by Sanchez&#x27;s henchmen. Bond meets and teams up with Pam Bouvier, a pilot and DEA informant, at a Bimini bar, and journeys with her to the Republic of Isthmus. He seeks Sanchez&#x27;s employment by acting as an assassin for hire. Bond tries to assassinate Sanchez but is stopped by two Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau officers, who take him to an abandoned warehouse to meet an MI6 agent. They reveal they posed as drug buyers to gain Sanchez&#x27; trust and he would be taking them to his drug manufacturing and distribution plant, if left alive. Sanchez&#x27;s men rescue Bond and kill the officers and agent, believing them to be the assassins; Bond later claims he recognised them as such. That evening, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez&#x27;s girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond frames Krest by planting the stolen $5 million in &quot;Wavekrest&quot;. Sanchez locks Krest in a decompression chamber and cuts the oxygen supply, causing Krest&#x27;s head to explode. Bond is then admitted into the inner circle.

Sanchez takes Bond to his base of operations, which is disguised as the headquarters of a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez&#x27;s scientists dissolve cocaine in petrol and transport it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The televangelist Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez&#x27;s business manager Truman-Lodge, who uses Butcher&#x27;s TV broadcasts to communicate with Sanchez&#x27;s customers in the United States. During Sanchez&#x27;s presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario enters the room and recognises Bond. Bond starts a fire in the laboratory but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the cocaine bricks into a large industrial grinder. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to kill Dario by pulling him into the grinder.

Sanchez and most of the others flee as fire destroys the base, taking with him four tankers full of the cocaine and petrol mixture. Bond pursues them by plane, with Bouvier at the controls. During a chase through the desert, Bond destroys three of the tankers and kills several of Sanchez&#x27;s men. Sanchez attacks Bond with a machete aboard the fourth tanker, which crashes down a hillside. A petrol-soaked Sanchez attempts to kill Bond with his machete. Bond then reveals his cigarette lighter—his best man gift from Felix and Della—and sets Sanchez on fire. Sanchez staggers to the wrecked tanker, causing an explosion and killing himself. Bouvier arrives shortly afterward and picks up Bond.

Later, a party is held at Sanchez&#x27;s former residence. Bond receives a call from Leiter telling him that M has congratulated him for his work and offers him his job back. He then rejects Lupe&#x27;s advances and romances Bouvier instead.

==Production==
Shortly after &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; was released, producer Albert R. Broccoli and writers Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum started discussing the sequel. The film would retain a realistic style, as well as showing the &quot;darker edge&quot; of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited. China was visited after an invitation by the government, but the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; had removed some of the novelty of filming in China. By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the Great Wall, as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army. Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through because of Broccoli&#x27;s concerns that the Chinese government would censor the script. The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. In 1985, the Films Act was passed, removing the Eady Levy, resulting in foreign artists being taxed more heavily. The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was filmed in the UK, the first Bond film not to do so. Pinewood Studios, used in every previous &quot;Bond&quot; film, undertook only the post-production and sound re-recording.

===Writing and themes===
The initial outline of what would become &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum. Before the pair could develop the script, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing, leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own. Although both the main plot and title of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; owe nothing to any of the Fleming novels, there are elements from the books that are used in the storyline, including a number of aspects of the short story &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, such as the character Milton Krest. Felix Leiter&#x27;s mauling by a shark was based on the novel &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, whilst the film version of the book provided the close similarity between the main villain, Mr. Big, and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;″s main villain Sanchez. The screenplay was not ready by the time casting had begun, with Carey Lowell being auditioned with lines from &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;.

The script—initially called &quot;Licence Revoked&quot;—was written with Dalton&#x27;s characterisation of Bond in mind, and the obsession with which Bond pursues Sanchez on behalf of Leiter and his dead wife is seen as being because &quot;of his own brutally cut-short marriage&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s darker portrayal of Bond led to the violence being increased and becoming more graphic. Wilson compared the script to Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, where a samurai &quot;without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts, only sowing the seeds of distrust, he manages to have the villain bring himself down&quot;. Wilson freely admitted that the idea of the destruction-from-within aspect of the plot came more from &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and Sergio Leone&#x27;s remake of that film, &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, than from Fleming&#x27;s use of that plot device from &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

For the location Wilson created the Republic of Isthmus, a banana republic based on Panama, with the pock-marked Sanchez bearing similarities to General Manuel Noriega. The parallels between the two figures were based on Noriega&#x27;s political use of drug trafficking and money laundering to provide revenues for Panama. Robert Davi suggested the line &quot;loyalty is more important than money&quot;, which he felt was fitting to the character of Franz Sanchez, whose actions were noticed by Davi to be concerned with betrayal and retaliation.

The United Artists press kits referred to the film&#x27;s background as being &quot;Torn straight from the headlines of today&#x27;s newspapers&quot; and the backdrop of Panama was connected to &quot;the Medellín Cartel in Colombia and corruption of government officials in Mexico thrown in for good measure.&quot; This use of the cocaine-smuggling backdrop put &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; alongside other cinema blockbusters, such as the 1987 films &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; and &quot;RoboCop,&quot; and Bond was seen to be &quot;poaching on their turf&quot; with the drug-related revenge story.

===Casting===
After Carey Lowell was chosen to play Pam Bouvier, she watched many of the films in the series for inspiration. Lowell had described becoming a Bond girl as &quot;huge shoes to fill&quot;, as she did not see herself as a &quot;glamour girl&quot;, even coming to audition in jeans and a leather jacket. While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell&#x27;s own short hair style could be used.

Robert Davi was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli&#x27;s daughter Tina, and screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who had seen Davi in the television film &quot;Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami&quot;. To portray Sanchez, Davi researched the Colombian drug cartels and how to do a Colombian accent, and since he was method acting, he would stay in character off-set. After Davi read &quot;Casino Royale&quot; for preparation, he decided to turn Sanchez into a &quot;mirror image&quot; of James Bond, based on Ian Fleming&#x27;s descriptions of Le Chiffre. The actor also learned scuba diving for the scene where Sanchez is rescued from the sunken armoured car.

Davi later helped with the casting of Sanchez&#x27;s mistress Lupe Lamora, by playing Bond in the audition. Talisa Soto was picked from twelve candidates because Davi said he &quot;would kill for her&quot;. David Hedison returned to play Felix Leiter, sixteen years after playing the character in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Hedison did not expect to return to the role, saying &quot;I was sure that [&quot;Live and Let Die&quot;] would be my first – and last&quot; and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61-year-old actor, since the role included a scene parachuting.

Up-and-coming actor Benicio del Toro was chosen to play Sanchez&#x27;s henchman, Dario, for being &quot;laid back while menacing in a quirky sort of way&quot;, according to Glen. Davi warmed to the actor: &quot;Benicio called me his mentor during &#x27;Licence&#x27;&quot;.Wayne Newton got the role of Professor Joe Butcher after sending a letter to the producers expressing interest in a cameo because he always wanted to be in a Bond film. The President of Isthmus was played by Pedro Armendáriz Jr., the son of Pedro Armendáriz, who played Ali Kerim Bey in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;.

John Rhys-Davies claimed he was asked to reprise his role from the previous film as General Pushkin in a cameo appearance, but declined since he felt the character was not necessary to the plot.

===Filming===

Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988. Shooting began in the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus: locations in Mexico City included the Biblioteca del Banco de Mexico for the exterior of &quot;El Presidente Hotel&quot; and the Casino Español for the interior of &quot;Casino de Isthmus&quot; whilst the Teatro de la Ciudad was used for its exterior. Villa Arabesque in Acapulco was used for Sanchez&#x27;s lavish villa, and the La Rumorosa Mountain Pass in Tecate was used as the filming site for the tanker chase during the climax of the film. Sanchez&#x27;s Olympiatec Meditation Institute was shot at the Otomi Ceremonial Center in Temoaya. Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún.

In August 1988, production moved to the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez, following his arrest, is driven off the edge. Other locations there included Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea Church for Leiter&#x27;s wedding and Stephano&#x27;s House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The U.S. Coast Guard pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour. As production moved back to Mexico City, Broccoli became ill, marking the first time during the James Bond film series where he was not present during filming.
The scene where Sanchez&#x27;s plane is hijacked was filmed on location in Florida, with stuntman Jake Lombard jumping from a helicopter to a plane and Dalton himself tying Sanchez&#x27;s plane with a cable. The plane towed by the helicopter was a life-sized model created by special effects supervisor John Richardson. After filming wide shots of David Hedison and Dalton parachuting, closer shots were made near the church location. During one of the takes, a malfunction of the harness equipment caused Hedison to fall on the pavement. The injury made him limp for the remainder of filming. The aquatic battle between Bond and the henchmen required two separate units, a surface one led by Arthur Wooster which used Dalton himself, and an underwater one which involved experienced divers. The barefoot waterskiing was done by world champion Dave Reinhart, with some close-ups using Dalton on a special rig. Milton Krest&#x27;s death used a prosthetic head which was created by John Richardson&#x27;s team based on a mould of Anthony Zerbe&#x27;s face. The result was so gruesome that it was shortened and toned down to avoid censorship problems.

For the climactic tanker chase, the producers used an entire section of Mexican Federal Highway 2D in La Rumorosa, Baja California, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth at the request of driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel on the back of the cabin so a hidden stuntman could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.

===Music===

Initially Vic Flick, who had played lead guitar on Monty Norman&#x27;s original 007 theme, and Eric Clapton were asked to write and perform the theme song to &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and they produced a theme to match Dalton&#x27;s gritty performance, but the producers turned it down and instead Gladys Knight&#x27;s song and performance was chosen. The song was based on the &quot;horn line&quot; from &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, seen as an homage to the film of the same name, which required royalty payments to the original writers. The song gave Knight her first British top-ten hit since 1977. The end credits feature the Top 10 R&amp;B hit &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot;, sung by Patti LaBelle.

John Barry was originally intended to score but was not available at the time due to throat surgery after suffering a rupture of the esophagus in 1988 and it was considered unsafe to fly him from his home in New York to London to complete the score, post-production was extended to allow Barry time to recover. The soundtrack&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and &quot;Die Hard&quot;. Glen said he picked Kamen, feeling he could give &quot;the closest thing to John Barry.&quot;

==Release==
Film ratings organisations had objections to the excessive and realistic violence, with both the Motion Picture Association of America and the British Board of Film Classification requesting content adaptations, with the BBFC in particular demanding the cut of 36 seconds. &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; became the first Bond film to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA’s ratings board, a rating that has been applied to every Bond film since. The 2006 Ultimate Edition DVD of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; marked the first release of the film without cuts. It remains the only Bond movie to be originally rated 15 by the BBFC. But for the subsequent cuts, the original examiners had been considering an 18 rating.

&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on , raising £200,000 (£ in 2025 pounds) for The Prince&#x27;s Trust on the night.

There were also issues with the promotion of the film: promotional material in the form of teaser posters created by Bob Peak, based on the &quot;Licence Revoked&quot; title and commissioned by Albert Broccoli, had been produced, but MGM decided against using them after American test screenings showed &#x27;Licence Revoked&#x27; to be a common American phrase for the withdrawal of a driving licence. The delayed, updated advertising by Steven Chorney, in the traditional style, limited the film&#x27;s pre-release screenings. MGM also discarded a campaign created by advertising executive Don Smolen, who had worked in the publicity campaign for eight previous Bond films, emphasising the rougher content of the film.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
At the box office, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; grossed $156.2 million ($373.3 million in 2022 dollars) on its budget of $32 million ($78.9 million in 2022 dollars), grossing an inflation-adjusted profit of $287.2 million, making it the twelfth biggest box-office draw of the year. The film grossed a total of £7.5 million (£ million in 2025 pounds) in the United Kingdom, making it the seventh-most successful film of the year, despite the 15 certificate which cut down audience numbers. In the US and Canada, it grossed $34.6 million, making &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; the least financially successful James Bond film in the US, when accounting for inflation. A factor suggested for the poor takings was fierce competition at the cinema, with &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; released alongside &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (starring former Bond Sean Connery), and &quot;Batman&quot;.
Other large international grosses include $14.2 million in Germany, $12.4 million in France, $8.8 million in Japan, $8.7 million in the Netherlands and $8.6 million in Sweden.

Despite grossing more than 4.3 times its budget, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; has made the lowest inflation-adjusted box-office return—as well as having the lowest profit margin—out of all 25 of the official &quot;Bond&quot; films as of 2022. The only other &quot;Bond&quot; movie with &quot;Kill&quot; in the title—&quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, which was also directed by John Glen—has the &quot;second&quot;-lowest inflation-adjusted return of any &quot;Bond&quot; movie. However, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;&#x27;s return ratio of 4.3 ranks it 18th out of the 25 official film entries from the series.

=== Contemporary reviews ===
Derek Malcolm in &quot;The Guardian&quot; was broadly approving of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, liking the &quot;harder edge of the earlier Bonds&quot; that the film emulated, but wishing that &quot;it was written and directed with a bit more flair.&quot; Malcolm praised the way the film attempted &quot;to tell a story rather than use one for the decorative purposes of endless spectacular tropes.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s sister paper, &quot;The Observer&quot;, Philip French noted that &quot;despite the playful sparkle in his eyes, Timothy Dalton&#x27;s Bond is ... serious here.&quot; Overall French called &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; &quot;an entertaining, untaxing film&quot;. Ian Christie in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; excoriated the film, saying that the plot was &quot;absurd but fundamentally dull&quot;, a further problem being that as &quot;there isn&#x27;t a coherent storyline to link [the stunts], they eventually become tiresome.&quot;

Hilary Mantel in &quot;The Spectator&quot; dismissed the film:

David Robinson, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, observed that &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; &quot;will probably neither disappoint nor surprise the great, faithful audience&quot;, but bemoaned the fact that &quot;over the years the plots have become less ambitious&quot;. Robinson thought that Dalton&#x27;s Bond &quot;has more class&quot; than the previous Bonds and was &quot;a warmer personality&quot;. Iain Johnstone of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; pointed out that &quot;any vestiges of the gentleman spy ... by Ian Fleming&quot; have now gone, and in its place is a Bond that is &quot;remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the &quot;Batman&quot; film&quot; that was released at the same time as &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;.

Adam Mars-Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot; gave the film a mixed review, pointing out that it took out some of the more dated ideas from the Fleming novels, such as imperialism; he wrote that the writers were &quot;trying in effect to reproduce the recipe while leaving out ingredients that would now seem distasteful&quot;. Overall Mars-Jones thought that:

For the Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Rick Groen wrote that in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; &quot;they&#x27;ve excised Bond from the Bond flicks; they&#x27;ve turned James into Jimmy, strong and silent and (roll over, Britannia) downright American&quot;, resulting in a Bond film that is &quot;essentially Bond-less&quot;. Summing up, Groen thought &quot;Actually, that dialogue ... ain&#x27;t bad. The silence looks good on Timothy Dalton&quot;.

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; wrote that a number of factors &quot;fail to prevent the finished product from jamming and misfiring with disillusioning frequency&quot;. Arnold opined that &quot;demanding that he [Dalton] play Bond&#x27;s wrathfulness in a transparently seething and hotheaded manner&quot; means that Dalton &quot;seems to waste away on this second outing as Bond.&quot; Overall Arnold sees that there is a &quot;failure to recognize that Bond productions are simply too extravagant to permit an uncompromised return to first principles.&quot; The critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James, thought Dalton was &quot;the first James Bond with angst, a moody spy for the fin de siecle&quot;, and that &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; &quot;retains its familiar, effective mix of despicably powerful villains, suspiciously tantalizing women and ever-wilder special effects&quot;, but was impressed that &quot;Dalton&#x27;s glowering presence adds a darker tone&quot;. James concluded that &quot;for all its clever updatings, stylish action and witty escapism, &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; ... is still a little too much by the book.&quot;

Roger Ebert for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying &quot;the stunts all look convincing, and the effect of the closing sequence is exhilarating ... &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; is one of the best of the recent Bonds.&quot; Jack Kroll, writing in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, described &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; as &quot;a pure, rousingly entertaining action movie&quot;. Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him &quot;a fine actor who hasn&#x27;t yet stamped Bond with his own personality&quot;, observing &quot;Director John Glen is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here&quot;. For &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Richard Corliss bemoaned that although the truck stunts were good, it was &quot;a pity nobody – not writers Michael G. Wilson, and Richard Maibaum nor director John Glen – thought to give the humans anything very clever to do.&quot; Corliss found Dalton &quot;misused&quot; in the film, adding that &quot;for every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his second Bond film as Sean Connery did in his sixth.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Opinion on &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; has changed with the passing of time: some reviews are still mixed, though film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with a positive 79% rating from 63 reviews with the consensus stating that &quot;&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; is darker than many of the other Bond entries, with Timothy Dalton playing the character with intensity, but it still has some solid chases and fight scenes.&quot;

Tom Hibbert of &quot;Empire&quot; gives the film only two of a possible five stars, observing that &quot;Dalton ... is really quite hopeless&quot;. Hibbert concluded that &quot;he may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery.&quot; In 2006, IGN ranked &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; fifteenth out of the then 21 Bond films, claiming it is &quot;too grim and had strayed too far from the Bond formula.&quot; Desmond Llewelyn himself said in his last interview in 1999, the movie &quot;lost all its fantasy...[it] was a very good film, it wasn&#x27;t a Bond film.&quot;

Norman Wilner of MSN considered &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; the second worst Bond film, above only &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, but defended Dalton, saying he &quot;got a raw deal. The actor who could have been the definitive 007 ... had the bad luck to inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest, struggling to cope with its general creative decline and the end of the Cold War&quot;. In October 2008, &quot;Time Out&quot; re-issued a review of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying: &quot;one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared&quot;.

Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the film, &quot;Esquire&quot;″s Bob Sassone urged readers to give it a second look. &quot;High-Def Digest&quot; awarded it four out of five stars when re-released on Blu-ray. British &quot;GQ&quot; considered it the most underrated in the series, thinking the change in tone caused upset among fans. Digital Spy called Dalton the best Bond of the six actors, praising his depth, terming &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; a &quot;violently enjoyable 007 detour&quot;. Den of Geek writer Max Williams described the finished work as &quot;..about as good as the series can get..&quot;, praising Dalton for delivering &quot;his vision of Bond, perfectly.&quot;&quot;

Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a fundamental weakness in the film: the &quot;overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because there are times when &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;″s narrative bogs down.&quot; Berardinelli gave the film three out of a possible four stars, adding &quot;&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; may be taut and gripping, but it&#x27;s not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public&#x27;s rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture.&quot; Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: &quot;It boggles my mind that &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; is so controversial. There&#x27;s really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies.&quot; John Glen has said &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; &quot;is among my best Bond films, if not the best&quot;. &quot;I call Timothy Dalton the father of Daniel Craig&quot;, Davi admitted years later. &quot;The years of Roger Moore were delicious...But to take Bond into the era when action films were hard and real… Timothy brought that intensity and darkness as an actor...Like Fleming said, Bond’s not necessarily a good guy. Timothy gave Bond that edge.”

==Appearances in other media==
The &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; screenplay was novelised by the then-novelist of the Bond series John Gardner. It was the first Bond film novelisation since &quot;James Bond and Moonraker&quot; in 1979.

&quot;Licence to Kill&quot; was also adapted as a forty-four-page, colour graphic novel, by writer and artist Mike Grell (also author of original-story Bond comic books), published by Eclipse Comics and ACME Press in hardcover and trade editions in 1989. The adaptation closely follows the film story, although the ending is briefer, and James Bond is not drawn to resemble Timothy Dalton after Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be licensed. Domark also published a video game adaptation, &quot;007: Licence to Kill&quot;, to various personal computers.

The 2012 video game &quot;007 Legends&quot; features a level based on &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; with Carey Lowell reprising her role by providing the voice for the Pam Bouvier character.

<text>Faro ( , ) is a municipality, the southernmost city and capital of the district of the same name, in the Algarve region of southern Portugal. With an estimated population of 67,566 inhabitants in 2021 (with 39,733 inhabitants in the city proper, making it the biggest city and second most populous municipality in the Algarve (after Loulé) and one of the biggest in Southern Portugal), the municipality covers an area of about . 
&lt;br&gt;The municipalities of Faro-Olhão-Loulé due to its adjacency, sharing of infrastructures and regular commute can be considered an intermunicipal community with a population of 184,578 inhabitants (2021). A Metro connecting this community is planned to be finished by 2029.

== History ==

The Ria Formosa lagoon attracted humans from the Palaeolithic age until the end of prehistory. The first settlements date from the fourth century BC, during the period of Phoenician colonization of the western Mediterranean. At the time, the area was known as Ossonoba, and was the most important urban centre of southern Portugal and commercial port for agricultural products, fish, and minerals.

Between the second and eighth centuries, the city was under the domain of the Romans, then the Byzantines, and later Visigoths, before being conquered by the Arabic-speaking Muslims known as Moors in 713. From the third century onwards and during the Visigothic period, it was the site of an Episcopal see, the Ancient Diocese of Ossonoba (306-688). The Byzantine presence has endured in the city walls&#x27; towers that were built during the Byzantine period.

With the advent of Moorish rule in the eighth century, Ossonoba retained its status as the most important town in the southwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula. In the 9th century, after a revolt led by Yahia Ben Bakr who was succeeded in office by his son, Bakr Ben Yahia, it became the capital of a short-lived princedom and was fortified with a ring of defensive walls. At this time, in the 10th century, the name Santa Maria began to be used instead of Ossonoba. By the 11th century, the town was known as &quot;Santa Maria Ibn Harun&quot;.

During the Second Crusade soon after the Anglo-Norman forces took Lisbon in 1147 a detachment of this group sacked Faro, which was still by then under Muslim rule, on their way to the Holy Land.
Again in 1217, during the Fifth Crusade, a Frisian fleet of crusaders on their way to Acre, sacked and burned the city.

During the 500 years of Moorish rule, some Jewish residents of Faro made written copies of the Old Testament. The Moors were defeated and expelled in 1249 by the forces of the Portuguese King Afonso III. With the decline of the importance of the city of Silves (which was made the regional bishopric as Diocese of Silves shortly during and properly after the Reconquista), Faro took over the role of administration of the Algarve area.

=== Portuguese Kingdom ===

After Portuguese independence in 1143, Afonso Henriques and his successors began an expansion and Christian repopulation into the southern Iberian territory which had previously been occupied by the Moors. Following the conquest by D. Afonso III, in 1249, the Portuguese referred to the town as &quot;Santa Maria de Faaron&quot; or &quot;Santa Maria de Faaram&quot;. In the following years, the town became prosperous, due to its secure port and exploitation of salt. Consequently, by the beginning of the Portuguese Age of Discovery, the town was well positioned to become a leading commercial centre.

In the 14th century, the Jewish community began to grow in importance. In 1487, Samuel Gacon began printing the &quot;Pentateuco &quot;in Hebrew, the first book printed in Portugal. The Jewish community of Faro had long been a dominant force in the region, with many artisans and merchants contributing heavily to the economy and city development, but this level of prosperity was interrupted in December 1496 by an edict of Manuel I of Portugal, expelling those who did not convert to Christianity. As a result, officially, Jews no longer remained in Portugal. In the place of the Jewish village of Vila Adentro, the convent of Nossa Senhora da Assunção was founded and patronised by Queen Leonor, wife of the king.

Manuel I promoted the development and expansion of the city; 1499 had the construction of a hospital, the Church of Espírito Santo (or Church of the Misericórdia), a customshouse, and a slaughterhouse, all near the shoreline.

By 1540, John III of Portugal had elevated Faro to the status of city, then in 1577, the bishopric of the Algarve was transferred from Silves, which retains a co-cathedral, to the present Diocese of Faro.
In 1597, the city was sacked by English privateers led by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. The resultant fires damaged the walls, churches, and other buildings. At the same time, English troops seized the library of the Bishop of Faro, then Fernando Martins de Mascarenhas, which eventually became part of the collection of the University of Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library. Among the looted books was the first printed book in Portugal: a Torah in local Hebrew (Judeo-Español), printed by Samuel Gacon at his workshop in Faro.

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the city was expanded, with a series of walls during the period of the Restoration Wars (1640–1668), encompassing the semicircular front to the Ria Formosa.

The western city of Lagos had become the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577, but this all changed with the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. It affected many settlements across the Algarve, including Faro, which suffered damage to churches, convents (specifically the Convent of São Francisco and Convent of Santa Clara), and the episcopal palace, in addition to the walls, castle towers and bulwarks, barracks, guardhouses, warehouses, customshouses, and prison.

Much of the greater devastation across the coastal and lowland regions was caused by a tsunami, which dismantled fortresses and razed homes. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged by the tsunami, except Faro, protected by the sandy banks of the Ria Formosa lagoon. With the capital Lagos devastated, Faro became the administrative seat of the region the following year, 1756.

== Geography ==
The municipality of Faro is divided into two distinct areas, the coastline, part of the &quot;Parque Natural da Ria Formosa&quot; (Nature Park of Ria Formosa) and the &quot;barrocal&quot;, characterized by hills and valleys, populated with typical Algarvan vegetation.

The nature park was created by Decree-Law 373/87, on 8 December 1987, and is considered one of the seven natural wonders of Portugal, with a beach that is around from the downtown. It includes the river and a lagoon system, interspersed with dunes, forming a small islands and peninsulas, that protect a large area of marshes, channels, and islets. The beaches in Faro are situated on the peninsula of Ancão and island of Culatra, along the corridor of the nature park. The park is a rich and complex aquatic ecosystem, consisting of barrier islands, marshes, and channels, comprising sandy shorelines that separate the waters of the Ria Formosa and Atlantic Ocean. The beaches of Faro and Barrinha/Barra de São Luís, are located on the Ancão peninsula, the beach of Barreta on the Ilha Deserta, and the beaches of Farol and Culatra are located on the Ilha Culatra. The barrier islands are separated by tidal flats and shallows, including (from west to east) the Barra do Ancão/Barra de São Luís, the Barra de Santa Maria/Barra do Farol, and the Barra da Culatra/Barra da Armona (in the municipality of Olhão).

Annually, many species of aquatic migratory birds transient northern Europe and nest there during the winter. These include flamingos, terns, pied avocets, Eurasian wigeons, and common chaffinches.

Within the town are gardens and open spaces, among which are the Manuel Bivar Garden, Alameda João de Deus Garden, and the Mata do Liceu.

The variety of species and natural conditions result in the region being a popular ecotourism zone, promoting birdwatching, boating trips into the delta, kayaking along the Ria Formosa, pedestrian trails, and biking tours, accompanied by nature guides. The municipality is crossed by the southern &quot;Ecovia do Algarve&quot;, a bicycling circuit that connects the Algarve to the rest of Europe.

=== Climate ===
Faro has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), moderated by a transitioning Portugal-Canary current giving a certain resemblance to Southern California that is not heated in the summer by the Mediterranean Sea like Algarve. Given this region is highly susceptible to the difference of precipitation throughout the seasons of the year, in the future scarcity of water could appear in conjunction with the increase of temperature and less incidence of rains.

Summers are warm to hot and sunny with average daytime maximum temperatures of . Summer warmth can linger well into October. The weather in the winter is generally mild by European standards, managing around 6 hours of sunshine each day, with temperatures averaging around in the coldest month. The city receives most of its rainfall over the winter; rain is scarce between June and September. The annual average temperature is around , however it is becoming hotter and hotter, reaching as high as in 2023, with average temperatures since 2010 or even since 1994 being around , and the annual rainfall is around , however in recent years, rainfall has diminished, even reaching as low as in 2019, with the average yearly rainfall from 2017 to 2021 being closer to . The average sea temperature is in January rising to in August and September. Higher sea water temperatures are reached if the weather patterns produce a significant outflow of warmer surface water out of the Mediterranean which bathe the coastal Algarve with much warmer water. During the summer months, tropical nights are common and, on average, Faro has 37 tropical nights per year, which is the highest in Portugal. Faro has the highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Portugal, which was on 26 July 2004.

With over 3000 hours of sunshine a year, Faro is often regarded as one of the sunniest cities in Europe, alongside nearby Tavira. July and August have the most sunshine, while December has the least.


=== Human geography ===

Administratively, the municipality is divided into four civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

The main station is operated by the national railway operator Comboios de Portugal (CP), which operates the Alfa Pendular, Intercidades and CP Regional routes, as well as a special service during the summer, the InterRegional line. The Alfa Pendular service connects Faro to the North and terminates in Porto. The Intercidades and InterRegional services connect Faro to Lisboa. The CP Regional service operates across the east and west Algarve and connects Faro to Lagos in the west Algarve, and Vila Real de Santo António in the east Algarve. Bom João is only served by the CP Regional trains heading east. Despite the proximity of Seville, it is not connected by train.
=== Buses ===
The town is served by a public transport network that include minibuses, local bus lines, and regional services across the Algarve.
=== Maritime ===
Due to its position along the coast, a need exists to connect the shoreline communities with the outlying with various islands; with the exception of the island of Faro, most are accessible only by boat service. Throughout the year (from the commercial wharf or Portas do Mar wharf, depending on the time of year), regular and tourist services are operated along the estuary.
=== Metro ===

The Algarve Metrobus is a transport project under development which will connect the areas of Faro, Olhão and Loulé together through bus rapid transit. The metrobus will have 24 stops, including the Mar Shopping Algarve, airport, the two campuses of the University of Algarve and Parque das Cidades (Algarve Stadium). All this, on 100% dedicated lines, with frequencies every 12 minutes, during rush hour, and with extended opening hours.

<text>The Independent Democrats (ID) was a South African political party, formed by former Pan Africanist Congress member Patricia de Lille in 2003 via floor crossing legislation. The party&#x27;s platform was premised on opposition to corruption, with a mixture of liberal principles and strategies for improving equity. The party&#x27;s strongholds were the Northern and Western Cape.

On 15 August 2010, the party announced plans to merge with the larger Democratic Alliance as part of a plan to challenge the governing African National Congress (ANC). The party disbanded as a separate political organization in 2014.

== 2009 election manifesto ==
Ahead of the national elections in 2009, the ID launched a manifesto promising that, if elected to power, they would increase the staffing of the South African Police Service to 200,000, enlist 5,000 caseworkers to operate in crime-stricken communities, make South Africa a leader in renewable energy and finance a minimum social grant by taxing luxury goods, tobacco and alcohol. In addition they vowed that an &quot;ID government would fire a minister whose department received a qualified audit two years in a row.&quot;

== Merger with DA ==
In 2010, then-ID leader Patricia de Lille formalized an agreement to merge with the Democratic Alliance. The two parties merged by 2014. Due to this, the ID did not contest the 2011 local elections as a separate entity, instead fielding its candidates on the DA&#x27;s ballots. In February 2012, the-then Leader of the Official Opposition, Lindiwe Mazibuko, reshuffled her shadow cabinet, which included appointing members of the ID to shadow portfolios for the first time. This was seen as a move towards strengthening the co-operation between the two parties heading towards the completion of the merger.

<text>The speech () or Total War speech was a speech delivered by German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels at the Berlin to a large, carefully selected audience on 18 February 1943, as the tide of World War II was turning against Nazi Germany and its Axis allies. The speech is particularly notable as Goebbels almost mentions the Holocaust, when he begins saying (using the German word for extermination), but quickly changes it to (i.e. exclusion). This was the same word Heinrich Himmler used on 18 December 1941, when he recorded the outcome of his discussion with Adolf Hitler on the Final Solution, wherein he wrote (&quot;exterminate them as partisans&quot;).

It is considered the most famous of Goebbels&#x27;s speeches. The speech was the first public admission by the National Socialist leadership that Germany faced serious dangers. Goebbels called for a total war () to secure victory over the Allies, and exhorted the German people to continue the war even though it would be long and difficult because—as he asserted—both Germany&#x27;s survival and the survival of Western civilisation were at stake.

==Background==

After the Axis defeat in late 1942 at the Second Battle of El Alamein in Egypt, a turning point of World War II in Europe occurred on 2 February 1943 as the Battle of Stalingrad ended with the surrender of Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus and the German 6th Army to the Soviets. At the Casablanca Conference in January, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had demanded Germany&#x27;s unconditional surrender, and the Soviets, encouraged by their victory, were beginning to retake territory, including Kursk (8 February), Rostov-on-Don (14 February), and Kharkov (16 February). After the Axis defeats in Egypt and the subsequent loss of Tripoli (23 January 1943), military setbacks shook Axis morale. In the Pacific, the Americans had just completed their months-long reconquest of Guadalcanal.

Hitler responded with the first measures that would lead to the all-out mobilisation of Germany. Prior to the speech, the government closed restaurants, clubs, bars, theatres, and luxury stores throughout the country so that the civilian population could contribute more to the war. Despite this, the measures taken did not go as far as Goebbels wanted, and other ministers such as Hermann Göring and Hans Lammers succeeded in watering the measures down.

==Setting and audience==
The setting of the speech in the placed the audience behind and under a big banner bearing the all-capital words (&quot;total war – shortest war&quot;) along with Nazi banners and swastikas, as seen in pictures and film of the event.

Although Goebbels claimed that the audience included people from &quot;all classes and occupations&quot; (including &quot;soldiers, doctors, scientists, artists, engineers and architects, teachers, white collars&quot;), the propagandist had carefully selected his listeners to react with appropriate fanaticism. Goebbels said to Albert Speer that it was the best-trained audience one could find in Germany. However, the enthusiastic and unified crowd response recorded in the written version is, at times, not fully supported by the recording.

==Details==
Goebbels reiterated three themes in the speech:

#If the was not in a position to counter the danger from the Eastern Front, the German Reich would fall to Bolshevism and the rest of Europe shortly afterwards.
#The , the German people, and the Axis Powers alone had the strength to save Europe from this threat.
#Danger was at hand, and Germany had to act quickly and decisively.

In the speech, Goebbels elaborated at length what Nazi propaganda asserted was the threat posed by so-called International Jewry: &quot;The goal of Bolshevism is Jewish world revolution. They want to bring chaos to the Reich and Europe, using the resulting hopelessness and desperation to establish their international, Bolshevist-concealed, capitalist tyranny.&quot; Rejecting the protests of enemy nations against the Reich&#x27;s Jewish policies, he stated, to deafening chants from the audience, that Germany &quot;intends to take the most radical measures, if necessary, in good time.&quot;

While Goebbels referred to Soviet mobilisation nationwide as &quot;devilish&quot;, he explained that &quot;we cannot overcome the Bolshevist danger unless we use equivalent, though not identical, methods [in a] total war&quot;. He then justified the austerity measures enacted, explaining them as temporary measures.

Historically, the speech is important in that it marks the first admission by the Nazi Party leadership that they were facing problems, and launched the mobilisation campaign that, arguably, prolonged the war, under the slogan: &quot;And storm, break loose!&quot; (). Goebbels claimed that no German was thinking of any compromise and instead that &quot;the entire nation is only thinking about a hard war&quot;.

Goebbels attempted to counter reports in the Allied press that German civilians had lost faith in victory by asking the audience a number of questions at the end, such as:

The audio recording of the speech differs in some ways from the written record. Especially significant is that in the recording, Goebbels actually begins to mention the &quot;extermination&quot; of the Jews, rather than the less harsh terms used in the written version to describe the Final Solution, but catches himself in the middle of the word.

==Quotes==
The last line originated in the poem &quot;Männer und Buben&quot; (&quot;Men and Boys&quot;) by Carl Theodor Körner during the Napoleonic Wars. Körner&#x27;s words had been quoted by Hitler in his 1920 speech &quot;What We Want&quot; delivered at Munich&#x27;s &quot;Hofbräuhaus&quot;, but also by Goebbels himself in older speeches, including his 6 July 1932 campaign speech before the Nazis took power in Germany.

Regarding the word there was a slight pause when Goebbels said , means &#x27;elimination&#x27;, which is fit in the context of the speech.

==Reception==
Millions of Germans listened to Goebbels on the radio as he delivered this speech about the &quot;misfortune of the past weeks&quot; and an &quot;unvarnished picture of the situation.&quot; By amassing such popular enthusiasm, Goebbels wanted to convince Hitler to give him greater powers in running the war economy. Hitler, however, was not yet ready to bring the economy to a total war footing over the objections of his other ministers. On 23 July 1944, Goebbels was finally appointed Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, responsible for maximising the manpower for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not essential to the war effort.

The speech also led to the spread of a late-war whisper joke, popular in Western Germany, especially the Ruhr:

<doc id="449566" wikidata="Q313500" url="?curid=449566" title="Quintus Fabius Pictor">
<text>Quintus Fabius Pictor (born BC, BC) was the earliest known Roman historian. His history, written in Greek and now mostly lost besides some surviving fragments, was highly influential on ancient writers and certainly participated in introducing Greek historiographical methods to the Roman world. However, the work was highly partisan towards Rome, blaming the Second Punic War (218–201 BC) on Carthage and idealizing the Roman Republic as a well-ordered state loyal to its allies. Fabius probably served as praetor, was a member of the Senate, and participated in a delegation sent to the oracle at Delphi in 216 BC. Some scholars consider him one of the earliest annalists, although this conclusion has been criticized.

== Life ==
Quintus Fabius Pictor was born ca. 270 BC to a prestigious patrician family of the Roman Republic, the gens Fabia. The cognomen &quot;Pictor&quot; (Latin for &#x27;painter&#x27;) was inherited from his grandfather, Gaius Fabius Pictor, who had decorated the temple of Salus in 304. His father, Gaius Fabius Pictor, was consul in 269.

Fabius participated in Roman campaigns against the Gauls and the Ligurians in Cisalpine Gaul during the 230s. In 233, he was presumably a junior officer under the consulship of his cousin Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus. He most likely served as praetor some time prior to 218. Fabius joined the Senate before the outbreak of the Second Punic War in 218, but seems to have been a rather undistinguished senator. He may have also fought in the Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217. 

In 216 BC, during the Second Punic War, he was appointed to travel to the oracle at Delphi, the religious centre of Greece, in order to seek guidance after the disastrous Roman defeat to Hannibal at Cannae. He certainly obtained this role at the suggestion of his cousin Fabius Verrucosus, probably aided by his expert knowledge of the Greek language and culture, and possibly in his capacity as member of the &quot;decemviri sacris faciundis&quot;, although we have no direct evidence that he was a member of priestly colleges.&quot;&quot; It seems likely that Fabius was also sent there to sound out Greek public opinion regarding the alliance between Hannibal and Philip V of Macedon.

His later life remains unknown, and it is unclear whether Fabius lived long enough to witness the end of the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). Quintus Fabius Pictor, who was praetor in Sardinia in 189 and died in 167 BC, was presumably his homonymous son.

==Work==
Fabius wrote a history of Rome some time between 215 and 200 BC. His work was certainly published before 192 BC, either during or shortly after the Second Punic War. Bruce W. Frier has proposed a publication date no later than 213. Fabius&#x27; history was written in Greek, which was at that time the only language suitable to reach a large educated public in Italy, Greece and elsewhere in the Mediterranean world. The Latin &quot;annales&quot; ascribed to a Fabius are thus most likely a later translation of his history, or perhaps a draft of his work in Latin later edited posthumously. In the words of Arnaldo Momigliano, &quot;under the impact of Hellenisation the natives of many countries were persuaded to rethink their national history and to present it in the Greek language to the educated readers of a multinational society.&quot; Some scholars have also argued that his history of Rome may have been primarily intended for an Hellenist audience.

Fabius&#x27; work, which is variously called the &quot;Annales Graeci&quot; or the &quot;Romaika&quot; (≈ &quot;Romaion&quot;) &quot;praxeis&quot; by ancient authors, comprised three large sections: one on the &quot;ktisis&quot; (creation story), which included the first years of the Republic; a second part on &quot;the antiquities after the foundation phase&quot;, that is the period from the Decemvirate (ca. 450) to the Pyrrhic War (280–275); and a third on the contemporary history from the outbreak of the First Punic War onwards. Fabius&#x27; account of early Rome mixed historical elements with mythology. His story began with the &quot;coming of Herakles into Italy&quot; and the arrival of the legendary Trojan refugee Aeneas in Latium. He dated the founding of Rome to the &quot;first year of the eighth Olympiad&quot;, that is 747 BC. According to historian Hans Beck, &quot;the calculation of the city&#x27;s foundation date that matched with Olympiad chronologies attests both to the call for accuracy and to the desire to stress an analogy to Greek culture.&quot; Fabius&#x27; work ended with his own recollections of the Second Punic War, although it is unclear whether he survived long enough to record it entirely.

Fabius&#x27; history has not survived, but it is partially known today through quotations and allusions by later authors. It is not certain whether the work was annalistic, recounting events year by year, although citation of his work by other historians may imply that it was. According to Beck, however, the label &quot;annalistic&quot; should be avoided to describe Fabius&#x27; work, for the surviving fragments &quot;make it plain that the conceptual assumptions of this model (lack of style, a mere compilation of people, places and prodigies) are not accurate.&quot;

== Views and influences ==
Fabius was influenced by Greek historiographical methods, especially that of the Sicilian Greek historian Timaeus. Other Greek authors such as Antiochus of Syracuse and Diocles of Peparethus had already written about the mythical origins of Rome, and Fabius was also influenced by them. For instance, his narrative of the legendary overthrow of Amulius by Romulus and Remus was taken from Diocles.

His views of Roman history as a closed unity in search for social meaning were biased towards his nation, and probably emerged as a nationalistic reaction influenced by the conflict between Rome and Carthage, especially the political turmoil that followed the defeat of Cannae in 216 BC. Beck writes that &quot;the work’s apologetic tone, its idealization of the republic as a well-ordered state, and the emphasis on Rome’s loyalty to its allies all seem to support this view, suiting an effort at damage-control immediately after Cannae.&quot; According to scholar John Briscoe, &quot;his reasons for writing in Greek were both literary—the possibility of writing in Latin did not occur to him—and political, the need to defend Roman policy to the Greek world.&quot; However, Momigliano contends that the available Fabius&#x27;s fragments recounting contemporary events appear &quot;objective and serene ... [and show] that Fabius was in no hurry to present the Carthaginians to the Greek public as collectively responsible for the beginning of the Second Punic War.&quot;

==Legacy==
Fabius&#x27; portrayal of the Siege of Saguntum as the cause of the Second Punic War, dismissing Hannibal&#x27;s attack as sweeping &quot;injustice&quot;, soon became the dominant view among ancient historians. In the early 2nd century BC, Roman historians Lucius Cincius Alimentus and Gaius Acilius were highly influenced by Fabius in matters of language, form, and theme. 

Fabius was used as a source by Polybius, Livy, Gellius, Quadrigarius, Plutarch, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Despite his use of Fabius&#x27;s history, Polybius complained about the quality of his work, saying that he had been biased towards the Romans and inconsistent. Cicero spoke harshly of early Roman historians: &quot;Let me remind you that in the beginning the Greeks themselves also wrote like our Cato, Pictor, and Piso. History was nothing more than a compilation of yearly chronicles...&quot;

An anonymous &quot;Account of the Roman History of Fabius Pictor&quot; was published in 1749, claiming that a manuscript in the &quot;Carthaginian language&quot; had been discovered in the ruins of Herculaneum near Pompeii. In fact, it was a political satire on English religion and politics at the time.

<text>In mathematics, −1 (negative one or minus one) is the additive inverse of 1, that is, the number that when added to 1 gives the additive identity element, 0. It is the negative integer greater than negative two (−2) and less than 0.

== In mathematics ==
=== Algebraic properties ===
Multiplying a number by −1 is equivalent to changing the sign of the number – that is, for any we have . This can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom that 1 is the multiplicative identity:
Here we have used the fact that any number times 0 equals 0, which follows by cancellation from the equation
In other words,
so is the additive inverse of , i.e. , as was to be shown.

The square of −1 (that is −1 multiplied by −1) equals 1. As a consequence, a product of two negative numbers is positive. For an algebraic proof of this result, start with the equation
The first equality follows from the above result, and the second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1: it is precisely that number which when added to 1 gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, it can be seen that
The third equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation implies
The above arguments hold in any ring, a concept of abstract algebra generalizing integers and real numbers.
Although there are no real square roots of −1, the complex number satisfies , and as such can be considered as a square root of −1. The only other complex number whose square is −1 is − because there are exactly two square roots of any non‐zero complex number, which follows from the fundamental theorem of algebra. In the algebra of quaternions – where the fundamental theorem does not apply – which contains the complex numbers, the equation has infinitely many solutions.

=== Inverse and invertible elements ===
Exponentiation of a non‐zero real number can be extended to negative integers, where raising a number to the power −1 has the same effect as taking its multiplicative inverse: 

This definition is then applied to negative integers, preserving the exponential law for real numbers and .

A −1 superscript in takes the inverse function of , where specifically denotes a pointwise reciprocal. Where is bijective specifying an output codomain of every from every input domain , there will be

: and .

When a subset of the codomain is specified inside the function , its inverse will yield an inverse image, or preimage, of that subset under the function.

Exponentiation to negative integers can be further extended to invertible elements of a ring by defining as the multiplicative inverse of ; in this context, these elements are considered units.

In a polynomial domain over any field , the polynomial has no inverse. If it did have an inverse , then there would be
:
which is not possible, and therefore, is not a field. More specifically, because the polynomial is not constant, it is not a unit in .

<doc id="449574" wikidata="Q1949112" url="?curid=449574" title="Shirdi">
<text>Shirdi (; also known as Sainagar) is a town and pilgrimage site in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Shirdi is located in the Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar District. It is most well known for being the home of the 19th-century Indian saint Sai Baba.

== History ==

In the mid-1850s, a young Sai Baba arrived and settled in Shirdi, then a small village. Although he was initially denounced by the villagers as a madman, over the following decades, he became a prominent spiritual figure, drawing both Hindu and Muslim devotees from the surrounding areas. Following his death in 1918, his remains were placed in &quot;Buti Wada&quot;, which eventually grew to become what is known today as Sai Baba&#x27;s Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.

== Demographics ==
As per the 2011 Indian census, the population of Shirdi stood at 36,004. Males constitute 53% of the population, and females make up 47%. Shirdi has an average literacy rate of 70%, which is higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy is 76%, and female literacy is 62%. In Shirdi, 15% of the population is under six years of age.

Being one of the most famous pilgrimage sites in India, much of Shirdi&#x27;s population is made up of tourists. Every day, roughly 60,000 religious tourists visit the Samadi Mandir.

== Transportation ==
=== Train ===
The Sainagar Shirdi railway station became operational in March 2009. As of 2011, there are trains from Chennai, Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Vijayawada, Hyderabad, Mysore, among others.

=== Air ===
Shirdi Airport was inaugurated by then-president Ramnath Kovind on 1 October 2017. Major destinations from Shirdi Airport include the airports of Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Mumbai. The airport is located in Kakadi, in the Kopargaon tahsil area, 14 km southwest of Shirdi. The construction, according to the original plans, was completed in February 2016, and the first trial flight took place on 2 March 2016. In July 2019, the state government approved extending the runway from 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) to 3,200 metres (10,500 ft), building a new terminal to boost hourly passenger capacity from 300 to 1,000, and adding night-landing facilities.

The nearest major airports are at Aurangabad and Pune, and respectively from Shirdi.

=== Road ===
Shirdi is accessible via State Highway 10, which runs south through Pune, Ahmednagar, Nashik, and Dhule districts.

<text>The Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus or FF+; , &quot;VF Plus&quot;) is a right-wing political party in South Africa that was formed (as the Freedom Front) in 1994. It is led by Pieter Groenewald. Since 2024, it is a part of the current South African government of national unity together with the African National Congress (ANC), the Democratic Alliance and other parties.

==History==
===Origins as the Freedom Front (19942003)===
The Freedom Front was founded on 1 March 1994 by members of the Afrikaner community under Constand Viljoen, after he had left the Afrikaner Volksfront amidst disagreements. Seeking to achieve his goals through electoral means, Viljoen registered the Freedom Front with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) on 4 March 1994 to take part in the April 1994 general elections (This date has also been given as 7 March). On 12 March 1994 Viljoen handed in a list of candidates for the FF to the IEC, confirming that his party would take part in the elections.

In the election, under the leadership of Viljoen, the Freedom Front received 2.2% of the national vote (with 424,555 votes cast), earning nine seats in the National Assembly, and 3.3% (with 639,643 votes cast) of the combined vote to the nine provincial legislatures. This suggested that many Afrikaners had split their vote. The party performed the best in the rural areas of the former Transvaal and Orange Free State, and was noted by the new deputy president Thabo Mbeki as representing possibly as much as half the Afrikaner voting population in these areas, with the strongest support among farmers and the working class.

Freedom Front support gradually eroded in the coming years, as the party was strung along in ultimately fruitless negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) to create a Volkstaat making the party lose its importance. It would also receive increased competition from new parties such as the Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging. In the 1999 election their support dropped to 0.8% (127,217 votes cast) with three seats in the National Assembly and between 1 and 2% in its stronghold provinces. This represented a respectable portion of the Afrikaner vote, but nowhere near earlier levels. The party&#x27;s support remained relatively stable in all national elections held during the next twenty years.

In 2001, Viljoen retired and Pieter Mulder was elected as leader.

===Formation of the FF+ and early years (20032016)===
In 2003, shortly before the 2004 general election, the Conservative Party, the Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging and the Freedom Front decided to contest the election as a single entity under the name Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus or FF+), led by Mulder. Later, the Federal Alliance also joined the VF+/FF+.

Under Mulder&#x27;s leadership the party&#x27;s support remained relatively stable.

In the 2004 general election, support for the Freedom Front Plus rose slightly to 0.89% (139,465 votes cast). The party won one seat in most of the provincial legislatures, and four seats in the National Assembly.

In the 2006 municipal elections, the FF Plus received 1% of the popular vote (252,253 votes cast).

In the 2009 general election, the party received 0.83% (146,796 votes cast) and retained its four seats in the National Assembly but lost its seats in the provincial legislatures of North West, Mpumalanga and Northern Cape. After the elections, the FF Plus&#x27;s leader Pieter Mulder was appointed as Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries by the new President Jacob Zuma.

In the 2014 general election, the FF Plus increased its vote slightly to 0.9%. It retained its 4 MPs, and also regained a seat in the North West.

The party also enjoyed consistent landslide victories in the Afrikaner enclave Orania.

Along with other parties, the FF Plus entered into coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA) after the 2016 municipal elections to govern Johannesburg, Tshwane and several other municipalities.

===Groenewald leadership and resurgence (2016present)===
In 2016, Pieter Groenewald took over leadership of the FF Plus. He oversaw a pivot of the party away from being an exclusive abode for Afrikaners to that of one for all minorities, with a special focus on Afrikaans-speaking minorities. This was highlighted when the FF Plus and the Bruin Bemagtiging Beweging (Brown Movement) an interest group focused on Coloureds led by Peter Marais, the former premier of the Western Cape formed an official alliance. This ultimately led to Marais being elected as the party&#x27;s candidate for premier of the Western Cape for the 2019 elections.

==== 2019 national and provincial elections ====
FF Plus voter support increased substantially in the 2019 general election, with the party growing its vote total by 250,000, to 2.38% of the national vote, earning ten seats in the National Assembly. This was more than the nine seats that the old Freedom Front had received in 1994. Additionally, it gained eight seats in the provincial legislatures, for a total of eleven. In the 2014 general election, the FF Plus won seats in three provincial legislatures, in 2019, it won seats in eight out of the nine provincial legislatures. Its new supporters were largely Afrikaners and Coloured voters from the Western Cape who had previously supported the DA.

Following the 2019 general election, the FF Plus won three wards from the Democratic Alliance (DA) in municipal by-elections in the North West Province and continued to show growth in various other municipal by-elections in Gauteng, Limpopo and Mpumalanga.

==== 2021 municipal elections and aftermath ====
In the run up to the 2021 local government elections, the FF Plus adopted Cape Independence as an official party position. They and CapeXit had a joint election campaign in the Western Cape to highlight the party&#x27;s stance on Cape Independence. Over 60% of the FF Plus&#x27;s ward councillors standing in the Western Cape were Coloureds, with Lennit Max being the party&#x27;s candidate for mayor of Cape Town. The party claims that their candidates are selected purely on merit in contrast to the DA.

The FF Plus continued their gains in the Western Cape as a result, being in the kingmaker position in over 6 districts. In 2022, FF Plus member Manicks Mpunwana became a city councilor in Bela-Bela, becoming the first black South African to serve as a councilor from the FF Plus.

==== 2024 election and Government of National Unity ====

In the 2024 general election, the FF Plus gave up many of the gains it had previously made against the DA, winning only six seats in Parliament (National Assembly) with 1.36% of the vote. In June 2024, Freedom Front Plus agreed to join the ANC-led government of national unity (GNU) aka Third Cabinet of Cyril Ramaphosa. The leader of the FF Plus, Pieter Groenewald, became Minister of Correctional Services in the new Cabinet. Following Groenewald&#x27;s appointment, leadership changes occurred in the party&#x27;s parliamentary caucus which saw Corné Mulder succeed Groenewald as parliamentary leader and Wouter Wessels succeed Mulder as chief whip.

On 22 February 2025, Mulder was elected unopposed to succeed Groenewald as party leader after the latter chose not to seek re-election.

== Policies and ideology ==
FF Plus is a right-wing, conservative political party with its beliefs and ideals largely centred around Afrikaner interests&#x27; and Afrikaner nationalism with an orientation around Christian values. With its origins in Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People&#x27;s Front) and the Conservative Party, FF Plus&#x27;s position has shifted to being more moderate and populist since its beginning, particularly under the leadership of Pieter Groenewald, who has campaigned to alleviate issues within both Afrikaner and Coloured communities, particularly within the Cape provinces (Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape). 

Within the South African political landscape, the FF Plus is considered further to the right than many other parties, however holds significant vote share with the Democratic Alliance (DA), many voters of which moved toward the FF Plus at the 2019 election. Both parties&#x27; voters also hold some crossover on policy matters, such as Cape independence and federalism.

As of 2021, its stated policy positions include abolishing affirmative action and replacing it with merit-based appointments, and opposing the proposed expropriation without compensation land reform movement to protect the rights and interests of minorities, especially Afrikaners and Afrikaans-speaking Coloureds. The party also supports greater self-determination for minorities throughout South Africa, and has adopted Cape independence as an official party position. In this regard, the party has put forward legislation in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament (known as the Western Cape People&#x27;s Bill) calling for a recognition of Western Cape self-determination.

=== Foreign policy ===
The party is critical of what it regards as South Africa&#x27;s contradictory foreign policy under the governing African National Congress (ANC). The FF Plus supports the strengthening of relations with countries that &quot;promote self-determination within their own borders&quot;, as well as countries with whom South Africa has strong existing trade ties. The party has called on South Africa to criticize the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, the party expressed support for Israel.

<text>Mark Haddon (born 26 September 1962) is an English novelist, best known for &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot; (2003). He won the Whitbread Award, the Dolly Gray Children&#x27;s Literature Award, the Guardian Prize, and a Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for his work.

==Life, work and studies==

In 2003, Haddon won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award—in the Novels rather than Children&#x27;s Books category—for &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&quot;. He also won the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize in the Best First Book category, as &quot;The Curious Incident&quot; was considered his first book written for adults. Despite being categorized as an adult book for some awards, Haddon also won the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize in 2003 for the book. The book was furthermore long-listed for the 2003 Man Booker Prize, and became a long-running stage play. 
Mr Reed was his friend. 
&quot;The Curious Incident&quot; is written from the perspective of an c 15-year-old boy, Christopher John Francis Boone. In an interview at Powells.com, Haddon claimed that this was the first book that he wrote intentionally for an adult audience; he was surprised when his publisher suggested marketing it to both adult and child audiences (it has been very successful with adults and children alike). However, it has also received criticism from autistic readers for its &#x27;depressing&#x27; depiction of Christopher, the autistic protagonist.

His short story &quot;The Pier Falls&quot; was longlisted for the 2015 Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award, the richest prize in the world for a single short story. He published a collection of short stories inspired by classical mythology called &quot;Dogs and Monsters&quot; in 2024.

In 2023, he turned down an OBE for his services to literature, saying: &#x27;I would feel uneasy accepting an honour which presumes an uncritical acceptance of the British Empire as a good thing.&#x27;

== Personal life ==
Haddon is a vegetarian. He describes himself as a &quot;hard-line atheist&quot;. In 2019, a heart bypass followed by long COVID left him with brain fog that made him unable to read or write. He spoke to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2024 about his five-year-long process of partial recovery, saying that although he still could not read properly, the fog was &quot;starting to thin a little&quot;. 

Haddon lives in Oxford with his wife Sos Eltis, a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford, and their two sons.

<text>The United Democratic Movement (UDM) is a centre-left, social-democratic, South African political party, formed by a prominent former National Party leader, Roelf Meyer (who has since resigned from the UDM), a former African National Congress and Transkei homeland leader, General Bantu Holomisa, and a former ANC Executive Committee member, John Taylor. It has an anti-separatist, pro-diversity platform; and supports an individualist South Africa with a strong moral sense, in both social and economic senses.

Mongameli Bobani was the Executive Mayor of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality from 2018 to 2019 and the first mayor from the UDM since the party governed King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality (2000-2002).

In the 2024 general election, UDM got three seats with 0.49% of the vote in Parliament (National Assembly).

In June 2024, United Democratic Movement agreed to join the ANC-led government of national unity (GNU). Leader of the UDM, Bantubonke ‘Bantu’ Holomisa, became the Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans in the Government of National Unity.

==Formation==

===The National Consultative Forum===

During his testimony at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Holomisa made reference to a possible bribe that was paid to the former Prime Minister of Transkei, Chief George Matanzima and Miss Stella Sigcau, the then incumbent Prime Minister. Holomisa was expelled from the ANC because of these allegations. In November 1996, Holomisa publicly announced consulting South Africans on the need or not for a new political party. With this objective, the National Consultative Forum (NCF) was established on 8 February 1997.

===The New Movement Process===

Roelf Meyer left the National Party on 17 May 1997, along with fellow politicians Nilo Botha, Takis Christodoulou, Kobus du Plessis, and Annelizé van Wyk, some of whom had resigned their seats in the Gauteng Legislature. At a three-day strategic planning conference in May 1997, it was decided that a political movement should be established capable of unifying people around shared values across racial, historical, ideological and social dividing lines. The New Movement Process (NMP) was then established.

Bantu Holomisa and Roelf Meyer (who had met with Meyer still representing the National Party to discuss the process for a new movement) again met at Loftus Versveld, in mid-1997, to discuss working together and agreed in principle to explore the possibility of formal cooperation. A Joint Committee (JC) between the NCF and the NMP was formed to look into matters of common interest. The JC amalgamated its two (NCF and NMP) technical support teams into a Technical Committee (TC) to act as its executive body to implement the brief of the JC. This was to “look into matters of common interest between the two sides… consider… the establishment of a new party at an appropriate time… (and) in regard to the latter question… (investigate) matters of strategy, time scales, policy and funding”. The TC was jointly chaired by Kobus du Plessis (NMP) and Joel Mafenya (NCF) and its first meeting took place at the Carlton Hotel on 22 June 1997. After a joint strategic session at the Vaal Dam in July 1997 it was agreed that a new political party should be formed. The United Democratic Movement was launched at the World Trade Centre, in Kempton Park, on 27 September 1997. Bantu Holomisa was elected the party&#x27;s first president at its first national congress in June 1998.

===First elections===

As one of several newcomer parties, UDM was among the most successful in the 1999 general election; the party garnered 3.4% and earned seats in six of the nine provincial legislatures. It also became the official opposition in the Northern Province and its stronghold, the Eastern Cape.

==Decline==

In the 2000 municipal elections, the UDM won control of the King Sabata Dalindyebo Local Municipality. The party lost the council during the floor crossing period, however, and this would begin a time of decline; In the 2004 general election, nine members were elected to the National Assembly, five fewer than were elected in the 1999 election. The UDM lost its position as the official opposition in the Eastern Cape after two of its members in the Eastern Cape Legislature had defected to the splinter United Independent Front in 2005.

On October 8, 2008, the UDM announced its kickoff of the 2009 general election campaign. It also welcomed over 300 former members of the ANC who had left their former party following the deposition of former president Thabo Mbeki in September 2008. Almost 1,000 former African National Congress members joined the party after the ANC recalled President Mbeki and replaced him with Kgalema Motlanthe. Nevertheless, the election would continue the downward trend of the UDM, with the party retaining only four MPs with 0.8% of the vote and losing its representation in all provinces except the Eastern Cape, where it was pushed into fourth place.

In 2014, a faction of the Congress of the People led by Mbhazima Shilowa joined the UDM. This helped to strengthen the party in its Eastern Cape stronghold, where it likely gained support from many previous COPE supporters. In the 2014 general elections, UDM support remained at very low levels in eight of the provinces, and it failed to re-establish itself nationally, but made a convincing rebound in the Eastern Cape, where it overtook COPE to become the third-largest party. The increase was especially convincing in the King Sabata Dalindyebo region. However, this new growth had largely evaporated by the time of the 2016 local elections.

The general election of 2019 saw its support drop further. The UDM lost half of its seats both nationally and in the Eastern Cape, becoming the seventh-most supported party nationally, and fourth-most in the Eastern Cape. In the 2021 South African municipal elections, party support declined even further, leaving the UDM as the twelfth-most supported party nationally.

<text>The Coroner&#x27;s Toolkit (or TCT) is a suite of free computer security programs by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema for digital forensic analysis. The suite runs under several Unix-related operating systems: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, SunOS/Solaris, Linux, and HP-UX. TCT is released under the terms of the IBM Public License.

Parts of TCT can be used to aid analysis of and data recovery from computer disasters.

TCT was superseded by The Sleuth Kit. Although TSK is only partially based on TCT, the authors of TCT have accepted it as official successor to TCT.

<text>Lozi, also known as Silozi and Rozi, is a Bantu language of the Niger–Congo language family within the Sotho–Tswana branch of Zone S (S.30), that is spoken by the Lozi people, primarily in southwestern Zambia and in surrounding countries. The language is most closely related to Northern Sotho (&quot;Sesotho sa Leboa&quot;), Tswana (&quot;Setswana&quot;), Kgalagari (&quot;SheKgalagari&quot;) and Sotho (&quot;Sesotho&quot;/Southern Sotho). Lozi, sometimes written as &quot;Rotse&quot;, and its dialects are spoken and understood by approximately six per cent of the population of Zambia. &quot;Silozi&quot; is the endonym (the name of the language used by its native speakers) as defined by the United Nations. &quot;Lozi&quot; is the exonym.

The origins of Silozi can be traced back to a mixture of languages, primarily Luyana and Kololo. The Luyana people migrated south from the Kingdom of Luba and Kingdom of Lunda in the Katanga area of the Congo River basin, either late in the 17th century or early in the 18th century. They settled on the floodplains of the upper Zambezi River in what is now western Zambia, where they established a kingdom called Barotseland or Bulozi.

In the 1830s, the Kololo people, originally from the Free State province of South Africa, fled northwards to escape the Mfecane under King Shaka Zulu (died 1828). They employed tactics learned from the Zulu armies to conquer the Luyana on the Zambezi floodplains, imposing their rule and language. However, by 1864, the indigenous population revolted and overthrew the Kololo. By then, the original Luyana language had largely been replaced by a new hybrid language, Silozi.

Today, Silozi is spoken in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, reflecting its historical development and cultural significance in the region.

==Phonology==
Lozi has 5 vowels:

20 consonants are in Lozi:

Tone is marked as high or low.

== Orthography ==

Lozi uses the Latin script, which was introduced by missionaries. In 1977, Zambia standardised the language&#x27;s orthography.

<text>Andrew Maxwell Haden (26 September 195029 July 2020) was a New Zealand rugby union player and All Black captain. He played at lock for Auckland and New Zealand from 1972 until 1985. He also played club rugby in the United Kingdom and Italy.

==Life and career==
Haden was born in Wanganui on 26 September 1950. He attended Wanganui Boys&#x27; College. He made his All Black debut in 1972, and his Test debut against the British Lions in 1977, going on to make 41 Test appearances and scoring two tries. Of those 41 appearances, 8 were as captain of the All Blacks. Haden was noted for his powerful scrummage skills and for his imposing presence at the lineout. He played club rugby for Auckland, Harlequins in London and Algida Rome in Italy. Off the field, he published his autobiography, &quot;Boots ’n All&quot;, in 1983. By receiving royalties from the book, he ostensibly tested the sport&#x27;s strict amateurism rules in force back then. He ultimately prevailed, however, by claiming that being a writer was his profession.

Haden was selected as one of the “Five players of the year” for the 1984 and 1985 seasons, in the Rugby Almanack of New Zealand.

Haden was a controversial player, who was accused of cheating and unsporting conduct. The most infamous occurrence of this happened in a match against at Cardiff Arms Park in 1978. The score was 12–10 in Wales&#x27;s favour, when Haden and another New Zealand player, Frank Oliver, fell to the ground as if pushed during a lineout after the ball had been thrown in. The referee awarded a penalty in the dying moments of the match, which Brian McKechnie kicked, winning the game for New Zealand. Later, Welsh legend J. P. R. Williams wrote that Haden should have been sent off. Despite the controversy however, the referee subsequently stated that the penalty had actually been awarded for an actual infringement against Oliver and not the Haden &#x27;dive&#x27; as was thought. Haden did not, however, deny that the attempts to cheat the referee were pre-planned, something also confirmed by his captain Graham Mourie. The match happened on the same day as the annual &#x27;Miss World&#x27; competition, which prompted Welsh cartoonist Gren to create a picture of the &#x27;Miss World&#x27; event, but with Miss New Zealand lying on the floor, pretending to have been pushed. Haden made his last Test appearance in 1985 against .

==Later years==
Haden was an agent for various celebrities, including Rachel Hunter. He was given the honorary position of Rugby World Cup Ambassador in 2010, but resigned the post after making controversial statements about a racial quota he alleged the Crusaders to be operating, calling Polynesians &quot;darkies&quot;, and then suggesting women raped by sports stars may be partly to blame.

In 2003, Haden announced that he was beginning chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He overcame this bout of illness, but in February 2020 was diagnosed with lymphoma. He consequently died of lymphoma on 29 July 2020, at his home in Auckland. He was 69 years old.

<doc id="449601" wikidata="Q3933276" url="?curid=449601" title="Republican Liberty Caucus">
<text>The Republican Liberty Caucus (RLC) is a political action organization dedicated to promoting the ideals of individual liberty, limited government and free market economics within the Republican Party in the United States. It is part of the libertarian wing of the Republican Party. It also operates a political action committee, the RLC-USA PAC.

The organization was founded in 1991 and has chapters in many states. In 2011, the organization hosted its National Convention in Arlington, Virginia. The 2013 convention was held in Austin, Texas and the 2015 National Convention was hosted in Nashua, New Hampshire.

==Issues==
The RLC works within the Republican Party to influence the party to adopt the RLC&#x27;s agenda. As activist Tom Heitman put it, &quot;We&#x27;re trying to reintroduce the Republican platform to the Republican Party.&quot;

The RLC favors individual freedom and limited government. Specifically, the RLC favors reduced government intrusion, lower taxes, elimination of federal agencies, less regulation, a strong national defense with fewer military bases abroad, and no foreign aid.

In 2010, the Republican Liberty Caucus of Texas denounced the new state Republican Party platform that supported criminalization of sodomy and making same-sex marriage a felony.

==Leadership==

==Endorsements==

===Presidential endorsements===
The Republican Liberty Caucus&#x27; process for endorsing presidential candidates is described in the organization&#x27;s Bylaws and Rules:
A candidate for President of the United States may be endorsed by the Caucus by a 2/3 vote of the active and voting Chartered state&#x27;s executive committees. The national Secretary shall notify all Chartered states of a favorable national board proposal for endorsement and state executive officers shall inform the Secretary of the approval or denial by their executive committee within 60 days.

Since the Caucus&#x27; founding in 1991, only three candidates have reached this level of support: Steve Forbes 1996, Ron Paul in 2012 and Rand Paul in 2016. When Forbes ran again in 2000, the organization remained neutral in that primary and did not endorse another specific Republican candidate in any presidential primary until December 30, 2011, when the RLC endorsed Ron Paul for President. In 2016, his son Rand Paul was also endorsed by the RLC.

===Notable 2012 endorsements===

On November 2, 2011, the Republican Liberty Caucus announced its first two endorsements in the 2012 election: Barry Hinckley, ran in the Republican primary in Rhode Island, and Brian K. Hill, ran in the Republican primary in Connecticut. The Republican nominee in Rhode Island challenged Democratic United States Senator Sheldon Whitehouse while the Republican nominee in Connecticut ran for an open seat being vacated by independent United States Senator Joseph Lieberman.

<doc id="449605" wikidata="Q612177" url="?curid=449605" title="Constantin Ion Parhon">
<text>Constantin Ion Parhon (; 15 October 1874 – 9 August 1969) was a Romanian neuropsychiatrist, endocrinologist and politician. He was the first head of state of the Romanian People&#x27;s Republic from 1947 to 1952. Parhon was President of the Physicians and Naturalists Society in Iași, director of medical institutes, professor, and a titular member of the Romanian Academy.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Câmpulung to the schoolteacher Ioan Parhon and his wife Maria (née Bauer). His father was originally from Cetatea de Baltă (today Alba County, formerly Târnava-Mică County). He started his secondary studies in Focșani and at the Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu High School in Buzău, and completed them at the Saints Peter and Paul High School in Ploiești, obtaining his baccalaureate in 1892. 

Parhon then went to Bucharest, where he studied medicine at the University of Bucharest from 1893 to 1900, when he obtained the scientific title of Doctor of Medicine with the thesis &quot;Contributions to the study of vasomotor disorders in hemiplegia&quot;. During his studies, he worked as an external (1896–1897) and internal (1897–1900) hospitalist in Bucharest.

== Working career ==
After completing his studies and obtaining his doctorate, he worked as a doctor at the &quot;Rallet&quot; Rural Hospital in Dâmbovița County (1901–1902) and then as a secondary doctor at the Pantelimon Hospital (1903–1909). During this period, he became a professor at the Clinic for Nervous Diseases in Bucharest (1903), following a training course in Munich in 1906. He then became primary doctor at the Mărcuța Hospice (1909–1912). 

He was employed in higher medical education, as a university professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Iași (1913–1933) and of the endocrinology clinic at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Bucharest (1933–1940 and 1944–1958). 

Parhon was the founder of the Romanian school of endocrinology. In 1909, he co-authored with Moise Goldstein the first book on endocrinology, &quot;Secrețiile Interne&quot; (&quot;Internal Secretions&quot;). Later on, he published a &quot;Handbook of Endocrinology&quot;, co-written with Goldstein and (3 volumes, 1945–1949). Parhon published over 400 titles, and was known for his encyclopaedic knowledge. Besides the afore-mentioned works, some of his other well-known works are &quot;Old Age and Its Treatment&quot; (1948), &quot;The Age Biology&quot; (1955), and &quot;Selected Works&quot; (5 volumes, 1954–1962). He was an honorary member of the Soviet, Bulgarian, and East German academies, as well as the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, as well as several foreign scientific societies. In 1948, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Charles University of Prague.

== Politics ==
As a socialist militant who, according to his own testimony, was influenced by the works of Karl Marx in his teens, Parhon was one of the founders of a Laborer Party (&quot;Partidul Muncitoresc&quot;), a short-lived group that fused into the left-wing Peasants&#x27; Party in 1919. A short while after the fusion, Parhon split with the group and became politically inclined toward the Romanian Communist Party.

He allegedly protested against Romania&#x27;s participation in World War II on the Axis side (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), but, according to some sources, he was also a representative in Romania for the Reich-based chemical and pharmaceutical company Merck Darmstadt. In November 1944, after the August 23 coup d&#x27;état that led Romania to switch sides in the war and join the Allies, he became President of the Romanian Association for Strengthening the Ties with the Soviet Union, which had been founded at his villa in Sinaia. He was a deputy in Parliament (known as the Assembly of Deputies) and the Great National Assembly between 1946 and 1961. After the forced abdication of King Michael I on 30 December 1947, the Deputies&#x27; Assembly adopted Law No. 363, through which Romania became a People&#x27;s Republic and the 1923 Constitution was repealed. The same law provided for a Presidium composed of five members (elected by the Deputies&#x27; Assembly) to exercise the executive powers in the state; alongside Parhon, its members were Mihail Sadoveanu, Ștefan Voitec, , and Ion Niculi. Shortly afterwards, Parhon became the President of the Presidium, thus becoming Romania&#x27;s head of state.
On 13 April 1948, the Parliament adopted a new Constitution, which borrowed heavily from the Soviet model of 1936 and entrusted the supreme powers to the Great National Assembly – which in turn elected a Presidium, composed of a president, three vice-presidents, a secretary and 14 members. The same day, Parhon was elected as President of the Presidium, though the real power in the state was exercised by the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party and its First Secretary, Gheorghe Gheorgiu-Dej. On 22 August 1950, he issued a decree (together with Marin Florea Ionescu) whereby Brașov was renamed &quot;Orașul Stalin&quot; (Stalin City), &quot;in honor of the great genius of working humanity, the leader of the Soviet people, the liberator and beloved friend of our people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.&quot;

Parhon was a member of the Romanian Academy and other scientific societies. He was awarded the title of &quot;Hero of Socialist Labor&quot; and received the State Prize. He liked to be referred to as a &quot;citizen-scientist&quot;.

== Death ==

He resigned from political office in June 1952, dedicating the rest of his life to scientific research. He was buried in the round hall of &quot;The Monument of the Heroes for the Freedom of the People and of the Motherland, for Socialism&quot; in Bucharest&#x27;s Carol Park. In the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution of December 1989, his remains were exhumed in 1991, and interred in another cemetery.

== Legacy ==
He remained in public knowledge as Doctor Constantin I. Parhon, founder of the Romanian school of endocrinology, active full member and honorary president (1948–1969) of the Romanian Academy. Streets in Bârlad, Cornățelu, Mangalia, Mediaș, and Râmnicu Sărat are named in his honor, as is the Dr. C. I. Parhon Hospital in Iași.

<doc id="449608" wikidata="Q7535193" url="?curid=449608" title="Skill testing question">
<text>Skill testing questions (or STQ) are a legal requirement attached to many contests in Canada.

==Origin==
The combined effect of Sections 197 to 206 of the Canadian Criminal Code bans for-profit gaming or betting, with exceptions made for provincial lotteries, licensed casinos, and charity events. Many stores, radio stations, and other groups still wish to hold contests to encourage more purchases or increase consumer interest. These organizations take advantage of the fact that the law does allow prizes to be given for games of skill, or mixed games of skill and chance. To make the chance-based contests legal, such games generally consist of a mathematical skill-testing question (STQ). Penalties for violating the contest section of the Criminal Code, if it was enforced, include up to two years of imprisonment if charged as an indictable offense or a fine no more than $25,000 on a summary conviction charge. 

The Promotional Contest Provision of the Competition Act also states that &quot;selection of participants or distribution of prizes is not made on the basis of skill or on a random basis.&quot;

Courts have accepted estimating the number of beans in a jar as a game with skill, as well as estimating the number of votes will be cast in an upcoming election as a game with mixed skill and chance. Thus neither example requires additional STQ as the skill component has been met.

==Question format==
The most common form that these questions take is as an arithmetic exercise. A court decision ruled that a mathematical STQ must contain at least three operations to actually be a test of skill. For example, a sample question is &quot;(16 × 5) - (12 ÷ 4)&quot; (Answer: 77). The winner should not receive any assistance (e.g. using a calculator, asking another individual to calculate the answer for the winner) in answering the STQ. Enforcement of these rules is not very stringent, especially for small prizes. Enforcement is often impossible if the winner chooses the time and location to answer the question (for example, the question is attached to the prize claim form). In most cases, there is no individual monitoring to ensure the integrity of answering STQ without assistance and the winner will submit the claim form having affirmed that they completed STQ without any assistance. In some cases, the player may not be required to answer the STQ to claim a prize. The questions are also becoming easier. For contests held in other countries but open to Canadians, a STQ must be asked of any potential Canadian winner.

==Consequences for not answering correctly==
Since those sections of the Criminal Code require elements of skill for the winners to be awarded of their prize, not answering the STQ correctly can result in the prize not being awarded. This has happened in at least one occasion for Tim Hortons&#x27; Roll Up the Rim contest winner in 2008. The individual failed to answer the same STQ correctly on the prize claim form twice due to a learning disability. Tim Hortons refused to release the prize until the intervention of a local newspaper.

==Free entry alternative==
The Criminal Code also prohibits receiving consideration in exchange for playing the games, resulting in the &quot;free entry alternative&quot; which is usually indicated by &quot;No purchase necessary&quot; in the fine print of a contest. Generally this means that it is possible to enter the contest for free by, for example, writing a letter to the entity sponsoring the contest and requesting a game piece or entry form.

<text>The present tense (abbreviated  or ) is a grammatical tense whose principal function is to locate a situation or event in the present time. The present tense is used for actions which are happening now. In order to explain and understand present tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which the past tense, the present and the future tense are positioned. The term &quot;present tense&quot; is usually used in descriptions of specific languages to refer to a particular grammatical form or set of forms; these may have a variety of uses, not all of which will necessarily refer to present time. For example, in the English sentence &quot;My train leaves tomorrow morning&quot;, the verb form &quot;leaves&quot; is said to be in the present tense, even though in this particular context it refers to an event in future time. Similarly, in the historical present, the present tense is used to narrate events that occurred in the past.

There are two common types of present tense form in most Indo-European languages: the present indicative (the combination of present tense and indicative mood) and the present subjunctive (the combination of present tense and subjunctive mood). The present tense is mainly classified into four parts or subtenses.
# Simple present : The simple present tense is employed in a sentence to represent an action or event that takes place in the present regularly.
# Present perfect : The present perfect tense is utilized for events that begin in the past and continue to the moment of speaking, or to express the result of a past situation. 
# Present continuous: The present continuous tense is used to describe an action that is happening right now.
# Present perfect continuous

==Use==
The present indicative of most verbs in modern English has the same form as the infinitive, except for the third-person singular form, which takes the ending &quot;-[e]s&quot;. The verb &quot;be&quot; has the forms &quot;am&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;. For details, see English verbs. For the present subjunctive, see English subjunctive.

A number of multi-word constructions exist to express the combinations of present tense with the basic form of the present tense is called the simple present; there are also constructions known as the present progressive (or present continuous) (e.g. &quot;am writing&quot;), the present perfect (e.g. &quot;have written&quot;), and the present perfect progressive (e.g. &quot;have been writing&quot;).

Use of the present tense does not always imply the present time. In particular, the present tense is often used to refer to future events (&quot;I am seeing James tomorrow&quot;; &quot;My train leaves at 3 o&#x27;clock this afternoon&quot;). This is particularly the case in condition clauses and many other adverbial subordinate clauses: &quot;If you see him...&quot;; &quot;As soon as they arrive...&quot; There is also the historical present, in which the present tense is used to narrate past events.

For details of the uses of present tense constructions in English, see Uses of English verb forms.

==Hellenic languages==
=== Modern Greek present indicative tense ===
In Modern Greek, the present tense is used in a similar way to the present tense in English and can represent the present continuous as well. As with some other conjugations in Greek, some verbs in the present tense accept different (but equivalent) forms of use for the same person. What follows are examples of present tense conjugation in Greek for the verbs βλέπω (see), τρώω (eat) and αγαπώ (love).

==Romance languages==
The Romance languages are derived from Latin, and in particular western Vulgar Latin. As a result, their usages and forms are similar.

=== Latin present indicative tense ===
The Latin present tense can be translated as progressive or simple present. Here are examples of the present indicative tense conjugation in Latin.

=== French present indicative tense ===
In French, the present tense is used similarly to that of English. Below is an example of present tense conjugation in French.

The present indicative is commonly used to express the present continuous. For example, &quot;Jean mange&quot; may be translated as &quot;John eats&quot;, &quot;John is eating&quot;. To emphasise the present continuous, expressions such as &quot;en train de&quot; may be used. For example, &quot;Jean est en train de manger&quot; may be translated as &quot;John is eating&quot;, &quot;John is in the middle of eating.&quot; &quot;On est en train de chercher un nouvel appartement&quot; may be translated as &quot;We are looking for a new apartment&quot;, &quot;We are in the process of finding a new apartment.&quot;

=== Italian present indicative tense ===
In Italian, the present tense is used similarly to that of English. What follows is an example of present indicative tense conjugation in Italian.

=== Portuguese and Spanish present indicative tense ===
The present tenses of Portuguese and Spanish are similar in form, and are used in similar ways. What follows are examples of the present indicative conjugation in Portuguese.

There follow examples of the corresponding conjugation in Spanish.

==Slavic languages==
=== Bulgarian present indicative tense ===
In Bulgarian, the present indicative tense of imperfective verbs is used in a very similar way to the present indicative in English. It can also be used as present progressive. Below is an example of present indicative tense conjugation in Bulgarian.

*Archaic, no infinitive in the modern language.

=== Macedonian present tense ===

The present tense in Macedonian is expressed using imperfective verbs. The following table shows the conjugation of the verbs &quot;write&quot; (&quot;пишува/pišuva&quot;), &quot;speak&quot; (&quot;зборува/zboruva&quot;), &quot;want&quot; (&quot;сака/saka&quot;) and &quot;open&quot; (&quot;отвaра/otvara&quot;).

==Sinitic languages==
In Wu Chinese, unlike other Sinitic languages (Varieties of Chinese), some tenses can be marked, including the present tense. For instance, in Suzhounese and Old Shanghainese, the word is used. The particle is placed at the end of a clause, and when a tense is referenced, the word order switches to SOV.

In a sentence such as &quot;&quot;, it would be the perfective aspect in Standard Mandarin, whereas this would be analysed as the present tense in contemporary Shanghainese, where has undergone lenition to .

<doc id="449626" wikidata="Q1150921" url="?curid=449626" title="State of Deseret">
<text>The State of Deseret (modern pronunciation , contemporaneously , as recorded in the Deseret alphabet spelling 𐐔𐐯𐑅𐐨𐑉𐐯𐐻) was a proposed state of the United States promoted by leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who had founded settlements in what is today the state of Utah. A provisional state government operated for nearly two years in 1849–50, but was never recognized by the United States government. The name Deseret derives from the word for &quot;honeybee&quot; in the Book of Mormon.

==History==

===Proposed concept as territory, then state===
When members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon pioneers) settled in the Salt Lake Valley near the Great Salt Lake in 1847 (then part of the Centralist Republic of Mexico), they wished to establish a government that would be recognized by the United States.

Initially, second LDS Church president Brigham Young intended to apply for status as a territory and sent John Milton Bernhisel to Washington, D.C. with a petition for territorial status. Realizing that California and New Mexico were applying for admission as states, Young changed his mind and decided to petition for statehood.

Realizing that they did not have time to follow the usual steps toward statehood, Young and a group of church elders formed a convention in the capital town of Salt Lake City, where they quickly drafted and adopted a state constitution on March 6, 1849. It was based on that of Iowa, a state through which the Mormons had passed, with some having temporarily settled there. The bicameral state legislature had 17 senators in its upper chamber and 35 representatives, in the lower chamber, all free white male citizens. The state government also had an elected governor, a lieutenant governor and a supreme court. However, the state constitution was silent on the issue of slavery, which was tearing the nation apart in the 1850s. The state constitution took effect on May 10.

The government sent the legislative records and constitution to Iowa for printing because no printing press existed in the Great Basin. They then sent Almon W. Babbitt with a copy of the state&#x27;s formal records and constitution to meet with Bernhisel in Washington, D.C. and to petition for statehood rather than for territorial status.

===Geography of the proposed state===

The provisional state encompassed most of the territory that had been acquired from Mexico the previous year as the Mexican Cession.

The Territory of Deseret would have comprised roughly all of the lands between the mountain ranges of the Sierra Nevada in the west and the Rockies to the east, and between the initial southern border with Mexico and northward to include parts of the Oregon Territory (recently split along the 49th parallel of latitude by treaty with the British further north in western Canada), as well as the coast of northern California south of the Santa Monica Mountains (including the existing settlements, missions and pueblos of Los Angeles and San Diego). This included the entire watershed of the upper Colorado River (excluding the lands south of the 1854 new second border with Mexico), after the borderline Gadsden Purchase of 1854, as well as the entire area of the central Great Basin. The proposal encompassed nearly all of present-day Utah and Nevada, large portions of eastern California along with Arizona and parts of western Colorado and New Mexico, southern Wyoming and Idaho, along with southeastern Oregon.

The proposal was crafted specifically to avoid disputes that might arise from existing settlements of White Americans. At the time of its proposal, the existing population of the Deseret area, including Southern California, was sparse, since most of the California settlement had been in the northern California gold rush areas of 1848—1849 around San Francisco Bay and Sacramento, areas not included in the provisional state. The border with New Mexico did not reach the Rio Grande, an intentional decision to avoid becoming entangled in the disputes of the western and northwestern borders of Texas after the former Republic of Texas was admitted as the 28th state in 1846. Deseret also avoided encroaching on the fertile Willamette Valley further north in western Oregon, which had been heavily traveled and settled by legions of wagon trains since the 1840s with the famous Oregon Trail. Planners utilized &quot;a map drawn by cartographer Charles Preuss (1803-1854), and published by order of the United States Senate in 1848.&quot; This map was drawn by Preuss based on survey data from famous military officer and Western explorer John C. Frémont (1813–1890), and published in 1848.
As the proposal encompassed lands largely considered inhospitable for cultivation, it was hoped that Deseret might avoid conflict over the issue of the expansion of slavery. Its size would make it easier to preserve the balance of power in the Senate, by decreasing the number of free states entered into the Union. However, the proposal for the state was seen as too ambitious to succeed in Congress, even setting aside controversy over the Mormons and the rumored but not yet publicly acknowledged practice of polygamy.

===Political context for creation of Utah Territory===
The California Constitutional Convention debates of 1849 in Monterey, California mentioned the Mormons or Salt Lake a number of times along with the continuing and intensifying North–South political, social and economic conflict over the extension of slavery into the western territories of the United States. Advocates of smaller boundaries for the new 31st state to the east (such as the longitude meridian line of 116° west or the crest of the Sierra Nevada range of the western Rocky Mountains) argued that the Mormons were unrepresented at the constitutional convention, culturally different and apparently planning to apply for their own territorial government to be formed further to the east. They also argued that the Great Salt Lake was too distant for a single territorial or state government to be practical and that Congress would not agree to such a large state (after the controversy over boundaries five years earlier with the admission of the Republic of Texas as the 28th state in 1846). California delegates advocated retention of all of the Centralist Republic of Mexico&#x27;s former province along the Pacific Ocean coast of Alta California (Upper California) from the Mexican Cession of Mexico&#x27;s northwestern territories in the peace treaty following the defeat in the Mexican–American War of 1846—1849. It resulted in extensive lands acquired in the current Southwestern United States.

With congressional action regarding Upper California&#x27;s boundaries and status soon approaching, the provisional government to the east of Deseret sent Mormon apostle Amasa Lyman, and John Wilson, a federal Indian agent in California, as a delegation to the interim government of California, then situated in the temporary capital of the coastal ocean town of Monterey. The delegates sought to call a new statehood constitutional convention and include Deseret in the new state to settle the slavery question throughout the vast territory acquired from Mexico. However, the newly elected first governor of California, Peter H. Burnett, rejected the proposal on the basis that the community in the Great Salt Lake area was too far east beyond the Sierra Nevada mountains and Great Basin Desert (in future Nevada) to combine under a single western government, even temporarily.

On September 9, 1850, as part of the negotiated Compromise of 1850, the new Utah Territory was created by an act of Congress, encompassing a portion of the northern section of the earlier proposed state of Deseret. The slavery question would be decided by a voting referendum of the territory&#x27;s residents.

===Lingering impact after territorial incorporation===

On February 3, 1851, Brigham Young was inaugurated as the first governor of the Utah Territory. On April 4, 1851, the General Assembly of Deseret passed a resolution to dissolve the state. On October 4, 1851, the Utah territorial legislature voted to reenact the laws and ordinances of the state of Deseret.

After the establishment of the Utah Territory, the Mormons did not relinquish the idea of a state of Deseret. From 1862 to 1870, a group of Mormon elders under Young&#x27;s leadership met as a shadow government after each session of the territorial legislature to ratify the new laws under the name of the State of Deseret. Attempts were made in 1856, 1862 and 1872 to write a new state constitution under that name, based on the new boundaries of the Utah Territory.

The idea of creating a secular American political state based on the religious tenets of Mormonism began to weaken, especially after the advent of the transcontinental railroad, which made the territory available to many non-Mormon settlers, particularly in the western areas of the territory. Young and the church leaders supported the massive construction project of the east–west railroad, even reassigning workers from the monumental Salt Lake Temple to work on the Central Pacific Railroad heading east from the Pacific Ocean to the Rocky Mountains to link with the Union Pacific Railroad driving westward from Missouri and Nebraska. The legendary driving of the famous golden spike just 66 miles northeast from the Great Salt Lake completed the first transcontinental railroad across North America at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory in May 1869, two decades after its establishment.

==Government==

Prior to the establishment of Utah Territory, in the absence of other authority, the provisional government of Deseret became the &quot;de facto&quot; government of the Great Basin. Three sessions of its General Assembly, a bicameral state legislature, were held. In 1850, the legislature appointed judges and established a criminal code. Taxes were established on property, and liquor and gambling were outlawed. The LDS Church was incorporated and a militia, based on the earlier Nauvoo Legion (from Nauvoo, Illinois, where the Mormon pilgrims were formerly centered), was formed.

The legislature initially formed six counties that covered only inhabited valleys. These counties initially encompassed only a small portion of the area of Deseret and were expanded as settlement grew.

==Flags==
According to most descriptions, the Deseret flag was similar to the historic Utah state flag. However, it was not standardized, and several other secular and religious alternatives were used. Variants similar to the American flag were also reported.
==Deseret in fiction==
*In Ward Moore&#x27;s 1953 alternate history novel &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot;, set in an alternate timeline reality where the Confederacy won the U.S. Civil War and the United States in the North became a corrupt and dysfunctional rump state, Deseret is mentioned as the only prosperous state in the Union&#x27;s Far West (where polygamy is still practiced).
*In the Car Wars board game first published in 1980 (and fiction set in its near-future alternate universe), Utah secedes from the U.S. under the name the Republic of Deseret in the aftermath of a second Civil War, but eventually agrees to rejoin as an &quot;autonomous region&quot;. More specific details are provided in &quot;Volume Seven: Mountain West&quot; of &quot;The AADA Road Atlas and Survival Guide&quot;. According to the &quot;Car Wars Sixth Edition&quot; first published in 2020, this will happen in 2065.
*In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series of post-Civil War alternate fiction books, published 1997 to 2007, the Mormons of Utah attempt to secede from the United States as Deseret during the supposed Second Mexican War and the First and Second Great Wars. This results in the LDS Church being banned by that futuristic U.S. government.
*In Paradox Interactive&#x27;s grand strategy game &quot;Victoria II&quot;, as well as its sequel, &quot;Victoria 3&quot;, Deseret is a formable nation that may gain independence from Mexico or the United States.
*In Francis Spufford&#x27;s 2023 alternative history novel &quot;Cahokia Jazz&quot;, Deseret is an independent republic, negotiating for admission to the Union in the slightly different 1920s.

<text>The HP-35 was Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s first pocket calculator and the world&#x27;s first &quot;scientific&quot; pocket calculator: a calculator with trigonometric and exponential functions. It was introduced in 1972.

==History==
In about 1970 HP co-founder Bill Hewlett challenged France Rode to create a &quot;shirt-pocket sized HP-9100&quot;. At the time, slide rules were the only practical portable devices for performing trigonometric and exponential functions, as existing pocket calculators could only perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Introduced at , like HP&#x27;s first scientific calculator, the desktop 9100A, it used reverse Polish notation (RPN) rather than what came to be called &quot;algebraic&quot; entry. The &quot;35&quot; in the calculator&#x27;s name came from the number of keys.

The original HP-35 was available from 1972 to 1975. In 2007 HP announced the release of the &quot;retro&quot;-look HP 35s to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the launch of the original HP-35. It was priced at .

The HP-35 was named an IEEE Milestone in 2009.

==Description==
The calculator used a traditional floating decimal display for numbers that could be displayed in that format, but automatically switched to scientific notation for other numbers. The fifteen-digit LED display was capable of displaying a ten-digit mantissa plus its sign and a decimal point and a two-digit exponent plus its sign. The display used a unique form of multiplexing, illuminating a single LED segment at a time rather than a single LED digit, because HP research had shown that this method was perceived by the human eye as brighter for equivalent power. Light-emitting diodes were relatively new at the time and were much dimmer than high-efficiency diodes developed in subsequent decades.

The calculator used three &quot;AA&quot;-sized NiCd batteries assembled into a removable proprietary battery pack. Replacement battery packs are no longer available, leaving existing HP-35 calculators to rely on AC power, or their users to rebuild the battery packs themselves using available cells. An external battery charger was available, and the calculator could also run from the charger, with or without batteries installed.

Internally, the calculator was organized around a serial (1-bit) processor chipset dual sourced under contract from Mostek and American MicroSystems Inc (pictured), processing Decimal floating point numbers with 10 digit mantissa and 2 digit exponent, stored in 14 nibble (56 bit) numbers as BCD including two nibbles for the signs.

The calculator had a four-register stack (x, y, z and t). The stack was represented in the operating manuals with the t register at the top, followed by the registers z, y, and x. The &quot;enter&quot; key pushed the displayed value (x) up the stack. Any binary operation popped the bottom two registers and pushed the result. When the stack was popped, the t register duplicated into the z register. The ‚roll down‘ operation treated the stack like a ring buffer by ‚rolling down‘ the register contents from t to z, z to y, y to x, and x to t.

==Descendants==
The HP-35 was the start of a family of related calculators with similar mechanical packaging:
* The HP-45 added many more features, including the ability to control the output format (rather than the purely automatic format of the HP-35). It also contained an undocumented timer feature. The timer worked, but was not accurate enough to use as a stopwatch due to lack of a crystal oscillator.
* The HP-65 added programmability, with program storage on magnetic cards.
* The HP-55, a less expensive follow-on to the HP-65, provided storage for smaller programs, but didn&#x27;t provide any external storage. The timer that was already present on the HP-45 was now crystal-controlled to achieve the needed accuracy and explicitly documented.
* The HP-67 expanded on the programmability of the HP-65, and added fully merged keycodes.
* The HP-80 and cheaper HP-70 provided financial, rather than scientific functions, such as future value and net present value.

Follow-on calculators used varying mechanical packaging but most were operationally similar. The HP-25 was a smaller, cheaper model of a programmable scientific calculator without magnetic card reader, with features much like the HP-65. The HP-41C was a major advance in programmability and capacity, and offered CMOS memory so that programs were not lost when the calculator was switched off. It was the first calculator to offer alphanumeric capabilities for both the display and the keyboard. Four external ports below the display area allowed memory expansion (RAM modules), loading of additional programs (ROM modules) and interfacing a wide variety of peripherals including HP-IL (&quot;HP Interface Loop&quot;), a scaled-down version of the HPIB/GPIB/IEEE-488 instrument bus. The later HP-28C and HP-28S added much more memory and a substantially different, more powerful programming metaphor.

== Calculator trivia ==
* The HP-35 was long and wide, said to have been designed to fit into one of William Hewlett&#x27;s shirt pockets.
* Was the first scientific calculator to fly in space in 1973.
* HP-35 calculators were carried on the Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 flights, between July 1973 and February 1974.
* Is the first pocket calculator with a numeric range that covered 200 decades (more precise 199, ±10±99).
* The LED display power requirement was responsible for the HP-35&#x27;s short battery life between charges—about three hours. To extend operating time and avoid wearing out the on/off slide switch, users would press the decimal point key to force the display to illuminate just a single LED junction.
* The HP-35 calculated arithmetic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions but the complete implementation used only 767 carefully chosen instructions (7670 bits).
* One high-quality feature of the HP-35 was its use of double-injected keys. Rather than printing the function on the key surface where it could wear off over time and use as with cheaper calculators, the keys were constructed with two colors of plastic, providing durable key top labels for the labeled keys.
* Introduction of the HP-35 and similar scientific calculators by Texas Instruments soon thereafter signaled the demise of the slide rule among science and engineering students. Slide rule holsters rapidly gave way to &quot;electronic slide rule&quot; holsters, and colleges began to drop slide-rule classes from their curricula.
* 100,000 HP-35 calculators were sold in the first year, and over 300,000 by the time it was discontinued in 1975—3½ years after its introduction.

<text>Guy Drut (born 6 December 1950) is an Olympic champion and politician who won gold at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal in the 110 m hurdles. In 1996, he became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

==Biography==
===Sports career===
Born in Oignies, Pas-de-Calais, France, Drut captured the silver medal in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, finishing behind the American Rod Milburn. In the European Championship of 1974 Drut came a comfortable first. It was at the next Olympics that Guy was to realise his dream, winning the 110 m hurdles in a time of 13.30 ahead of Cuba&#x27;s Alejandro Casañas and the American Willie Davenport.

===Political career===
After retirement Guy became active in business and politics, with one of his roles being Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports in the conservative government of Alain Juppé from 1995 to 1997. He has been convicted by French courts (a 15-month suspended prison sentence) at the end of 2005 for accepting fictitious employment as political patronage; as a consequence suspended by the IOC. In 2006, president Jacques Chirac amnestied Drut, using a rarely used clause in a 2002 amnesty law authorizing the president to grant amnesty for certain categories of crimes to people who had made great contributions to France in certain fields.
The move caused great controversy, including within the majority members of Parliament: president of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debré commented that it gave an unpleasant impression of &quot;self-washing machine&quot; but said it was a &quot;courageous&quot; move that he would not have made;
Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the majority party UMP, disapproved such uses of amnesty. 
Chirac justified it by France&#x27;s regaining a seat at IOC.

Drut served on the IOC&#x27;s Evaluation Commission for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="449641" wikidata="Q1458366" url="?curid=449641" title="Urðarbrunnr">
<text>Urðarbrunnr (Old Norse &quot;Wellspring of Urðr&quot;; either referring to a Germanic concept of fate—&quot;urðr&quot;—or the norn named Urðr) is a spring or well in Norse mythology. Urðarbrunnr is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, the wellspring lies beneath the world tree Yggdrasil, and is associated with a trio of norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld). In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Urðarbrunnr is cited as one of three wellsprings existing beneath three roots of Yggdrasil that reach into three distant, different lands; the other two wellsprings being Hvergelmir, located beneath a root in Niflheim, and Mímisbrunnr, located beneath a root near the home of the frost jötnar. Scholarly theory and speculation surrounds the wellspring.

==Attestations==
Urðarbrunnr is attested in the following works:
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, Urðarbrunnr is mentioned in stanzas 19 and 20 of the poem &quot;Völuspá&quot;, and stanza 112 of the poem &quot;Hávamál&quot;. In stanza 19 of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil, and that Yggdrasil, an ever-green ash-tree, is covered with white mud or loam. Stanza 20 describes that three norns (Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld) &quot;come from&quot; the well, here described as a &quot;lake&quot;, and that this trio of norns then &quot;set down laws, they chose lives, for the sons of men the fates of men.&quot;

Stanza 112 of &quot;Hávamál&quot; has been the matter of much debate and is considered unclear, having been referred to as &quot;mysterious&quot;, &quot;obscure and much-debated&quot;. Benjamin Thorpe translates the stanza as:

:Time &#x27;tis to discourse from the preacher&#x27;s chair.
:By the well of Urd I silent sat,
:I saw and meditated, I listened to men&#x27;s words.
===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Urðarbrunnr is attested in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (chapters 15, 16, and the beginning of chapter 17), and twice in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;====

In chapter 15 of &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, a book of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the throned figure of Just-As-High tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about Yggdrasil and its roots. Just-As-High describes three roots that support Yggdrasil that stretch a great distance. The third root is located &quot;among the Æsir&quot;, &quot;extends to heaven&quot; and, beneath it, is the &quot;very holy&quot; Urðarbrunnr. Just-As-High details that, every day, the gods ride over the bridge Bifröst to hold court at the well.

High provides more information regarding the wellspring in chapter 16. High says that there are many beautiful places in heaven, and &quot;everywhere there is divine protection around it.&quot; There, a beautiful hall stands under the ash (Yggdrasil) near the wellspring (Urðarbrunnr), and from this hall come &quot;three maidens&quot; whose names are Urðr, Verðandi, and Skuld. The maidens shape the lives of men, and &quot;we call them norns&quot;. High goes on to describe that there are other norns, and their nature.

Further into chapter 16, High states that norns that dwell by Urðarbrunnr take water from the wellspring and mud that lies around it, and pour it over the Yggdrasil so that its branches do not decay or rot. The water is described as so holy that anything that enters the wellspring will become &quot;as white as the membrane called the skin that lies round the inside of the eggshell.&quot; High then quotes stanza 19 of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, and states that two swans feed from the wellspring, from which all other swans descend. Chapter 17 starts off with Gangleri asking what other &quot;chief centres&quot; exist outside of Urðarbrunnr.

====&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;====
Two sections of the book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; reference Urðarbrunnr. The first reference is in section 49, where a fragment of a work by the 10th century skald Kormákr Ögmundarson is recited in explaining how &quot;Odin&#x27;s fire&quot; is a kenning for a sword. The passage reads &quot;A sword is Odin&#x27;s fire, as Kormak said: Battle raged when the feeder of Grid&#x27;s steed [wolf], he who waged war, advanced with ringing Gaut [Odin&#x27;s] fire.&quot; and that Urðr &quot;rose from the wellspring.&quot;

Urðarbrunnr is mentioned a second time in section 52 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, this time associated with Christ. The section states that early skalds once referred to Christ in relation to Urðarbrunnr and Rome, and quotes the late 10th century skald Eilífr Goðrúnarson, who states that &quot;thus has the powerful king of Rome increased his realm with lands of heath-land divinities [giants; i.e. lands]&quot; and that Christ is said to have his throne south of Urðarbrunnr.

==Theories==

===Temple at Uppsala===
Parallels have been pointed out between the description of Urðarbrunnr at the base of the world tree Yggdrasil and Christian medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of a wellspring at the base of a sacred tree at the Temple at Uppsala, Sweden, found in his 11th century work &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;.

===Eilífr Goðrúnarson===
Eilífr Goðrúnarson&#x27;s Christianity-influenced account of Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;) associates the wellspring with the south and Rome. Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though there may be no other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan &quot;skald&quot;, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the wellspring, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.

<text>Carel Pietersz. Fabritius (; bapt. 27 February 1622 – 12 October 1654) was a Dutch painter. He was a pupil of Rembrandt and worked in his studio in Amsterdam. Fabritius, who was a member of the Delft School, developed his own artistic style and experimented with perspective and lighting. Among his works are &quot;A View of Delft&quot; (1652; National Gallery, London), &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; (1654), and &quot;The Sentry&quot; (1654).

==Biography==
Carel Pietersz. Fabritius was born in February 1622 in Middenbeemster, a village in the ten-year-old Beemster polder in the Dutch Republic, and was baptized on 27 February of that year. He was the son of Pieter Carelsz., a painter and schoolteacher, and he had two younger brothers, Barent and Johannes, who also became painters.

Initially he worked as a carpenter (Latin: &quot;fabritius&quot;). In 1641 he married Aeltge Velthuys, who died in childbirth in 1643. In the early 1640s he studied at Rembrandt&#x27;s studio in Amsterdam, along with his brother Barent. In 1650 he married the widow Agatha van Pruyssen. In the early 1650s he moved to Delft, and joined the Delft painters&#x27; guild in 1652.

Fabritius died young, caught in the explosion of the Delft gunpowder magazine on 12 October 1654, which destroyed a quarter of the city, along with his studio and many of his paintings. Only about a dozen paintings have survived. According to Houbraken, his student Mattias Spoors and the church deacon Simon Decker died with him, since they were working on a painting together at the time.

In a poem written by Arnold Bon to his memory, he is called Karel Faber.

== Painting ==
Of all Rembrandt&#x27;s pupils, Fabritius was the only one to develop his own artistic style. A typical Rembrandt portrait would have a plain dark background with the subject defined by spotlighting. In contrast, Fabritius&#x27; portraits feature delicately lit subjects against light-coloured, textured backgrounds. Moving away from the Renaissance focus on iconography, Fabritius became interested in the technical aspects of painting. He used cool colour harmonies to create shape in a luminous style of painting.

Fabritius was also interested in complex spatial effects, as can be seen in the exaggerated perspective of &quot;A View of Delft, with a Musical Instrument Seller&#x27;s Stall&quot; (1652). He also showed excellent control of a heavily loaded brush, as in &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; (1654). All these qualities appear in the work of Vermeer and de Hooch, both also based in Delft; it is likely that Fabritius was a strong influence on them.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gastropnir was in the realm of Menglöð.

Gastropnir is featured in Fjölsvinnsmál, as Svipdag conducts his mission to reach Menglöð. Svipdag walking up to the gate in the wall where he addresses a watchman called Fjölsviður. In the exchange between the two, Svipdagr asks what the wall is called. Fjolsvith replies that it is called Gastropnir and adds that he built it out of Leirbrimir&#x27;s limbs.

<text>The Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs) is a professional public policy school at Princeton University. The school provides an array of comprehensive coursework in the fields of international development, foreign policy, science and technology, and economics and finance through its undergraduate (AB) degrees, graduate Master of Public Affairs (MPA), Master of Public Policy (MPP), and PhD degrees. 

The school is consistently ranked as one of the best institutions for the study of international relations and public affairs in the country and world. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; ranks the Princeton School as second in the world for international relations at the undergraduate level (behind Harvard University), fourth at the masters level (behind the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, and the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University), and second at the doctoral level (behind Harvard University).

==History==
In 1930, Princeton University established the School of Public and International Affairs, which was originally meant to serve as an interdisciplinary program for undergraduate students in Princeton&#x27;s liberal arts college. On February 23, 1930, the front page of &quot;The Sunday New York Times&quot; announced:Princeton Founds Statesmen&#x27;s School – Institution Will Train Youths for Public Life and Will Stress Internationalism – Hoover Hails The Project. De W.C. Poole Quits Diplomatic Service to Be Its Liaison Officer With World Affairs. The establishment of a school of public and international affairs at Princeton University was announced today by President John Grier Hibben in his annual message to the National Alumni Association. The school&#x27;s primary purpose is to train young men for public life and to equip them—and others—with a broad sense of &quot;the fundamentals of citizenship.&quot;

President Hibben made the announcement in Nassau Hall, &quot;where in 1783 George Washington received the thanks of the Continental Congress for his conduct of the Revolutionary War.&quot; DeWitt Clinton Poole, a noted foreign service officer and &quot;until recently counselor of the United States Embassy in Berlin&quot; had been the prime advocate for the creation of the school. The next year, in August 1931, the Fédération Interalliée Des Anciens Combattants (FIDAC), the most influential international veterans association of the interwar period (representing nine million Allied veterans), chose Princeton to receive its educational medal for promoting world peace and understanding.

In 1948, the school added a graduate professional program and was renamed to honor Woodrow Wilson, who was the 13th president of the university, governor of New Jersey and the 28th president of the United States. In two of Wilson&#x27;s speeches at the university – first during its 150th anniversary celebration in 1896 and again at his inauguration as the university&#x27;s president in 1902 – he mentioned &quot;Princeton in the nation&#x27;s service.&quot; This phrase serves as the basis for the university&#x27;s unofficial motto, which was amended in 2016 to &quot;Princeton in the nation&#x27;s service and in the service of humanity.&quot;

In 2015, student protesters forced Princeton to reconsider having the school named after Wilson due to his racist views, of which they disapproved. The protesting efforts were largely due to the organizational efforts of the Black Justice League. Despite the group no longer existing, faculty and new student activists pled for the university to apologize to the original members to recognize the BJL&#x27;s perseverance. The Wilson Legacy Review Committee ultimately decided to keep his name attached to the school, observing that, as other notable men and women, Wilson had a &quot;complex legacy of both positive and negative repercussions&quot;.

But on June 26, 2020, following the eruption of George Floyd protests and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Princeton University board of trustees decided to rename the Woodrow Wilson School the &quot;Princeton School of Public and International Affairs,&quot; citing Wilson&#x27;s &quot;racist thinking and policies [that] make him an inappropriate namesake for a school or college whose scholars, students, and alumni must stand firmly against racism in all its forms.&quot; It was also announced that Wilson College, the first of Princeton&#x27;s six undergraduate residential colleges, would be renamed First College. Woodrow Wilson opposed admitting African-American students to Princeton, and introduced racial segregation into the United States federal civil service as president.

From 2012 to 2021, Cecilia Rouse served as dean of the Princeton School until her confirmation as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under the Biden Administration.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate program===
The school stresses a multidisciplinary approach to policy studies with undergraduate students at the Princeton School taking courses in at least four disciplines including economics, history, politics, psychology, sociology, and science policy. In their junior year, students must enroll in and complete a Policy Task Force, which addresses a specific public policy issue. Students conduct research, propose recommendations, and issue final reports. Students are also allowed to work towards certificates in an array of fields, including Global Health and Health Policy, Urban Studies, and the History and the Practice of Diplomacy.

===Master&#x27;s degrees===
The two-year MPA program prepares students for international and domestic policy careers. All second-year MPA students must complete a Policy Workshop, which emphasizes policy implementation. Through the graduate policy workshops, students conduct field-based research and present their research and recommendations to clients. Students also develop analytical and quantitative skills through coursework emphasizing the political, economic, and behavioral aspects of complex policy issues. MPA candidates may select one of four fields of concentration: 
* International Relations
* International Development
* Domestic Policy
* Economics and Public Policy

The one-year MPP program is designed for mid-career professionals, PhD research scientists, lawyers, and physicians who are involved in international and domestic public policy.

===Doctoral degrees===
The PhD in public affairs focuses on two research areas: security studies; and science, technology and environmental policy. The school works with other departments at the university to offer a joint degree program that combines work in a social science with a multidisciplinary perspective on economics problems. Graduate students also have the opportunity to pursue certificates in demography; health and health policy; science, technology and environmental policy; and urban policy/urban policy and planning. In addition to the MPA, MPP and PhD degrees, the school offers a four-year MPA/J.D. program, and has formal joint degree arrangements with law schools at Columbia University, New York University and Stanford University. Students often refer to the Princeton School by its colloquial abbreviation, &quot;SPIA&quot;. The school also offers a joint degree program (JDP) in social policy, allowing students to take courses in the departments of politics, psychology, sociology, and economics.

==Robertson Hall==
In 1961, Charles &#x27;26 and Marie Robertson provided a gift to expand the graduate school. Their gift funded the construction of the School&#x27;s current home, designed by Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed New York&#x27;s original World Trade Center. To the north of the building is James FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Freedom&quot; (1966). &quot;Before construction could begin [on Robertson], the building that had housed the School since 1952, then called Woodrow Wilson School Annex, had to be relocated.&quot; In May after two months of preparation, &quot;the 3-story, L-shaped, 7,000,000-pound building was moved 296 feet in 12 hours by 38 men and 9 hydraulic jacks...&quot; The Annex, renamed Corwin Hall, subsequently housed the department of political science and Center of International Studies. The new structure, completed in the fall of 1965, was originally named Woodrow Wilson Hall, but was &quot;renamed Robertson Hall in 1988 to honor its benefactors&quot; and as President Goheen characterized upon its completion, was &quot;a fit embodiment and expression of the high aspiration we hold for the [SPIA].&quot;

In approximately 2005, the SPIA established the Bernstein Gallery in Robertson Hall. The gallery &quot;presents art exhibitions to stimulate thinking about contemporary policy issues and to enable understanding the world beyond the power of words. Each year, six curated shows are presented ... and ... are complemented by ... panel discussions with experts from Princeton University, the School and outside organizations.&quot; The exhibits are &quot;...Integrated with the School&#x27;s multidisciplinary approach ... to enhance the impact of the course curriculum and to deepen people&#x27;s commitment to the ideals of public service.&quot; A retrospective of political art was held in 2017. The lower level lobby and gallery are named for Marver Bernstein, SPIA&#x27;s first dean and his wife, Sheva. Bernstein participated in Robertson&#x27;s architectural selection process and his wife, an interior designer, participated in its mid-century modern interior.

In 2012, the Princeton University Art Museum announced the installation of the &quot;Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads&quot; exhibit by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei on Scudder Plaza.

In 2019–2020 Robertson Hall underwent a major renovation of its &quot;offices, work areas, and gathering spaces&quot; to provide more open, collaborative spaces. The exterior, auditorium, and lower-level classrooms were largely unchanged.

On October 5, 2019, the University dedicated a memorial marker, named Double Sights, on the west side of the Fountain of Freedom. Designed by 2019 MacArthur Fellow and Gish Prize winner Walter Hood, the memorial was meant to catalyze “stimulus to reflection and an invitation to dialogue&quot; about the controversial legacy of Woodrow Wilson. The marker is a 39-foot statue consisting of a white column and a black column, coated in stone-like glass engraved with quotes displaying both the honorable and racist aspects of Wilson&#x27;s legacy. The marker was the product of a recommendation by a 2015 University committee to create a “permanent marker” that “educates the campus community and others about the positive and negative dimensions of Wilson’s legacy.”

Faculty members at the school include Nobel Laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, a university president, and former ambassadors. Nobel Laureates include Angus Deaton, Daniel Kahneman, Paul Krugman, and Arthur Lewis.

==Controversy==
In July 2002, dissenting family members of the Robertson Foundation board, which was established initially by a $35 million gift in 1961, filed suit seeking to more narrowly focus the SPIA curriculum on training for careers in government and public service vs. Princeton&#x27;s broader conception of &quot;public affairs&quot; which &quot;embraces some non-government activities, for example, certain types of work in journalism, in private foundations, and in business, labor and consumer organizations.&quot; A settlement was reached in 2008.

<text>Alvaldi (also Ölvaldi; Old Norse &#x27;all-powerful&#x27;) is a jötunn in Norse mythology, presented as the father of Þjazi.
Saturn&#x27;s moon Alvaldi is named after him.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name &quot;Alvadi&quot; means &#x27;all-powerful&#x27;. The name &quot;Ölvadi&quot;, found in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, appears to be a variant form referring to the same character.

== Attestations ==
In &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot; (Lay of Hárbarðr), Alvadi is mentioned as the father of the jötunn Þjazi.

In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (Language of Poetry)&quot;,&quot; he is named Ölvadi and portrayed as the father of Þjazi, Gangr and Iði. Described as &quot;very rich in gold&quot;, Ölvadi divides the inheritance among his sons in such a way that each may take the same mouthful of gold. According to philologist Rudolf Simek, the story is probably the remnant of an old myth.

<text>The Temple at Uppsala was long held to be a religious center in the Norse religion once located at what is now Gamla Uppsala (Swedish &quot;Old Uppsala&quot;), Sweden attested in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s 11th-century work &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; and in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Uppsala has for long been exposed to fanciful theories about the implications of these descriptions of the temple and of the findings of archaeological excavations in the area, now including recent findings of extensive wooden structures and log lines from the 5th century which allegedly played a supporting role to activities at the site, including ritual sacrifice. According to sources from the later Middle Ages the temple was destroyed by King Inge the Elder in the 1080s, but there are no contemporary sources to support that.

==Adam of Bremen==
===Description===

In &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot;, Adam of Bremen provides a description of the temple. Adam records that a &quot;very famous temple called Ubsola&quot; exists in a town close to Sigtuna. Adam details that the temple is &quot;made out of gold&quot; and that the people there worship statues of three specific gods that sit on a triple throne. Thor, whom Adam refers to as &quot;the mightiest,&quot; sits in the central throne, while Wodan (Odin) and Fricco (Freyr) are seated on the thrones to the sides of him. Adam provides information about the characteristics of the three gods, including that Fricco is depicted with an immense erect penis, Wodan in armor (&quot;as our people depict Mars,&quot; Adam notes) and that Thor has a mace, a detail which Adam compares to that of the Roman god Jupiter. Adam adds that, in addition, &quot;they also worship gods who were once men, whom they reckon to be immortal because of their heroic acts [...].&quot;. Adam says that the three gods have a priest appointed to them each who offer up sacrifices to the deities from the people. If famine or plague occurs, a sacrifice is made to Thor; if there is war, a sacrifice is made to Wodan; if a marriage is to be held, a sacrifice is made to Fricco. Adam continues that &quot;every nine years there is a communal festival of every province in Sweden held in Ubsola; and those already converted to Christianity have to buy themselves off from the ceremonies.&quot;

Adam details sacrificial practices held at the temple; Adam describes that nine males of &quot;every living creature&quot; are offered up for sacrifice, and tradition dictates that their blood placates the gods. The corpses of the nine males are hung within the grove beside the temple. Adam says that the grove is considered extremely sacred to the heathens, so much so that each singular tree &quot;is considered to be divine,&quot; due to the death of those sacrificed or their rotting corpses hanging there, and that dogs and horses hang within the grove among the corpses of men. Adam reveals that &quot;one Christian&quot; informed him that he had seen seventy-two cadavers of differing species hanging within the grove. Adam expresses disgust at the songs they sing during these sacrificial rites, quipping that the songs are &quot;so many and disgusting that it is best to pass over them in silence.&quot;

Adam describes that near the temple stands a massive tree with far-spreading branches, which is evergreen both in summer and winter. At the tree is also a spring where sacrifices are also held. According to Adam, a custom exists where a man, alive, is thrown into the spring, and if he fails to return to the surface, &quot;the wish of the people will be fulfilled.&quot;

Adam writes that a golden chain surrounds the temple that hangs from the gables of the building. The chain is very visible to those approaching the temple from a distance due to the landscape where the temple was built; it is surrounded by hills, &quot;like an amphitheatre.&quot; The feasts and sacrifices continue for a total of nine days, and during the course of each day a man is sacrificed along with two animals. Therefore, in a total of nine days twenty-seven sacrifices occur, and, Adam notes, these sacrifices occur &quot;about the time of the spring equinox.&quot;

===Views===

Rudolf Simek says that, regarding Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of the temple, &quot;Adam&#x27;s sources for this information are of extremely varying reliability, but the existence of a temple at Uppsala is undisputed.&quot; The question is if this temple was pagan or Christian. Simek says that details of Adam&#x27;s accounts have been cited as potentially influenced by the description of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in the Old Testament. Simek notes, at the same time, similar chains as described by Adam appear on some European churches dating from the 8th to 9th centuries, although the description of the temple chain having been made of gold may be an exaggeration. Simek says that the numerous attempts at reconstructing the temple based on the postholes may overestimate the size of the temple, and notes that &quot;more recent&quot; research indicates that the site of the 11th-century temple probably adjoined the choir of the church standing there today, while the postholes discovered by Lindqvist may instead point to an earlier, burnt-down temple at the same site.

Building on previous critical discussions about Adam of Bremen&#x27;s description of the temple by the archaeologists Harald Wideen and Olaf Olsen, Henrik Janson in his fundamental study on the European background of Adam&#x27;s work, came to the conclusion that Adam used the case of Uppsala to display some of the more prominent lines of conflict at the outbreak of the investiture controversy. These lines of conflict reached deep into Scandinavia. Papacy and Empire were competing about the control of the Northern parts of Europe, and the Empire, through the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, claimed subjugation of the Scandinavian kingdoms under the Imperial church. These rights were however challenged by some political actors in the North, and a particularly strong resistance came from the kingdom of the Swedes where another Church, called &quot;Gallicana ecclesia&quot; by Pope Gregory VII, had the support of the Papacy. This Church can be connected to the Mälar-region and indeed Uppsala. It is not totally clear where the representatives of this &quot;Gallican Church&quot; came from, but one part of these influences can certainly be recognized in later Swedish saint lives remembering bishops from England, connected to the Cluniac reform movement, active in the Mälar-region in the 11th century - obviously in opposition to the Imperial Church of Hamburg-Bremen for which Adam of Bremen was trying to build up divine historical legitimacy. An important part of the picture is the fact that in these years it became feasible to accuse opponents of paganism even if it was obvious that they were perfectly good Christians. The key concepts here were faith, &quot;fides&quot;, meaning faithfulness, and obedience, &quot;obedientia&quot;, as was explicitly stated by Gregory VII in precisely these years: &quot;anyone falls into the sin of heathenism [&quot;paganitas&quot;] who, while claiming that he is a Christian, disdains to obey the apostolic see&quot;. Previously these measures had mainly been directed against socially inferior groups – e.g. the Saxons against the Slavs and for that matter Scandinavians – but now this theological weapon was fired against the highest representatives of the Imperial Church. The first one to be hit was Archbishop Liemar of Hamburg Bremen, in whose service and defense Adam of Bremen was writing his work. Pointing to the lack of sources that could confirm Adam&#x27;s description about a pagan temple in Uppsala, and bringing forth other sources, such as the over one thousand Christian rune stones in the area, showing that Christianity was well established there when Adam was writing, Janson concluded that the Uppsala Temple was nothing but a Christian church resisting The Sacred Roman Empire, with support from the Papacy and enemies of Henry IV that gathered around Gregory VII at the very outbreak of the Investiture contest.

Orchard (1997) states that &quot;it is unclear to what extent Adam&#x27;s description has a basis in historical fact rather than lurid fiction&quot; yet that Adam&#x27;s account contains &quot;a good deal of useful information (as well as considerable speculation).&quot; Orchard points out that Adam&#x27;s description of the temple has often been questioned &quot;on several levels&quot; and that Thietmar of Merseburg produced a considerably less detailed but similar account of sacrifices held in Lejre, Denmark earlier in the 11th century. Thietmar&#x27;s account, however, concerns the religious situation in Denmark in the early 10th century, almost a century before he was writing, and he actually states that these pagan rites were extinguished in the 930&#x27;s. Thus, there are good reasons to doubt that he could &quot;give a fair representation of pre-Christian rituals&quot; in Scandinavia.

==&quot;Heimskringla&quot;==

In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; compiled in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, Snorri presents a euhemerized origin of the Norse gods and rulers descending from them. In chapter 5, Snorri asserts that the æsir settled in what is now Sweden and built various temples. Snorri writes that
&quot;Odin took up his residence at the
Maelare lake, at the place now called Old Sigtun. There he erected a large farm shrine (hof), where there were offerings (blót) according to the customs of the Asaland people. He appropriated to himself the whole of that district, and called it Sigtun. To the shrine spirits (hofgoðunum) he gave also dwelling places. Njörðr dwelt in Nóatún, Frey in Upsal, Heimdal in the Himinbergs, Thor in Thrudvang, Balder in Breidablik; to all of them he gave good estates.&quot;

In chapter 10, after Njörðr has died, his son Freyr comes to power and &quot;he was called the king of Swedes and received tribute from them.&quot; Freyr&#x27;s subjects loved him greatly, and he was &quot;blessed by good seasons like his father.&quot; According to the saga, Freyr &quot;erected a great shrine at Uppsala and made his chief residence there, directing it to all tribute due to him, both lands and chattels. This was the origin of the Uppsala crown goods, which have been kept up ever since.&quot;

==Archaeological record==
In 1926, Sune Lindqvist conducted archaeological investigations in Gamla Uppsala and discovered postholes beneath the church in Gamla Uppsala. These postholes may be lined up with the result of concentric rectangles, and subsequently various attempts at reconstructions of the temple have been attempted based on this discovery.

Price and Alkarp (2005) have been among those who dispute the 1926 interpretation: Though still maintained today in school textbooks and elsewhere, this conclusion is clearly erroneous as the postholes can be shown stratigraphically to belong to several different phases of construction. 
Using ground penetrating radar and other geophysical methods, Price and Alkarp found the remains of what they interpreted as a wooden construction located directly under the northern transept of the medieval cathedral, and two other buildings, one of them a Bronze Age building, and the other possibly a Viking Age feasting hall.
Orchard (1997) says that archaeological digs in the area &quot;have failed to reveal anything on the scale proposed for the temple&quot; yet that three burial mounds at the location reveal the importance of the site.

In 2013, the remains of two lines of large wooden poles were discovered. One line is approximately a kilometer long consisting of 144 poles and the other half a kilometer with each pole being separated by 5–6 meters. The line probably continues but was not excavated due to lack of funds. The shorter line is perpendicular to the first, located a kilometer to the south and broken into a corner which indicates that if the lines mark an enclosure, as the one at Jelling Denmark, the enclosed area would be gigantic and by far the biggest structure north of the Alps at this time. The poles were very wide and have been estimated to be at least 7 meters in length. The construction however belong to the mid 5th century. It was consequently gone for many centuries when Adam of Bremen described the Uppsala temple. There is nothing to suggest a connection between these posts and Adam&#x27;s temple, but the interpretations they have provoked are illustrative evidence to how everything around Uppsala still tend to be interpreted in the suggestive shadow of his description.

<text>[[File:Cloudseedingimagecorrected.jpg|alt=Cloud Seeding|thumb|upright=1.2|This image explaining cloud seeding shows a substance – either silver iodide or dry ice – being dumped onto the cloud, which then becomes a rain shower. The process shown in the upper-right is what is happening in the cloud and the process of condensation upon the introduced material.]

[[Cloud seeding|Cloud seeding]] is a type of [[weather modification]] that aims to change the amount or type of [[precipitation]], mitigate hail or disperse fog. The usual objective is to increase rain or snow, either for its own sake or to prevent precipitation from occurring in days afterward.

[[Cloud]] seeding is undertaken by dispersing substances into the air that serve as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|cloud condensation]] or [[ice nucleus|ice nuclei]]. Common agents include [[silver iodide]], [[potassium iodide]], and dry ice, with [[hygroscopic]] materials like table salt gaining popularity due to their ability to attract moisture. Techniques vary from static seeding, which encourages ice particle formation in [[supercooled]] clouds to increase precipitation, to dynamic seeding, designed to enhance convective cloud development through the release of [[latent heat]].

Methods of dispersion include aircraft and ground-based generators, with newer approaches involving [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s delivering [[electric charge]]s to stimulate rainfall, or infrared [[laser]] pulses aimed at inducing particle formation. Despite decades of research and application, cloud seeding&#x27;s effectiveness remains a subject of debate among scientists, with studies offering mixed results on its impact on precipitation enhancement.

Environmental and health impacts are considered minimal due to the low concentrations of substances used, but concerns persist over the potential accumulation of seeding agents in sensitive ecosystems. The practice has a long history, with initial experiments dating back to the 1940s, and has been used for various purposes, including agricultural benefits, [[water supply]] augmentation, and event planning. Legal frameworks primarily focus on prohibiting the military or hostile use of weather modification techniques, leaving the ownership and regulation of cloud-seeding activities to national discretion. Despite skepticism and debate over its efficacy and environmental impact, cloud seeding continues to be explored and applied in regions worldwide as a tool for weather modification.

==Methods==
===Salts===

The most common chemicals used for cloud seeding include [[silver iodide]], [[potassium iodide]] and [[dry ice]] (solid carbon dioxide). [[Liquid propane]], which expands into a gas, has also been used. It can produce ice crystals at higher temperatures than silver iodide. After promising research, the use of [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]] materials, such as [[table salt]], is becoming more popular.

When cloud seeding, increased snowfall takes place when temperatures within the clouds are between −20 and −7 °C. [[Freezing]] [[nucleation]] is induced by the introduction of substances similar to silver iodide, which has a [[crystalline]] structure like ice.

In mid-altitude clouds, the usual seeding strategy has been based on the fact that the equilibrium [[vapor pressure]] is lower over ice than over water. The formation of ice particles in supercooled clouds allows those particles to grow at the expense of liquid droplets. If sufficient growth takes place, the particles become heavy enough to fall as precipitation from clouds that otherwise would produce no precipitation. This process is known as &quot;static&quot; seeding.

Seeding of warm-season or tropical [[cumulonimbus]] (convective) clouds seeks to exploit the [[latent heat]] released by freezing. This strategy of &quot;dynamic&quot; seeding assumes that the additional latent heat adds buoyancy, strengthens updrafts, ensures more low-level convergence, and ultimately causes rapid growth of properly selected clouds.

Cloud seeding chemicals may be dispersed by aircraft or by dispersion devices on the ground (generators or canisters fired from [[anti-aircraft gun]]s or [[rocket]]s). For release by aircraft, silver iodide [[flare]]s are ignited and dispersed as an aircraft flies through the inflow of a cloud. When released by devices on the ground, the fine particles are carried downwind and upward by [[air current]]s after release.

===Electric charges===
Since 2021, the [[United Arab Emirates]] have been using drones equipped with a payload of electric-charge emission instruments and customized sensors that fly at low altitudes and deliver an electric charge to air molecules. This method produced a significant rainstorm in July 2021. For instance, in [[Al Ain]] it rained 6.9 millimeters on 20–21 July.

===Infrared laser pulses===

An electronic mechanism was tested in 2010, when [[infrared]] [[laser]] pulses were directed to the air above [[Berlin]] by researchers from the [[University of Geneva]]. The experimenters posited that the pulses would encourage atmospheric [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] to form particles that would then act as seeds.

==Effectiveness==
Despite decades of research and application, cloud seeding&#x27;s effectiveness remains a subject of debate among scientists, with studies offering mixed results on its impact on precipitation enhancement, according to a report issued by the US [[Government Accountability Office]] in December 2024. Whether cloud seeding is effective in producing a statistically significant increase in precipitation has been a matter of academic debate, with contrasting results depending on the study in question and contrasting opinion among experts.

A study conducted by the United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] failed to find statistically significant support for cloud seeding&#x27;s effectiveness. Based on its findings, Stanford University ecologist Jerry Bradley said: &quot;I think you can squeeze out a little more snow or rain in some places under some conditions, but that&#x27;s quite different from a program claiming to reliably increase precipitation.&quot; Data similar to that of the NAS study was acquired in a separate study conducted by the Wyoming Weather Modification Pilot Project, but whereas the NAS study concluded that &quot;it is difficult to show clearly that cloud seeding has a very large effect&quot;, the WWMPP study concluded that &quot;seeding could augment the snowpack by a maximum of 3% over an entire season.&quot;

In 2003, the [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] (NRC) released a report stating, &quot;science is unable to say with assurance which, if any, seeding techniques produce positive effects. In the 55 years following the first cloud-seeding demonstrations, substantial progress has been made in understanding the natural processes that account for our daily weather. Yet scientifically acceptable proof for significant seeding effects has not been achieved&quot;.

A 2010 [[Tel Aviv University]] study claimed that the common practice of cloud seeding to improve rainfall, with materials such as [[silver iodide]] and frozen carbon dioxide, seems to have little if any impact on the amount of precipitation. A 2011 study suggested that airplanes may produce ice particles by freezing cloud droplets that cool as they flow around the tips of propellers, over wings or over jet aircraft, and thereby unintentionally seed clouds. This could have potentially serious consequences for particular [[hail stone]] formation.

In 2016, Jeff Tilley, director of weather modification at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, claimed that new technology and research has produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable and affordable water supply practice for many regions. Moreover, in 1998 the American Meteorological Society held that &quot;precipitation from supercooled orographic clouds (clouds that develop over mountains) has been seasonally increased by about 10%.&quot;

Despite the mixed scientific results, cloud seeding was attempted during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing to coax rain showers out of clouds before they reached the city in order to prevent rain during the [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies. Whether this attempt was successful is a matter of dispute, with Roelof Bruintjes, who leads the National Center for Atmospheric Research&#x27;s weather-modification group, remarking, &quot;we cannot make clouds or chase clouds away&quot;.

==Impact on environment and health==
With an [[NFPA 704]] health hazard rating of 2, [[silver iodide]] can cause temporary incapacitation or possible residual injury to humans and other mammals with intense or chronic exposure. But several detailed ecological studies have shown negligible environmental and health impacts. The toxicity of silver and silver compounds (from silver iodide) was shown to be of low order in some studies. These findings likely result from the minute amounts of silver generated by cloud seeding, which are about one percent of industry emissions into the atmosphere in many parts of the world, or individual exposure from tooth fillings.

Accumulations in the soil, vegetation, and [[surface runoff]] have not been large enough to measure above natural background. A 1995 environmental assessment in the Sierra Nevada of California and a 2004 independent panel of experts in Australia confirmed these earlier findings.

&quot;In 1978, an estimated 3,000 [[tonne]]s of silver were released into the US environment. This led the US Health Services and EPA to conduct studies regarding the potential for environmental and human health hazards related to silver. These agencies and other state agencies applied the Clean Water Act of 1977 and 1987 to establish regulations on this type of pollution.&quot;

Cloud seeding over [[Kosciuszko National Park]]a biosphere reserveis problematic in that several rapid changes of environmental legislation were made to enable the trial. Environmentalists are concerned about the uptake of elemental silver in a highly sensitive environment affecting the [[pygmy possum]], among other species, as well as recent high-level algal blooms in once pristine glacial lakes. Research 50 years ago and analysis by the former Snowy Mountains Authority led to the cessation of the cloud seeding program in the 1950s with non-definitive results. Formerly, cloud seeding was rejected in Australia on environmental grounds because of concerns about the pygmy possum. The claims of negative environmental impact are disputed by peer-reviewed research, as summarized by the International Weather Modification Association.

==History==




In 1891, [[Louis Gathmann]] suggested shooting [[liquid carbon dioxide]] into rain clouds to cause them to rain. During the 1930s, the [[Bergeron–Findeisen process]] theorized that supercooled water droplets present, while ice crystals are released into rain clouds, would cause rain. While researching [[aircraft icing]], [[General Electric]] (GE)&#x27;s [[Vincent Schaefer]] and [[Irving Langmuir]] confirmed the theory. Schaefer discovered the principle of cloud seeding in July 1946 through a series of serendipitous events. Following ideas he and Langmuir generated while climbing Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, Schaefer, Langmuir&#x27;s research associate, created a way of experimenting with supercooled clouds using a deep freeze unit of potential agents to stimulate ice crystal growth, i.e., table salt, talcum powder, soils, dust, and various chemical agents with minor effect. Then, on July 14, 1946, he wanted to try a few experiments at GE&#x27;s [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] Research Lab.

He was dismayed to find that the deep freezer was not cold enough to produce a &quot;cloud&quot; using breath air. He decided to move the process along by adding a chunk of [[dry ice]] just to lower the temperature of his experimental chamber. To his astonishment, as soon as he breathed into the deep freezer, he noted a bluish haze, followed by an eye-popping display of millions of microscopic ice crystals, reflecting the strong light rays from the lamp illuminating a cross-section of the chamber. He instantly realized that he had discovered a way to change super-cooled water into ice crystals. The experiment was easily replicated, and he explored the temperature gradient to establish the limit for liquid water.

Within the month, Schaefer&#x27;s colleague, the atmospheric scientist [[Bernard Vonnegut]], was credited with discovering another method for &quot;seeding&quot; super-cooled cloud water. Vonnegut accomplished his discovery at the desk, looking up information in a basic chemistry text and then tinkering with silver and iodide chemicals to produce silver iodide. Together with Professor Henry Chessin, of [[University at Albany, SUNY|SUNY Albany]], a crystallographer, he co-authored a publication in &quot;Science&quot; and received a patent in 1975. Both methods were adopted for use in cloud seeding during 1946 while working for GE in the state of New York.

Schaefer&#x27;s method altered a cloud&#x27;s heat budget; Vonnegut&#x27;s altered formative crystal structure, an ingenious property related to a good match in [[lattice constant]] between the two types of [[crystal]]. (The [[crystallography]] of ice later played a role in Vonnegut&#x27;s brother [[Kurt Vonnegut]]&#x27;s novel &quot;[[Cat&#x27;s Cradle]]&quot;). The first attempt to modify natural clouds in the field through &quot;cloud seeding&quot; began during a flight that began in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] on 13 November 1946. Schaefer was able to cause snow to fall near [[Mount Greylock]] in western Massachusetts after he dumped of dry ice into the target cloud from a plane after a easterly chase from the [[Schenectady County Airport]].

Dry ice and silver iodide agents are effective in changing super-cooled clouds&#x27; physical chemistry, and thus useful in augmenting winter snowfall over mountains and, under certain conditions, in lightning and hail suppression. While not a new technique, [[hygroscopic]] seeding for enhancement of rainfall in warm clouds is enjoying a revival, based on positive indications from research in South Africa, Mexico, and elsewhere. The hygroscopic material most commonly used is table salt. It is postulated that hygroscopic seeding causes the droplet size spectrum in clouds to become more maritime (bigger drops) and less continental, stimulating rainfall through coalescence. From 1967 to 1972, the U.S. military&#x27;s [[Operation Popeye]] cloud-seeded silver iodide to extend the monsoon season over [[North Vietnam]], specifically the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. The operation extended the monsoon period an average of 30 to 45 days in the targeted areas. The 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron carried out the operation to &quot;make mud, not war&quot;.

One private organization that offered, during the 1970s, to conduct weather modification (cloud seeding from the ground using silver iodide flares) was Irving P. Krick and Associates of [[Palm Springs, California]]. They were contracted by [[Oklahoma State University]] in 1972 to conduct a seeding project to increase warm cloud rainfall in the [[Carl Blackwell Lake|Lake Carl Blackwell]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. That lake was, at that time (1972–73), the primary water supply for [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]], [[Oklahoma]], and was dangerously low. The project did not operate for a long enough time to show statistically any change from natural variations.

An attempt by the U.S. military to modify hurricanes in the [[Atlantic basin]] using cloud seeding in the 1960s was called [[Project STORMFURY]]. Scientists tested four hurricanes across eight days and observed decreased wind speeds of 10% to 30% on four of these days. They originally attributed the lack of results to faulty execution, but the results came into question because of the lack of supercooled water in the hurricane and the inability to determine if the effects were due to human intervention or the natural processes of hurricanes.

Two federal agencies have supported various weather modification research projects, which began in the early 1960s: The [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] (Reclamation; Department of the Interior) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA; Department of Commerce). Reclamation sponsored several cloud-seeding research projects under the umbrella of Project Skywater from 1964 to 1988, and NOAA conducted the Atmospheric Modification Program from 1979 to 1993. The sponsored projects were carried out in several states and two countries (Thailand and Morocco), studying both winter and summer cloud seeding. From 1962 to 1988 Reclamation developed cloud seeding applied research to augment water supplies in the western U.S. The research focused on winter orographic seeding to enhance snowfall in the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, and precipitation in coast ranges of southern California. In California Reclamation partnered with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to sponsor the Serra Cooperative Pilot Project (SCPP), based in [[Auburn, California|Auburn]], to conduct seeding experiments in the central Sierra. The University of Nevada and [[Desert Research Institute]] provided cloud physics, physical chemistry, and other field support. The High Plains Cooperative Pilot Project (HIPLEX) focused on convective cloud seeding to increase rainfall during the growing season in Montana, Kansas, and Texas from 1974 to 1979. 

In 1979, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and other member-states led by the [[Government of Spain]] conducted a Precipitation Enhancement Project (PEP) in Spain, with inconclusive results due probably to location selection issues. 

Reclamation sponsored research at several universities, including Colorado State University, the Universities of Wyoming, Washington, UCLA, Utah, Chicago, NYU, Montana, and Colorado, and research teams at Stanford, Meteorology Research Inc., and Penn State University, and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, North Dakota, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, and Oklahoma. Cooperative efforts with state water resources agencies in California, Colorado, Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Arizona assured that the applied research met state water management needs. HIPLEX also partnered with NASA, Environment Canada, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). From 2002 to 2006, in cooperation with six western states, Reclamation sponsored a small cooperative research program called the Weather Damage Modification Program.

In the U.S., funding for research has declined in the last two decades. But the Bureau of Reclamation sponsored a six-state research program from 2002 to 2006 called the &quot;Weather Damage Modification Program&quot;. A 2003 study by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] urges a national research program to clear up remaining questions about weather modification&#x27;s efficacy and practice.

In [[Australia]], the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) conducted major trials between 1947 and the early-1960s:

* 1947–1952: CSIRO scientists dropped dry ice into the tops of cumulus clouds. The method worked reliably with clouds that were very cold, producing rain that would not have otherwise fallen.
* 1953–1956: CSIRO carried out similar trials in [[South Australia]], [[Queensland]] and other states. Experiments used both ground-based and airborne [[silver iodide]] generators.
* Late 1950s and early 1960s: Cloud seeding in the [[Snowy Mountains]], on the [[Cape York Peninsula]] in Queensland, in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] District of [[New South Wales]], and in the [[Warragamba]] catchment area west of [[Sydney]].

Only the trial conducted in the Snowy Mountains produced statistically significant rainfall increases over the entire experiment.

[[Hydro Tasmania]] (at the time still known as the Hydro Electric Commission) began experimenting with cloud-seeding over lake catchments in central [[Tasmania]] in the early 1960s in order to determine if their electricity-producing dams could be kept at high water levels through cloud seeding. Tasmania proved to be one place where cloud seeding was highly effective. Various trials were undertaken between 1964 and 2005, and again between 2009 and 2016, but none have taken place since then. Hydro Tasmania also undertook soil and water survey samples and found negligible trace elements of the materials used for cloud seeding (such as silver iodine), and determined it did not have a detrimental effect on the environment.

An Austrian study to use silver iodide seeding for hail prevention ran during 1981–2000, and the technique is still actively deployed there.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====

The largest cloud seeding system is in the [[People&#x27;s Republic of China]]. They believe that it increases the amount of rain over several increasingly [[arid]] regions, including its capital city, [[Beijing]], by firing silver iodide [[rocket]]s into the sky where rain is desired. There is even political strife caused by neighboring regions that accuse each other of &quot;stealing rain&quot; using cloud seeding. China used cloud seeding in [[Beijing]] just before the 2008 Olympic Games in order to have a dry Olympic season. In February 2009, China also blasted iodide sticks over Beijing to artificially induce snowfall after four months of drought, and blasted iodide sticks over other areas of northern China to increase snowfall. The snowfall in Beijing lasted for approximately three days and led to the closure of 12 main roads around Beijing. At the end of October 2009 Beijing claimed it had its earliest snowfall since 1987 due to cloud seeding. According to &quot;research paper from Tsinghua University, the Chinese weather authorities used weather modification to ensure the sky was clear and lower air pollution&quot; on July 1, 2021. The Chinese Communist party celebrated its centenary on July 1 with a major celebration. The celebration took place in Tiananmen Square. The paper was published on November 26, 2021 in a peer-review journal called Environment Science (via South China Morning Post) . The research shows that the Chinese government used cloud-seeding techniques to force rainfall the evening before the celebration event. This rainfall lowered the amount of PM2.5 pollution by more than two-thirds. That helped improve the air quality at the time from &quot;moderate&quot; to &quot;good&quot;.

==== India ====
In [[India]], cloud seeding operations were conducted during the years 1983, 1984–87, and 1993–94 by the Tamil Nadu Government due to severe drought. In the years 2003 and 2004 Karnataka government initiated cloud seeding. Cloud seeding operations were also conducted in the same year through US-based Weather Modification Inc. in the state of [[Maharashtra]].

The company [[Srishti Aviation]] is actively involved in air defense with two [[Cessna 340]] aircraft for its cloud seeding operations. On the ground at the radar facility the Meteorologist assigns the pilots the cloud that has a high concentration of supercooled liquid water. The aircraft will find the altitude where the temperatures are about -5 °C. This is the altitude at which the seeding agent is most active.

==== Pakistan ====
Pakistan has undergone its first-ever artificial rain experiment using cloud seeding, in a move carried out with the help of the United Arab Emirates.there was drizzle in &#x27;at least 10 areas&#x27; of Lahore, consistently ranked the most polluted city in the world.

On Friday, November 15, 2024, Pakistan successfully conducted a cloud seeding operation using locally developed technology, resulting in artificial rainfall to tackle the region’s smog crisis. The Meteorological Department confirmed rainfall in [[Jhelum]], [[Gujar Khan]], [[Chakwal]], and [[Talagang]], attributing it to the cloud seeding effort. Cloud seeding was conducted around 2 p.m., with subsequent rainfall observed within hours in Jhelum and Gujar Khan.

==== Indonesia ====
In [[Jakarta]], cloud seeding was used to minimize flood risk in anticipation of heavy floods in 2013, according to the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology.

==== Iran ====
In 1946, the Iranian government tried to fertilize Iran&#x27;s clouds with the help of Americans, but it was unsuccessful. Then in 1947, in Article 19 of the Law on Water and its Nationalization, the then Ministry of Water and Electricity was obliged to provide the water needed by the country in various ways, including cloud fertilization. Accordingly, the Ministry of Energy between 1953 and 1957, in cooperation with a Canadian company and using aircraft and silver iodide compound fertilized the clouds that were over the Karaj and Jajrud dam area.

After the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]] of 1978, in the years 1989 to 1995, cloud fertilization was carried out in a scattered manner using ground generators in the heights of Shirkuh, Yazd. Then, with the announcement of the Minister of Energy in February 1996, the National Center for Cloud Fertility Research and Studies was established in Yazd and officially started working in 1997.

==== Israel ====

Israel conducted experimental cloud seeding for seven years from 2014 to 2021. The practice involved emitting silver iodide from airplanes and ground stations and took place only in the northern parts of the country. Israel stopped the rain enhancement project in 2021 due to the experiment data showing that the practice was largely ineffective and expensive, and because there had been some recent years of unrelated significant rainfall.

==== Kuwait ====
To counter drought and a growing population in a desert region, [[Kuwait]] is embarking on its own cloud seeding program, with the local Environment Public Authority conducting a study to gauge its viability locally.

==== United Arab Emirates ====

=== Southeast Asia ===
In [[Southeast Asia]], open-burning [[haze]] pollutes the regional environment. Cloud seeding has been used to improve the air quality by encouraging rainfall. On 20 June 2013, [[Indonesia]] said it will begin cloud-seeding operations following reports from [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] that smog caused by forest and bush fires in [[Sumatra]] have disrupted daily activities in the neighboring countries. On 25 June 2013, hailstones were reported to have fallen over some parts of Singapore. Despite [[National Environment Agency|NEA]] denials, some believe that the hailstones are the result of cloud seeding in Indonesia. 

==== Malaysia ====

In Malaysia, cloud seeding was first used in 1988 for three purposes: filling up dams, lessening the effects of haze, and fighting forest fires. In 2015, cloud seeding was done daily in [[Malaysia]] since the [[2015 Southeast Asian haze|haze]] began in early-August. Johor Water Regulatory Body is focus to produce rain over dams with critically low water levels. They use [[Cessna 340]] with tubes of ioidise salt their operation base is at Senai Airport WMKJ.

==== Thailand ====
The Thailand [[Royal Rainmaking Project]] (, ) was initiated in November 1955 by [[King Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Thai farmers repeatedly suffered the effects of drought. The king resolved to do something about it and proposed a solution to the dearth of rain: artificial [[rainmaking]], or cloud seeding. The program is run by the Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation. Thailand started a rain-making project in the late-1950s, known today as the [[Royal Rainmaking Project]]. Its first efforts scattered sea salt in the air to catch the humidity and dry ice to condense the humidity to form clouds. The project took about ten years of experiments and refinement. The first field operations began in 1969 above [[Khao Yai National Park]]. Since then the Thai government claims that rainmaking has been successfully applied throughout Thailand and neighboring countries. The king received recognition for the Royal Rainmaking Project from the [[Eureka (organization)|Eureka organization]] in 2001 for an invention that is beneficial to the world. In 2009, Jordan received permission from Thailand to use the technique. On 12 October 2005 the [[European Patent Office]] granted to King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] the patent EP 1 491 088 &quot;Weather modification by royal rainmaking technology&quot;. The budget of the Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation in [[Fiscal year|FY2019]] was 2,224 million [[Thai baht|baht]]. 

==== Vietnam ====

In [[Vietnam]], during the leadup to and initial stages of the [[Battle of Điện Biên Phủ]] in 1954, the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] looked into the possibility of using cloud seeding to impede [[Việt Minh]] flow of supplies through Route Provinciale 41, a dirt road leading into Điện Biên Phủ that would become more difficult to navigate during the [[monsoon|rainy season]]. General [[Henri Navarre]] authorized research into using cloud seeding this way on March 16, just before the outbreak of the battle, and a test commenced the following month. Results were disappointing; while it did not take long for the rain clouds to form and release precipitation, they often drifted away from Route Provinciale 41 in the process, reducing their ability to hinder Việt Minh logistics.

==== Sri Lanka ====

In January 2019, the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] (SLAF) and [[Ministry of Power and Energy|Ministry of Power, Energy and Business Development]] signed an agreement for a cloud seeding project, created in response to lower water levels for [[hydroelectric power]] due to dry weather. In February of that year, a group of officials from the SLAF, [[Ceylon Electricity Board]], and meteorology and irrigation departments were sent to Thailand to study rainmaking projects carried out by the [[Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation]]. On March 22, a [[Harbin Y-12]] flew over the [[Maskeliya Dam|Maskeliya Reservoir]] at 8000 feet, dispersing cloud seeding chemicals. Rain arrived the next day on March 23, though project members had expected it to appear earlier on the 22nd. [[News First]] proclaimed that the pilot project had &quot;proven to be a success&quot;, while [[Mongabay]] described it as a &quot;failed attempt&quot; that had &quot;fallen short&quot; and highlighted various climate experts who recommended that the government conduct more research into the project&#x27;s potential environmental effects before proceeding further.

===North America===
====United States====
In the United States, cloud seeding is used to increase precipitation in areas experiencing drought, to reduce the size of hailstones that form in thunderstorms, and to reduce the amount of fog in and around airports. In the summer of 1948, the usually humid city of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], Louisiana, under Mayor [[Carl B. Close]], seeded a cloud with dry ice at the municipal airport during a drought; quickly of rain fell.

Major [[ski resort]]s occasionally use cloud seeding to induce snowfall. Eleven western states and one Canadian province (Alberta) had ongoing weather modification operational programs in 2012. In 2006, an $8.8 million project began in [[Wyoming]] to examine cloud seeding&#x27;s effects on snowfall over Wyoming&#x27;s [[Medicine Bow Mountains|Medicine Bow]], [[Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming)|Sierra Madre]], and [[Wind River Range|Wind River]] mountain ranges.

In Oregon, Portland General Electric used Hood River seeding to produce snow for hydro power in 1974-1975. The results were substantial, but caused an undue burden on the locals, who experienced overpowering rainfall, causing street collapses and mudslides. PGE discontinued its seeding practices the next year.

In 1978, the U.S. signed the [[Environmental Modification Convention]], which bans the use of weather modification for hostile purposes.

As of 2022, seven agencies in California are conducting cloud seeding operations using silver iodide, including the [[Sacramento Municipal Utility District]], which began employing the technique in 1969 to increase the water supply to its hydroelectric power plants, and reported that it results in &quot;an average of 3 to 10% increase in [[[Sierra Nevada]]] snowpack&quot;.

====Canada====
During the sixties, Irving P. Krick &amp; Associates operated a successful cloud seeding operation in the area around [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. This utilized both aircraft and ground-based generators that pumped silver iodide into the atmosphere in an attempt to reduce the threat of hail damage. Ralph Langeman, [[Lynn Garrison]], and Stan McLeod, all ex-members of the RCAF&#x27;s 403 Squadron, attending the University of Alberta, spent their summers flying hail suppression. The Alberta Hail Suppression Project is continuing with C$3 million a year in funding from insurance companies to reduce hail damage in southern Alberta.

===Europe===
==== Bulgaria ====
Bulgaria operates a national network of hail protection, silver iodide rocket sites, strategically located in agricultural areas such as the [[Rose Valley, Bulgaria|rose valley]]. Each site protects an area of 10 sq. km, the density of the site clusters is such that at least 2 sites will be able to target a single hail cloud, initial detection of hail cloud formation to firing of the rockets is typically 7–10 minutes in its entire process with a view to seed the formation of much smaller hailstones, high in the atmosphere that will melt before reaching ground level.

Data collated since the 1960s suggests huge agricultural sector losses are avoided yearly with the protection system, unseeded the hail will flatten entire regions, with seeding this can be reduced to minor leaf damage from the smaller hailstones that failed to melt.

====France and Spain====
Cloud seeding began in France during the 1950s with the intent of reducing hail damage to crops. The [[ANELFA]] () project consists of local agencies acting within a non-profit organization. A similar project in Spain is managed by the Consorcio por la Lucha Antigranizo de Aragon. The success of the French program was supported by analysis made by Jean Dessens based on insurance data; that of the Spanish program in studies conducted by the Spanish Agricultural Ministry. However, Jean Dessens&#x27;s results were heavily criticized and doubt was cast on the effectiveness of ground generator seeding. ()

====Russia====
The [[Soviet Union]] created a specifically designed version of the [[Antonov An-30]] aerial survey aircraft, the An-30M Sky Cleaner, with eight containers of solid [[carbon dioxide]] in the cargo area plus external pods containing meteorological cartridges that could be fired into clouds. Russian government spends millions on &#x27;cloud seeding&#x27; technology to ensure it doesn&#x27;t rain on May Day public holiday. A single contractor was hired to employ a technique which involves dispersing clouds and forcing them to rain before the time they naturally would – dropping the rain on other places and at other times, so they don’t affect specific events. In 2020, Russia used cloud seeding to help fight Siberian forest fires. The Russian government has also used cloud seeding technology in Crimea to alleviate drought which was caused as a result of Ukraine blocking the Crimean Canal.
Russia published a review of the weather electromagnetic correction technology in 2015, which was developed in the 1980s in the USSR and shares technology with India. 

====Germany====
In Germany [[civic engagement]] societies organize cloud seeding on a region level. A registered society maintains aircraft for cloud seeding to protect agricultural areas from hail in the district [[Rosenheim]], the district [[Miesbach]], the district [[Traunstein]] (all located in southern Bavaria, [[Germany]]) and the district Kufstein (located in Tyrol, [[Austria]]).

Cloud seeding is also used in [[Baden-Württemberg]], a federal state particularly known for its [[Viticulture|winegrowing]] culture. The districts of [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg]], [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn]], [[Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis|Schwarzwald-Baar]] and [[Rems-Murr-Kreis|Rems-Murr]], as well as the cities [[Stuttgart]] and [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] participate in a program to prevent the formation of hailstones. Reports from a local insurance agency suggest that the cloud seeding activities in the Stuttgart area have prevented about 5 million euro in damages in 2015 while the project&#x27;s annual upkeep is priced at only 325.000 euro. Another society for cloud seeding operates in the district of [[Villingen-Schwenningen]].

====Austria====

[[Austria]] has two hail defense organizations: Steirische Hagel Abwehr, with four aircraft: Cessna 182 and Südflug with three aircraft: [[Cessna 150|Cessna 150L]], [[Cessna 182 Skylane|Cessna 182P]], [[Partenavia P.68]] at [[Graz Airport]]. 

====Slovenia====
[[Slovenia|Slovenia&#x27;s]] oldest [[Flying club|aeroclub]] [[Letalski center Maribor]] carries air defense against hail as a specialized EASA operation. The [[Cessna 206|Cessna TU206G Turbo Stationair 6 II]] is equipped with external aggregates and flares for flying. Three crew members work in the operation. Two are the pilots in the plane and the third is the radar operator on the ground. The purpose of the defense is to prevent damage to farmland and cities in the areas of [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]] and [[Prekmurje]] - aircraft hail suppression. They have been carrying out defense since 1983. Silver iodide is used as a reagent. The base is at [[Maribor Edvard Rusjan Airport]]. The activity is financed by local communities and the Ministry of Agriculture, it has great support among people and farmers from all over the countryside.

====United Kingdom====
[[Project Cumulus]] was a UK government initiative to investigate [[Weather control|weather manipulation]], in particular through cloud seeding experiments, operational between 1949 and 1952. A [[conspiracy theory]] has circulated that the [[Lynmouth flood]] of 1952 was caused by secret cloud seeding experiments carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]]. However, meteorologist [[Philip Eden]] has given several reasons why &quot;it is preposterous to blame the Lynmouth flood on such experiments&quot;.

===Australia===

In Australia, summer activities of [[CSIRO]] and [[Hydro Tasmania]] over central and western [[Tasmania]] between the 1960s and the present day appear to have been successful. Seeding over the [[Hydro Tasmania|Hydro-Electricity Commission]] catchment area on the Central Plateau achieved rainfall increases as high as 30 percent in autumn. The Tasmanian experiments were so successful that the Commission has regularly undertaken seeding ever since in mountainous parts of the State.

In 2004, [[Snowy Hydro Limited]] began a trial of cloud seeding to assess the feasibility of increasing snow precipitation in the [[Snowy Mountains]] in Australia. The test period, originally scheduled to end in 2009, was later extended to 2014. The [[New South Wales]] (NSW) Natural Resources Commission, responsible for supervising the cloud seeding operations, believes that the trial may have difficulty establishing statistically whether cloud seeding operations are increasing snowfall. This project was discussed at a summit in [[Narrabri]], NSW on 1 December 2006. The summit met with the intention of outlining a proposal for a 5-year trial, focusing on Northern NSW.

The various implications of such a widespread trial were discussed, drawing on the combined knowledge of several worldwide experts, including representatives from the Tasmanian Hydro Cloud Seeding Project however does not make reference to former cloud seeding experiments by the then-Snowy Mountains Authority, which rejected weather modification. The trial required changes to NSW environmental legislation in order to facilitate placement of the cloud seeding apparatus. The modern experiment is not supported for the Australian Alps.

In December 2006, the [[Queensland]] government of [[Australia]] announced a [[Australian dollar|$]]7.6 million in funding for &quot;warm cloud&quot; seeding research to be conducted jointly by the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] and the United States [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]]. Outcomes of the study are hoped to ease continuing drought conditions in the states [[South East Queensland|South East]] region.

In March 2020, scientists from the [[Sydney Institute of Marine Science]] and [[Southern Cross University]] trialled [[Marine cloud brightening|marine cloud seeding]] off the coast of Queensland, Australia, with the aim to protect [[Great Barrier Reef]] from [[coral bleaching]] and dieoff during [[marine heatwave]]s. Using two high-pressure turbines, the team sprayed microscopic droplets of [[Saline water|saltwater]] into the air. These then evaporate leaving behind very small salt crystals, which water vapour clings to, creating clouds that reflect the sun more effectively.

===Africa===

In [[Mali]] and [[Niger]], cloud seeding is also used on a national scale. In 1985 the Moroccan Government started with a Cloud seeding program called &#x27;Al-Ghait&#x27;. The system was first used in [[Morocco]] in 1999; it has also been used between 1999 and 2002 in [[Burkina Faso]] and from 2005 in [[Senegal]]. Cloud seeding experiments and operations were also conducted in [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) between 1968 and 1980.

== Legal frameworks and implications ==

=== Existing international legislation ===
The [[Environmental Modification Convention|Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]] (ENMOD) is the only international framework related to the regulation of weather and climate modification technologies. Developed after cloud-seeding operations were conducted during the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Cold War]], the convention&#x27;s scope of application solely encompasses military or any other hostile uses of weather modification technologies. Indeed, the use of weather modification programs for peaceful purposes is not prohibited by the treaty. ENMOD has been criticised for its many weaknesses, notably regarding the vagueness and ambiguity of notions leaving room for various interpretations.

=== Ownership of clouds ===
Given the growing attractiveness of weather modification programs, the legal framework offered by ENMOD is arguably insufficient, as the question of &quot;[[ownership]]&quot; is not answered. A 1948 article in the &quot;[[Stanford Law Review]]&quot; stated that attributing a &quot;legal title to a cloud would be ridiculous&quot; due to the distinct nature of clouds, their perpetual change of form and location, their emergence, disappearance and renewal. Similarly, Brooks considers private ownership of clouds as &quot;nonsense&quot; as control is limited to the short moment of the cloud being above somebody&#x27;s land. Quilleré-Majzoub (2004) dismisses the concept of ownership of clouds altogether, given their specific nature, rendering the idea of a cloud ever belonging to somebody unsubstantiated. Indeed, clouds are beyond occupancy – similar to air, running water, the sea and animals &quot;[[Ferae Naturae|ferae naturae]]&quot; – and should thus be considered as common property. Based on this assumption, according to Quilleré-Majzoub it follows that a distinction between &quot;[[res communis]]&quot;, belonging to everybody and thus necessitating international regulation, and &quot;[[res nullius]]&quot;, belonging to nobody with states serving themselves as they please, is more suitable. Although water is generally considered as &quot;res nullius&quot; in international law, there is strong pressure to acknowledging it as &quot;res communis&quot;, but cloud moisture does currently not have a clearly defined status. She thus suggests that international law should elaborate a jurisdictional regime that takes into account both the particular nature of clouds and the implications of new technologies.

According to Brooks (1948) the picture changes once the moisture in the clouds is made accessible through artificial [[rainmaking]] technologies, as the rainwater can now be occupied. Typically, regarding naturally occurring precipitation, the first to reduce it to possession, normally the landowner, will gain rights in it as long as no existing rights are violated. Given that this benefit is accorded by nature, these natural rights should not allow the landowner to claim artificially induced rain. California legislation binds water generated through seeding to existing surface water rights and groundwater regulations, considering the produced water &quot;natural supply&quot;. Yet courts could decide that the induced rain should be designated as &quot;additional precipitation&quot;, permitting the cloud-seeding entity to claim a portion of this generated water. This approach would also face challenges, given the difficulty of determining the fraction of extra water procured by cloud seeding.

==Conspiracy theories==
Cloud seeding has been the focus of many theories based on the belief that governments manipulate the weather in order to control various conditions, including [[global warming]], populations, military weapons testing, public health, and flooding. This speculation has been fueled in part by government interventions and programs like [[Operation Popeye]].

A 2016 classified ad placed by Los Angeles County&#x27;s Department of Public Works in the [[Pasadena Star News]] sparked claims that widespread weather modification was being confirmed. The department followed up with a clarification that it was only describing cloud seeding, used as an anti-drought measure intermittently for more than half a century in Los Angeles.

<doc id="449661" wikidata="Q1639136" url="?curid=449661" title="Operation Medak Pocket">
<text>Operation Medak Pocket (), officially called by Croatians Operation Pocket-93 &quot;(Operacija Džep-93)&quot; was a military operation undertaken by the Croatian Army between 9 – 17 September 1993, in which a salient reaching the south suburbs of Gospić, in the south-central Lika region of Croatia then under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina, was attacked by Croatian forces. The pocket was named after the village of Medak.

The Croatian offensive temporarily succeeded in expelling rebel Serb forces from the pocket after several days of fighting. However, the operation ended in controversy due to a confrontation between the Croatian Army and United Nations peacekeepers as well as accusations of serious Croatian war crimes against local Serb civilians. Although the outcome of the battle against the Serbs was a tactical victory for the Croatians, it became a serious political liability for the Croatian government and international political pressure forced a withdrawal to the previous ceasefire lines. The area was eventually secured by UN troops. 

According to UN and Canadian sources, UNPROFOR personnel and Croatian troops exchanged heavy fire, eventually resulting in the Canadian troops driving off a Croatian assault. In Canada, the battle was considered to be one of the most severe battles fought by the Canadian Forces since the Korean War.

==Background==
By March 1991, tensions between Croats and Serbs escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. Following a referendum on independence that was largely boycotted by Croatian Serbs, the Croatian parliament officially adopted independence on 25 June. The Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) declared its intention to secede from Croatia and join the Republic of Serbia while the Government of Croatia declared it a rebellion. Between August 1991 and February 1992, the RSK initiated an ethnic cleansing campaign to drive out the Croat and non-Serb population from RSK-held territory, eventually expelling as many as 250,000 people according to Human Rights Watch.

Much of the interior of the Lika region of southern Croatia was captured by the forces of the RSK and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) during 1991. In Lika, almost all of the Croatian population in the Serb-held area was killed, expelled or forced to seek refuge in government-held areas, while the Serbs continued shelling of the Croatian city of Gospić throughout the year from their positions. A ceasefire was agreed in the January 1992 Sarajevo Agreement and a United Nations peacekeeping force UNPROFOR was installed to police the armistice lines and act as negotiators, aid-workers, and combat soldiers.

Despite this, sporadic sniping and shelling continued to take place between the two sides. Gospić, which was close to the front lines, was repeatedly subjected to shellfire from the Serbian Army of Krajina (SVK). The town was of great importance in securing lines of communication between Zagreb, Dalmatia and Rijeka. Much of the shelling took place from the Serb-controlled Medak Pocket, an area of high ground near Medak, Croatia approximately four to five kilometres wide and five to six kilometres long which consisted of the localities of Divoselo, Čitluk and part of Počitelj plus numerous small hamlets. The pocket was primarily a rural area with a combination of forest and open fields. It was fairly lightly inhabited before the attack, with about 400 Serb civilians residing in the area and was held by units of the SVK&#x27;s 15th Lika Corps.

The pocket adjoined Sector South, one of the four United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) in Croatia. It was not actually in the UNPA but lay just outside in a so-called &quot;pink zone&quot;—RSK held territory outside the UNPAs, patrolled by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. Prior to the Medak Pocket offensive, Croatian government forces had launched several relatively small-scale attacks to retake rebel Serb-held territory in &quot;pink zones&quot; in the Miljevci plateau in June 1992 and the area of the Maslenica bridge in northern Dalmatia in January 1993—the Operation Maslenica. It has been alleged that the timing of the Maslenica and Medak offensives was owed to the political imperatives of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman, who was facing political difficulties following Croatia&#x27;s intervention in the war in Bosnia.

During Croatian chief of staff Janko Bobetko&#x27;s visit to Gospić area, he and his team concluded that the situation on that area of the front was unsatisfactory. It was especially critical on Velebit mountain which was held by the members of Special police of the Croatian Ministry of Interior. In case that these positions become overrun, the city of Gospić would become semi-surrounded. Croatian lines were also harassed by constant intrusions of smaller recon-sabotage groups that operated behind enemy lines. On 4 September one such group attacked Croatian positions on Velebit which resulted in two Croatian policemen being killed.

Upon that, general Markač issued the order of making a plan that would prevent further intrusions on territory held by the Special police. When Bobetko learnt about that plan, he suggested fitting it into plan of activities of Croatian Army. From beginning of September, the intensity of artillery attacks on wider area of Gospić also intensified. Bobetko therefore decided to run a small-scale tactical operation, with tasks of partially neutralizing Serb artillery positions around city of Gospić, destroying enemy recon-sabotage group base in Divoselo and shorten the length of Croatian frontline.

==The offensive==

===9–14 September===

Croatian offensive involved around 2,500 troops drawn from the Croatian Army&#x27;s Gospić Operational Zone. It began by preparatory fire of 9th Guards artillery batteries approximately at 06:10 am on 9 September 1993. The attack was designed as the double envelopment maneuver in which tanks and infantry of 9th Guards Brigade of Croatian army starting from Gospić suburb of Bilaj provided one thrust of the attack, while commandos of Special Police of the Croatian Ministry of the Interior (MUP) starting from Velebit mountain provided a second thrust. The MUP units previously held vital Croatian positions on Velebit mountain. These forces were also supported by 111th Brigade of Croatian Army, Gospić Home Guard Regiment and Lovinac Home Guard Regiment.. These two reinforced battlegroups successfully linked up same day at 14:00 hours in village of Rajičevci, therefore surrounding one battalion of Serb militia and number of Serb civilians in Medak pocket. This was followed by mopping up operations. After two days of fighting the Croatian forces had taken control of Divoselo, Čitluk and part of Počitelj. The salient was pinched out with the new front line running just in front of the village of Medak.

In accordance with their defense strategy called &quot;Strategy of Real Threat&quot;, which envisioned deterring any Croatian attack of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina by bombarding Croatian cities in retribution, Serb forces began to use long-range artillery (including FROG-7 ballistic missiles and M-87 Orkan) to bombard Karlovac, the Zagreb suburb of Lučko, Samobor and Jastrebarsko on 10 September. These indiscriminate attacks left dozens of civilians killed and wounded with extensive damage to homes and property. Seven civilians were killed and 23 wounded during an artillery attack on downtown Karlovac alone. On 9 September, Serb forces shelled and damaged an oil refinery in Sisak. On 13 and 14 September, Croatian Air Force MiGs-21 successfully destroyed some of the SVK artillery and rocket batteries on Banovina and Kordun but one of the aircraft was downed by SA-6 near Gvozd. and its pilot, Miroslav Peris was killed.

The SVK launched ground counter-attacks which retook some of the captured territory. It also threatened to attack 20 or 30 more targets throughout Croatia unless the captured territory was handed back. The two sides exchanged heavy artillery fire during 12–13 September, with the UN recording over 6,000 detonations in the Gospić-Medak area.

According to former SVK colonel Milislav Sekulić, one of the reasons for success of Croatian offensive on Medak Pocket was the poor combat readiness of SVK forces in that area. Notably, a month before, &quot;Citizens and fighters of Divoselo&quot; complained to their commanding officer that village defence is basically consisted of 30 people, out of which the youngest was aged 15 and oldest 72. At the same time, some of their men deserted from the frontline only to engage in smuggling and other criminal activities around Knin.

===15–17 September===

====Ceasefire====
The offensive attracted strong international criticism and, facing political and military pressure at home and from abroad, the Croatian government agreed to a ceasefire. Major-General Petar Stipetić recalled that he was summoned in Zagreb by chief-of-staff Janko Bobetko on 15 September where he met with him and four other UN officers. Bobetko handed him the ceasefire agreement and after Stipetić put his signature on the page of the document, Bobetko said that he himself would never signed that agreement, which angered Stipetić. Stipetić also said that order of withdrawal caused a lot of anger among Croatian soldiers, although he expected nothing less. According to him, certain commanders warned him not to go to their sector because their men want to kill him for signing the ceasefire. When he came in Gospić, he met with General Ademi who asked him to try to get some time from the UNPROFOR because battlefield sanitation wasn&#x27;t completed at that point, therefore UNPROFOR gave him three days to fix the battlefield. On 15 September a ceasefire agreement was signed by General Mile Novaković, on behalf of the Serbian side and Major-General Petar Stipetić, on behalf of the Croatian side. The agreement required the Croatian forces to withdraw to their starting lines of 9 September, and for Serb forces to withdraw from the pocket and remain withdrawn thereafter. The Croatian withdrawal was scheduled for 1200 on 15 September.

In order to oversee the withdrawal and protect local civilians, UNPROFOR sent 875 troops of the 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry Battle Group (2PPCLI BG), its rifle companies consisting of 50% to 80% augmentees from the army reserve, to move into the pocket, accompanied by two French Army mechanized units. The UN forces, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel James Calvin, were instructed to interpose themselves between the Serb and Croatian forces.

====Canadian buffer====
&quot;Operation Harmony&quot; was the name given to the Canadian participation in UNPROFOR. The initial Canadian contingent, which deployed in March and April 1992, was drawn primarily from the 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group based in Lahr, Germany. It was based on troops of the Royal 22e Régiment, along with detachments from the Royal Canadian Regiment and 4 Combat Engineer Regiment. The Canadians were among the best trained troops at UNPROFOR&#x27;s disposal, making them a natural choice for this dangerous task. They were equipped with M-113 armoured personnel carriers and carried a mix of M2 .50 caliber machine guns, C6 medium machine guns, C7 assault rifles, C9 light machine guns, and 84 mm Carl Gustav RCL&#x27;s. The attached Heavy Weapons Support Company brought 81 mm mortars and a specially fitted APC armed with anti-tank guided missiles.

Croatian forces and other officials involved with the Medak Pocket Mission lost confidence in the UN&#x27;s ability due to failed attacks on forces in the zone of separation between Krajina Serb forces. Earlier that year Croatian troops had launched an attack in order to seize a Peruća Lake power dam and reservoir. The dam was gravely damaged on 28 January 1993, in the aftermath of Operation Maslenica, at 10:48 a.m., when it was blown up in an intentional effort to destroy it by RSK forces. of explosive was used, causing heavy damage, but ultimately the effort to demolish the dam failed. The Croatian communities in the Cetina valley were nevertheless in great danger of being flooded by the lake water. The actions of Major Mark Nicholas Gray of the Royal Marines, deployed with UNPROFOR, prevented total collapse of the dam as he had opened the spillway channel before the explosion and reduced the water level in the lake by . Subsequently, the Croatian forces intervened and captured the dam and the surrounding area. Consequently, the UN needed muscle in Sector South to rebuild its credibility in the eyes of many across the globe. With their &#x27;tough but fair&#x27; reputation, 2PPCLI was sent from the north near Zagreb to the Krajinan region in Southern Croatia, near the Dalmatian Coast territory. 

According to Canadian sources, Croatian forces, under the pretext of not receiving authorization from Zagreb, decided to attack the Canadian forces who were moving in between the Serb and Croat forces. Private Scott LeBlanc who was present in the UN forces recalls, &quot;We started taking fire almost immediately from the Croats&quot;. When the Canadians began constructing a fortified position, the Croatians fired hundreds of artillery shells at them. The Canadians successfully used breaks in the shelling to repair and reinforce their positions.

The UN forces took control of abandoned Serbian positions but again came under fire from the Croatian lines, with the attackers using rocket propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns. The UN troops then dug in their positions and apparently returned fire. As night fell, the Croatians attempted several flanking manoeuvres but the Canadians responded with fire against the Croatian infantry. The French used 20 mm cannon fire to suppress Croatian heavy weapons. The Croatian commander, Rahim Ademi, upon realizing that his forces could not complete their objectives, met with the Canadian commander and agreed to a ceasefire where his troops would withdraw by noon the next day.

According to Croatian version of events, Canadians started moving forward towards Croatian positions, while still having Serb troops right behind their back. The Croatian side interpreted this Canadian move as their non-completing of first phase of the agreement, which among other things included demilitarisation of area around Serb-held positions. At the same time, Serb forces located to the rear of the Canadians sniped Croatian positions; nevertheless, the order was issued not to open fire on UNPROFOR. Croatian soldiers received an order from Brigadier Ademi to fire only in self defence, and not to use heavy weapons and tanks. As the night fell the situation became unclear because Serb troops could not be clearly distinct from UNPROFOR forces, so gunfire was exchanged with the opposing side as a mean of deterrent for any kind of attack on Croatian positions. On the following morning, Brigadier Ademi claimed to have become angry because UNPROFOR forces wanted to provoke his men, take new positions and thus allow Serbs to take their old positions back, so he allowed the implementation of phase two, which meant UNPROFOR troops crossing behind Croatian lines.

When the deadline passed, Canadian forces attempted to cross the Croatian lines, but were stopped at a mined and well-defended roadblock. Calvin held an impromptu media conference with the roadblock as a backdrop, telling journalists that Croatian forces clearly had something to hide. The Croatian high command, realizing they had a public relations disaster on their hands, quickly moved back to their lines held on 9 September. The withdrawal was finally verified as having been completed by 18:00 on 17 September, bringing the offensive to an end.

The advancing Canadian forces discovered that the Croat army had destroyed almost all of the Serb buildings, razing them to the ground. In the burning wrecks they found 16 mutilated corpses. The Canadians expected to find many survivors hiding in the woods, but no Serb was found alive. Rubber surgical gloves littered the area, leading Calvin to a conclusion that there had been a clean-up operation. However, UN&#x27;s investigation suggests that these gloves may have also been ordinary precautionary measures by the Croatians to deal with the legitimate dead and wounded. Photographs of Canadian personnel also shows them using surgical gloves. Everything was recorded and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). ICTY indicted Ademi in 2001, charging him with crimes against humanity, but he was ultimately acquitted.

On 27 April 1998, Calvin reported that &quot;the Croatians reported that 27 of their members were killed or wounded during the fire fights with [his] battle group during the 14 days in Medak&quot;. The same report indicates four Canadians wounded in initial artillery barrage, seven French soldiers were injured by land mines, three French APCs and a front-loader lost to land mines, a Canadian killed and further two injured in collision of their jeep with a Serb truck. Calvin&#x27;s report does not identify the Croatian casualty report or its source. Various Canadian sources (Ottawa Citizen, Tested Mettle, Chances for Peace) talk about 27–30 Croatian soldiers killed in an apparent clash with Canadian peacekeepers. The source of this number is apparently some kind of information published by Croatian Radio Television as well as video footage broadcast by it. In his study &quot;Human Losses in Operation Medak Pocket&quot;, author Miroslav Međimorec claims that he did a search of the entire Croatian Radio Television&#x27;s archive, but was unable to find the alleged footage or any source of that number. He also holds it possible that the footage no longer exists. Even though the operation was considered a success, due to the emerging Somalia Affair, the clash was not highly publicized at the time. Canadians trained to deal with foreign populations and authorities have to deal with conflicting parties as a non-enemy participant with knowledge and the caution that one side would become the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;La-Rose Edwards, Dangerfield, Weekes 1997 47/48&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians are also taught how to deal with human rights violations, especially those that many Canadians had to face in the Medak Pocket where war crimes occurred. Most importantly they have advanced knowledge of law and skills for armed conflict. The Canadian troops showed their ability to immediately stand down when Croatian forces ceased fire and the Canadians reverted to their role as impartial peacekeepers.

The French Lieutenant-General Jean Cot, who was in charge of the operation and Calvin&#x27;s superior officer, said:
The group that UNPROFOR disarmed were members of the Croatian Special Police who ended up in demilitarised zone and were disarmed at gunpoint. At first they refused to hand over their weapons, but after receiving a radio order from their commander, Mladen Markač, they complied with the request. After that, they were escorted out of the demilitarised zone and handed over to Croatian authorities. Their weapons were afterwards delivered by a Canadian officer who threw them demonstratively in the mud in front of them and walked away without saying a word. Several cases were also recorded of Canadians entering 1.5–2 kilometers too deep behind the agreed lines and crushing Croatian road obstacles using their vehicles. After UNPROFOR took control of the demilitarised zone, Canadians allowed incursions of Serb soldiers in the demilitarised zone, and Serb attacks on Croatian soldiers from there resulted in the wounding of one Croatian soldier. Such behaviour of Calvin&#x27;s men resulted in increased diplomatic activity in the following days to calm the tense situation in the field. In one such meeting General Bobetko also mentioned other Croatian frustrations with UNPROFOR&#x27;s peacekeeping prior to the Medak Pocket offensive: 

====Croatian denial====
Several sources deny that Canadian forces engaged in combat at Medak Pocket. The exchange of fire is described as a &quot;minor incident&quot; of sporadic firefights in Croatian sources. Serbian sources also fail to mention &quot;the battle&quot; in their own view of operation Medak pocket.

Of its 875 soldiers (2PPCLI), only 375 came from the regular unit: the rest were augmentees, 385 Primary Reserve soldiers and 165 from other regular force units. In fact, reserve soldiers made up 70% of rifle company strength during the mission due to the requirement for highly skilled and experienced regular soldiers in support and technical trade positions . This includes 7 out of the 12 platoon commanders who came from reserve battalions as Reserve Entry Scheme Officers (RESO). Nevertheless the 2 PPCLI Battlegroup in Croatia contained the highest concentration of reserve soldiers on an operational mission to date.

Alpha and Bravo Companies, arrived in the area (Sector South&#x27;s Medak Pocket) from Sector West on 7 September 1993, just 48 hours before the Croatian offensive started.

UNTV reports (1993-09-18) on the actions of CANBAT and CIVPOL after UNPROFOR had successfully crossed Croatian lines to set up a buffer between Croatian and Serbian forces in the Medak pocket. Includes interviews with civilians caught up in the recent Croatian offensive.

In an interview with three CANBAT soldiers they explain that they arrived 48 hours ago and that their task was to observe the area and take up a position on the earth embankment fifty metres from where they had first come in between the opposing sides. They explain that in process of replacing the Serb lines, they came under direct and indirect fire from the Croatian lines and, following the UNPROFOR rules of engagement, they did return fire but with small arms only. The soldiers say that there were no casualties on their side, that the Serbs have a couple of casualties, and they have no knowledge of any Croatian casualties.

Major-general Petar Stipetić, &quot;categorically rejected any insinuations of an armed conflict between Croatian troops and the UN in the Medak Pocket&quot;, although, he mentioned an incident on second day of Croatian withdrawal when French APC got stuck in a minefield for which Croatian commander ordered his engineers and medical corps to salvage the French.

In 2002 the Croatian newspaper &quot;Nacional&quot; published a report claiming that &quot;the armed conflict between the Croatian and Canadian forces in operation Medak Pocket from 9 to 17 September 1993 never happened&quot; and that the Canadians had fired &quot;no more than a couple of shots into the night.&quot; The same newspaper also claims that the autopsy on Croatian soldiers killed during the Operation Medak Pocket, revealed that none of them died from the weapons that Canadians had in their arsenal at the Medak Pocket. Retired Croatian admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo, testifying at 2007 trial of general Mirko Norac, commanding officer of the 9th Guards Brigade in September 1993, and general Rahim Ademi, commanding officer of the Gospić military district at the time, denied Canadian claims of scale of the armed conflict with UNPROFOR and 26 Croatian fatalities resulting from the battle. He went on to say that he wonders if the 26 victims were Serbs since the claim of 26 killed Croats was not true. This was denied by Calvin, and decorated Canadian Army veterans who served at Medak. For their part, the Croatian authorities, both civil and military, during the aftermath of the skirmish with the UN forces and in the years that followed, have never stated that any serious battle with UNPROFOR forces in the Medak area ever occurred and claim that the Canadian forces&#x27; version of events is politically motivated. Domazet also invited Canadian side to show where are the graves of 26 Croatian soldiers &quot;that they killed in non existing clash for which they received 800 medals&quot;.

=== Serbian denial ===
Croatian author Miroslav Međimorec gained access to the battle reports of ARSK 3rd Motorised Brigade (3. mtb), which was stationed near the Canadian UNPROFOR forces on 16 and 17 September 1993. The reports, although written in confusing manner, mention only occasional provocations coming from Croatian side in this period, to which the Serb side answered with small arms fire. The author concluded, based upon this testimony alone, that the clash between Croatian forces and the UN either was not fierce enough to be mentioned by the person writing the report or it did not happen at all.
In his paper Medak Pocket: Canadian Interpretation - Canadian Sources, he wrote that Canadian &quot;soldiers accounts&quot; are filled with event&#x27;s excitement, &quot;are contradicted by the nature of the firefights&quot; and that they usually come down to bare bragging instead of speaking of the real witnessed event.

===Nielsen denial===
Retired Royal Danish Army colonel Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen, UNPROFOR commanding officer in the area at the time, but who was not present for the battle nor its aftermath, nor even in the area, testifying at the Ademi–Norac trial, denied that there was any armed conflict between the Canadian and Croatian troops except for a single incident when the Canadians deployed in front of Serb-held positions. Croatian Army fired shots, but the Canadians did not return fire. He added that the firing stopped when Croats realized that they were engaging the UN force.

===Canadian view===
In Canada, the event has been referred to as &quot;Canada&#x27;s secret battle&quot;. The Medak Pocket was an event that challenged the skill and discipline of an army that had not deployed formed units to fight in a full-scale battle for almost 40 years. Military analysts have since written extensively of the effects the battle at Medak Pocket has had on the Canadian military, including the management of public information regarding the battle, and both the Canadian military&#x27;s and the Canadian public&#x27;s perception of what &quot;peacekeepers&quot; were trained to do. The battle did not gain widespread public attention in Canada at the time.

==War crimes investigations==

The UN immediately began an investigation into the events at Medak. The task was hampered by the systematic destruction that had been carried out by the withdrawing Croatians. The UN forces found that (in the words of an official Canadian study on the incident) &quot;each and every building in the Medak Pocket had been leveled to the ground&quot;, in a total of eleven villages and hamlets. UNPROFOR units recovered 18 bodies in the Medak Pocket at the immediate aftermath of the operation. Croatian authorities turned over another 64 bodies which they claimed they recovered at the Medak Pocket which were given to the Serbs&#x27; authorities. The investigation claimed that one of the factors which complicated the determination of military status was that many civilians wore items of military clothing and many local military wore items of civilian clothing. The Croatians claimed that there were cases of two elderly women killed during the attack. They said that one was killed while operating an anti-aircraft battery and another blew herself up using a grenade to avoid capture. The UN dismissed these claims in their report in 1994; however, several eyewitness at the Norac-Ademi trial in 2006 described in detail how that grenade incident happened.

Investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) determined that at least 100 Serbs had been unlawfully killed and many others had suffered serious injuries; many of the victims were women and elderly people. 29 executed Serb civilians have been identified, as well as five Serb soldiers who had been captured or wounded. More were thought to have been killed, but the bodies were said to have been removed or destroyed by the Croatians. In addition, Serb-owned property was systematically looted and destroyed to render the area uninhabitable. Personal belongings, household goods, furniture, housing items, farm animals, farm machinery and other equipment were looted or destroyed, and wells were polluted to make them unusable. An estimated 164 homes and 148 barns and outbuildings were burned down or blown up. According to several eyewitness at the Norac-Ademi trials, one woman was impaled on a stake. Much of the destruction was said to have taken place during the 48 hours between the ceasefire being signed and the withdrawal being completed.

The US Department of State claimed that Croatian forces destroyed 11 Serbian villages and killed at least 67 individuals, including civilians. Several members of the Croatian military were subsequently charged with war crimes. The highest-ranking indictee was General Janko Bobetko. He was indicted for war crimes by the ICTY in 2001, but died before the case was heard by the court, and in consequence the trial was cancelled.

The wider area was under the jurisdiction of the Gospić Military District, commanded at the time by Brigadier Rahim Ademi. He was also indicted by the ICTY and was transferred there in 2001. In 2004, General Mirko Norac – who was already serving a 12-year jail sentence in Croatia for his role in the Gospić massacre – was also indicted and transferred to The Hague. The two cases were joined in July 2004, and in November 2005 the tribunal agreed to a Croatian government request to transfer the case back to Croatia, for trial before a Croatian court.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT/MO/1015e&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of Mirko Norac and Rahim Ademi began at the Zagreb County Court in June 2007 and resulted in first-degree verdict in May 2008 whereby Norac was found guilty and given a seven-year sentence for failing to stop his soldiers killing Serbs (28 civilians and 5 prisoners), while Ademi was acquitted
on the grounds that, there was a parallel chain of command ran by Domazet Lošo. The appeal went to the Supreme Court of Croatia, which rendered its verdict in November 2009, confirming the previous verdict but commuting Norac&#x27;s sentence by a year. The final appeals were rejected in March 2010. The process was tracked for the ICTY prosecutor by the OSCE Zagreb office.

Former members of Croatian 9th Guards Brigade Velibor Šolaja and Josip Krmpotić were also found guilty of war crimes in the Medak Pocket. Šolaja was given a five-year prison sentence for murder of civilians, while Krmpotić was found guilty of arson and destruction of Serb-owned houses around Gospić, for which he received a three-year prison sentence. During court proceedings against Šolaja in 2014, another member of the 9th brigade, Josip Mršić admitted to killing an old civilian woman back in 2014. In March 2017, he was sentenced to three years in prison by the County Court in Zagreb, a ruling that was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2021.

==Aftermath==

After the offensive, most of the villages in the area were destroyed and depopulated. Even today, the region is still largely abandoned, though some Serbs have since returned to it. The region remained, in effect, neutral ground between the warring sides until near the end of the war. It was recaptured by the Croatian Army on 4 August 1995 during Operation Storm, which ended in the defeat of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina.

The offensive also exposed serious weaknesses in the Croatian Army&#x27;s command, control, and communications, which had also been a problem in Operation Maslenica earlier in the year.

The operation caused serious political difficulties for the Croatian government, which was heavily criticised abroad for its actions at Medak. The well-publicised accusations of war crimes, along with the Muslim-Croat bloodshed in Bosnia, led to Croatia&#x27;s image being severely tarnished; in many quarters abroad, the country was viewed as having moved from being a victim to an aggressor.

The war crimes committed during the operation damaged the credibility of UNPROFOR as well, as its forces had been unable to prevent them despite being in the vicinity at the time. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, admitted that

:&quot;The 9 September 1993 Croatian destruction of three villages in the Medak pocket has, despite the robust action taken by UNPROFOR to secure the withdrawal of Croatian forces, further increased the mistrust of the Serbs towards UNPROFOR and has led to the reaffirmation of their refusal to disarm. In turn, this refusal to disarm, as required in the United Nations peace-keeping plan, has prevented UNPROFOR from implementing other essential elements of the plan, particularly facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons to their places of origins in secure conditions.&quot;

The 2nd Battalion PPCLI Battle Group, was later awarded the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation for its actions in the Medak Pocket, the first Canadian unit ever presented this unit commendation.

<text>Semiconductor materials are nominally small band gap insulators. The defining property of a semiconductor material is that it can be compromised by doping it with impurities that alter its electronic properties in a controllable way. 
Because of their application in the computer and photovoltaic industry—in devices such as transistors, lasers, and solar cells—the search for new semiconductor materials and the improvement of existing materials is an important field of study in materials science.

Most commonly used semiconductor materials are crystalline inorganic solids. These materials are classified according to the periodic table groups of their constituent atoms.

Different semiconductor materials differ in their properties. Thus, in comparison with silicon, compound semiconductors have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) has six times higher electron mobility than silicon, which allows faster operation; wider band gap, which allows operation of power devices at higher temperatures, and gives lower thermal noise to low power devices at room temperature; its direct band gap gives it more favorable optoelectronic properties than the indirect band gap of silicon; it can be alloyed to ternary and quaternary compositions, with adjustable band gap width, allowing light emission at chosen wavelengths, which makes possible matching to the wavelengths most efficiently transmitted through optical fibers. GaAs can be also grown in a semi-insulating form, which is suitable as a lattice-matching insulating substrate for GaAs devices. Conversely, silicon is robust, cheap, and easy to process, whereas GaAs is brittle and expensive, and insulation layers cannot be created by just growing an oxide layer; GaAs is therefore used only where silicon is not sufficient.

By alloying multiple compounds, some semiconductor materials are tunable, e.g., in band gap or lattice constant. The result is ternary, quaternary, or even quinary compositions. Ternary compositions allow adjusting the band gap within the range of the involved binary compounds; however, in case of combination of direct and indirect band gap materials there is a ratio where indirect band gap prevails, limiting the range usable for optoelectronics; e.g. AlGaAs LEDs are limited to 660 nm by this. Lattice constants of the compounds also tend to be different, and the lattice mismatch against the substrate, dependent on the mixing ratio, causes defects in amounts dependent on the mismatch magnitude; this influences the ratio of achievable radiative/nonradiative recombinations and determines the luminous efficiency of the device. Quaternary and higher compositions allow adjusting simultaneously the band gap and the lattice constant, allowing increasing radiant efficiency at wider range of wavelengths; for example AlGaInP is used for LEDs. Materials transparent to the generated wavelength of light are advantageous, as this allows more efficient extraction of photons from the bulk of the material. That is, in such transparent materials, light production is not limited to just the surface. Index of refraction is also composition-dependent and influences the extraction efficiency of photons from the material.

==Compound semiconductors==

A &quot;compound semiconductor&quot; is a semiconductor compound composed of chemical elements of at least two different species. These semiconductors form for example in periodic table groups 13–15 (old groups III–V), for example of elements from the Boron group (old group III, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium) and from group 15 (old group V, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth). The range of possible formulae is quite broad because these elements can form binary (two elements, e.g. gallium(III) arsenide (GaAs)), ternary (three elements, e.g. indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)) and quaternary alloys (four elements) such as aluminium gallium indium phosphide (AlInGaP)) alloy and Indium arsenide antimonide phosphide (InAsSbP). The properties of III-V compound semiconductors are similar to their group IV counterparts. The higher ionicity in these compounds, and especially in the II-VI compound, tends to increase the fundamental bandgap with respect to the less ionic compounds.

===Fabrication===
Metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is the most popular deposition technology for the formation of compound semiconducting thin films for devices. It uses ultrapure metalorganics and/or hydrides as precursor source materials in an ambient gas such as hydrogen.

Other techniques of choice include:
* Molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE)
* Hydride vapor-phase epitaxy (HVPE)
* Liquid phase epitaxy (LPE)
* Metal-organic molecular-beam epitaxy (MOMBE)
* Atomic layer deposition (ALD)

<doc id="449669" wikidata="Q19052" url="?curid=449669" title="Silver iodide">
<text>Silver iodide is an inorganic compound with the formula AgI. The compound is a bright yellow solid, but samples almost always contain impurities of metallic silver that give a grey colouration. The silver contamination arises because some samples of AgI can be highly photosensitive. This property is exploited in silver-based photography. Silver iodide is also used as an antiseptic and in cloud seeding.

==Structure==
The structure adopted by silver iodide is temperature dependent:
* Below 420 K, the β phase of AgI, with the wurtzite structure, is most stable. This phase is encountered in nature as the mineral iodargyrite. 
* Above 420 K, the α phase becomes more stable. This motif is a body-centered cubic structure which has the silver centers distributed randomly between 6 octahedral, 12 tetrahedral and 24 trigonal sites. At this temperature, Ag+ ions can move rapidly through the solid, allowing fast ion conduction. The transition between the β and α forms represents the melting of the silver (cation) sublattice. The entropy of fusion for α-AgI is approximately half that for sodium chloride (a typical ionic solid). This can be rationalized by considering the AgI crystalline lattice to have already &quot;partly melted&quot; in the transition between α and β polymorphs.
* A metastable γ phase also exists below 420 K with the zinc blende structure.
==Preparation and properties==
Silver iodide is prepared by reaction of an iodide solution (e.g., potassium iodide) with a solution of silver ions (e.g., silver nitrate). A yellowish solid quickly precipitates. The solid is a mixture of the two principal phases. Dissolution of the AgI in hydroiodic acid, followed by dilution with water, precipitates β-AgI. Alternatively, dissolution of AgI in a solution of concentrated silver nitrate followed by dilution affords α-AgI. Unless the preparation is conducted in dark conditions, the solid darkens rapidly, the light causing the reduction of ionic silver to metallic. The photosensitivity varies with sample purity.

==Cloud seeding==
The crystalline structure of β-AgI is similar to that of ice, allowing it to induce freezing by the process known as heterogeneous nucleation. Approximately 50,000 kg are used for cloud seeding annually, each seeding experiment consuming 10–50 grams. (see also Project Stormfury, Operation Popeye).

==Safety==
Extreme exposure can lead to argyria, characterized by localized discolouration of body tissue.

<text>Taksony () is a town of roughly 6,000 inhabitants roughly 23 kilometers south of Budapest, on the bank of the Ráckeve branch of the Danube known as Kisduna (Little Danube). Taksony is known for its many natural springs and tranquil scenery and serves as a haven for fishermen, boaters and summer vacationers.

==History==
Taksony was named after the reigning prince Taksony of Hungary, Prince Árpád&#x27;s grandson. After the invasion of the Mongols, the settlement was destroyed several times by fire. Maria Theresa settled Germans here. Relocation of families occurred after World War II and shortly thereafter, a new phase of development began. The Saint Anna Roman Catholic Church, devastated by an earthquake, was rebuilt in 1958. The foundation stone of the Calvinist church was laid on September 6, 1987. The early 20th century life of the ethnic Germans is presented in the House of Regional Traditions which is a traditional home with relics of German settlers, from early the years of the 20th century. Taksony&#x27;s Catholic parish is famous for its Saint Anna feasts.

<text>Majd ad-Dīn Usāma ibn Murshid ibn ʿAlī ibn Munqidh al-Kināni al-Kalbī (also Usamah, Ousama, etc.; ) (4 July 1095 – 17 November 1188) or Ibn Munqidh was a medieval Arab Muslim poet, author, &quot;faris&quot; (knight), and diplomat from the Banu Munqidh dynasty of Shaizar in northern Syria. His life coincided with the rise of several medieval Muslim dynasties, the arrival of the First Crusade, and the establishment of the crusader states.

He was the nephew and potential successor of the emir of Shaizar, but was exiled in 1131 and spent the rest of his life serving other leaders. He was a courtier to the Burids, Zengids, and later Ayyubids in Damascus, serving Zengi, Nur ad-Din, and Saladin over a period of almost fifty years. He also served the Fatimid court in Cairo, as well as the Artuqids in Hisn Kayfa. He travelled extensively in Arab lands, visiting Egypt, Syria, Palestine and along the Tigris River, and went on pilgrimage to Mecca. He often meddled in the politics of the courts in which he served, and he was exiled from both Damascus and Cairo.

During and immediately after his life, he was most famous as a poet and &quot;adib&quot; (a &quot;man of letters&quot;). He wrote many poetry anthologies, such as the &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Asa&quot; (&quot;Book of the Staff&quot;), &quot;Lubab al-Adab&quot; (&quot;Kernels of Refinement&quot;), and &quot;al-Manazil wa&#x27;l-Diyar&quot; (&quot;Dwellings and Abodes&quot;), and collections of his own original poetry. In modern times, he is remembered more for his &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot; (&quot;Book of Learning by Example&quot; or &quot;Book of Contemplation&quot;), which contains lengthy descriptions of the crusaders, whom he interacted with on many occasions, and some of whom he considered friends.

Most of his family was killed in an earthquake at Shaizar in 1157. He died in Damascus in 1188, at the age of 93.

== Early life ==

Usama was the son of Murshid, and the nephew of Nasr, emir of Shaizar.

Shaizar was seen as a strategically important site and the gateway to enter and control inner Syria. The Arabs initially conquered Shaizar during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637. Due to its importance it exchanged hands numerous times between the Arabs and Byzantines, who regained it in 999. In 1025 the Banu Munqidh tribe were given an allocation of land beside Shaizar by the ruler of Hama, Salih ibn Mirdas. Over time they expanded their lands building fortifications and castles until Usama&#x27;s grandfather Izz al-Dawla al-Murhaf Nasr retook it in 1080.

When Nasr died in 1098, Usama&#x27;s father, Majd ad-Din Abi Salamah Murshid (1068–1137) became the emir of Shaizar and the surrounding cities. However, he soon gave up his position to Usama&#x27;s uncle, Izz ad-Din Abi al-Asaker Sultan, since Murshid was more interested in studying religion and hunting than in matters of politics.

While Usama&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s rule, Shaizar was attacked numerous times by the Banu Kilab of Aleppo, the sect of the Hashshashin, the Byzantines, and the crusaders. It was struck with siege engines for 10 days in 1137 by the Byzantines and the crusaders attempted on many occasions to storm it. However, due to its natural fortifications, it never fell.

As a child, Usama was the second of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama&#x27;s own children. He was encouraged by his father to memorise the Quran, and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn Munira of Kafartab and Abu Abdullah al-Tulaytuli of Toledo. He spent much of his youth hunting with his family, partly as recreation and certainly as warrior (&quot;faris&quot;), training for battle as part of &quot;furusiyya&quot;. He also gathered much direct fighting experience, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and against the Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar. According to Usama, his first experience in battle took place in 1119, in a raid on the crusaders at Apamea.

Sultan did not initially have any male heirs and it is possible that Usama expected to succeed him. He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid&#x27;s other sons. According to Usama, Sultan became jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131, when Usama entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy. When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle. Despite this, he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129, and after his father death in 1137 his exile became permanent.

Usama&#x27;s uncle died in 1154 and his son, Taj al-Dawla Nasr ad-Din Muhammad, inherited the castle. However, Usama was the last heir of the line left alive when in 1157 an earthquake struck the area, killing most of his family.

== Damascus and Egypt ==

Usama went to Homs, where he was taken captive in a battle against Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo, who had just captured nearby Hama. After his capture he entered Zengi&#x27;s service, and travelled throughout northern Syria, Iraq, and Armenia fighting against Zengi&#x27;s enemies, including the Abbasid caliph outside Baghdad in 1132. In 1135, he returned to the south, to Hama, where one of Zengi&#x27;s generals, al-Yaghisiyani, was appointed governor. He returned to Shaizar when his father died in May 1137, and again in April 1138 when Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus besieged the city.

The emperor&#x27;s siege of Shaizar was unsuccessful, but Shaizar was heavily damaged. After the siege, Usama left Zengi&#x27;s service and went to Damascus, which was ruled by Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, the atabeg of the Burid dynasty. Zengi was determined to conquer Damascus, so Usama and Unur turned to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem for help. Usama was sent on a preliminary visit to Jerusalem in 1138, and in 1139 Zengi captured Baalbek in Damascene territory. In 1140, Unur sent Usama back to Jerusalem to conclude a treaty with the crusaders, and both he and Unur visited their new allies numerous times between 1140 and 1143. During these diplomatic missions Usama developed a friendship with members of the Knights Templar whom he considered more civilized than other crusader orders. Afterwards, Usama was suspected of being involved in a plot against Unur, and he fled Damascus for Fatimid Cairo in November 1144.

In Cairo he became a wealthy courtier, but he was involved in plots and conspiracies there as well. The young az-Zafir became caliph in 1149, and Ibn as-Sallar became vizier, with Usama as one of his advisors. As-Sallar sent Usama to negotiate an alliance against the crusaders with Zengi&#x27;s son Nur ad-Din, but the negotiations failed. Usama took part in battles with the crusaders outside of Ascalon on his way back to Egypt, and after he left, his brother &#x27;Ali was killed at Gaza.

Back in Egypt, as-Sallar was assassinated in 1153 by his son Abbas, Abbas&#x27;s son Nasr, and caliph az-Zafir, who, according to Usama, was Nasr&#x27;s lover. Thirteenth-century historian Ibn al-Athir says that Usama was the instigator of this plot. Usama may also have been behind the assassination of az-Zafir by Abbas, in 1154. Az-Zafir&#x27;s relatives called upon a supporter, Tala&#x27;i ibn Ruzzik, who chased Abbas out of Cairo, and Usama followed him. He lost his possessions in Cairo, and on the way to Damascus his retinue was attacked by the crusaders and Bedouin nomads, but in June 1154 he safely reached Damascus, which had recently been captured by Nur ad-Din. Ibn Ruzzik tried to persuade him to come back, as the rest of his family was still in Cairo, but Usama was able to bring them to Damascus, through crusader territory, in 1156. The crusaders promised to transport them safely, but they were attacked and pillaged, and Usama lost his entire library.

== Later years ==

In 1157, Shaizar was destroyed by an earthquake, killing almost all of Usama&#x27;s relatives. They were there for the circumcision of the son of his cousin Muhammad, who had recently succeeded Sultan as emir. The only survivor was Muhammad&#x27;s wife. Usama had remained in Damascus, and after the destruction of his homeland he remained there in semi-retirement. He went on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1160, then went on campaign against the crusaders with Nur ad-Din in 1162, and was at the Battle of Harim in 1164. That year, Usama left Nur ad-Din&#x27;s service and went north to the court of Kara Arslan, the Artuqid emir of Hisn Kayfa.

Usama&#x27;s life in Hisn Kayfa is very obscure, but he travelled throughout the region, and probably wrote many of his works there. In 1174, Usama was invited to Damascus to serve Saladin, who had succeeded Nur ad-Din earlier that year and was a friend of Usama&#x27;s son Murhaf. Usama lived in semi-retirement, as he did in Hisn Kayfa, and often met with Saladin to discuss literature and warfare. He may have also taught poetry and hadith in Damascus, and held poetry salons for Saladin and his chief men, including al-Qadi al-Fadil and Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani. He died on 17 November 1188. He was buried in Damascus on Mount Qasiyun, although the tomb is now lost.

== Family ==

Usama had three brothers, Muhammad, &#x27;Ali, and Munqidh; his cousin, also named Muhammad, succeeded Usama&#x27;s uncle Sultan as emir of Shaizar. He had a son, Murhaf, in 1126, and another son, Abu Bakr, who died as a child. He had a daughter, Umm Farwa, in Hisn Kayfa in 1166. He mentions other children, but their names, and the name of his wife or wives, are unknown.

The picture he painted of his father was of a pious religious man who was not interested in the affairs of this world. He would spend most of his time reading the Quran, fasting and hunting during the day and at night would copy the Quran. He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.

== Religion ==

It is sometimes assumed that Usama was Shi&#x27;ite, because he often writes about &#x27;Ali, his family cooperated with the Fatimids and other Shi&#x27;ite dynasties, and he himself served the Fatimids in Egypt. Philip K. Hitti thought he had a &quot;secret sympathy&quot; with the Shi&#x27;ites. Paul M. Cobb does not think there is enough evidence one way or the other, but believes he was probably Sunni with &quot;acceptable Shi&#x27;ite tendencies.&quot; Robert Irwin thinks the Banu Munqidh were Twelver Shi&#x27;ites (unlike the Fatimids who were Seveners), and that another clue to Usama&#x27;s Shi&#x27;ism is his dislike of jihad, which is different in the Shia doctrine. Usama also admired Christian monks and holy men, and was disturbed that Muslims were not as pious as Christians. He was very fond of Sufis when he first learned about them late in his life in Damascus.

== Works ==

Around 1171 in Hisn Kayfa, Usama wrote the &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Asa&quot; (&quot;Book of the Staff&quot;), a poetry anthology about famous walking sticks and other staffs, and &quot;al-Manazil wa&#x27;l-Diyar&quot; (&quot;Dwellings and Abodes&quot;). In Damascus in the early 1180s he wrote another anthology, the &quot;Lubab al-Adab&quot; (&quot;Kernels of Refinement&quot;), instructions on living a properly cultured life. He is most famous for the &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot; (translated various ways, most recently as &quot;the Book of Contemplation&quot;), which was written as a gift to Saladin around 1183. It is not exactly a &quot;memoir&quot;, as Philip Hitti translated the title, although it does include many autobiographical details that are incidental to the main point. It was meant to be &quot;a book of examples (&quot;&#x27;ibar&quot;) from which to draw lessons.&quot;

In 1880, Hartwig Derenbourg was the first to discover the &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot;, which survived in only one manuscript, in the possession of the Escorial Monastery near Madrid. Derenbourg was also the first to produce an Arabic edition (1886), a biography of Usama (1889), and a French translation (1895). In 1930, Hitti produced an improved Arabic edition, and an English translation. Qasim as-Samarrai produced another Arabic edition in 1987.

Usama wrote in &quot;Middle Arabic&quot;, a less formal style of classical Arabic.

== Reputation ==

Usama was known for becoming embroiled in palace intrigues and political maneuvering. As the Encyclopaedia of Islam says, &quot;his career was a troubled one, and for this his own actions were surely responsible in large part.&quot;

To contemporary and later medieval Muslims, however, he was best remembered for his poetry and his poetry anthologies. Ibn Khallikan, author of a fourteenth-century biographical dictionary, calls him &quot;one of the most powerful, learned, and intrepid members of the [Munqidh] family&quot; and speaks at great length about his poetry.

He was also known for his military and hunting exploits. Ibn al-Athir described him as &quot;the ultimate of bravery&quot;, regarding his presence at the Battle of Harim.

For modern readers he is most famous for the &quot;Kitab al-I&#x27;tibar&quot; and his descriptions of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed nature of the work has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, &quot;adab&quot; in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians are quick to point out that Usama&#x27;s historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama&#x27;s anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their &quot;otherness&quot; to entertain his Muslim audience. As Carole Hillenbrand wrote, it would be &quot;dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value.&quot;

<text>Gospel Oak is an area of north west London in the London Borough of Camden at the very south of Hampstead Heath. The neighbourhood is positioned between Hampstead to the north-west, Dartmouth Park to the north-east, Kentish Town to the south-east, and Belsize Park to the south-west. Gospel Oak lies across the NW5 and NW3 postcodes and is served by Gospel Oak station on the London Overground.

==History==
The name Gospel Oak is derived from a local oak tree, under which parishioners gathered to hear regular gospel readings when the area was still rural. The oak of Gospel Oak marked the boundary between the parishes of Hampstead and St Pancras, and was said to be situated on the corner of Mansfield Road and Southampton Road. The oak vanished sometime in the 1800s and was last recorded on a map of the area in 1801.

There are reports that the founder of Methodism John Wesley preached from the oak, with the 18th century farming population meeting there regularly. The small street named Wesleyan Place, off Highgate Road, was the original site of a very early Methodist chapel that was connected with the famous oak.

Local resident Michael Palin attempted in 1998 to re-plant a new oak tree for Gospel Oak in Lismore Circus however, the tree has not survived.

The history of Gospel Oak can be traced as far back as the history of Hampstead, which was documented in AD 986 by Ethelred the Unready to the Abbot of Westminster. Situated as it is in the southern part of Hampstead Heath, the area was, in years past, referred to as nearby South End Green. When the now-lost great oak tree of Gospel Oak became famous as a preaching spot in the 1700s, the area was referred to as Gospel Oak, and the name continues today.

The neighbourhood began serious development in the mid-1800s when Lord Mansfield, Lord Southampton and Lord Lisburne were the local landowners. Plans were drawn up for elegant streets radiating from Lismore Circus but after two railway lines were extended across the area in the 1860s the first buildings were two- and three-story cottages, based around present-day Oak Village. The area was for many years rather remote from the rest of the wider Kentish Town development and streets were not fully completed and the housing stock was regarded as relatively sub-standard.

During this early building period, there was a risk that Parliament Hill Fields (the southernmost part of Hampstead Heath, entered from the ‘Gospel Oak Entrance’ near Gospel Oak station) would be built over. In the 1840s, Lord Southampton&#x27;s estate initially proposed building on the fields, but a campaign led to the fields being bought in 1889 by the Metropolitan Board of Works as an extension to the already protected Hampstead Heath. The fields now host Parliament Hill itself, the Parliament Hill Lido, an athletics running track, a bandstand, café and various children&#x27;s play areas.

On the evening of 2 September 1861, an excursion train returning from Kew Gardens hit an empty train on the bridge next to Gospel Oak station. The engine left the line and plunged down the embankment, killing 14 and injuring 300.

A curious story of Victorian Gospel Oak relates to a story that appeared in the local press of the time, called &quot;The Elephants of Gospel Oak&quot;. In March 1884, Sangers Circus was booked to perform at Gospel Oak (presumably on Parliament Hill Fields). Four elephants were transported by train to Kentish Town but on leaving the train, two of the elephants bolted and ran up Fortess Road, knocking over a child, running further beyond Tufnell Park station and ending up falling into cellars in Pemberton Gardens. The other two elephants were then drafted to pull out the trapped elephants using ropes. All four elephants then paraded down the streets of Dartmouth Park, accompanied by hundreds of onlookers, arriving back at Gospel Oak where the elephants performed to packed audiences.

Later development including the areas of the Mansfield Conservation area to the west of Gospel Oak station led to the neighbourhood becoming more respectable and solidly residential - although in 1909 when John Betjeman&#x27;s family moved to the more affluent Highgate they obviously felt that they were a cut above Gospel Oak:
Here from my eyrie, as the sun went down,I heard the old North London puff and shunt,Glad that I did not live in Gospel Oak.

Bombing during the 1940s and post-war regeneration affected Gospel Oak considerably. During World War II, the area around Gospel Oak station was bombed, and on the night of 16 November 1940, Mansfield Road School (Gospel Oak Primary School is now on this site) and other parts of Gospel Oak were bombed. The school was acting as a fire station at the time and 4 local residents died and many more injured. The present-day school was subsequently built on the site, and the damaged Victorian houses opposite were torn down to make way for the more modern estates that are seen today.

==Topography==
One of ‘London’s lost rivers’ the River Fleet flows hidden under Gospel Oak, following the line of Fleet Road, and crossing under Southampton Road, Kingsford Road and continuing along the line of Malden Road to eventually meet the Thames.

==Local politics==
The majority of Gospel Oak forms a ward, called Gospel Oak, on Camden London Borough Council. It was represented by future MP Tessa Jowell (Labour) from 1974 to 1986, businessman John Mills (Labour) from 1990 to 2006, Camden Council Leader Raj Chada (Labour) from 2002 to 2006 and future MP Chris Philp (Conservative) from 2006 to 2010. The southern part of Gospel Oak is included in the Haverstock ward (which also includes areas to the south of Queen&#x27;s Crescent and south-west to Belsize Park).

For parliamentary purposes, Gospel Oak is part of the wider Holborn and St Pancras constituency currently held by the Prime Minister, Labour&#x27;s Sir Keir Starmer.

==Transport==

===Trains===

Gospel Oak is served by the London Overground network, with Gospel Oak station being the start of the Gospel Oak to Barking line as well as an intermediate stop on the North London Line.

Gospel Oak station dates back to 1860. The name of the current Gospel Oak station in Mansfield Road/Gordon House Road has changed over the years. When it first opened in 1860 it was the very first station in the area that took the name ‘Kentish Town’ which it held until 1867 when it was renamed ‘Gospel Oak’ due to other stations taking the Kentish Town name. Given Gospel Oak station&#x27;s immediate proximity to Parliament Hill (just an 8-minute walk from station to summit), there was a movement in the 1950s to rename Gospel Oak station Parliament Hill station – a proposal which was quashed by local residents.

Kentish Town station situated 1 mile away is served by Thameslink.

<text>United and Alternative Left (, EUiA) is a political party in Catalonia, Spain. EUiA has 4000 members, and until 2019 was the Catalan correspondent of the Spain-wide United Left (IU).
It was formed in 1998 as a schism from Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV). It comprises an alliance of Party of the Communists of Catalonia, Living Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, POR, PRT-IR, PASOC, CEA, and CLI. After competing in a series of elections with their former colleagues at &quot;Iniciativa&quot;, the two parties agreed to run together as an electoral coalition. In 2015, the party joined the electoral coalition En Comú Podem. In 2017, it was one of the founding parties of Catalunya en Comú, being expelled from the organization two years later as it was no longer the Catalan correspondent of United Left.

<text>Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into them and seeding them with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983. The hypothesis was that the silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane, and this led to seeding several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this hypothesis was incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury&#x27;s successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.

The last experimental flight was flown in 1971, due to a lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA&#x27;s fleet. Project Stormfury was officially canceled more than a decade after the last modification experiment. Although the project failed to achieve its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, its observational data and storm lifecycle research helped improve meteorologists&#x27; ability to forecast the movement and intensity of hurricanes.

==Hypothesis==

Cloud seeding was first attempted by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir. After witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of weather modification. Schaefer found that when he dumped crushed dry ice into a cloud, precipitation in the form of snow resulted.

With regard to hurricanes, it was hypothesized that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane&#x27;s winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.

Due to Langmuir&#x27;s efforts, and the research of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal was to try to weaken hurricanes.

==Project Cirrus==
Project Cirrus was the first attempt to modify a hurricane. It was a collaboration of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations and initial skepticism by government scientists, the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on Hurricane Cape Sable that was heading west to east and out to sea.

The project&#x27;s two B-17s and a B-29 of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance group were dispatched from MacDill Field, Florida, to intercept the hurricane. The seeding B-17 flew along the rainbands of the hurricane, and dropped nearly 180 pounds (82 kilograms) of crushed dry ice into the clouds. The crew reported &quot;Pronounced modification of the cloud deck seeded&quot;. It is not known if that was due to the seeding. Next, the hurricane changed direction and made landfall near Savannah, Georgia. The public blamed the seeding, and Irving Langmuir claimed that the reversal had been caused by human intervention. Cirrus was canceled, and lawsuits were threatened. Only the fact that a system in 1906 had taken a similar path, as well as evidence showing that the storm had already begun to turn when seeding began, ended the litigation. This disaster set back the cause of seeding hurricanes for eleven years.

At first the seeding was officially denied and it took years before the government admitted it. According to the September 12, 1965 edition of the Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel, in 1947 a hurricane &quot;went whacky&quot; and &quot;Twelve years later it was admitted the storm &quot;had in fact been seeded.&quot;&quot;

==Between the projects==
The United States Weather Bureau&#x27;s National Hurricane Research Project, founded in 1955, had as one of its objectives to investigate the scientific validity of hurricane modification methods. To this end, silver iodide dispensers were tested in Hurricane Daisy in August 1958. The flares were deployed outside of the hurricane eyewall, so this was an equipment test rather than a modification experiment. The equipment malfunctioned in all but one of the flights, and no conclusive data was acquired.

The first seeding experiment since the Cirrus disaster was attempted on September 16, 1961, into Hurricane Esther by NHRP and the United States Navy aircraft. Eight cylinders of silver iodide were dropped into Esther&#x27;s eyewall, and winds were recorded as weakening by 10 percent. The next day, more seeding flights were made. This time, the silver iodide did not fall into the eyewall, and no reduction in windspeed was observed. These two results were interpreted as making the experiment a &quot;success&quot;.

The seedings into Hurricane Esther led to the establishment of Project Stormfury in 1962. Project Stormfury was a joint venture of the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Navy.

==Project BATON==
The objective of Project BATON was the analysis of the life history of thunderstorms. A Department of
Defense research activity supported by the Advanced Research Project Agency, Project BATON sought to expand understanding of storm physics as an aid to weather forecasting, fire prevention, and, possibly, for artificially controlling the weather. Dr. Helmut Weickmann, as an employee of the U.S, Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, and Dr. Paul MacCready of Meteorology Research, Inc., were joint leaders of the Project BATON team.

During the 1962 July–August storm season in Flagstaff, Arizona, the scientists, selected &quot;guinea pig&quot; storms, and seeded them with chemicals. Effects were thoroughly analyzed from the ground and from the air with time-lapse motion picture cameras, stereo still cameras, storm radar, lightning detectors, and airborne heat sensors. Among the agents inserted in selected clouds were &quot;condensation nuclei&quot; which temporarily increased the number of water droplets in the cloud, and pulverized dry ice, which turns a portion of the cloud to fine snow crystals that remain aloft. The utilization of these agents facilitated study of a storm&#x27;s characteristics.

==Project STORMFURY begins==

Robert Simpson became its first director, serving in this capacity until 1965. There were several guidelines used in selecting which storms to seed. The hurricane had to have a less than 10 percent chance of approaching inhabited land within a day; it had to be within range of the seeding aircraft; and it had to be a fairly intense storm with a well-formed eye. The primary effect of these criteria was to make possible seeding targets extremely rare.

No suitable storms formed in the 1962 season. Next year, Stormfury began by conducting experiments on cumulus clouds. From August 17 to 20 of that year, experiments were conducted in 11 clouds, of which six were seeded and five were controls. In five of the six seeded clouds, changes consistent with the working hypothesis were observed.

On August 23, 1963, Hurricane Beulah was the site of the next seeding attempt. It had an indistinct eyewall. In addition, mistakes were made, as the seedings of silver iodide were dropped in the wrong places. As a consequence, nothing happened. The next day, another attempt was made, and the seeders hit their targets. The eyewall was observed to fall apart and be replaced by another eyewall with a larger radius. The sustained winds also fell by twenty percent. All in all, the results of the experiments on Beulah were &quot;encouraging but inconclusive.&quot;

In the six years after Beulah, no seedings were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment was not ready to be used. The year after that, all flights were used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.

Joanne Simpson became its director beginning in 1965.
While out to sea in August of the 1965 Atlantic hurricane season, Stormfury meteorologists decided that Hurricane Betsy was a good candidate for seeding. However, the storm immediately swung towards land, and on September 1, the planned flights were canceled. For some reason, the press was not notified that there were no seedings, and several newspapers reported that it had begun. As Betsy passed close to the Bahamas and smashed into southern Florida, the public and Congress thought that seeding was underway and blamed Stormfury. It took two months for Stormfury officials to convince Congress that Betsy was not seeded, and the project was allowed to continue. A second candidate, Hurricane Elena, stayed too far out to sea.

After Betsy, two other hurricanes came close to being seeded. Hurricane Faith was considered a likely candidate, but it stayed out of range of the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.

Dr. R. Cecil Gentry became the director of Stormfury in 1968. There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. What once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted on the wings of the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved. Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis. The new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, latent heat would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.

Hurricane Debbie in 1969 provided the best opportunity to test the underpinnings of Project Stormfury. In many ways it was the perfect storm for seeding: it did not threaten any land; it passed within range of seeding aircraft; and was intense with a distinct eye. On August 18 and again on August 20, thirteen planes flew out to the storm to monitor and seed it. On the first day, windspeeds fell by 31%. On the second day, windspeeds fell by 18%. Both changes were consistent with Stormfury&#x27;s working hypothesis. Indeed, the results were so encouraging that &quot;a greatly expanded research program was planned.&quot; Among other conclusions was the need for frequent seeding at close to hourly intervals.

The 1970 and 1971 seasons provided no suitable seeding candidates. Despite this, flights were conducted into Hurricane Ginger. Ginger was not a suitable storm for seeding, due to its diffuse, indistinct nature. The seeding had no effect. Ginger was the last seeding done by Project Stormfury.

==After the seedings==
Atlantic hurricanes meeting all of the criteria were extremely rare, which made duplication of the &quot;success&quot; reached with Hurricane Debbie extremely difficult. Meanwhile, developments outside of meteorology hindered the cause of hurricane modification.

In the early 1970s, the Navy withdrew from the project. Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, tropical cyclones. At the same time, the Project&#x27;s B-17s were nearing the end of their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30 million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3&#x27;s were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.

The plan was to begin again in 1976, and seed typhoons by flying out of Guam. However, political issues blocked the plan. The People&#x27;s Republic of China announced that it would not be happy if a seeded typhoon changed course and made landfall on its shores, while Japan declared itself willing to put up with difficulties caused by typhoons because that country got more than half of its rainfall from tropical cyclones.

Similar plans to operate Stormfury in the eastern north Pacific or in the Australian region also collapsed.

==Failure of the working hypothesis==
Multiple eyewalls had been detected in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna. Double eyewalls were usually only seen in very intense systems. They had also been observed post-seeding in some of the seeded storms. At the time, the only observations of rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful seedings, occurred during rapid changes in storm intensity. It remained unclear whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether it was just part of a natural cycle (because correlation does not imply causation). It was initially thought that eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded but not unseeded systems provided the evidence that Project Stormfury was a success. But if it was later observed that such eyewall changes were common in unseeded systems as well, such observations would throw doubt on the hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.

Data and observations did in fact begin to accumulate that debunked Stormfury&#x27;s working hypothesis. Beginning with Hurricanes Anita and David, flights by hurricane hunting aircraft encountered events similar to what happened in &quot;successfully&quot; seeded storms. Anita itself had a weak example of a concentric eyewall cycle, and David a more dramatic one. In August 1980, Hurricane Allen passed through the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. It also underwent changes in the diameter of its eye and developed multiple eyewalls. All this was consistent with the behavior that would have been expected of Allen had it been seeded. Thus, what Stormfury thought to have accomplished by seeding was also happening on its own.

Other observations in Hurricanes Anita, David, Frederic, and Allen also discovered that tropical cyclones have very little supercooled water and a great deal of ice crystals. The reason that tropical cyclones have little supercooled water is that the updrafts within such a system are too weak to prevent water from either falling as rain or freezing. As cloud seeding needed supercooled water to function, the lack of supercooled water meant that seeding would have no effect.

Those observations called the basis for Project Stormfury into question. In the middle of 1983, Stormfury was finally canceled after the hypothesis guiding its efforts was invalidated.

==Legacy==
In the sense of weakening hurricanes to reduce their destructiveness, Project Stormfury was a complete failure because it did not distinguish between natural phenomena in tropical cyclones and the impact of human intervention. Millions of dollars had been spent. In the end, &quot;[Project] STORMFURY had two fatal flaws: it was neither microphysically nor statistically feasible.&quot;

In addition, Stormfury had been a primary generator of funding for the Hurricane Research Division. While the project was operational, the HRD&#x27;s budget had been around $4 million (1975 USD; $16 million 2008 USD), with a staff of approximately 100 people. In 2000, the HRD employed 30 people and has a budget of roughly $2.6 million each year.

However, Project Stormfury had positive results as well. Knowledge gained during flights proved invaluable in debunking its hypotheses. Other science resulted in a greater understanding of tropical cyclones. In addition, the Lockheed P-3s were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones, allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms. Those planes were still used by the NOAA as of 2005.

Former Cuban president Fidel Castro alleged that Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaponize hurricanes.

<text>The Hymn of the Pearl (also Hymn of the Soul, Hymn of the Robe of Glory or Hymn of Judas Thomas the Apostle) is a passage of the apocryphal &quot;Acts of Thomas&quot;. In that work, originally written in Syriac, the Apostle Thomas sings the hymn while praying for himself and fellow prisoners. Some scholars believe the hymn predates the Acts, as it only appears in one Syriac manuscript and one Greek manuscript of the Acts of Thomas. The author of the Hymn is unknown, though there is a belief that it was composed by the Syriac gnostic Bardaisan from Edessa due to some parallels between his life and that of the hymn. It is believed to have been written in the 2nd century or even possibly the 1st century, and shows influences from heroic folk epics from the region.

==Synopsis==
The hymn tells the story of a boy, &quot;the son of the king of kings&quot;, who is sent to Egypt to retrieve a pearl from a serpent. During the quest, he is seduced by Egyptians and forgets his origin and his family. However, a letter is sent from the king of kings to remind him of his past. When the boy receives the letter, he remembers his mission, retrieves the pearl and returns. That the boy is implicitly Thomas rather than Jesus is indicated by the eventual assertion that he is next in line to his elder brother, this unnamed brother not otherwise mentioned in the text.

==Interpretation==
The hymn is commonly interpreted as a Gnostic view of the human condition, that we are spirits lost in a world of matter and forgetful of our true origin. This state of affairs may be ameliorated by a revelatory message delivered by a messenger, a role generally ascribed to Jesus. The letter thus takes on a symbolic representation of gnosis.

The hymn has been preserved and especially treasured in Manichaeism – a version of it appears as part of a Coptic Manichaean psalm book and is called the Psalms of Thomas. The Hymn of the Pearl has also been admired by Orthodox Christian thinkers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>Michelle Susan Martin (born 29 April 1967) is an Australian former professional squash player who was one of the game&#x27;s leading players in the 1990s. She was ranked number one in the world from 1993 to 1996 and again in 1998 and 1999, and won three World Open titles and six British Open titles.

==Early life==
Martin was born on 29 April 1967 in Sydney, as the fourth of six children. Her older brothers Brett and Rodney also went on to be top professional players. Her parents, who had built the Engadine Squash Centre below their family home, introduced her to the game when she was three years old. She would often play squash with her family after school, and at the age of eight, she came second in the state under-13s championship. She moved with her family to Brisbane in 1980, and attended Everton Park State High School.

==Career==
She joined the Australian Institute of Sport&#x27;s squash unit shortly after its establishment in 1985, and was part of the program for the rest of the 1980s; her coaches there included squash champions Geoff Hunt and Heather McKay. After working in a bank, she began her professional squash career in 1987, competing in her first of six World Team Squash Championships in that year; she went on to participate in all of them during her career except the 1989 championship.

In early 1990, Martin was considering giving up the sport due to lack of progress (her world ranking had been steady at No. 6 for some years), until her uncle Lionel Robberds began coaching her, providing her with a rigorous training program of running, gym work and physical drills. Her confidence in her game and world ranking began to increase. In late 1990, she met Phil Harte, who was to be her manager from then until 1992. Harte suggested that, rather than wearing the traditional shirt and skirt during squash games, she should wear a two-piece lycra suit because it was &quot;something sexy&quot; that would &quot;shake up the squash world&quot; and gain publicity for her in the process. She agreed to do so, which caused much controversy. Fellow squash player Danielle Drady, who was married to Martin&#x27;s brother Rodney, later left him for Harte, who became her manager and similarly had her dress in glad wrap for publicity. Rodney became Martin&#x27;s coach in 1998.

She spent 44 months as the best women&#x27;s squash player in the world from March 1993 to October 1996 before Cassie Jackman of England broke her dominance; she was also ranked number one in the world in 1998 and 1999. She won three consecutive World Open championships from 1993 to 1995, and was a finalist in all the World Opens from 1992 to 1999 except 1996; she also won six consecutive British Opens from 1993 to 1998. She represented her country at the 1996 and 1999 Squash World Cups, and won gold medals in the sport at the 1998 Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games in the women&#x27;s singles and mixed doubles. She also won the Australian Open in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, and 1999. At the end of 1999 she announced her retirement, saying she had achieved all her goals in the sport. She worked as a manager and coach of the Australian women&#x27;s junior and senior teams from 2003 to 2016.

===World Open===

====Finals: 7 (3 titles, 4 runners-up)====

===World Team Championships===

====Finals: 6 (4 title, 2 runner-up)====

==Personal life==
Martin was married to Stephen Lacy, who was also her manager when she played professional squash, and the couple has two sons.

==Recognition==
In 1994, Martin was named New South Wales Sportswoman of the Year. She was inducted into the Australian Squash Hall of Fame in 1995 and was upgraded to Legend status in 2011; she was also inducted into the New South Wales Sports Hall of Champions in 1998, the Women&#x27;s Squash Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Queensland Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. She received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2013. She was inducted into the World Squash Hall of Fame, the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and the Australian Institute of Sport &quot;Best of the Best&quot; in 2001.

<text>The M113 is a fully tracked armored personnel carrier (APC) that was developed and produced by the FMC Corporation. The M113 was sent to United States Army Europe in 1961 to replace the mechanized infantry&#x27;s M59 APCs. The M113 was first used in combat in April 1962 after the United States provided the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) with heavy weaponry such as the M113, under the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) program. Eventually, the M113 was the most widely used armored vehicle of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War and was used to break through heavy thickets in the midst of the jungle to attack and overrun enemy positions. It was largely known as an &quot;APC&quot; or an &quot;ACAV&quot; (armored cavalry assault vehicle) by the allied forces.

The M113 was the first aluminum hull combat vehicle to be put into mass production. Much lighter than earlier similar vehicles, its aluminum armor was designed to be thick enough to protect the crew and passengers against small arms fire, but light enough that the vehicle was air transportable and moderately amphibious.

In the U.S. Army, the M113 series have long been replaced as front-line combat vehicles by the M2 and M3 Bradleys, but large numbers are still used in support roles such as armored ambulance, mortar carrier, engineer vehicle, and command vehicle. The U.S. Army&#x27;s heavy brigade combat teams are equipped with approximately 6,000 M113s and 6,724 Bradleys.

The M113&#x27;s versatility spawned a wide variety of adaptations that live on worldwide and in U.S. service. These variants together currently represent about half of U.S. Army armored vehicles. It is estimated that over 80,000 vehicles in the M113 family have been produced and used by over 50 countries worldwide, making it one of the most widely used armored fighting vehicles of all time.

M113 production was terminated in 2007. The Army initiated the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program to search for a replacement. In 2014, the U.S. Army selected BAE Systems&#x27; proposal of a turretless variant of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle to replace over 2,800 M113s in service.
Thousands of M113s continue to see combat service in the Israel Defense Forces, although by 2014 the IDF was seeking to gradually replace many of its 6,000 M113s with the Namers, and with the Eitan AFV in 2020.

==Development==

The M113 was developed by the FMC Corporation, which had produced the earlier M59 and M75 armored personnel carriers. The M113 bears a very strong resemblance to both of these earlier vehicles. The M75 was too heavy and expensive to be useful, as its weight precluded amphibious use and transport by air. The lightened M59 addressed both of these problems, but ended up with too little armor, and was unreliable as a result of its dual engine power train.

The Army was looking for a vehicle that combined the best features of both designs, the &quot;airborne armored multi-purpose vehicle family&quot; (AAM-PVF) of all-purpose, all-terrain armored fighting vehicles. FMC had been working with the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Co. in the late 1950s to develop a suitable aluminum armor that provided the protection of the M75 and the low weight and mobility of the M59.

FMC responded with two proposals; two versions of the aluminum T113 – one thicker and one more thinly armored – along with the similar but mostly steel T117. The thicker-armored version of the T113 – effectively the prototype of the M113 – was chosen because it weighed less than its steel competitor, whilst offering the same level of protection. An improved T113 design, the T113E1, was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1960 as the &quot;M113&quot;. A diesel prototype, T113E2, was put into production in 1964 as the &quot;M113A1&quot;, and quickly supplanted the gasoline-engined M113. FMC transferred the M113&#x27;s production in 1994 to United Defense, its newly formed defense subsidiary. United Defense was acquired by BAE Systems in 2005.

The M113 was developed to provide a survivable and reliable light tracked vehicle able to be air-lifted and air-dropped by C-130 and C-141 transport planes. The original concept was that the vehicle would be used solely for transportation to move the troops forward under the protection of armor and then having them dismount for combat, after which the M113 would retreat to the rear. Entering service with the U.S. Army in 1960, the M113 required two crewmen, a driver and a commander, and carried 11-15 passengers inside the vehicle. Its main armament was a single .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun operated by the commander. The first batch of 32 M113s arrived in Vietnam on 30 March 1962 and were sent to two Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) mechanized rifle companies, each equipped with 15 of the APCs.

The two mechanized units were fielded for the first time on 11 June 1962. During the Battle of Ap Bac in January 1963, at least fourteen of the gunners aboard the M113s were killed in action due to their exposed position, necessitating modifications to improve crew survivability. Makeshift shields formed from metal salvaged from the hulls of sunken ships were soon fitted to the carriers, affording better protection; however, it was found that this material could be penetrated by small arms fire, so subsequent shields were constructed from scrapped armored vehicles. The ARVN 80th Ordnance Unit in South Vietnam developed the shield idea further and commenced engineering general issue gun shields for the M113. These shields became the predecessor to the standardized armored cavalry assault vehicle (or ACAV) variant and were issued to all ARVN mechanized units during the early 1960s.

According to Ralph Zumbro the ARVN had modified the M113s to function as &quot;amphibious light tanks&quot; and not as the battle taxis U.S. designers had intended. Instead of an armored personnel carrier, the ARVN used the carried infantry as extra &quot;dismountable soldiers&quot; in &quot;an oversized tank crew&quot;. These &quot;ACAV&quot; sets were eventually adapted to U.S. Army M113s with the arrival of the army&#x27;s conventional forces in 1965. The vehicles continued to operate in the role of a light tank and reconnaissance vehicle, and not as designed in theater.

The U.S. Army, after berating the South Vietnamese for flouting battle doctrine, came out with their own ACAV version. This more or less standardized ACAV kit included shields and a circular turret for the .50-caliber M2 machine gun in the track commander (TC) position, two M60 machine guns with shields for the left and right rear positions, and &quot;belly armor&quot;—steel armor bolted from the front bottom extending 1/2 to 2/3 of the way towards the bottom rear of the M113. The two rear machine gunners could fire their weapons while standing inside the rectangular open cargo hatch. This transformed the M113 into a fighting vehicle, but the vehicle still suffered from its lightly armored configuration, having never been designed for such a role. Canada also adopted the ACAV kits when employing the M113A2 during peacekeeping operations in the Balkans in the 1990s.

In order to improve the fighting ability of the mounted troops, a number of experiments were carried out in the 1960s under the MICV-65 project. These attempted to develop a true infantry fighting vehicle rather than an armored personnel carrier. Pacific Car and Foundry entered the steel-armored XM701, but this proved to be too slow and too heavy to be airmobile, even in the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. FMC entered the XM734, which was largely the ACAV M113 but with the troops sitting facing outwards on a central bench, rather than facing inwards as in the M113. Four gun ports and vision blocks were added on each side to allow the seated troops to fire even while under cover. Although neither the XM701 or XM734 were deemed worthwhile to produce, FMC continued development of their version as the XM765 advanced infantry fighting vehicle (AIFV). The AIFV was sold to a number of third party-users in the 1970s, including the Netherlands, the Philippines and Belgium.

===Modifications===
 Modified versions of the Vietnam War ACAV sets were deployed to Iraq to equip the standard M113s still in service. The circular .50 caliber gun shields have been modified, while the rear port and starboard gun stations have been deleted for service in that region. Some of these modified vehicles have been utilized for convoy escort duties.

The M113 has light armor, but it can be augmented with add-on steel plates for improved ballistic protection. Reactive armor and slat armor can be added for protection against rocket-propelled grenades. Band tracks made of rubber are in use by Canadian and other forces to enable stealthy operation, less damage to paved roads, higher speed, less maintenance, access to terrain where operation of wheeled vehicles is impractical and less vibration and rolling resistance.

Most of the 13,000 M113s that are still in U.S. Army service have been upgraded to the A3 variant. The current U.S. Army M113 fleet includes a mix of M113A2 and A3 variants and other derivatives equipped with the most recent RISE (reliability improvements for selected equipment) package. The standard RISE package includes an upgraded propulsion system (turbocharged engine and new transmission), greatly improved driver controls (new power brakes and conventional steering controls), external fuel tanks, and 200-amp alternator with four batteries. Additional A3 improvements include the incorporation of spall liners and provision for mounting external armor.
The M113 has also been adopted to replace the aging fleet of visually modified M551s being used to simulate Russian-made combat vehicles at the U.S. Army&#x27;s National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California as well as the M60A3s formerly at the Combat Maneuver Training Center near Hohenfels, Germany. These M113s, like the M551s they replaced, have also been modified to resemble enemy tanks and APCs, such as the T-80 and BMP-2. One of the advantages of the M113 being used to simulate the latter is that the infantry squad can now ride inside the simulated BMP instead of in a truck accompanying a tank masquerading as one, as was often the case with the M551s.

===Nicknames===
The M113 has received a variety of nicknames over the years. The South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) called it the &quot;green dragon&quot;. United States troops tended to refer to the M113 simply as a &quot;113&quot; (spoken as &quot;one-one-three&quot;), or a &quot;track&quot;. The Israel Defense Forces employ the M113 in many different variants, all designed in Israel, and have given each of them official names, from the baseline &quot;Bardelas&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; Cheetah) to the &quot;Nagmash&quot; (Hebrew acronym equivalent to &quot;APC&quot;), &quot;Nagman&quot;, and &quot;Kasman&quot; variants for urban combat up to the &quot;Zelda&quot; and &quot;Zelda 2&quot;, which are fitted with ERA-suites.

The Australian Army refers to its M113A1s as &quot;buckets&quot;, &quot;bush taxis&quot; and modified M113A1s fitted with 76 mm turrets as &quot;beasts&quot;. The German Army has various nicknames, depending on location and branch of service, including &quot;elephant shoe&quot;, &quot;Tank Wedge&quot; and &quot;bathtub&quot;. In Spain&#x27;s Army it is known as &quot;TOA&quot;, the acronym of Transporte Oruga Acorazado, which is Spanish for Armored Tracked Carrier. In the Ukrainian Army it is called &quot;Emka&quot; (M).

==Design==
===Armament===
The basic M113 armored personnel carrier can be fitted with a number of weapon systems. The most common weapon fit is a single .50 caliber M2 machine gun. However, the mount can also be fitted with a 40 mm Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher. A number of anti-tank weapons could be fitted to the standard variant: the U.S. Army developed kits that allowed the M47 Dragon and BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile systems to be mounted.

In the case of the M47, the system mated to the existing machine gun mount, without having to remove the machine gun. This allowed the commander to use both weapons. A large array of turrets and fixed mounts are available to mount high explosive cannon ranging from 20 mm to 105 mm on to the M113 series, making them function as assault guns and fire support; while in many cases still having room inside to carry dismounted infantry or cavalry scouts.

===Armor===
The M113 is built of 5083 aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. Aluminum alloy is lighter than steel but requires around three times the thickness for an equivalent level of ballistic protection, meaning the armor of the M113 was only designed for 7.62 mm and shell splinter protection. All variants of the M113 are capable of mounting anti-landmine applique armor. The M113A3 was upgraded with internal spall liners and armored fuel tanks. In comparison, a modern APC such as the Stryker has all-around 7.62 mm armor-piercing protection, plus 14.5 mm protection on the front, sides, and rear, and a protection against antipersonnel mines.

===Mobility===
Its weight allows the use of a relatively small engine to power the vehicle, a Detroit 6V53 V6 two-stroke diesel engine of with an Allison TX-100-1 three-speed automatic transmission. This allows the vehicle to carry a large payload cross-country and to be transported by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. Original production M113s can swim without deploying flotation curtains, using only a front-mounted trim vane; they are propelled in the water by their tracks.

==Operational history==
===Vietnam===

The Vietnam War was the first combat opportunity for mechanized infantry, a technically new type of infantry with its roots in the armored infantry of World War II, now using the M113 armored personnel carrier. In addition, armored cavalry squadrons in Vietnam consisted largely of M113s, after replacing the intended M114 in a variety of roles, and armor battalions contained M113s within their headquarters companies, such as the maintenance section, medical section, vehicle recovery section, mortar section, and the scout (reconnaissance) section. United States Army mechanized infantry units in Vietnam were fully equipped with the M113 APC/ACAV, which consisted of one headquarters company and three line companies, normally with an authorized strength of approximately 900 men. Ten U.S. mechanized infantry battalions were deployed to Vietnam from 1965 until their departure in 1972.

====Company D, 16th Armor====
Company D, 16th Armor, 173rd Airborne Brigade, was the first U.S. Army armor unit deployed to Vietnam. It originally consisted of three platoons of M113s and a platoon of 90 mm M56 Scorpion self-propelled anti-tank guns (SPAT). It was the only independent armor company in the history of the U.S. Army. Upon the company&#x27;s arrival in Vietnam, a fourth line platoon was added; this was equipped with M106 4.2 in. mortar carriers (modified M113s).

The mortar platoon often operated with Brigade infantry units to provide indirect fire support. It also deployed at times as a dismounted infantry unit. The remaining SPATS platoon was reequipped with M113s in late 1966 and the mortar platoon was deactivated in early 1967. From early 1967, D/16th had three line platoons equipped with M113s and eventually, its diesel version, the M113A1. It was also standardized in late 1968 with three machine guns per track, one M2 .50 caliber and two M60 machine guns mounted on each side.

====General usage in combat====
The M113s were instrumental in conducting reconnaissance in force (RIFs), search and destroy missions, and large invasions (incursions) such as the U.S. invasion of Cambodia on 1 May 1970 and later Laos (Operation Lam Son 719) in 1971; all of which used the M113 as the primary workhorse for moving the ground armies. While operating with cavalry and armor units, the M113s often worked in conjunction with U.S. M48 Patton and M551 Sheridan tanks. During the Vietnam War, U.S. Army gun trucks, along with V-100 armored cars, conducted convoy escorts for military traffic.

The USAF used M113 and M113A1 ACAV vehicles in USAF security police squadrons, which provided air base ground defense support in Vietnam. Also, M113s were supplied to the ARVN. One notable ARVN unit equipped with the M113 APC, the 3d Armored Cavalry Squadron, earned the Presidential Unit Citation. Additional M113s were supplied to the Cambodian Khmer National Armed Forces, equipped with a turret for the machine gun and a M40 recoilless rifle mounted on the roof.

The ARVN also used M113 armored personnel carriers. In 1975, 1381 ARVN M113s were destroyed and captured. Losses in other years are unknown.

The Australian Army also used the M113 in Vietnam. After initial experiences showed that the crew commander was too vulnerable to fire, the Australians tried a number of different gun shields and turrets, eventually standardizing with the Cadillac-Gage T-50 turret fitted with two .30 cal Browning machine guns, or a single .30-single .50 combination. Other turrets were tried as were various gun shields, the main design of which was similar to the gun shield used on the U.S. M113 ACAV version.

In addition, the Australians operated an M113 variant fitted with a Saladin armored car turret, with a 76 mm gun as a fire support vehicle, or FSV, for infantry fire support. This has now also been removed from service.

Subsequent to Vietnam all Australian M113 troop carriers were fitted with the T50 turret. The FSV was eventually phased out and replaced with a modernized version known as an &quot;MRV&quot; (medium reconnaissance vehicle). The MRV featured a Scorpion turret with 76 mm gun, improved fire control, and passive night vision equipment.

Regiments using the M113 included former Citizens&#x27; Military Forces (CMF) units like the 4/19th Prince of Wales Light Horse Regiment (armoured reconnaissance) and Regular units such as 2ns Cavalry Regiment (armoured reconnaissance) and 3/4th Cavalry Regiment (APC Regiment). An Armoured Reconnaissance Troop consisted of Alpha Track – Charlie Track (M113 LRV) Bravo – Delta Track (M113 MRV) Echo Track (M113 APC) with Assault Section (armoured infantry) later known as Scouts...
:Light reconnaissance vehicle (LRV) – 50/30 cal MG in Cadillac-Gage T-50 turret
:Armoured personnel carrier (APC) – 30/30 cal MG in Cadillac-Gage T-50 turret
:Medium reconnaissance vehicle (MRV) – Saladin turret (later Scorpion turret) – formerly known as a fire support vehicle

=== Israel ===
The IDF are the second largest user of the M113 after the United States, with over 6000 of the vehicles in service.

In 1967 some Jordanian M113 were captured in the West Bank during the Six-Day War and were integrated into the Israeli Army. In 1970 Israel started to receive M113A1 to replace the antiquated half-tracks. The IDF M113s were armed with M2 HB machine guns, and two MAG 7.62 mm machine guns on either side of the upper crew compartment door.

The M113 took part in the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, when the IDF was equipped with 448 M113s that saw action on the Sinai and Golan fronts. They proved inadequate for direct fighting due to their poor armor protection. In the Battle of Buq&#x27;atta most of the 7th Recon Company was wiped out while trying to assault Syrian commandos with their M113s.

They were used by the IDF in the 1978 South Lebanon conflict. In the 1982 Lebanon War, they saw heavy action. PLO ambushes with RPGs caused extensive casualties because of the tendency of the M113&#x27;s aluminum armor to catch on fire after being hit by anti-tank weapons. Israeli infantrymen being ferried by M113s learned to quickly dismount and fight on foot when engaged.

By the time of the Siege of Beirut, M113s were only used to carry supplies to the front line, always stopping at least 100 meters from enemy lines. M113s were subsequently used by both the IDF and the South Lebanon Army during the South Lebanon conflict.

The IDF utilized M113s during the First Intifada and the Second Intifada. In May 2004, two fully laden IDF M113s were destroyed by IEDs in the Gaza Strip, killing 11 soldiers, all those inside the vehicles on both occasions. This became known in Israel as the &quot;APC disaster&quot;. The vulnerability of the M113 armored personnel carrier to IEDs and RPGs led the IDF to later begin to develop the Namer APC. M113s were used again in the 2006 Lebanon War and Operation Cast Lead.

In 2014, during the first wave of the IDF&#x27;s ground incursion into Gaza in Operation Protective Edge, a Hamas RPG-29 destroyed a fully loaded M113 in Gaza during the Battle of Shuja&#x27;iyya, killing all seven Golani Brigade soldiers inside the vehicle. As a result, the IDF faced calls from the Israeli public to build more Namer APCs over the next decade and to gradually reduce the number of M113s used in its future combat operations. A group of 30 Israeli reserve soldiers subsequently notified their commanders that they would refuse to enter the Gaza Strip in M113s. 

M113s were fielded in Palestine and Lebanon during the Israel–Hamas war. On 15 June 2024, eight soldiers were killed, possibly due to a detonation of the explosives carried on the exterior of their M113. On 24 June 2024, Al-Qassam Brigades published footage of its forces attacking an M113 using a Chinese HJ-8 ATGM, hitting the vehicle, caused an external fire on the carry-on CARPET demining system.

Several disabled Zelda APCs in Nabatieh, Lebanon and Gaza have revealed VBIED use by the IDF, where the vehicles are filled with explosives, towed to their target, and detonated. An unknown number of M113s were converted into Unmanned Ground Vehicles and were observed to be acting as VBIEDs in Rafah. In November 2024 IAI showed videos of unmanned M113 units working with unmanned D9 bulldozers in what appeared to be Gaza as an example of its new teaming system for robotic units.

The Israel Defense Forces still operates large numbers of the M113, maintaining a fleet of 6,000 of the vehicles. On numerous occasions since their introduction in the late 1960s, the IDF&#x27;s M113s have proven vulnerable to modern anti-tank missiles, IEDs, and RPGs, resulting in the deaths of many Israeli soldiers riding inside the vehicles. The IDF has nonetheless been unable to replace the use of them in combat operations, due to budget constraints in equipping its large mechanized infantry regiments.

Israel is prototyping the Eitan (Hebrew for steadfast), an eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicle to replace their M113s. Designed to serve alongside the tracked Namer, the Eitan is planned to be cheaper and lighter, at 35 tons, incorporating an active protection system and a turret. They are expected to begin replacing the M113 starting in 2020. However, due to the slow rate of production of replacement APCs, the IDF is expected to be dependent on the M113 well into the 2020s. The IDF has also increased production of Namer APCs to replace the M113.

===Law enforcement===
In the United States, M113s have been adopted by numerous law enforcement agencies. An M113 belonging to the Midland County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was used in the 2008 raid of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints compound.

The Brazilian Marine Corps&#x27;s M113s were used in joint operations with Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais during the 2010 raid on Complexo do Alemão.

===Ukraine===

M113s were sent by the United States and several Western world countries to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War. They are currently being used by Ukrainian forces alongside other combat vehicles donated to Ukraine.

==U.S. Army replacement plans==

The U.S. Army stopped buying M113s in 2007, with 6,000 vehicles remaining in the inventory.

The M113 will be replaced in U.S. Army service by the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program. 2,897 AMPVs, configured for five mission roles, are set to replace M113s at the brigade level and below within armored brigade combat teams. However, the AMPV program is not developing a vehicle to replace the M113 in supporting echelons above brigade level; this vehicle will have different requirements.

BAE Systems proposed a turretless variant of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle as the AMPV. In December 2014, the U.S. Army selected BAE proposal, the only proposal it received, to replace over 2,800 M113s in service.

, five variants of the AMPV are planned: M1283 General Purpose (522 planned), M1284 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (790 planned), M1285 Medical Treatment Vehicle (216 planned) and M1286 Mission Command (993 planned).

The AMPVs are to be produced at a rate of around 180 vehicles per year, enough to equip 1.3 armored brigades. With 12 brigades to modernize, the M113 is not planned to be entirely replaced in armored brigades until the late 2020s. With studies on what vehicle to replace M113s with in rear-echelon units ongoing, the M113 is not likely to be phased out of U.S. Army service until after 2030, over 70 years after entering service.

==Basic variants==
;M113
Original version, powered by Chrysler 75M V8 gasoline engine.

;M113A1
Starting in 1964, the gasoline engine was replaced with a 6V-53 Detroit Diesel engine, to take advantage of the better fuel economy and the reduced fire hazard of the diesel engine. The suffix A1 was used on all variants to denote a diesel engine, i.e. an M106A1 was an M106 mortar carrier equipped with a diesel engine.

;M113A2
In 1979, further upgrades were introduced. Engine cooling was improved by switching the locations of the fan and radiator. Higher-strength torsion bars increased ground clearance, and shock absorbers reduced the effects of ground strikes. The weight of the M113A2 was increased to . Because the added weight affected its freeboard when afloat, it was no longer required to be amphibious. Four-tube smoke grenade launchers were also added. The suffix A2 is used on all variants to denote upgrade to A2 standard.

;M113A3
In 1987, further improvements for &quot;enhanced (battlefield) survival&quot; were introduced. This included a yoke for steering instead of laterals, a brake pedal, a more powerful engine (the turbocharged 6V-53T Detroit Diesel), and internal spall liners for improved protection. Armored fuel tanks were added externally on both sides of the rear ramp, freeing up of internal space. The suffix A3 is used on all variants to denote upgrade to A3 standard.

A huge number of vehicles based on the running gear of the M113 have been created, ranging from APCs to tactical ballistic missile launchers. The M113 has become one of the most prolific armored vehicles of the second half of the 20th century, and continues to serve with armies around the world into the 21st century.

;M58 Wolf system
A smoke screen generator vehicle

;M106 mortar carrier

A mortar carrier armed with an M30 mortar 106.7 mm (4.2-inch, or &quot;Four-deuce&quot;) mounted on a turntable in the rear troop compartment. On this variant, the single hatch over the rear troop compartment was exchanged for a three-part circular hatch. The mortar could be fired from the vehicle, but could also be fired dismounted. Currently, the U.S. Army mortar carrier is the M106 upgraded to A3 standard and armed with an M121 120 mm mortar, a variant of the M120 mortar.

;M1064 mortar carrier
Armed with an M121 120 mm mortar, a variant of the M120 mortar.

;M125
Mortar carrier, basically an M106 armed with an M29 81 mm mortar.

;M132 armored flamethrower
Variant equipped with a turret armed with a flamethrower and a .50 caliber machine gun. These vehicles are no longer used by the U.S. Army. Vehicles upgraded to A1 standard were known as &quot;M132A1s&quot;.
;M150
Anti-tank variant equipped with a TOW ATGM launcher.

;M163 VADS
Self-propelled variant of the M167 VADS short-range air-defense system, mounting an M61 Vulcan cannon with a radar rangefinder and 2,100 rounds of ammunition on a modified M113 chassis (M741 carrier).

;M48 Chaparral
Anti-aircraft variant equipped with a launcher armed with four MIM-72A/M48 Chaparral missiles.

;M548
Unarmored cargo carrier equipped with a rear cargo bed.


;M577 command post carrier
Command variant, the roof over the rear troop compartment is higher. The vehicle also carries additional radios and a generator. A variant of this is the M1068 standard integrated command post system carrier, equipped with the newest U.S. Army automated command and control system.

;M579
A fitter and repair vehicle equipped with a crane. This vehicle was not taken into U.S. Army service.

;M806
Repair and recovery vehicle equipped with an internal winch and two earth anchors mounted on the rear hull.

;M901 ITV (improved TOW vehicle)
Equipped with a launcher armed with two TOW missiles.

;M113 &quot;MBT&quot; (NTC)
A variant of the M113 fitted with a modified Bradley turret as part of a vismod package specifically for training. This version also features MILES gear, a MGSS/TWGSS system, and fake ERA around the turret.

;M113 &quot;C&amp;R&quot; (command and reconnaissance)
A lowered and shortened version of the M113 developed for the Netherlands. It was used for reconnaissance duties with cavalry battalions and armored engineer companies. It had four road wheels on either side. The engine was moved to the rear of the vehicle although the drive sprockets were maintained at the front. Armament was a 25 mm cannon in a remotely operated turret. Crew consisted of commander, driver and gunner. It has also been used by the Canadian Army as the Lynx reconnaissance vehicle.

;AIFV

A development of the M113A1 APC, upgraded with an enclosed turret and firing ports.

;Others
In 1994, a stretched version of the M113 was presented by its manufacturer, also known as Mobile Tactical Vehicle Light (MTVL). Its hull is lengthened by 34 inches and equipped with an additional road wheel (six on each side) to sustain the added dry weight and payload. The vehicle was developed as a &quot;production-tooled demonstrator&quot; with private-industry funding from United Defense. United Defense LP proposed the MTVL for the Interim Armored Vehicle program in 2000. Although the U.S. Army did not buy it, it was acquired by other nations, and is copied today by Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt in their local plants. Some nations, like Canada and Australia, also stretched existing M113 hulls.

The Army plans to convert four M113s into unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) by late 2019 to serve in experimentation roles to test unmanned movement and combat concepts prior to the fielding of purpose-built robotic combat vehicles, planned by 2028.

;M113 copies
Several countries acquired M113s and later copied the design and proceeded to produce clones or evolved models (post-M113A3-standard) in their own indigenous factories. Pakistan produces an armored personnel carrier known as Talha which has a number of mechanical and automotive parts in common with the M113. Turkey produces the ACV-300 based on the AIFV. Egypt produces many variants of the M113 including the Egyptian Infantry Fighting Vehicle (EIFV), which features a combination of an M113A3-base and the fully functional and stabilized two-man turret of the M2 Bradley. Iran is also producing its own M113s.
