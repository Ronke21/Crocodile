<text>Morecambe Football Club is a professional association football club based in Morecambe, Lancashire, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. 

The club was founded in 1920 and entered into the Lancashire Combination, where they would remain for the next 48 years, winning the league title on five occasions: 1924–25, 1961–62, 1962–63, 1966–67 and 1967–68. They joined the newly formed Northern Premier League in 1968 and went on to win the FA Trophy in 1974 and the Northern Premier League President&#x27;s Cup in 1992. Under the stewardship of Jim Harvey, a second-place finish in the 1994–95 Northern Premier League Premier Division season saw them promoted into the Conference. Having been beaten in the 2003 and 2006 play-off semi-finals, Sammy McIlroy led the club to promotion into the Football League with victory in the 2007 play-off final. They finished in the top ten of League Two twice, reaching the play-off semi-finals after fourth-place finishes in 2009–10 and 2020–21; in the latter season they reached the 2021 League Two play-off final and achieved a first promotion to League One. They competed in the third tier for two seasons, before being relegated in 2023, amid financial troubles.

Nicknamed &quot;The Shrimps&quot; due to the coastal town&#x27;s local speciality food, the club have played home games at the Mazuma Mobile Stadium since moving from their original home at Christie Park in 2010. The club contests rivalries with nearby Accrington Stanley and formerly with non-League neighbours Lancaster City of the same council area, along with other Lancashire clubs.

==History==
=== 1920–2007: Non-League ===
Football in the town dates back to the turn of the 20th century; however, it was not until 7 May 1920 that Morecambe FC was formed after a meeting at the local West View Hotel. The club then took its place in the Lancashire Combination League for the 1920–21 season.

Sharing grounds with Morecambe Cricket Club at Woodhill Lane during the first season, football proved popular, with crowds in excess of 3,000 for derby fixtures with Lancaster City and Fleetwood Town. Although success on the field was hard to come by, with the club languishing near the bottom of the table, at the end of the first season the club moved grounds to Roseberry Park. A few years later after the purchase of the ground by the then-President, J.B. Christie, the ground&#x27;s name was changed to Christie Park in his honour. Those early seasons proved difficult, and it was not until 1924–25 that the club began to enjoy some success, claiming the league title for the first time; this was later followed by success in the Lancashire Junior Cup, beating old rivals Chorley after two replays, and in front of over 30,000 spectators.

Christie bequeathed the ground to the club in 1927 and also helped incorporate the club into a Limited Company with a then share capital of £1,000. The rest of the 1920s and the whole of the 1930s saw a constant struggle to keep football alive on the North West coast, with poor results on the field and little or no revenue off the field.

The post-war era saw an upturn in the Shrimps&#x27; fortunes with steady progress throughout the late 1940s and nearly all the 1950s, with a visible marked improvement when in 1956 Ken Horton was appointed player-manager. Whilst success was only just around the corner, the foundations for the future were being built. The Auxiliary Supporters club had been formed and with their help many ground improvements were undertaken, so that the on-field success dovetailed neatly with the off-field enterprise. Morecambe enjoyed success during the fourteen years from 1960. This included an FA Cup third round appearance in 1961–62, a 1–0 defeat to Weymouth; a Lancashire Senior Cup final victory in 1968, a 2–1 win over Burnley; and an FA Trophy success at Wembley in 1974, a 2–1 win over Dartford in the final.

The next 12 years were as barren as any previous period in the club&#x27;s history. Attendances fell from a creditable 2,000 plus to a miserable 200 minus, with a visible decline in the club fortunes during that period. However, in 1985–86, signs of improvement appeared; the club&#x27;s league position improved, and success in cups came as well over the next few years. It took ten years for the club to reach its ambition of promotion to the Football Conference after many further improvements, not only to the ground but also to the club&#x27;s structure.

Since elevation to the Conference in season 1995–96, the Shrimps achieved status as one of the leading teams in the league. In fact, only Woking had a longer unbroken membership of the league at this time. The runners-up spot was claimed on one occasion and the play-off positions were narrowly missed twice. Also during this time, the club equalled its best appearance in the FA Cup in both 2000–01 and 2002–03. On both occasions the club faced Ipswich Town, losing 3–0 and 4–0 respectively. Morecambe also defeated a few league clubs in the FA Cup, including Cambridge United in 2000–01 and Chesterfield in 2002–03.

In November 2005, Jim Harvey suffered a heart attack during a league game at Christie Park against Cambridge United. The club quickly declared the appointment of a caretaker manager, Sammy McIlroy, a long-time friend of Harvey. After McIlroy&#x27;s initial three-month stint as caretaker expired, he was given the job for the remainder of the season with Harvey expected to return on its closure. However, on his first day back as manager of Morecambe, Harvey was sacked by the club and McIlroy was appointed as permanent manager.

In the absence of Harvey, Morecambe reached the Conference play-offs. They lost to Hereford 4–3 on aggregate, but McIlroy was appointed on a permanent basis in May 2006. The following season, Morecambe were promoted to the Football League for the first time in their history after winning the Conference play-off final, beating Exeter City 2–1 at Wembley on 20 May 2007, in front of over 40,000 fans which followed their semi-final victory over York City.

===Football League (2007–present)===
On 17 July 2007, Morecambe announced plans to move to a new stadium by the start of the 2009–10 season. However, work did not start on the proposed site until spring 2009, with completion anticipated in summer 2010.

Morecambe played their first Football League game against Barnet at Christie Park on 11 August 2007, earning a 0–0 draw. On 14 August 2007, Morecambe played their first League Cup tie, winning 2–1 against near neighbours Preston North End at Deepdale. The Shrimps then beat another Championship side, winning 3–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 28 August. In the third round, they faced a third consecutive Championship side, Sheffield United, but lost 5–0. They finished their first League Two season in 11th place with 60 points. They also finished 11th in the 2008–09 season, with 63 points.

The 2009–10 season was Morecambe&#x27;s last at Christie Park, and they finished in fourth place, qualifying for the play-offs, but lost 7–2 on aggregate to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge. On 10 August 2010, Morecambe played their first match at the Globe Arena against Championship side Coventry City in the League Cup. Morecambe won 2–0, with Andy Fleming scoring the first two goals at the stadium.. After the club finished the 2010–11 season in 20th place, Morecambe manager Sammy McIlroy left the club by mutual consent on 9 May 2011, after five years.

On 13 May 2011, Jim Bentley signed a two-year deal as player-manager. After a promising start to the 2011–12 season, a poor end to the season led to Morecambe finishing 15th in League Two. In Bentley&#x27;s second season they finished 16th. Bentley signed a two-year contract extension in October 2013, and two further extensions in August 2015 and October 2017. Over this period, Morecambe retained their League status with 18th, 11th, 21st, 18th, 22nd and 18th finishing positions. 

==== 2019–present: A League One spell, financial problems ====
Bentley left the club in October 2019 to become the AFC Fylde manager, having spent 16 months as the then longest serving manager in the top four tiers of English football. In November 2019, Morecambe appointed Derek Adams as manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract. The remainder of the season, shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the Shrimps finish 22nd after 37 games played, again avoiding relegation.

The 2020–21 season proved to be a banner year. The club faced two Premier League sides in two cup competitions, falling to Newcastle United in the third round of the EFL Cup and to Chelsea in the third round of the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge; the latter equalled their furthest run in the FA Cup since the early 2000s. In the league, the club qualified in fourth place for the League Two play-offs with 78 points, missing automatic promotion by one point. Following a 3–2 aggregate win over Tranmere Rovers in the semi-final, the club reached a first League play-off final. In the 2021 League Two play-off final against Newport County at Wembley Stadium on 31 May 2021, Morecambe won 1–0, after Carlos Mendes Gomes converted a penalty in the 107th minute. This earned the Shrimps promotion to League One, the third tier of English football, for the first time in their history. Adams resigned three days later &quot;to pursue an opportunity elsewhere&quot; as manager of Bradford City.

In June 2021, the club announced that former Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson would be manager for the club&#x27;s first season in League One. Their first game was a 2–2 draw at Ipswich Town. The club once again reached the FA Cup third round, and faced another London-based Premier League side, Tottenham Hotspur. After scoring the first goal, Morecambe were undone in the last 15 minutes by goals from Harry Kane, Lucas Moura and Harry Winks to lose 3–1 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. After 32 games, Robinson left to take over at Scottish club St Mirren. Goalkeeping coach Barry Roche served a game as caretaker manager before Adams returned as manager on a deal to June 2023. Despite the club flirting with relegation, Adams led them out of the drop zone to finish 19th and retain League One status for a second season.

In October 2022, Adams voiced worries about the future of the club. Its owners, Bond Group Investments, had put the club up for sale in September 2022, with directors Jason Whittingham and Colin Goldring (both associated with the collapse of Worcester Warriors rugby union club) stepping down from the Shrimps&#x27; board. In March 2023, players&#x27; wages were paid late, with funds invested by Sarbjot Johal, who was aiming to take over the club, ultimately bridging the gap. However, uncertainty about the club&#x27;s ownership continued into June 2023; Johal was also involved in negotiations to buy Wigan Athletic and had not provided proof of sufficient funding.

In May 2023, Morecambe were relegated to League Two after a defeat by Exeter City. The Shrimps then confirmed 14 players would be leaving upon the expiry of their contracts, with no players offered new deals. In August 2023, Morecambe received a suspended three-point deduction for paying its players late in March. In December 2023, Morecambe and owner Jason Whittingham were charged by the EFL for failing to adhere to an agreed process regarding players&#x27; wages, and in April 2024, the three-point deduction was activated and Whittingham was fined £10,000. The club finished the 2023–24 season in 15th place.

On 30 April 2024, after succeeding Derek Adams as manager in November 2023, Ged Brannan left the financially troubled club to join League Two rivals Accrington Stanley. Manager-less, with chief executive Ben Sadler joining Walsall, and with only one player (striker Charlie Brown) under contract for the next season due to an ongoing transfer embargo, the club was described as &quot;a circus&quot; by its chairman Rod Taylor on 8 May 2024. On 20 May 2024, Morecambe announced the departure of 16 players at the end of the season, leaving the club with a five-strong first-team squad. The following day, club directors called on Whittingham to sell the club to avoid a &#x27;catastrophic outcome&#x27;. Derek Adams returned for a third spell as Morecambe manager in early June 2024, when Whittingham said the club was talking to four potential buyers. In early July 2024, talks over a possible buyout of the club were reported to be at &quot;an advanced stage&quot;, the transfer embargo was lifted (though Morecambe were fined £5,131.82 for failing to meet payment obligations) and Morecambe signed 15 players.

On 19 December 2024, the club received a suspended two-points deduction for failing to report on five separate occasions the non-payment of accounts owed to HM Revenue and Customs. On 23 January 2025, Morecambe - 23rd in League Two and five points from safety - insisted the club was &quot;not in immediate jeopardy&quot; despite having no proof of funds for the rest of the season and being unable to sign players in the transfer window. However, Morecambe later secured funds to sign players. Whittingham said &quot;With every fibre in my body ... I can&#x27;t wait to get out of Morecambe. ... I no longer want to be the owner of the club&quot;.

<text>Shrewsbury Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. The team competes in League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1886, the club were inaugural members of the Shropshire &amp; District League in 1890 and then joined the Birmingham &amp; District League five years later. Crowned champions in 1922–23, they switched to the Midland League in 1937 and won the Midland League title in 1937–38, 1945–46 and 1947–48. Shrewsbury were admitted into the Football League in 1950 and won promotion out of the Fourth Division at the end of the 1958–59 season. They were promoted again in 1974–75 after being relegated the previous year, and went on to win the Third Division title in 1978–79. They returned to the fourth tier following relegations in 1989 and 1992, where they won another league title in 1993–94. The club lost in the 1996 Football League Trophy final and dropped into non-League football after suffering relegations in 1997 and 2003.

Shrewsbury immediately regained their Football League status after winning the 2004 Conference play-off final. They subsequently lost League Two play-off finals in 2007 and 2009 before they won automatic promotion in 2011–12 and again in 2014–15 after relegation in the previous season. They finished as runners-up in the 2018 EFL Trophy final and 2018 League One play-off final.

The club plays its home games at New Meadow, having moved from the Gay Meadow in 2007. They have won the Shropshire Senior Cup a record 67 times and are the only club from the county to ever play in the Football League.

==History==
===Early history===
The first club in the town was the Shrewsbury Football Club, founded in 1868, which in the 1877–78 football season won both the Birmingham Senior Cup and Shropshire Senior Cup, and was captained by John Hawley Edwards. It disbanded in around 1880.

The present Shrewsbury Town were formed in 1886, following the demise of first Shropshire Wanderers and later indirectly Castle Blues. Press reports differ as to the exact date the new club was formed, The &quot;Eddowes Shropshire Journal&quot; of 26 May 1886 reported the birth of the club at The Lion Hotel, Wyle Cop, Shrewsbury. The &quot;Shrewsbury Chronicle&quot; reported the club being formed at the Turf Hotel, Claremont Hill, Shrewsbury. It may be both accounts are true, with a get-together at The Lion being finalised at the Turf.

After friendlies and regional cup competitions for the first few seasons, Shrewsbury were founder members of the Shropshire &amp; District League in 1890–91, later admitted to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1895–96. Many of the teams Town faced in the early days have vanished, however Shrewsbury met many of today&#x27;s Football League and Conference teams, including Crewe Alexandra, Coventry City, Stoke City, Kidderminster Harriers and Stafford Rangers.

In 1910, Shrewsbury looked to move to a new ground, having spent early years at locations across the town, notably near Copthorne Barracks west of the town. The club moved to Gay Meadow on the edge of the town centre, within sight of Shrewsbury Abbey, and stayed 97 years.

Shrewsbury&#x27;s Birmingham League days were mostly mid-table, with a few seasons challenging near the top, the club being league champions in 1922–23.

A move to the Midland League in 1937–38 saw the club enjoy one of its most successful seasons, winning a league and cup treble. Shrewsbury were league champions, scoring 111 goals . In addition, the Welsh Cup was won following a replay, the team enjoyed a run in the FA Cup, and won the Shropshire Senior Cup.

After a run of good seasons in post-war years, Shrewsbury were admitted, alongside Scunthorpe United to the old Division 3 (North) of the Football League in 1950, after being Midland League champions in 1949–50, following the decision to expand from 88 to 92 clubs.

===Football League history===
Elevation to the football league in 1950 saw the club play one season in the Northern section of the third division, followed by a further seven in the Southern section, this before they became founder members of the newly formed fourth division in 1958–59, gaining immediate promotion as runners-up to Mansfield Town at the first attempt. Shrewsbury gained their first promotion, to the Third Division, in 1958–59. They remained in the third tier 15 years, slipping back to Division Four at the end of 1973–74.

1960–61 season saw Shrewsbury Town reach the Semi Final of the League Cup. After beating Everton in the quarter-finals, they narrowly lost over two legs 4–3 on aggregate to Rotherham United. This era was also remembered for Arthur Rowley. He arrived from Leicester City in 1958, the club&#x27;s first player/manager. During his playing and managerial career, he broke Dixie Dean&#x27;s goal-scoring record, scoring his 380th league goal against Bradford City at Valley Parade on 29 April 1961. Retiring from playing in 1965 he remained manager until July 1968.

Shrewsbury were promoted to the Third Division in 1974–75 as runners-up, before another successful season in 1978–79, when they were league champions under Ritchie Barker and later Graham Turner. Over 14,000 fans packed Gay Meadow on 17 May 1979 to see Shrewsbury seal promotion with a 4–1 win over Exeter City. In addition, the club beat First Division Manchester City 2–0 in an FA Cup run that saw them reach the quarter-finals for the first time, before they lost in a replay to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Turner is the team&#x27;s most successful manager, winning the Third Division Championship in 1978–79 – his first season in charge – to take the club into the Second Division for the first time. They remained in the division for ten years, although Turner departed for Aston Villa in 1984. Shrewsbury again reached the FA Cup quarter-finals in 1981–82, defeating the UEFA Cup holders Ipswich Town in the fifth round before losing 5–2 away to Leicester City.

The 1980s saw many big teams defeated by Shrewsbury, including Fulham, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United and Chelsea. Shrewsbury beat Middlesbrough 2–1 at Gay Meadow at the end of the 1985–86 season to relegate their opponents, who went out of business and almost out of existence. The match was marred by violence from Middlesbrough fans, with many of them later having to return to Shrewsbury for court appearances.

In the early to mid-1980s the club enjoyed its most successful Football League run. Shrewsbury survived through the sale of players, including Steve Ogrizovic, David Moyes, John McGinlay and Bernard McNally. They were relegated at the end of 1988–89 after ten years. In the Third Division, on 22 December 1990, Gary Shaw scored the quickest Town hat trick – 4 minutes and 32 seconds – against Bradford City at Valley Parade. At the end of 1991–92, three years after relegation to the Third Division, the club was relegated to the Fourth – the first time since 1975. However, two seasons later Shrewsbury won the new &quot;(fourth tier)&quot; Division Three championship under Fred Davies in 1993–94, and remained in Division Two &quot;(third tier)&quot; for three seasons.

The 1990s saw Shrewsbury make their first appearance at Wembley as finalists in the 1995–96 Football League Trophy final. They lost 2–1 to Rotherham United, with future Shrewsbury striker Nigel Jemson scoring both Rotherham goals. Shrewsbury remained a mid-table team before slipping down to the bottom division again at the end of 1996–97. Davies was sacked in May 1997 to make way for the former club captain Jake King to return to the club where he began his career, following a successful reign at local rivals Telford United.

===Relegation from the Football League===

In 1999–2000, Shrewsbury endured a poor season, and in mid-November 1999 King was sacked as the club neared relegation. The former Everton captain and Welsh international Kevin Ratcliffe joined from Chester City as manager and saved Shrewsbury from relegation on the final day of the season with a 2–1 victory away to Exeter City. The season was known as the &#x27;Great Escape&#x27;. Subsequently Town made steady progress with Luke Rodgers emerging as a regular goalscorer, and they narrowly missed the 2001–02 league play-offs after a final-day defeat to Luton Town.

The 2002–03 season saw Shrewsbury enjoy an FA Cup run. After dispatching non-league sides Stafford Rangers and Barrow, they hit the headlines when Nigel Jemson struck twice to beat Everton 2–1 at Gay Meadow in the third round in front of 7,800 spectators. Watched by a near-capacity crowd of 7,950, Town lost 4–0 in the fourth round to Chelsea in a match televised on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, with Gianfranco Zola scoring twice. The side&#x27;s form then disappeared, and they picked up just two further wins as they were relegated from the Football League after 53 years. Following angry demonstrations from fans, Ratcliffe resigned, and Mark Atkins took temporary charge for the club&#x27;s final League game, a 2–1 defeat to Scunthorpe United, who coincidentally had been Shrewsbury&#x27;s first League opponents in 1950.

The Northwich Victoria manager Jimmy Quinn was appointed Shrewsbury&#x27;s manager in May 2003. With most of the previous year&#x27;s players released, Quinn assembled a whole new squad, with experienced non-league players such as Darren Tinson and Jake Sedgemore joined by Colin Cramb, Scott Howie and former League Cup finalist Martin O&#x27;Connor. The league title went to Chester City, but with 74 points, Shrewsbury finished third and defeated Barnet on penalties in the play-off semi-finals to set up a final against Aldershot Town, at Stoke City&#x27;s Britannia Stadium. After a 1–1 draw, Shrewsbury&#x27;s goalkeeper Scott Howie saved three consecutive Aldershot penalties in another penalty shoot-out, and the defender Trevor Challis scored the winning kick.

===Return to the Football League===
Quinn departed 14 league games into the 2004–05 season, and was replaced by the former Preston North End manager Gary Peters, who preserved Shrewsbury&#x27;s Football League status in League Two. Meanwhile, the club had unearthed two talented local players in Joe Hart and David Edwards, who both went on to become experienced internationals.

Despite the departure of their goalkeeper Hart to Manchester City, Shrewsbury went on a 14-match unbeaten run in the 2006–07 season. Following a 2–2 draw against Grimsby Town in the final League match to be held at Gay Meadow, they finished in seventh place to qualify for the play-offs, where they defeated Milton Keynes Dons in the semi-finals. The team lost to Bristol Rovers in the final on 26 May 2007 at the new Wembley Stadium in front of a record crowd for any fourth-tier game of 61,589.

The club chairman Roland Wycherley had cut the first sod of soil at Shrewsbury&#x27;s New Meadow ground in the summer of 2006 and club moved permanently for the 2007–08 season. Peters left the club on 3 March 2008 by mutual consent, and his replacement, Paul Simpson, led the club to an 18th-place finish in the league. After the season, the kit manufacturer Prostar earned the naming rights of the stadium.

The 2008–09 season saw Shrewsbury reach the play-offs again, after they beat Dagenham and Redbridge on the final day of the season. They beat Bury 4–3 on penalties in the semi-finals, with Luke Daniels making two saves to send Shrewsbury through, but lost 1–0 to Gillingham in the play-off final, with a goal in the 90th minute by Gillingham&#x27;s Simeon Jackson. On 30 April 2010, after a disappointing 2009–10 season, Simpson was dismissed with two games remaining.

Graham Turner returned to Shrewsbury Town as manager in June 2010. The club finished the 2010–11 season in fourth place, missing automatic promotion by one point. They lost 2–0 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final to Torquay United. In the 2011–12 season they finished second on 88 points, and beat Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 1–0 with a James Collins header in the penultimate game of the season to achieve promotion to League One after a 15-year absence. Shrewsbury also enjoyed a notable run in the League Cup, beating Derby County at Pride Park and Premier League Swansea City, before losing 3–1 to Arsenal after James Collins headed them in front at the Emirates Stadium.

Shrewsbury exceeded expectations in the 2012–13 season and sealed League One safety with two games to spare by beating Oldham Athletic 1–0, finishing 16th. The first half of the following season was disappointing, and Turner quit in January and relegation was confirmed after a 4–2 home defeat against Peterborough United.

===Recent history===

In May 2014 the ex-Fleetwood Town boss Micky Mellon was appointed manager. Town were promoted back to League One on 25 April 2015 with a 1–0 victory away to Cheltenham Town via Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro&#x27;s goal. Mellon left for Tranmere Rovers in October 2016, and was replaced by the Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst, with Shrewsbury bottom. In 2017–18, Hurst led Shrewsbury to the EFL Trophy Final, which they lost to Lincoln City. He also led the team to the League One play-offs, but they lost to Rotherham United after extra time. Hurst left to join Ipswich Town on 30 May 2018. He was replaced by former Macclesfield boss John Askey, who was sacked in November 2018 having won just five of their opening 21 games. His successor, Sam Ricketts was appointed manager in December.

A highlight of the 2019–20 season was a fourth round FA Cup tie against the European champions Liverpool, which Shrewsbury drew 2–2. Town narrowly lost the replay 1–0 at Anfield in front of an attendance of 52,399. However, following disruption to the season in March 2020 due to COVID-19, final League One standings were decided on a points per game basis with Shrewsbury finishing in 15th place. In November 2020, Ricketts was sacked with Shrewsbury in 23rd place and was replaced by Steve Cotterill. He helped Shrewsbury to a five-year high of 12th place in 2023, then stepped down in June 2023 and was replaced by Matt Taylor, who lasted less than seven months as manager. On 24 January 2024, the club confirmed the reappointment of Paul Hurst as head coach.

==Stadiums==
===Racecourse Ground===
The Racecourse Ground was used in Monkmoor between 1886 and 1889. Town&#x27;s first ground hosted 51 matches over 3 years. The majority of these were friendlies as Town were not members of any league. Their first game was a 5–2 victory over Wellington Town on 16 October 1886 at the Racecourse Ground.

===Ambler&#x27;s Field===
Copthorne 1889–1893
Town spent 4 seasons at Ambler&#x27;s Field, Copthorne between 1889 and 1893. Here they were founder members of the Shropshire and District League started in 1890. 22 February 1890 saw town&#x27;s record victory which was 18–0 against Wellington Town (Bowdler 8, Phasey 3, Rowlands 2 Gosson 3 Aston and Murphy). Town played 44 times at this ground.

===Sutton Lane===
Sutton Farm 1893–1895
Town played 47 times in 2 seasons at Sutton Lane, Sutton Farm and when they moved from here, they also moved up to the Birmingham League. This ground is now allotments.

===Barracks Ground===
Town played at Barracks Ground, Copthorne for 15 years, over 300 matches between 1895 and 1910 against more classier opposition of reserve teams like Aston Villa and Wolves. In 1909–10 they reached the first round of the FA Cup.

===Gay Meadow===

Shrewsbury played at Gay Meadow, Abbey Foregate between 1910 and 2007. For many years, Shrewsbury coracle maker Fred Davies achieved some notability amongst football fans, by a unique service he and his coracle provided. He would sit in his coracle during Shrewsbury Town home matches, and retrieve any stray footballs that went into the River Severn. Although Davies died long ago, his legend is still associated with the club.

===New Meadow===
A new stadium was opened in July 2007 on Oteley Road, Meole Brace. It features a 9,875 all-seater capacity in four separate stands for football.
Capacity for concerts at the stadium is 17,000.

The ground has conference facilities, a function area, snack bars, licensed bars, a club shop and a restaurant. Within the stadium confines are training facilities for the club and a 5-a-side football complex which is run The Shrewsbury Town Foundation.

The first match at the stadium was 4–0 win against A-line Allstars featuring Gianfranco Zola on 14 July 2007. The first league match was a 1–0 win against Bradford City with Dave Hibbert scoring the winner. Shrewsbury&#x27;s record victory at this ground is 7–0 against Gillingham on 13 September 2008 in League Two. The record attendance at New Meadow is 10,210 vs. Chelsea in the 2014–15 Football League Cup. The record league attendance at New Meadow was 9,510 for a League One tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2013.

The England under-18s, under-19s, under-20s, under-21s and England women&#x27;s senior team have all played at the stadium. The England Women&#x27;s team have played three matches at New Meadow. For sponsorship reasons, the stadium has been named The Croud Meadow since June 2023.

==Club colours ==

The club&#x27;s colours have always featured blue. However, blue has not always been the most dominant colour. Early kits included blue and white stripes, quartered shirts and all-blue shirts, which were worn with either white or amber trim until 1978. In 1978 Shrewsbury&#x27;s most famous kit was introduced – the blue and amber stripes, which they wore as they were promoted in successive seasons, up to the old second division (now the Football League Championship). This was the design worn by character Derek Smalls in the movie &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;.

The club was not loyal to the stripes for long, and in 1982 reverted to a blue shirt, then used a blue body with amber sleeves, later reverting to an amber body with blue sleeves. In 1987 the shirts radically changed to white shirts for four seasons before reverting to stripes in 1991–92. After a flamboyant abstract pattern on the shirts in 1992–93, Shrewsbury&#x27;s kits have stayed mostly blue, with amber stripe(s) of some description evident since 1999.

The shirt sponsors have, since their introduction in 1982 until 2017, all been local companies. As of the 2017–18 season, the current shirt sponsor is The Energy Check, a South Shields-based Energy management company.

==Club crest==
The first crest to appear on the shirt of Shrewsbury Town was the town&#x27;s coat of arms, The Loggerheads in 1907. The crest was used intermittently on shirts until 1960 through to 1970, when a generic football design was used. During this time, The Loggerheads continued to be used on other merchandise, such as match-day programmes. The Loggerheads returned in 1970, and in various guises continued to be used until 1986, when a &quot;Shrew&quot; cartoon was introduced as the club&#x27;s crest in an attempt to rebrand &quot;Salop&quot; as &quot;The Shrews&quot;. During this time, the club&#x27;s kit was also changed to predominantly white. A campaign by fanzine &quot;A Large Scotch&quot; eventually led to the return of The Loggerheads crest in 1992. The crest changed once in again in 2007 to coincide with Salop&#x27;s move to New Meadow, the new badge featured a single lion&#x27;s head in a circle. The club stated that the new badge was necessary as any design incorporating The Loggerheads could not be copyrighted.

== Kit suppliers ==
Over the years the club has had many different kit suppliers, the most recent being Umbro at the start of the 2021/22 season. It marked the return to the famous double diamond after the supplier manufactured the clubs kits during the most successful period in its history, which was from 1973 to 1982. From the start of the 2024/25 season, Oxen will become the clubs new technical kit supplier. 
==Supporters and rivalries==
The club has many supporters groups from different areas of the nationally and internationally, including locally throughout Shropshire, Wales, Scotland, London and internationally in Italy (where there is a team called Shrewsbury Town in a league in Milan). Most recently there is a large supporters group in Portland, Oregon where there are ties with the MLS side Portland Timbers. In 2019, a group named &quot;South Stand Flags&quot; was set up after the opening of New Meadow&#x27;s safe standing section in order to &quot;improve atmosphere at home games&quot;. The group, usually based in block 9 of the South Stand, organise choreography and flag displays. Their first fundraiser raised over £1000 which funded the purchase of 50 new flags. The group has gained of praise from players and managers, including the ex-Shrewsbury boss Sam Ricketts.

An unofficial fanzine and forum named &quot;Blue &amp; Amber&quot; was introduced in 2005.

In late 2019 the club started attracting fans from the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada. The support stemmed from the club having two Grenada internationals, Aaron Pierre and Omar Beckles, who helped the nation to a six-match unbeaten run in qualifying for the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The president of the Grenada Football Association, Cheney Joseph, adopted &quot;The Shrews&quot; as his team, stating &quot;I have fallen in love with Shrewsbury. I&#x27;m serious. I believe they can become a dream story, a Cinderella story&quot;. In November 2019, Joseph sent a partnership offer to the club, as well as a formal invitation for Town chairman Roland Wycherley to visit the country. On 9 November, Oliver Norburn became the third Town player to be called up by Grenada, whom he qualified for through his paternal grandfather. On 26 January 2020, Joseph made his first visit to his adopted club, where he witnessed &quot;The Shrews&quot; come back from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with Liverpool.

===Rivals===

The club maintains several rivalries. The rivalry with near-neighbours Hereford United was ranked nineteenth in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Twenty fiercest rivalries in English football&quot; in 2015. Known as the &#x27;A49 derby&#x27; due to the road that connects Shrewsbury with Hereford, it has not been played since Hereford United went out of business and reformed as Hereford FC, who now play in the National League North, three divisions below &quot;The Shrews&quot;. This is similar to the rivalry with the now defunct Chester City. In 2010, a new club was formed named Chester FC who, like Hereford, also compete in the National League North and are yet to meet Shrewsbury in any competition. Another rivalry for the Shrews is with Welsh club Wrexham. Following Wrexham&#x27;s relegation from the Football League in 2008, the fixture was not competed again until 2024 for an FA Cup match. The two sides also met in League One during the 2024–25 season.

The club&#x27;s other main rivals include Walsall, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Port Vale and Shropshire rivals AFC Telford United.

===Notable former players ===
====Record holders====
Mickey Brown holds the club record for most league appearances 418, accumulated during three spells. However Colin Griffin (footballer) holds the record number of total appearances with 497. Centre half turned centre forward Alf Wood scored 5 goals in the 7–1 victory against Blackburn Rovers in 1971 and became the first player since Dixie Dean to score four headed goals in one match.

====Famous names====

Several Shrewsbury players have gone onto, or came from prominent top-flight careers. These include current and former top-flight managers David Moyes, Nigel Pearson, Gordon Lee, David Pleat and Gary Megson. International stars John McGinlay, Jim Holton, Jimmy Quinn, Michael Gulla (American footballer), Jimmy McLoughlin, Mickey Thomas, Carl Robinson and Neville Southall all spent time at Shrewsbury. Doug Rougvie won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Aberdeen in 1983 and played for Shrewsbury later in the decade after a spell at Chelsea.

More recently, Premier League winner Mark Atkins spent later seasons of his career at Shrewsbury, as did Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s Nigel Jemson and former Nottingham Forest player Ian Woan. Coventry City stalwart Steve Ogrizovic was previously a Shrewsbury player. Two notable recent departees are local-born youth products, England goalkeeper Joe Hart and Wales midfielder David Edwards, both of whom have been capped at U21 and senior international levels. Edwards went on to play in the Premier League with Wolverhampton Wanderers and the Wales national team and returned to Shrewsbury in January 2019. Hart was a regular in the England senior team and is one of only two men to win every major domestic trophy in both England and Scotland.

====Local players ====
In addition to Hart and Edwards, Shrewsbury have given opportunities to many young local players, who have forged successful professional careers. Norman Hobson was a local Shrewsbury born defender in the mid to late 1950s and made 224 appearances. Bernard McNally was a local star in the 1980s, with two other local players, Kevin Seabury and Peter Wilding being fan favourites at the club in the 1990s. Veteran striker Andy Cooke was born and raised in Shrewsbury, and supported the club as a boy, but forged his career elsewhere after being rejected as a trainee. Tom Bradshaw is a recent Shrewsbury-born talent to have emerged from the Youth Team, and Mason Springthorpe signed for Everton prior to making an appearance for the Shrews, for £125,000.

====Cult heroes====
In 2004, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot; ran polls to determine club&#x27;s cult heroes, and Dean Spink was named as Shrewsbury&#x27;s cult hero, ahead of Steve Anthrobus and Austin Berkley.

== Foundation ==
The Shrewsbury Town FC Foundation is the club&#x27;s official charity that carries out community work in the local community and surrounding areas. The foundation helps provide opportunities to many people by offering many different programmes. These include health &amp; wellbeing, education, and employability. The foundation also provides football and participation opportunities which consists of walking football, disability football and soccer schools. It also runs the Shrewsbury Town development centres which provides advanced coaching to help progress players into academy football. Women&#x27;s football and a Girls Emerging Talent Centre is also organised and supported by the foundation.

<text>Stevenage Football Club (known as Stevenage Borough Football Club until 2010) is a professional association football club based in the town of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. The club competes in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system. They play their home games at The Lamex Stadium in Stevenage.

Founded in 1976 following the demise of the town&#x27;s former club, they joined the United Counties League in 1980 and enjoyed success in the club&#x27;s first year at senior status; winning the United Counties League Division One and the United Counties League Cup. Following three promotions in four seasons in the early 1990s, the club were promoted to the Conference National in 1994. Despite winning the league in the 1995–96 season, the club were denied promotion to the Football League due to insufficient ground facilities. Stevenage remained in the top tier of non-League for the following fourteen seasons, before the club earned promotion to the Football League after winning the Conference Premier in the 2009–10 season.

The promotion served as the catalyst for a rebranding of the club, dropping the word &#x27;Borough&#x27; from its title in June 2010. In their first season in the Football League, Stevenage won promotion to League One, the third tier of English football, via the play-offs. The club achieved their highest league finish during the 2011–12 season courtesy of a sixth-placed finish in League One. The core of the team that helped guide the club to its success throughout 2009 to 2012 departed, and Stevenage were relegated back into League Two at the end of the 2013–14 season.

The club has also enjoyed success in national cup competitions, becoming the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium in 2007, beating Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 to lift the FA Trophy in front of a competition record crowd of 53,262. They won the competition again in 2009. The club has also produced a number of notable results in the FA Cup against high-profile opposition.

==History==
===1976–2010===
Stevenage Borough was formed in 1976 following the bankruptcy of Stevenage Athletic. Chairman Keith Berners, and &quot;a number of like-minded volunteers&quot; were tasked with arranging a team to play Hitchin Town Youth at Broadhall Way in November 1976, as a &quot;curtain-raiser&quot; for the new club. However, the Broadhall Way pitch was subsequently dug up for non-footballing purposes after Stevenage Borough Council sold the land to a local businessman, who dug a trench across the full length of the pitch to ensure no football was played. Consequently, the new club started out playing in the Chiltern Youth league on a roped-off pitch at the town&#x27;s King George V playing fields, and moved up to intermediate status, joining the Wallspan Southern Combination shortly after. Stevenage Borough Council granted consent for the club to incorporate the name &quot;Borough&quot; in their title and to adopt the town&#x27;s civic emblem as the club badge. In 1980, the council reacquired the lease for Broadhall Way and allowed the football club to become its tenant. With the council as their landlords and a refurbished stadium, Stevenage Borough took on senior status, under the management of Derek Montgomery, and joined the United Counties Football League in the same year. The club&#x27;s first competitive league match was a 3–1 victory against ON Chenecks on 16 August 1980, played in front of 421 people. In their first season as a senior club, the team won the United Counties League Division One championship, scoring over a hundred goals. The club also won the United Counties League Cup during the same season.

After three successive seasons in the United Counties Premier Division, the club joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League in 1984, and the following season earned promotion to Isthmian League Division One after finishing the season as champions. Two years later, the club were relegated back to the Division Two North, having finished second bottom of the division. Brian Williams was tasked with steadying the club following the relegation; appointed as manager in July 1988. He spent two full seasons in charge, guiding Stevenage to two fourth-place finishes. Paul Fairclough was appointed as the club&#x27;s manager in June 1990 and he would ultimately guide the team to four league titles in eight years. The club won promotion during the 1990–91 season, Fairclough&#x27;s first season in charge, winning 34 of their 42 games. The league triumph included winning every match played at home, scoring 122 goals and amassing 107 points. The following season, Stevenage won the Isthmian League Division One title, remaining unbeaten at home for the second consecutive season, and were promoted to the Isthmian League Premier Division. A third promotion in four years followed at the end of the 1993–94 season, as Stevenage were promoted to the Football Conference after winning the Isthmian League Premier Division. Two seasons later, Stevenage won the Conference, but were denied promotion to the Football League, due to insufficient ground facilities, thus reprieving Torquay United, who had finished in last place of Division Three. During the same season, the club reached the First Round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 2–1 to Hereford United of the Third Division at Edgar Street.

 The 1996–97 season saw the club progress to the Third Round of the FA Cup for the first time after a 2–1 victory against Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road. They were drawn against Birmingham City at Broadhall Way, but ground issues saw the tie switched to St Andrew&#x27;s; Birmingham won the match 2–0. The following season, the club reached the Fourth Round where they drew Premier League club Newcastle United at Broadhall Way. A temporary stand was erected behind the South Stand, allocated to the Newcastle supporters, which increased the stadium capacity to 9,000, enough to satisfy The FA. Stevenage held Newcastle to a 1–1 draw, with Giuliano Grazioli equalising after Alan Shearer had given Newcastle an early lead. Stevenage lost 2–1 in the replay at St James&#x27; Park, a goal from Alan Shearer that &quot;appeared to not cross the line&quot; proved the difference. Despite earning a large amount of revenue from the two respective cup runs, news emerged that the club were in financial difficulties and that the chairman, Victor Green, was going to close the club down if no buyer was found. Phil Wallace purchased the club and set about rebuilding the finances and the relationship with the local council.

During the 2001–02 season, the club reached the FA Trophy final for the first time, losing 2–0 to Yeovil Town at Villa Park. The following season, Stevenage were positioned in last place of the Conference National in January, seven points from safety. The club appointed Graham Westley as manager in January 2003. Westley guided the club to 12th position, winning eight games out of a possible 12 in the league. During the 2004–05 season, Stevenage made the play–offs after finishing fifth under the guidance of Westley. The team lost 1–0 to Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium in the play-off final. The following year, the team finished sixth, outside of the play-off places, and Westley&#x27;s contract was not renewed, ending his three-and-a-half-year spell as manager. The club appointed Mark Stimson as their new manager and the team finished in eighth position in Stimson&#x27;s first season as manager. That season, the club reached the FA Trophy final again, where they came back from 2–0 down to beat Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 in front of a record FA Trophy crowd of 53,262. The victory meant that Stevenage were the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium.
After the FA Trophy success in 2007, as well as keeping the majority of the first-team at the club, Stevenage started the 2007–08 season by breaking a new club record when the defence kept eight consecutive clean sheets. Stimson was offered a new contract by Stevenage in October 2007, but resigned the following day and subsequently joined Football League club Gillingham. In November 2007, he was replaced by Peter Taylor. After failing to make the play-offs, Taylor resigned at the end of the season and was replaced by former manager Graham Westley. On Westley&#x27;s return, Stevenage started the season slowly before going on a 27–game unbeaten run from December to March and reached the play-offs, where they lost in the semi-finals to Cambridge United, 4–3 on aggregate. During the same season, Stevenage enjoyed success in cup competitions; winning the Herts Senior Cup for the first time, beating Cheshunt 2–1 in the final, and the FA Trophy, where they beat York City 2–0 in the final.

The following season, Westley retained the majority of the squad and Stevenage were positioned in first place by New Year&#x27;s Day. The squad won eight consecutive games through February and March 2010, and Stevenage were promoted to the Football League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history with two games to spare. Promotion was secured thanks to a 2–0 victory at Kidderminster Harriers, as Stevenage finished the season 11 points clear at the top of the table. The club reached the final of the FA Trophy again, losing to Barrow 2–1 after extra-time. Shortly after the end of the season, chairman Phil Wallace stated that the club will start its life in the Football League as Stevenage Football Club, dropping the word &#x27;Borough&#x27; from its name as of June 2010.

===Football League (2010–present)===
Stevenage&#x27;s first Football League fixture was against Macclesfield Town in August 2010, ending in a 2–2 draw at Broadhall Way. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, the club were in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. During a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. Stevenage subsequently reached the League Two play-offs, finishing in sixth place. They faced Torquay United in the 2011 Football League Two play-off final on 28 May 2011 at Old Trafford. Stevenage won the game 1–0, securing a place in League One for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, meaning the club had also earned back-to-back promotions. During the same season, Stevenage equalled their previous best performance in the FA Cup, reaching the Fourth Round of the competition before losing 2–1 to Reading. In the previous round, Stevenage were drawn against Premier League club Newcastle United, whom they had previously met, and lost over two &quot;bitter&quot; games, during the 1997–98 season. Stevenage subsequently beat Newcastle 3–1 at Broadhall Way, the first time the club had ever beaten first tier opposition.

In their first season in the third tier of English football, Stevenage were positioned in the League One play-off places following a fourteen-game unbeaten run that lasted for three months. In January 2012, Westley opted to leave Stevenage in order to take up the vacant managerial position at Preston North End. Former Colorado Rapids manager Gary Smith replaced Westley. A run of four wins in their last five games meant that Stevenage finished in sixth, thus taking the final play-off place, losing 1–0 on aggregate to Sheffield United in the semi-final. Stevenage also reached the Fifth Round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history during the season, losing 3–1 to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur in a replay at White Hart Lane, after the two teams drew 0–0 at Broadhall Way.

The majority of the squad that had helped the club win back-to-back promotions into League One departed at the end of the season. New management under Smith, alongside a change in transfer policy, resulted in a complete squad overhaul. Stevenage were positioned within the top six places midway through the 2012–13 season, but a run of 14 losses from 18 matches from December 2012 meant the club were closer to the relegation places three months later. Smith was subsequently sacked in March 2013 and replaced by Westley, returning for his third spell at the club. The team finished in 18th place that season. A further squad overhaul took place ahead of the 2013–14 season and Stevenage were ultimately relegated back to League Two after finishing in last place in the League One standings that season. The team made the play-off semi-finals in their first season back in League Two, losing to Southend United.

The club opted against offering Westley a new contract and replaced him with Teddy Sheringham in May 2015, taking on his first managerial role. Sheringham was sacked in February 2016 with the club positioned in 19th. First-team coach Darren Sarll took caretaker charge for the remainder of the season and was given the role on a permanent basis after helping the club secure League Two safety. During Sarll&#x27;s first full season in the charge, the club finished three points from the play-off positions. With Stevenage in 16th place during the 2017–18 season, Sarll was sacked in March 2018; Wallace stating the club &quot;had not seen the progress expected&quot; since making a number of signings during the January transfer window. Former player and first-team coach, Dino Maamria, replaced Sarll as manager. During the 2018–19 season, Maamria&#x27;s first full season in charge, the club finished 10th, one point from the play-off places. In May 2019, Wallace announced a 12% public equity offering, through sports investment platform Tifosy, with the aim of raising funds to invest in player wages and increase the transfer budget. The offer closed on 31 July 2019, at which time the club stated a total of £300,000 worth of shares had been purchased.

The club started the 2019–20 season without a win in the opening month of the season and Maamria was subsequently sacked in September 2019. First-team coach Mark Sampson took caretaker charge, but with the club in 23rd-place after several months under his management, Graham Westley returned for a fourth spell in December 2019. Two months later, Westley resigned, and was replaced by Alex Revell, who had previously assumed the role of player-coach at the club. The club were in last place of League Two when the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. EFL clubs formally agreed to end the season during an EFL meeting on 9 June 2020, although &quot;ongoing disciplinary matters&quot; involving 23rd-placed Macclesfield Town, who had not paid their players on six separate occasions during the season, meant Stevenage might be reprieved. Stevenage were initially relegated from League Two after an independent disciplinary panel opted to deduct Macclesfield two points on 19 June, with a further four suspended, the maximum number they could deduct without relegating them, highlighting this as a key factor in the sanctions they had chosen to impose. The EFL successfully appealed against the panel&#x27;s sanctions on Macclesfield, winning on 11 August; the four suspended points were applied to the 2019–20 season, meaning Stevenage finished 23rd and so remained in League Two. 

Under Revell&#x27;s management, the club finished the 2020–21 season in 14th position in League Two. After three victories in the first 16 matches of the 2021–22 season, Revell left his position as first-team manager and was replaced by Paul Tisdale in November 2021. Tisdale left the club in March 2022, with Stevenage having won three of his 21 matches as manager. With the club positioned in 22nd place in League Two after a nine-match winless run, three points above the relegation places, Steve Evans was appointed as manager. The club won four of their final nine matches to avoid relegation and finish in 21st position. During the 2022–23 season, under Evans&#x27; management, Stevenage earned promotion into League One after finishing in second place in League Two. That season, the club also defeated Premier League club Aston Villa at Villa Park in the FA Cup third round. Stevenage trailed in the match, before scoring two goals in the final two minutes to win 2–1. During the 2023–24 season, Stevenage were in the play-off hunt for most of the season. However, Evans left for Rotherham United towards the end of the season.

==Club identity==
===Crest===
The club has had five crests since its formation in 1976. The first club crest was created in 1980 when Stevenage took on senior status, adopting the town&#x27;s civic emblem as the basis of the crest. When the club were promoted to the Conference National in 1994, the crest was changed to the Stevenage Borough Council &#x27;tick&#x27; in recognition of the help the club had received from the council in its rise through the leagues. Shortly after former chairman Victor Green took over the club, in 1996, a new crest was introduced, modelled on the town&#x27;s coat of arms; incorporating the club&#x27;s colours of red and white, as well as a hart – which features on both the Stevenage and Hertfordshire coat of arms. This crest was adjusted slightly in 2010 to remove the word &#x27;Borough&#x27;, in-line with the club&#x27;s name change prior to playing in the Football League. The crest was modified ahead of the 2011–12 season by being placed in a shield, but reverted to the former version two years later. A new crest was created in June 2019; the hart being &quot;brought to the forefront of the new design&quot;. The club stated that the previous crest &quot;presented modern-day challenges due to its complex and detailed design&quot; and therefore the new crest, circular in design, enabled the club to create a more visible identity on both a commercial and social level.

===Colours===
The club have always played in red and white colours. Prior to taking on senior status, the team wore red and white stripes. This changed from 1980 to 1988 when the club adopted plain red shirts and white shorts, although did wear an all red strip during the 1982–83 season. The club reverted to stripes from 1988, and the strip design has varied considerably over the years. To mark the 40th anniversary of the club during the 2016–17 season, supporters were consulted about their favourite strip and the result was a re-creation of the diagonal stripes worn from 1996 to 1998.

==Stadium==

===Broadhall Way===
The club plays at Broadhall Way, previously home to Stevenage Town and Stevenage Athletic. Following the bankruptcy of the town&#x27;s former club, the stadium was not used for three years. The newly formed Stevenage Borough moved into Broadhall Way in 1980 as a result of the council re-purchasing the stadium. Following Stevenage&#x27;s successful 1995–96 Football Conference campaign, the Hertfordshire club were denied promotion to the Football League because of insufficient ground capacity and facilities. In the early 2000s, the ground was upgraded, with a new £600,000 stand opening, including an executive suite underneath. In January 2009, Stevenage signed a seven-figure sponsorship deal with the Lamex Food Group, resulting in the renaming of Broadhall Way to The Lamex Stadium. As a result of the club securing promotion as league champions during the club&#x27;s 2009–10 season, Broadhall Way hosted League football for the first time during the 2010–11 season.

The ground&#x27;s pitch includes four stands – the East Terrace, the North Stand, the West Stand, and South Stand. The West Stand is all-seated and covered, and covers the length of the pitch, although it has open corners to either side of the stand. At the back of the stand there are a number of glass-fronted areas to various club offices and executive boxes. The club shop is situated next to the West Stand, opposite to the club&#x27;s official car-park. Opposite to the West Stand is the East Terrace, which is a covered terrace for home supporters. The terrace has a gable with a clock sitting on its roof above the half-way line, as well as holding a television gantry on its roof.

The North Terrace was situated behind the goal at the north end of the ground and was just seven steps deep. Three-quarters of the terrace was covered, whilst one-quarter was open and without cover. The stand held a capacity of 700 people, and offered facilities for disabled fans. In January 2013, the club announced they were due to present plans to replace the existing North Terrace with a new £1.2 million 1,700 seat stand, although these did not materialise due to &quot;numerous obstacles put in the way&quot;. In July 2017, the club asked fans to contribute towards a mini-bond investment scheme, through sports investment platform Tifosy, in an attempt to fund the remaining £500,000 needed to go towards developing the new North Stand. Five weeks after the campaign started, the £500,000 target was met after investment from over 200 fans. The North Terrace was demolished in January 2018. The 1,428 all-seater stand was officially opened in December 2019.

Opposite the North Stand is the South Stand, which is a single tiered, all-seated covered stand. The stand was built in 2001, costing £600,000. The South Stand is reserved for away supporters and can hold a capacity of 1,400. The stand also has an electronic scoreboard in the centre of the roof, which was installed in 2001, making it visible to home supporters. The scoreboard was replaced in October 2011. Behind the stand is the supporters&#x27; club. A new set of floodlights were installed before the start of the club&#x27;s 2007–08 season.

===Training facilities===
The club opened a £5million training facility in nearby Shephalbury Park in the Autumn of 2002. In June 2011, the club announced it had secured a 42-acre former sports ground in Bragbury End – with the intention of developing the site into a new training complex. Work began on the development in the summer of 2011, and the staff began to use the complex towards the latter stages of the 2012–13 season.

==Records and statistics==
Stevenage&#x27;s highest Football League finish was sixth place in League One during the 2011–12 season. The same season, the club recorded their best run in the FA Cup when they reached the fifth round of the competition. Stevenage&#x27;s largest victory in a league match came courtesy of an 11–1 win over British Timken Athletic in the United Counties League in December 1980, whilst their heaviest defeat is an 8–0 loss to Charlton Athletic in an EFL Trophy match in October 2018.

The record for the most number of appearances for Stevenage is held by Ronnie Henry, who played 502 matches in all competitions over two spells with the club. Martin Gittings is the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 217 goals in all competitions. He is the only player to have scored over 100 goals for the club.

<text>Tamworth Football Club is an association football club based in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England. The club competes in the , the fifth level of the English football league system, as of the 2024–25 season.

The club was formed in 1933 after the previous Tamworth club, Tamworth Castle, ceased to exist. After playing in the Birmingham Combination and West Midlands (Regional) League, the team reached the Southern League in 1972. Following a spell in the Northern Premier League between 1979 and 1983 and a single season back in the Southern League Tamworth subsequently fell on hard times and returned to lower-level football. In 1988 Tamworth returned to the Southern League and a year later won the FA Vase. Tamworth reached the final of the FA Trophy in 2003 and in the same season won promotion to the Football Conference, going on to spend four seasons at the highest level of non-League football before being relegated to the Conference North. In 2009 the club gained promotion back to the Conference Premier, and spent five seasons at that level before being relegated. Further relegation in 2018 took the club back to the Southern League.

The team originally played at The Jolly Sailor Ground but after a year moved into The Lamb Ground, named after a pub which formerly stood nearby. The stadium currently has a capacity of just under 5,000 and a 3G artificial pitch which was laid in 2016. Local rivals include Burton Albion and Nuneaton Borough, and to a lesser degree Atherstone Town, Bedworth United and Bolehall Swifts.

==History==
===Early years===
The town of Tamworth had been represented at football by Tamworth Castle F.C. until the club folded in 1933. This void was filled thanks to a campaign started by a letter from a local businessman in the local newspaper setting in motion the formation of Tamworth F.C. Originally playing next to the Jolly Sailor pub, the club moved to their present ground, the Lamb Ground, in 1934. Tamworth began life competing in the Birmingham Combination, before joining the Birmingham and District League, subsequently renamed the West Midlands (Regional) League, in 1954. In the 1960s Tamworth experienced success, winning the league in 1963–64 and 1965–66 and finishing as runners-up on two other occasions, as well as lifting the West Midlands League Cup, Birmingham Senior Cup and Staffordshire Senior Cup in that decade.

In 1972 Tamworth gained promotion to the Southern League following a third West Midlands League title, but a period of falling attendances and financial difficulties followed. The club returned to the West Midlands League in 1984, and was taken over by a consortium of local businessmen. In 1987–88 Tamworth won the League and were promoted back to the Southern League.

===FA Vase win and promotion to the Conference===
In 1989 Tamworth, managed by Graham Smith, reached the final of the FA Vase for the first time, one year after gaining promotion back to the Southern League. The final against Sudbury Town was played at Wembley Stadium and finished in a 1–1 draw with Martin Devaney scoring for Tamworth, meaning that the winner would have to be decided by a replay. The replay was played at London Road, the home of Peterborough United, and Tamworth won 3–0 with two goals from Mark Stanton and one from Ian Moores to lift the FA Vase for the first time. In 1997 The Lambs won the championship of the Southern League Midland Division and gained promotion to the Premier Division.

In the 2001–02 season, Tamworth narrowly missed out on promotion to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-League football. The Lambs earned a 3–3 draw on the final day away to Folkestone Invicta but Kettering Town won their final game, allow them to overtake Tamworth for first place and win promotion to the Conference. The following season, however, Tamworth won the championship of the Southern League to gain promotion, finishing 13 points ahead of second-placed Stafford Rangers. In the same season Tamworth also reached the final of the FA Trophy where they played Burscough but were denied a double, losing 2–1 at Villa Park.

The club completed perhaps their highest profile signing of all time on 23 February 2006, with the capture of former England international midfielder Paul Merson. However, the arrangement meant that until the end of the season, the majority of Merson&#x27;s wages were to be paid by the club he used to manage, Walsall. The arrangement however only lasted two games, although Merson only played once in the 2–1 home loss to Halifax Town. Merson was dropped to the bench for the following game, which was a 5–0 defeat away to Grays Athletic. Merson later announced his retirement from professional football as a player on 9 March 2006, less than a month after joining Tamworth. Although the club finished the 2005–06 season in 21st position (the last relegation position) in the Conference Premier, the club were spared the drop after Canvey Island resigned from the league. They also reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time that season.

===Relegation and return to the Conference Premier===
Despite a fairly poor 2006–07 league campaign, Tamworth once again found themselves at the 3rd round stage of the FA Cup. Norwich City beat The Lambs, and 18 days later Tamworth manager Mark Cooper and assistant manager Richard Dryden were dismissed with the club at the foot of the league table. They were replaced two days later by the former Tamworth managerial duo of manager Gary Mills and assistant Darron Gee. Despite the change in leadership, Tamworth were relegated to the Conference North after finishing in 22nd position.
The club won promotion back to the Conference Premier at the second attempt, with a 1–0 win over Hinckley United on 21 April 2009 thanks to a goal from Nick Wright securing the title and promotion back to the Conference Premier.

On 13 October 2010, manager Gary Mills quit Tamworth to join fellow Conference Premier side York City, names of possible replacements started to circulate and many believed that Ian McParland had expressed interest in the job. However first team coach Des Lyttle became caretaker manager and was later hired as player-manager. He resigned as manager on 13 April 2011, and was replaced by Tamworth legend Dale Belford, who was to manage the club for the remaining four games of the season. Belford led Tamworth to last day safety with a 2–1 home win over Forest Green Rovers, with Jake Sheridan scoring the all important winning goal. Belford stepped aside at the end of the season, and the search for a new manager to lead the club for the 2011–12 Conference Premier season began, speculation was rife, and the names of former York City manager Martin Foyle, Eastwood Town manager Paul Cox and former Walsall assistant manager Martin O&#x27;Connor were all linked to the club, but on 25 May 2011, Tamworth announced Kettering Town manager Marcus Law as the club&#x27;s new manager.

Tamworth were defeated by Everton in the 3rd round of the 2011–12 FA Cup 2–0 on 6 January 2012. Around 5,000 Lambs supporters made the trip to Goodison Park.
Law was relieved of his managerial duties on 14 January 2013, and Dale Belford was appointed as caretaker manager for the foreseeable future with former Lambs player Scott Lindsey as his assistant.

===Conference North and Southern League===
The 2013–14 season was ultimately one to forget for the Lambs. In a season that included a few highlights such as progress to the 2nd round of the 2013–14 FA Cup, where they were beaten 2–1 at home to Bristol City, Tamworth could not survive in the league and finished 23rd, dropping down into the Conference North after five seasons in the English fifth tier. On 15 September 2014, with Tamworth in the bottom three of the Conference North, Belford left the club by mutual consent and was replaced by former Wrexham manager Andy Morrell. Despite a 12-game winning run, promotion was just out of reach as Tamworth failed to get into the play-offs on goal difference.

Tamworth began the 2018–19 season in the newly formed Southern League Premier Central, and announced a new first team management consisting of Mike Fowler, as head coach, Tim Harris as director of football and the return of Paul Green as player-coach.

On 10 September 2018, following a disappointing start to the season, head coach Mike Fowler stepped down from his role. Tim Harris also left the club on 20 September 2018, to take the director of football role at Hereford. On the same day Dennis Greene was confirmed as the club&#x27;s new manager, but he remained in the post for only four months before being dismissed following a string of disappointing results. On 8 March 2019, Andrew Danylyszyn and club legend Gary Smith were announced as joint managers for the club until the end of the season, with the management duo securing the job following a five-game unbeaten run while in a caretaker role at the club. Danylyszyn and Smith were jointly named manager of the month for March 2019 following four wins and a draw in their first five games in charge. Following much improved performances on the pitch, the duo steered the club away from relegation and secured a 12th position in their first season in the Southern League Premier Central. It was officially confirmed on 22 April 2019 that Danylyszyn and Smith had been appointed the club&#x27;s permanent management duo, and would lead the club into the 2019–20 season. They were joined at the club by former Kettering Town and Stratford Town manager Thomas Baillie, who was appointed as Head of Senior Football.

After the dismissal of the previous trio, Rushden and Diamonds manager Andy Peaks was appointed as first team manager and the side went unbeaten to the end of the 2021-22 season.

=== Back to back promotions ===
Although not expected to challenge for promotion the following season, in the 2022–23 season, Tamworth were confirmed as the Southern League Premier Division Central champions, winning the division on goal difference at the expense of Coalville Town.

On the back of the success of the previous season Tamworth subsequently recorded a second successive promotion the following year, winning the 2023-24 National League North title with two games remaining. 

In the 2024–25 season, Tamworth defeated League One side Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup first round. They then reached the FA Cup third round for only the fourth time in their history after defeating Burton Albion on penalties after securing a 1–1 draw. In the third round, Tamworth held Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur to a 0–0 draw in normal time before losing 3–0 in extra time.

==Club colours==

In the first season, Tamworth&#x27;s first team kit was all black with red flashing, but changed to red and black with a blue and white away kit in the following seasons.

Tamworth now play in mainly red kit with black or red shorts and matching or complimentary socks.

The clubs away kit colours change from season to season and have been dark blue, sky blue, white, yellow and luminous green.

== Club badge ==
The first Tamworth FC badges in the 1950s were caricatures of a lamb on a shield with the club name on banners above and below.

This was changed to a Fleur-De-Lys in the 1960s. The emblem appears on the towns coat of arms and was presented officially by the council to the club to use. 

A new badge was designed in 1989 by members of the Football Club and is made up of 5 sections

1: The Saltire in Chief - a gold cross on a blue background

2: The Fess of Vair or Fesse Vair - from the historic coat of arms of the Marmion family.

3: The Stafford(shire) knot - this was a badge of the Stafford family and is linked to the Borough of Stafford 

4: The Castle and the Crossed Swords - representing Tamworth Castle and the historical office of the Champion of England first granted to Robert Marmion in the reign of William the Conqueror.

5: The Fleur-De-Lys

It was confirmed on 17 August 2020, that Tamworth&#x27;s shirt for the 2020–21 season would be kit supplied by Macron Cardiff for a fourth season, and would once again be sponsored by Bradley Scott Windows.

Tamworth finished the 2021–22 season on 23 April 2022, and alongside the club&#x27;s end of season awards, it was announced that the club had signed a deal with Italian sports brand Kappa, with details of the shirt to be announced in due course.

The 2022–23 kit was sponsored by J. Clarke Transport again, with the away shirt sponsored by Turpins Bar and Grill.

Kappa were the kit supplier for the 2023–24 season as well, with Bradley Scott Windows sponsoring the home shirt and Compare The Build sponsoring the away kit. 

The club returned to supplier Macron for 2024–25. The home shirt was sponsored by Bradley Scott Windows once again. The away shirt was launched with two main sponsors, Drayton Manor theme park and Purewater. The team played in the kit in alternating games to ensure maximum exposure for both sponsors. Compare the Build were a feature sponsor on the sleeve and rear of the shirt.

==Stadium==

Tamworth have played at The Lamb Ground since 1934. The Lamb was considered for the first season but the club committee chose a more suitable ground adjacent to the Jolly Sailor pub and put a lot of work in to bringing it up to standard.

The club moved to The Lamb ground for their second season which takes its name from the pub, the &quot;Lamb Inn&quot;, which formerly stood on the entrance to the ground on the Kettlebrook Road.

The ground now has a capacity of approximately 4,000, a directors area, press areas and camera gantry.

All seating is in the Main Stand, which was constructed in 1997.

The Main Stand occupies one side of the pitch, with a covered terrace known as the &quot;Shed&quot; on the opposite side.

Work began on a new 3G pitch after the 2015–16 season finished, and was the first of its kind in the Conference North. It was ready in time for the 2016–17 season and is now available for the community as a whole to use seven days a week.

The club installed their first floodlights in 1967-68 and replaced the ten pylons (one of which had been earlier removed for the main stand in 1997) in 2020 with four state of the art LED floodlights.

A new clubhouse was built to replace the old one in 2021.

<text>Telford United Football Club was an English football club based in Telford, Shropshire.

The club existed under various names for a total of 132 years from its formation in 1872. The club was a founder member of the Alliance Premier League (later renamed the Football Conference) in 1979 and played at this level for 25 years. The club was known for memorable exploits in the FA Cup during the early 1980s and in the 2003–04 FA Cup as well as the 1970–71, 1982–83 and 1988–89 FA Trophies.

After Telford United was wound up in 2004, supporters established a new club named AFC Telford United.

==Club history==
=== Parish Church Institute &amp; Wellington Town ===
The club was formed in late 1872 as Parish Church Institute, and in 1879 was renamed Wellington Town. They won the Shropshire Senior Cup in 1881, and in 1892 were founder members of the Shropshire League. In 1898 they joined the Birmingham &amp; District League. In 1901 they switched to The Combination and won the Welsh Cup, before returning to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1902. They won the Welsh Cup for a second time in 1906–07.

They left the league again at the end of the 1905–06 season, but returned in 1908. In 1920–21 they won the league for the first time, and in 1925–26 reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, something they repeated for the next two seasons and again in 1929–30. In 1930–31 they reached the second round. The club won back-to-back titles in 1934–35 and 1935–36, before switching to the Cheshire County League in 1938. However, they returned to the Birmingham &amp; District League after a single season and went on to win the league and the Welsh Cup again in 1939–40.

After World War II they joined the Cheshire County League, winning the title in 1945–46 and 1946–47 and again in 1951–52. In 1958 they moved up to the expanded Southern League, and were placed in the Premier Division for the 1959–60 season after a transitional year in the North-West Division.

===Telford United===
In 1969 the club was renamed Telford United in recognition of the new town which had grown around Wellington. In their first season under the new name they reached the final of the first FA Trophy, but lost 2–0 to Macclesfield Town. They reached the final again the following year and won 3–2 against Hillingdon Borough. Following a third-place finish in 1978–79 they were founder members of the new Alliance Premier League. In 1982, when Alliance Premier League champions Runcorn failed to meet Football League stadium requirements, Telford applied to join the Football League, but their application was unsuccessful.

During the 1980s the club had several good runs in the FA Cup, reaching the second round in 1982–83 when they knocked out Third Division Wigan Athletic before losing to Tranmere Rovers in a replay. They also reached the final of the FA Trophy again, winning 2–1 against Northwich Victoria. The following season they reached the fourth round, beating Stockport County, Northampton Town and Rochdale before losing to Derby County. In 1984–85 they reached the fifth round, knocking out Lincoln City, Preston North End, Bradford City and Darlington before losing to Everton. They continued to claim League scalps, beating Stockport in 1985–86, Burnley in 1986–87 and Stoke City in 1991–92. They reached the FA Trophy final again in 1987–88, but lost to Enfield in a replay. The following season they reached the Trophy final for a fifth time, this time defeating Macclesfield 1–0. 

In the 2003–04 FA Cup the club knocked out both Brentford and Crewe Alexandra before losing to eventual finalists Millwall. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, but lost on penalties to Canvey Island. They folded at the end of the season, due to the business failure of owner Andy Shaw in March, but the name was resurrected shortly afterwards by the creation of AFC Telford United.

==Colours==

The club&#x27;s traditional colours were white shirts and black shorts, although from at least 1885 to 1906 the club wore scarlet.

<text>Woking Football Club is a professional association football club, based in Woking, Surrey, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1887, they joined the Isthmian League in 1911–12 and won the FA Amateur Cup in 1957–58. Woking were relegated twice in 1982–83 and 1984–85. However, they were promoted three times: in 1986–87, 1989–90 and 1991–92, to reach the Football Conference. Woking won the FA Trophy on three occasions throughout the 1990s and finished as runners-up in the Conference in their third and fourth season at that level but were not promoted. They remained at the highest level of non-League football until relegation in 2008–09. Woking subsequently won promotion back in 2011–12 before suffering another relegation in 2017–18. They earned immediate promotion to the National League via the play-offs in 2019.

The club currently plays its home matches at the Kingfield Stadium and is nicknamed the Cardinals, often shortened to the Cards.

==History==

===Early years===
Woking Football Club was founded in 1887. The club joined the West Surrey League in 1895–96, winning the title by one point. However, within 21 years of being formed, the club was in danger of folding for financial reasons. The turning point came when, in January 1908, Woking played Bolton Wanderers in the first round of the FA Cup, having made it through five qualifying rounds. Despite losing the away game 5–0, the club made it into the national news. Bolton Wanderers, impressed by the minnows they had defeated, travelled to Woking for a friendly match the following season, which kept the club solvent.

===Isthmian League years===
In 1911 the club joined the Isthmian League, maintaining their place in the top division for 72 years and finishing as runners-up to Wycombe Wanderers in 1956–57. That achievement was eclipsed the following season when, in front of a 71,000 crowd, Woking beat Ilford 3–0 to win the 1958 F.A. Amateur Cup final, the last to be televised live.

The club then went into decline, culminating in a first-ever relegation in 1982–83. By the end of the 1984–85 season the club had plunged to Division Two South of the Isthmian League. Former player, Geoff Chapple, was appointed as manager on 24 September 1984, but was not able to save the club from relegation. The following season, the club just missed out on promotion at the first attempt. However, the club clinched the Division Two South title in 1986–87 and, after two third-place finishes in Division One, they were promoted back to the Premier Division at the end of the 1989–90 season.

===FA Cup glory===
During the 1990–91 season, the club reached the fourth round of the FA Cup. Woking beat three Conference sides to set up a third round away tie at Second Division side West Bromwich Albion. After trailing 1–0 at half time, Woking went on to win 4–2, with Tim Buzaglo scoring a hat-trick. In the Fourth Round, the club was drawn against First Division Everton. The tie was originally going to be played at Woking, however the venue was switched to Everton&#x27;s home ground, Goodison Park. Woking narrowly lost the match 1–0 to a Kevin Sheedy goal.

===Promotion to the Conference and FA Trophy success===

Promotion to the Conference was achieved in 1991–92. The Isthmian League title was clinched in early April, with seven games still to be played, 18 points clear of nearest rivals, Enfield. The next season saw Woking finish the season in eighth position. The following summer saw Chapple sign former Chelsea, Sunderland, Fulham and QPR winger, Clive Walker, from Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and he was to prove the catalyst in the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history. Woking won the FA Trophy for the first time in 1994, defeating Runcorn in the final at Wembley; the following season they became only the second club to win back-to-back FA Trophies (after Scarborough in 1976–77), defeating Kidderminster Harriers in the final. A third FA Trophy triumph followed in 1997, with Dagenham &amp; Redbridge the opponents in the final. The Cards also achieved five successive top-five finishes in the Conference, including being runners-up in 1994–95 and 1995–96 when they finished below Stevenage. The club also continued to enjoy national prominence in the FA Cup. Barnet were defeated in successive seasons following draws at their homeground. In 1996–97 a run in the FA Cup saw the club beat Millwall, then top of Division Two, and Cambridge United, who were challenging for promotion from Division Three. The third round saw Woking draw 1–1 away to Premier League side Coventry City, thanks to a last minute equaliser from the Cards&#x27; Steve Thompson, but Coventry won the replay at Kingfield 2–1.

At the end of the 1996–97 campaign, having just clinched the FA Trophy for the third time, Geoff Chapple and his coach, Colin Lippiatt, left the club and joined Kingstonian. This was the beginning of a less successful period for the club. John McGovern and then Brian McDermott were given the position of manager, but neither achieved anything greater than a mid-table finish.

===21st century===
After McDermott, Colin Lippiatt returned but fared little better. He was replaced by his former boss as Geoff Chapple too came back to Woking. Lippiatt departed in January 2002 and Glenn Cockerill joined as Chapple&#x27;s assistant. This season ended with the club just one place above the relegation places. In the meantime very significant events had taken place off the field. The downturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes had led to a financial crisis. With the club facing administration or worse, local businessman and long-time fan Chris Ingram bought the club, becoming chairman in February 2002 with an aim of trying to increase the club&#x27;s income and to secure its long-term financial stability.

Cockerill took over as manager later that year, and oversaw a relative period of stability for the club, before he was sacked shortly before the end of the 2006–07 season. An unimpressive campaign under the management of Frank Gray followed in 2007–08, before a disastrous 2008–09 season which saw three men (Kim Grant, Phil Gilchrist and Graham Baker) take charge of the club, eventually resulted in the club&#x27;s relegation to the Conference South. That summer, a supporters&#x27; trust took over the running of the club. Woking finished 5th in their first Conference South season, but lost to Bath City in the play-off final. The following season saw Woking struggling to challenge for promotion, and Graham Baker was sacked halfway through the campaign for suggesting that the fans were expecting too much of the team.

Garry Hill took over as manager and improved the team&#x27;s form, eventually resulting in another fifth-place finish, only for the club to get knocked out in the play-off semi-finals this time against Farnborough. In April 2012, having beaten Maidenhead United 0–1 with Giuseppe Sole scoring for a record breaking ninth game in a row, Woking were promoted to the Conference Premier, winning the Conference South with two games to spare. They eventually reached 97 points, beating second placed Dartford by nine points. After five seasons in the National League (formerly Conference Premier), Woking acrimoniously parted company with Hill after six-and-a-half years at the helm.

The club appointed former Southampton and West Ham United under-23s coach Anthony Limbrick in May 2017, which saw the club take another step to becoming full-time again, with players training three times a week. Despite a good run in the 2017–18 FA Cup, Woking&#x27;s league form suffered, which culminated in just three league wins between October 2017 and April 2018. Limbrick was subsequently relieved of his duties just 11 months into a three-year contract, leaving assistant manager Jason Goodliffe to take over the managerial reins (aided by former Aldershot Town coach Matt Gray) to preserve The Cards&#x27; National League status with just five games remaining. However, Woking&#x27;s fate was eventually sealed on the final day of the season after a 2–1 home defeat against Dover Athletic.

On 16 May 2018, and after much speculation, the club finally confirmed the appointment of former Kingstonian and Hampton &amp; Richmond Borough manager Alan Dowson. Woking returned to the National League in 2019 at the first time of asking following a 1–0 win over Welling United in National League South play-off final. During this promotion season, Woking reached the third round of the FA Cup. Woking had beaten League Two side Swindon Town before losing out to Premier League side Watford 2–0.

The following season, Woking finished in 10th place back in the National League following the decision to stop the season in March 2020 due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2020–21 National League season, Woking finished 20th.

On 28 February 2022, Dowson was sacked by the club following a &quot;prolonged run of poor form in the league&quot;, ending his four-year association with the Surrey-based side. Dowson informed local paper &quot;SurreyLive&quot; that the club had sacked him in a 20-second phone call and he would never return to Woking. Due to the circumstances of how Dowson was sacked board members Rosemary Johnson and Kelvin Reay resigned. Ian Dyer, the assistant manager, took charge of the club as caretaker manager.

On 28 March 2022, former Yeovil Town manager Darren Sarll was appointed until the end of the 2023–24 season. In the 2022–23 season, Woking finished the season in 4th place but lost the play-off eliminator at home to Bromley. Despite signing a new two-year deal in February 2023, Sarll was ultimately sacked in November 2023 following defeats to eighth-tier side, Ramsgate in the FA Cup and Oxford City in the National League.

A month later, former Coventry City, Sheffield United and Portsmouth player, Michael Doyle was appointed as first-team manager on a two-year deal, replacing the interim manager, Ian Dyer. Doyle went onto secure the club&#x27;s National League status on the final day of the season, with a 3–0 home victory over AFC Fylde.

In July 2024, it was reported that Woking could go into administration if a buyer could not be found in the next few weeks. Owner Drew Volpe was willing to sell the club for £1, and only a £600,000 loan from his parents was keeping the club afloat. In November 2024, American businessman Todd Johnson (a former vice-chairman of Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and a co-owner of MLS side Minnesota United FC) agreed to acquire a majority stake in Woking, with Volpe - who had provided £3m to the club - retaining a minority stake. In December 2024, shareholders voted in favour of the club&#x27;s takeover by Johnson&#x27;s Cardinal Football Group. After three defeats in four games, on 16 December 2024, the club sacked their then manager, Michael Doyle, as well as Ben Turner, assistant manager. Woking were 19th in the National League, a point above the relegation zone. Neal Ardley was appointed as manager on 19 December 2024.

==Stadium==
At the start of the 1922 season, Woking F.C. moved to Kingfield Stadium, which has been known as the Laithwaite Community Stadium since August 2015. Previously, the club had played at the Horsell Cricket Ground before moving to a dedicated football venue on Pembroke Road in 1907.

Different stands of Woking FC stadium:

The KRE: This is the main home terrace and usually where the best atmosphere is found. It runs along one end of the pitch. The terrace is covered by a roof.

The Leslie Gosden stand: This stand is the largest stand of the stadium and is located opposite to the KRE. The LGS is an all seater stand consisting of around 2,000 seats. A quarter of this stand is usually given to away fans.

The Chris Lane terrace: The Chris Lane terrace is a large terrace without a roof and is reserved for away fans. The terrace runs a whole length of the pitch.

Moaners corner: Moaners corner is one of three stands on the opposite side of the pitch to the Chris lane terrace. It&#x27;s a small terrace stand without a roof. The fans who stand in the terrace are usually veteran fans.

Directors box: The directors box is a small stand the directors of the club sit in, this is also where the media area and PA box are located. This stand is located in between moaners corner and the family stand.

The family stand: The family stand is located next to the directors box and is an all-seater stand usually consisting of families.

==Mascot==
Woking F.C. has a team mascot called K.C. Kat.

==Rivalries==
For many years Woking&#x27;s main rivals have been Stevenage and Aldershot Town, where games attract larger than average crowds. Stevenage are Woking&#x27;s historic rivals due to animosity in the 1990s, while the rivalry with Aldershot is a more recent rivalry due to locality. Torquay United have also become minor rivals due to intense games and competition when they were relegated to the national league south together, altercations between fans has also helped feed this new rivalry.

<doc id="451218" wikidata="Q6860257" url="?curid=451218" title="Milnrow Cricket Club">
<text>Milnrow Cricket Club, based in Milnrow, an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, are an English cricket team who as of 2022 play in the Greater Manchester Cricket League (GMCL).

The club is over 150 years old and celebrated its centenary in 1957 with the publication of a club history. The first professional player for the club was James Rigby, in 1884, but the club has never had a great deal of sporting success when compared to its local rivals. It was a founder member of the Central Lancashire League in 1892.

In 2010 the club received a £57,000 grant from the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board. This was towards the costs of providing artificial practice areas for coaching purposes. Earlier in that year it had also received a smaller grant from Sport England. It has also received funding from, for example, the Co-op.

The club has a junior section and has in the past developed players who have been selected for the Academy of Lancashire Cricket Club, which exists to further develop young talent with the aim of seeing its members become professional players.

For the 2018 and 2019 seasons Milnrow played in the Lancashire League.

==Past professionals==
Despite its modest record in the league, Milnrow has attracted some top Test players and former county cricket players as its professionals. Former players for the team include the Australian all-rounder George Tribe, the county spinners Dusty Rhodes and John McMahon, former Lancashire captain Ken Grieves, the West Indies Test player Derick Parry, the Zimbabwean Kevin Curran and the Indian bowler Chetan Sharma. Its most recent Test player to act as a professional was Paul Wiseman, the New Zealand off-spin bowler in 2005.

The record wicket-taker in a single season was Tribe, whose 148 wickets in 1949 were a record at the time for the Central Lancashire League (equalled in the same season by George Pope, who took 148 for Heywood and later beaten by Dattu Phadkar with 154 for Rochdale in 1955); the historian of the Leagues, John Kay, wrote that Tribe &quot;suffered badly from indifferent fielding&quot; at Milnrow.

<text>Norden Cricket Club, known as Greenbooth Cricket Club until 1920, are an English cricket club.

They are currently branded &quot;Norden (J.W. Lees) CC&quot; as part of a sponsorship deal with a brewery and play their home fixtures at Stag Park, Norden, Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

They have an indirect link to Norden F.C., refounded in 2002 by a group of members of the cricket club.

== History ==

Greenbooth Cricket Club was formed in 1875 with no permanent home. By 1876 matches were played in a field near a local mill, whose owner was later the club&#x27;s president. A small pavilion was built.

In 1881 the club moved temporarily to Pithouses in Norden village, but the following year matches were instead held at a new venue, Woodhouse Lane, where a square was laid at a cost of £18 - 6s - 8d. A wooden pavilion followed 4 years later. This ground is now known as Stag Park.

In 1888, the club employed its first professional player, George Hammond of Bury. The remainder of the team continued to be amateurs. In 1892 Greenbooth Cricket Club played its first competitive matches when it entered the Bury and District Cricket League. However, the club&#x27;s participation in the league ended after one season.

In 1895 they joined the South East Lancashire League, and a new professional and coach was employed, a John Redfern from Linthwaite. His salary was £2-2s-0d (2 guineas) per week, which caused the players&#x27; annual subscription to be raised from three to four shillings. In 1896 the club transferred to the Middleton and District Cricket League, with John Redfern still employed as a professional player. However, in 1898 no professional was employed.

In 1899 the club won their first championship, the Middleton and District League, with a new professional fast bowler, G. E. Broadley from Accrington. The Middleton and District League was renamed as Lancashire Cricket Council in 1904.

Between 1900 and 1905 the club also operated a licensed bar, but despite improving the club&#x27;s finances this venture caused some controversy, and the bar was closed in 1905.

In 1915 Greenbooth won the championship for a second time, and applied to join the Central Lancashire League. However, this application was unsuccessful, and the First World War had by now prevented any further play for several years.

In 1920 the club changed its name from Greenbooth Cricket Club to Norden Cricket and Recreation Club. Norden was admitted to the South Lancashire League in the following year. At the end of the season the club was £120 in debt.

In 1937 Norden became members of the Saddleworth League.

In 1945 Beswick Royds Estates, who owned the cricket ground, offered it to the club for £450. An appeal for funds from the public resulted in seven hundred pounds being raised and the ground was purchased.
In 1950, the club began to plan improvements to their ground and in 1951 raised £2,600 for a new pavilion. Plans for the pavilion were drawn by architect Jack Smith. The official opening ceremony was performed by former player Dr. Vernon Bell on Saturday 28 July, with a match between Norden and Fieldhouse. The pavilion was described in the souvenir programme: There are dressing rooms at either end of the building: a hall or assembly room in the centre, secretary&#x27;s room and a large kitchen. The pavilion covers an area of 176 sq. yds. exclusive of the terracing which covers a further 70 sq. yds. Volunteer labour was used to bring the building up to floor level and the following materials were used: Stone ballast 62 tons. Sand 28 tons. Cement 9 tons. Stone pitching and filling 70 tons. Granite chipping 8 tons. Bricks 10,000. Ashes 30 tons. drain pipes, gutters etc.

The first XI won their league in both 1952 and 1953, and also in 1953 the second XI finished runners-up in their division. In 1957 both teams were League Champions and the club won the Aggregate Cup.

In 1959 Norden joined the Lancashire and Cheshire League, and the second team won their championship in 1966.

After joining the Lancashire and Cheshire League, Norden fared poorly against more experienced sides, most of which were long standing social and cricket clubs. It was suggested that to improve the social aspect of the club a licensed bar, last run by the club in 1905, should again be considered. In 1966 an extraordinary general meeting was held to discuss the proposal for a new bar, with a lack of support for the idea. A further meeting reversed this decision, although the decision was not unanimous. The club raised the extra four hundred pounds required for the bar installation by 26 of the club&#x27;s members agreeing to pay ten years&#x27; subscription in advance. Following the opening of the bar the club&#x27;s finances were improved, and in the winter of 1973 the bar was extended and modified, using voluntary labour and gifts to prevent the club bearing the entire cost.

The club were Central Lancashire League Division One winners in 2004 and crowned champions again in 2010, as well as winning the Aggregate Trophy.

From start of the 2018 season Norden moved to the Lancashire League.

<text>John Hope Peddie, commonly known as Jack or Jock Peddie, (3 March 1876 – 20 October 1928) was a Scottish footballer who played for various clubs in both England and Scotland, including Newcastle United, Manchester United, Plymouth Argyle and Heart of Midlothian. As a Plymouth player, he is most famous for scoring their first ever goals in the Western and Southern Leagues.

==Career==
Born in Hutchesontown, Glasgow, Peddie began his football career with Scottish Junior club Benburb, before moving to Third Lanark in June 1895. Two years later, he moved across the border to England, where he joined Newcastle United, first on trial in January 1897, before signing a professional contract in November 1897. With 17 goals in his first 20 league games, Peddie helped his new club gain promotion to the top flight in his first season in 1898, as well as netting a brace in an impressive 2–1 FA Cup upset of top-flight Preston North End the same season. Peddie scored Newcastle&#x27;s two goals in their first ever game in the First Division, a 4–2 home defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Newcastle&#x27;s first win in the division came at home to Liverpool in November 1898, when Peddie scored two goals in a 3–0 victory. In total, he scored 79 goals in 136 appearances and was Newcastle&#x27;s top scorer for four consecutive seasons between the 1897–98 and 1900–01 season.

After five seasons at Newcastle, Peddie moved to Manchester United in June 1902 and led the club&#x27;s scoring charts in his first season with 11 league goals (15 in all competitions). Despite this, he left for Plymouth Argyle in May 1903 ahead of their first season as a professional club. He scored their first competitive goals in both the Southern League and Western League, and scored 21 goals from 46 appearances in his one year at Home Park. He returned to Manchester United in 1904, and as well as being named club captain, he was again the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 17 goals in 32 league appearances. The arrival of high-scoring Jack Picken in May 1905 meant Peddie was unable to repeat the feat for a third time in four seasons, although he still made an important contribution with 20 goals in all competitions as Manchester United finished in second place to win promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. Peddie was also replaced as captain by Charlie Roberts prior to the 1905–06 season. Having played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match twice while playing for Third Lanark and twice with Newcastle, he made his fifth appearance in the fixture as a Manchester United player in March 1906, but would never be selected for the Scotland national team. In January 1907, he returned to Scotland, signing for Heart of Midlothian in a triple transfer with Dick Wombwell and William Yates. In total across his two spells with Manchester United, Peddie scored 58 goals in 121 appearances.

At Tynecastle, Peddie received £5 per week in wages and played inside right and centre forward. In the first round of the Scottish Cup, Hearts defeated Airdrieonians 2–0 at Broomfield, with Peddie scoring the second goal. Peddie missed the semi-final victory over Queen&#x27;s Park due to a knee injury that eventually ended his career. In May 1907, Peddie received considerable treatment for the knee injury and was back in the team at the start of the 1907–08 season; however, the injury kept flaring up and he played only 23 first-team matches during his final two seasons, scoring five goals. When James McGhee replaced William Waugh as Hearts manager in April 1908, Peddie was transferred and listed at £100. He emigrated to Canada in 1908, before eventually moving to the United States and settling in Detroit. He died in 1928 at the age of 52.

<doc id="451226" wikidata="Q3157246" url="?curid=451226" title="Jack Leslie (English footballer)">
<text>John Francis Leslie (17 August 1901 – 25 November 1988) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside left.

Leslie was the only black professional player in England during his time with Plymouth Argyle. Leslie enjoyed a 14–season spell with Argyle, having joined the club from Barking Town in 1921. A creator and scorer of goals, his partnership with outside left Sammy Black has gone down in history as one of the very best. Leslie played alongside Black 327 times, with the duo scoring 319 goals between them in all competitions, with Leslie contributing 137 of them. In 1930, The Football Herald described him as &quot;known throughout England for his skill and complexion.&quot;

==Early life==
Leslie was born in Canning Town, London, to a Jamaican father also called John Leslie, a boilermaker, and an English mother, Annie Leslie, a seamstress.

==Career==
He played for the local team Barking Town, scoring more than 250 goals and helping them win the Essex Senior Cup in 1920 and London League Premier Division title in 1921. Also in 1921 he joined Plymouth Argyle. Predominantly a centre-forward or an inside-left, Leslie was described as being versatile and able to provide cover wherever needed.

It took until his eleventh appearance for Argyle for him to get his first goal, in a 2–0 win against Gillingham in 1923.

Across a total of fourteen seasons at Argyle he scored 133 league goals in 384 games, making him Argyle&#x27;s ninth record highest appearance maker, and fourth highest goal scorer.

=== England call-up ===
Leslie was called up to the national team in 1925 as a travelling reserve; his manager, Bob Jack, told him he had been selected as a reserve for England against Ireland for an October 1925 Home Nations Championship game. However, the invitation to be a reserve for his country was withdrawn. It has been speculated that this was because of belated objections to his skin colour by members of the FA who had been unaware of his ethnicity. Later in life, Leslie told the journalist Brian Woolnough: &quot;They must have forgot I was a coloured boy.&quot;

Leslie was never picked in any capacity for England again. As a consequence, it was not until 1963 that John Charles became the first black player to appear in an England shirt when he represented England at under-18 level, and in 1978 Viv Anderson became the first black player to appear as a full international for the England national football team.

=== Retirement ===
He retired from professional football in 1935, playing his last game, and scoring his last goal, on 29 December 1934 in a 3–1 win against Fulham.

He later worked as a member of the backroom staff of his local club, West Ham United, as the boot-boy. He was offered the job by West Ham manager, Ron Greenwood who recognised Leslie as a great player. During his time at West Ham Leslie cleaned the boots of World Cup winners, Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters and of England international Trevor Brooking and Clyde Best who at the time was one of only a very small number of black players in the top flight of English football.

He died in 1988.

==Legacy==
In December 2019, the boardroom at the newly redeveloped Mayflower Grandstand at Plymouth Argyle&#x27;s ground Home Park was named in Leslie&#x27;s honour.

On 18 June 2020, following the George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom and a petition signed by over 500 people, it was reported that Plymouth City Council had proposed to rename Sir John Hawkins Square in the City Centre to the &#x27;Jack Leslie Square&#x27;.

In November 2020, a blue plaque was unveiled outside Leslie&#x27;s former home in Canning Town.

In August 2022, a previously unnamed road which runs outside Home Park&#x27;s Devonport End was named &quot;Jack Leslie Way&quot;.

In early 2020 &quot;The Jack Leslie Campaign&quot; was set up, with the aim of building a statue of Leslie outside Home Park. Crowd-funding for the project began on 1 July 2020, and by August 2020 had raised the target amount of £100,000.

On 7 October 2022, the commissioned bronze statue of Leslie was unveiled at Home Park. The statue stands 3.7 m (12 ft) tall, and was sculpted by Andy Edwards. A plaque on the statue&#x27;s base also paid tribute to Leslie&#x27;s strike-partner Sammy Black, who is Argyle&#x27;s record top goalscorer.

On the same day, Leslie was awarded a posthumous honorary England cap by the FA. The FA&#x27;s chair, Debbie Hewitt said in a statement: &quot;the FA is awarding Jack a posthumous honorary cap, to recognise his unique contribution and set of circumstances – and to right the historical wrong.&quot; The cap was presented to Leslie&#x27;s family at Wembley Stadium on 26 March 2023 before England&#x27;s Euro 2024 qualifying game against Ukraine.

In February 2023 he was inducted into the National Football Museum&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<text>Paul Mariner (22 May 1953 – 9 July 2021) was an English football player and coach.

A centre forward during his playing days, Mariner began his career with Chorley. He became a professional player in 1973 with Plymouth Argyle, where he scored 61 goals in 155 appearances and is considered to have been one of the club&#x27;s best ever players. He joined Ipswich Town in 1976, where he achieved domestic and European success under the guidance of Bobby Robson. He was called up to play for the England national team during his time at Portman Road, and went on to represent his country at the 1980 European Championships and the 1982 World Cup. In total, Mariner played 35 times for England, scoring 13 goals. He spent two years with Arsenal and then Portsmouth before finishing his career abroad. He played for clubs in Australia, the US, and Malta.

He took up coaching during his time with Albany Capitals and focused on it fully when he retired from playing. After spending time working in Japan, he returned to America to coach, firstly in Arizona and then at Harvard University. He joined Major League Soccer club New England Revolution in 2004 as a member of Steve Nicol&#x27;s coaching staff. After five years in Massachusetts, Mariner returned to Plymouth Argyle in 2009 as their head coach. He succeeded Paul Sturrock as the club&#x27;s manager two months later before returning to his role as head coach upon the arrival of Peter Reid. In January 2011, he returned to Major League Soccer as director of player development at Toronto FC.

Mariner was the color commentator for New England Revolution of MLS. Starting in 2020, he commentated for some of the Revolution games, and shared the duty with Charlie Davies.

==Playing career==
===1970s===
Mariner started his career as an amateur player at non-league club Chorley, close to his Lancashire roots and his style at the helm of their attack caught the attention of Plymouth Argyle, for whom he signed in 1973.

So began an impressive scoring record with the Devon club, with 56 goals in 135 appearances coming before Bobby Robson, who had been personally monitoring Mariner&#x27;s progress, took him to Ipswich Town for a club record £220,000 with John Peddelty and Terry Austin moving in the opposite direction as part of the deal. Mariner chose Ipswich ahead of similar offers from West Bromwich Albion and West Ham United.

Mariner made his debut in September 1976 and quickly settled into the Ipswich side as an old-fashioned number 9 – i.e., a forward capable of taking hard tackles and rough treatment from defenders but willing to give it back, while also scoring a fair share of goals. Received wisdom suggests that Mariner was only a &#x27;target-man&#x27;-type centre forward but he scored plenty of goals with his feet and had the skill to create his own chances on the deck, rather than relying entirely on service through the centre and via the flanks.

Such was Mariner&#x27;s impact that six months after joining Ipswich, he made his England debut as a substitute in a 5–0 win over Luxembourg at Wembley and played from the beginning in the following game against Northern Ireland in the British Home Championship at Windsor Park, Belfast. He impressed in both games, though did not score and was not selected for the next six matches. During this period, Ipswich finished third in the First Division, with Mariner contributing ten goals from 28 games.

Mariner&#x27;s third England cap came in the return World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg, scoring a last-minute goal in a 2–0 win. By now, Mariner had become one of a number of &#x27;target man&#x27;-type centre forwards for England coach Ron Greenwood to select from, with Stuart Pearson and Bob Latchford also on the scene. It was Mariner, however, who would be selected the majority of the time.

At club level, Mariner was having a mixed time. He scored 11 goals for Ipswich, but the team underperformed in the First Division and finished 18th. However, they reached the FA Cup final at Wembley where they memorably beat Arsenal 1–0. Mariner hit the goal-frame with one chance.

Greenwood did not select Mariner for England throughout 1979, although Mariner had his most productive spell for Ipswich that season, scoring 13 goals in 33 matches. It was not until 1980 that he won a sixth England cap – almost exactly two years after his fifth – and he scored England&#x27;s goal in a surprising 4–1 defeat against Wales at Wrexham. He stayed in the reckoning thereafter, scoring in a 2–1 win over Australia in Sydney in the final game before England took to the field for the 1980 European Championships. Mariner was named in Greenwood&#x27;s squad for the tournament, despite not playing during the whole qualifying campaign.

He did not play in the opening 1–1 draw versus Belgium in Turin but came on as a substitute in the remaining two group matches – a defeat against Italy and a victory over Spain, which ensured England&#x27;s elimination from the competition.

===1980s===
Mariner maintained his England place as his Ipswich goalscoring record continued to improve – 17 from 41 games had come in 1980 and Ipswich made the early running as the next season got underway. England began their qualifying campaign for the 1982 World Cup with a conclusive 4–0 win over Norway, with Mariner scoring a superb goal with a deft turn and shot from 25 yards. He was, however, left out of the next game, which turned into a gruesome 2–1 defeat against Romania in Bucharest. Greenwood put him back in the side a month later for a now vital match against Switzerland, and Mariner scored the opener in a 2–1 win.

Ipswich were challenging for three trophies as the 1981 season approached its climax, with Mariner again to the fore, scoring 13 times in 36 matches. However, they were to miss out on two domestic fronts, with Aston Villa winning the First Division (after Ipswich failed to beat Middlesbrough) and Manchester City defeating Ipswich in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. But in the UEFA Cup, Mariner was proving to be a real hero as glory beckoned.

He scored twice in the early rounds as Ipswich progressed to an attractive quarter final against St Étienne. In the first leg in France Mariner put two away as Ipswich went 4–1 up, and added another as Ipswich completed the task in the second leg. After winning the semi-final, Mariner scored again in the first leg of the final against AZ Alkmaar as Ipswich coasted to a 3–0 lead, ultimately winning the competition 5–4 on aggregate. Weeks later, Greenwood put him back in the England side as the World Cup qualification campaign resumed with a defeat in Switzerland, a vital victory in Hungary and a shock defeat in Norway. It appeared that they might miss out on the World Cup finals for an unthinkable third tournament in a row, but results elsewhere went their way, meaning England only needed to draw with the already qualified Hungary at Wembley in the final game to guarantee qualification. It was Mariner who scored the only goal in a 1–0 win, though he got it after a stumble which saw him score via a deflection rather than an actual shot on goal.

Injuries to both Achilles tendons restricted Mariner&#x27;s football over the next few months, and he only scored eight times in 25 games for Ipswich. But in the five final England warm-up matches prior to the World Cup in Spain, he scored four times, including a stunning solo run and strike against the Netherlands at Wembley. He was named in Greenwood&#x27;s squad and started the first match of the tournament, against France.

England went into a 2–1 lead thanks to a brace from Bryan Robson – the first of which was one of the World Cup Finals&#x27; quickest-ever goals – before Mariner slammed home a close-range volley to complete an impressive 3–1 win. It was his eleventh international goal in his 22nd match – an admirable ratio of one goal every other game. It was his also his sixth consecutive scoring game for England – a feat previously achieved only by Jimmy Greaves.

Greenwood selected Mariner for the rest of the tournament but he didn&#x27;t score again and England went out in the second phase after two disappointing goalless draws. Mariner is best remembered for dragging a devastated Kevin Keegan to his feet in support after the England captain, on as a substitute after a tournament ruined by injury problems, sank to his knees, head in hands, having just missed an open goal with a header which would have given England the lead in their goalless final game against Spain. (As England needed to better West Germany&#x27;s earlier 2–1 victory against Spain, a goal at this point would still have been insufficient in isolation to send England into the semi-finals.)

Mariner&#x27;s club boss Robson subsequently became England coach and he continued to select him as the qualification campaign for the 1984 European Football Championship got underway. Mariner continued to score frequently for Ipswich, whose young and vibrant side had started to age and break up.

England&#x27;s qualification campaign faltered, though Mariner scored in consecutive pool matches against Hungary and Luxembourg – the latter of which would prove to be his 13th and final England goal. By the time he next played for England, he was an Arsenal player, with the Gunners taking him from Ipswich in February 1984 for £150,000. Making his Arsenal-debut at Highbury against Aston Villa on 18 February in a 1-1 draw, he scored his first goal at Nottingham Forest the next week. By now Mariner was in his thirties but he still initially performed well for Arsenal, scoring seven times in the final fifteen games of the season, as the Gunners had a resurgence and finishing 6th in the 1983-84 season.

He was a regular throughout 1984-85 missing only seven games but he only mustered nine goals in 41 appearances.

Mariner won two more England caps but Mark Hateley, a tall and skilful young striker in the Mariner mould, was a candidate for his position and Gary Lineker and Peter Beardsley were also establishing themselves as international strikers. Hateley came on as a substitute for Mariner in a friendly victory over East Germany in September 1984, before Mariner picked up his 35th and final cap in a goalless draw against Romania in May 1985, a qualifier for the 1986 World Cup. With Hateley in the ascendancy and Mariner regularly sidelined at Arsenal, Robson opted not to select him for the England squad which qualified for Mexico 1986.

Meanwhile, at his club Mariner was rarely on the field, he was blighted by an Achilles heel injury which saw him only play nine times in 1985–86, including matches as an emergency centre half. His final appearance seeing him come off the bench against Nottingham Forest on 8 April 1986.

In August 1986 Arsenal&#x27;s new manager George Graham gave Mariner a free transfer in a decision that had been made before he took over; in all Mariner played 70 times for Arsenal, scoring 17 goals. He signed for Portsmouth, where he spent two seasons. In May 1989, he signed with the Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League.

===1990s===
In 1990-91 Paul Mariner played for Naxxar Lions, Malta. Mariner returned to the Capitals in 1991 as the team now played in the American Professional Soccer League, formed by the merger of the American Soccer League and Western Soccer League. He played three seasons with the Capitals, where he was named to the league&#x27;s Best XI in 1990. During his three seasons in Albany, Mariner also served as an assistant coach. In the spring of 1992, the Capitals&#x27; owner offered him the position of head coach but when he heard a rumour that the team was about to collapse, he accepted a position as a player-assistant coach with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks. He accepted that position and soon after the Capitals announced they were ceasing operations. In the early 1990s Paul made two appearances for Byhams Dairy, a Sunday League team in Sudbury Suffolk.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
After retiring, Mariner worked as a football pundit for BBC Radio Lancashire for their Friday-night Non-League Hour before setting up a management company for footballers. After a spell back in England coaching at Bolton School, he returned to the States to coach youth football at S.C. Del Sol in Phoenix, Arizona. In 2003, he became an assistant coach at Harvard University. In 2004, he was hired by the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer as assistant coach to former Liverpool and Scotland defender Steve Nicol. He was officially announced by the club on 5 February 2004.
He was interviewed by MLS expansion side Seattle Sounders FC for their head coach role prior to their inaugural season in 2009.

===Plymouth Argyle===
Speculation about his future was rife in October 2009 when he was linked with a coaching position at one of his former clubs, Plymouth Argyle, abetted by his visit to Devon to promote the city&#x27;s 2018 World Cup bid and his subsequent resignation on 17 October. It was announced the following day, 18 October 2009, that he was to become the new head coach of Plymouth Argyle, with Paul Sturrock staying on as team manager.

On 10 December 2009, Mariner replaced Sturrock as manager of Plymouth Argyle, following a run of poor form which left the Pilgrims second bottom in the Championship. He was unable to keep Plymouth up, however, and they were relegated from the Football league Championship after a six-year stay, on 19 April 2010.

On 6 May 2010, it was announced that Plymouth were to look for a new manager, however Mariner would remain as a member of the coaching staff. Mariner&#x27;s tenure as manager ended when Peter Reid was hired on 24 June 2010. Mariner stepped down from his role at Home Park on 30 December 2010 to pursue another opportunity. &quot;I have known Paul for a long time and working with him has been fantastic,&quot; said Argyle manager Peter Reid. &quot;I&#x27;m sure he will be successful in everything he does in the future. He&#x27;s a great personality and someone who is a legend with the fans at this football club.&quot;

===Toronto FC===
Mariner was named Director of Player Development for Toronto FC on 6 January 2011, joining new head coach Aron Winter at the club. After starting the season with 9 straight losses, Winter stepped down as Toronto named Mariner as the new head coach on 7 June 2012. Mariner recorded his first victory as Toronto manager on 27 June against Montreal Impact, the game ended in a 3–0 away win. The club rebounded briefly under the new coach, but after &quot;a dismal 0-10-4 run in league play&quot; to end the 2012 season, Mariner was dismissed on 7 January 2013. Mariner was praised by former Toronto FC players Andrew Wiedeman and Eric Hassli.

==Broadcasting career==
After his playing days ended in 1993, Mariner worked briefly as a commentator with BBC Radio Lancashire. In 2014, after his brief coaching stint in Toronto, Mariner returned to the New England Revolution as a broadcaster, providing colour commentary for the team&#x27;s television and radio broadcasts for six full seasons. He also worked as an analyst for ESPN broadcasts between 2009 and 2020.

==Personal life and death==
Mariner was born in Farnworth, near Bolton on 22 May 1953, the son of James Mariner, a crane driver, and Margaret Catherine Mariner, née Turnbull, and was baptised two months later at St Catherine&#x27;s Church in Horwich on 19 July 1953. He lived with his parents in Autumn Street, Horwich, and went to Horwich County Secondary School (now the lower school of Rivington and Blackrod High School). He married Alison Roscoe in Plymouth, Devon in 1976, and they had three sons. They eventually divorced in 1989.

Mariner died of brain cancer on 9 July 2021, at the age of 68.

<text>William Henry Rafferty (born 30 December 1950) is a Scottish retired footballer who played as a forward. He appeared in the Football League for Coventry City, Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Carlisle United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Portsmouth and AFC Bournemouth, scoring 145 goals in 468 matches. He finished his career in Portugal with spells at Louletano and Farense.

Rafferty began his league career with Coventry City after joining them from Port Glasgow but found opportunities few and far between. A move to Blackpool in 1972 saw him play and score more regularly before joining Plymouth Argyle a year later. With his striking partner, Paul Mariner, he became an important player in the Argyle side that won promotion to the Football League Second Division in 1975. Their partnership contributed 47 goals to the campaign, with Rafferty scoring 26.

He then joined Carlisle United where he continued to score regularly. He moved on to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Newcastle United. After Newcastle he joined Portsmouth in 1980. At Portsmouth, Rafferty once again became a key striker, winning the Third Division championship in 1983 before joining AFC Bournemouth, which would be his last league club in England.

<text>Thomas Edward Tynan (born 17 November 1955) is an English retired professional footballer.

A hard working striker with flowing blonde hair, Tynan was signed as an apprentice for Liverpool by manager Bill Shankly after winning a talent contest run by the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; newspaper, but he never made a first-team appearance for the Reds, and was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday in 1976, where he spent two years and scored 31 goals.

After just nine appearances for Lincoln City in 1978, Tynan moved on to Newport County where he formed a dynamic striking partnership with John Aldridge as the Newport team gained promotion to the Football League Third Division, won the 1980 Welsh Cup and in the subsequent season reached the quarter-final of the 1981 European Cup Winners Cup. Tynan scored both goals in the away leg against Carl Zeiss Jena of East Germany, the equalising goal being in the 90th minute but Newport lost the home leg 1–0. In total Tynan scored 66 goals in 183 matches during the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history.

In 1983, Tynan moved on to Plymouth Argyle where he became a cult figure during the 1980s and is frequently named by Argyle fans as one of the club&#x27;s all-time greatest players. He was a member of the side which reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1984, scoring the goal which beat then top flight West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round of the competition. Argyle went on to beat Derby County in the quarter-finals before losing to Watford in the penultimate stage of the competition.

In the 1984/85 season, Tynan was joint top scorer in all 4 divisions of the Football League with 31 goals, level with Tranmere&#x27;s John Clayton. Clayton, ironically, joined Argyle as Tynan&#x27;s replacement, when Tynan signed for Rotherham United in the summer of 1985. However, Tynan rejoined Argyle in early 1986, initially on loan, as the club pushed for promotion to the second tier. His excellent goalscoring record continued at that level and he became a club legend. In total Tynan scored 126 goals in 262 appearances for Plymouth. Former England manager Graham Taylor described him as one of the best natural finishers he had ever seen.

Tynan spent a season as manager of Goole Town in the Northern Premier League between 1993 and 1994.

As of January 2017 he was working as a taxi driver in Plymouth. He previously wrote a regular column about Argyle for local newspaper, the &quot;Plymouth Evening Herald&quot;. Tynan&#x27;s biography was published in March 2009, entitled &quot;The Original Football Idol: The Tommy Tynan story&quot; by Ryan Danes (Breedon Books ). He was also the subject of the 1990 book &quot;Tommy: A Life at the Soccer Factory&quot; by Richard Cowdrey (Bud Books )

<text>Robert Jack (4 April 1876 – 6 May 1943) was a Scottish football player and manager. Born in Alloa, Jack played in the Football League for Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and Glossop, and the Southern League for Plymouth Argyle and Southend United. He was an outside forward. Jack is Argyle&#x27;s most successful and longest-serving manager. During his 29 years in charge, the club won two league championships and established itself in the Second Division of the Football League. Jack also managed Southend for four years. His son, David, scored the first goal at Wembley Stadium.

==Playing career==
Jack began his career with Alloa Athletic, making his debut at the age of 15 and turning professional in 1893. He moved to Bolton Wanderers in 1895. He was Bolton&#x27;s leading scorer in the 1896–97 season with 11 goals. He played a total for 110 league and 15 FA Cup games for the club, scoring 29 goals. He left Bolton in August 1901, following a serious ankle injury. He joined local rivals Preston North End after scoring 29 goals in 110 league games for Bolton. He spent just one season with Preston, scoring 6 goals in 22 league games, before returning home for a short spell with Alloa at the start of 1902/03, then joining Glossop in late September. After a further 6 goals in 30 appearances he moved to Plymouth Argyle, becoming the club&#x27;s first professional in 1903. He made his Argyle debut in September 1903 against West Ham United in the Western League. In 1904–05, the club&#x27;s handbook described him as &quot;our famous flier, probably last season was the best in the player&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Managerial career==
Following the departure of Frank Brettell, Jack became player-manager of Plymouth Argyle in 1905, 1905–06, and led the club to third in the Western League and fifth in the Southern League. He left the club in the summer to take up the position of player-manager at Southend United. In his first two seasons with Southend they twice won the Southern League Second Division title, gaining election to the Southern League First Division in 1908.

He retired as a player at the end of the 1909–10 season and re-joined Plymouth Argyle as manager, remaining in charge at Home Park until April 1938 when he retired. During his 28 seasons in charge, Jack had guided Argyle to the Southern League title in 1913 and into the Football League in 1920. In their first season in the league they finished 11th in the Third Division, but finished runners-up in all of the next six seasons. They finally clinched the title and promotion in the 1929–30 season. In total, he took charge of 1,093 matches for the &quot;Pilgrims&quot;.

==Later life==
Jack lived in Southend during his retirement, occasionally working as a scout for his son David while he was manager at Southend. In addition to David, two of his other sons, (Rollo and Donald), also played professionally for Bolton Wanderers. Despite being Scottish, Jack represented England at bowls for several years, including being Captain. He won the English Bowling Association Singles Championship in 1926.

His ashes were scattered over the pitch at Home Park, Plymouth.

<text>Robin Michael Lawrence, commonly known as Lennie Lawrence, (born 12 December 1947) is an English football manager. He is assistant manager and non-executive director at National League side Hartlepool United.

Lawrence was a semi-professional at Croydon, Carshalton Athletic and Sutton United before becoming caretaker manager of Plymouth Argyle in 1978. He went on to manage Charlton Athletic, Middlesbrough (during their debut season in the Premier League), Bradford City, Luton Town and Grimsby Town and Cardiff City. He is one of a select few managers to have managed over 1,000 games.

Since 2005 Lawrence has worked at a number of clubs as either part of the coaching staff or in a Director of Football role. He joined Stevenage in June 2020 as a managerial advisor, to begin at either the restart of the 2019–20 season or the start of the 2020–21 season, following three years as the management consultant to Newport County, Lawrence left this role in early November 2020.

==Playing career==
Lawrence turned out at non-league level for Croydon, Carshalton Athletic and Sutton United during his semi-professional career.

==Managerial career==
===Plymouth Argyle and Lincoln City===
He came to Plymouth as Assistant Manager to Mike Kelly and when Kelly was sacked he got his first managerial appointment at Plymouth Argyle as caretaker and then worked alongside Malcolm Allison as Assistant. He later worked as a coach at Lincoln City, helping them win promotion from Division Four in the 1980–81 season.

===Charlton Athletic===
Lawrence moved to Charlton Athletic as reserve-team manager, and was later promoted to full-time manager in 1982. appointing Leicester City first team coach Eddie May, as his assistant. During his first few years in charge, the club was in a poor financial situation and came close to going out of business in 1984, and even left its home ground, The Valley, in 1985. Despite this, Lawrence and May, not only kept Charlton in the Second Division but gained promotion to the First Division in 1986, ending Charlton&#x27;s 29-year absence from the top-flight. With limited resources, he kept Charlton at this level for four years, before being relegated in 1990. He remained in charge for a further season.

===Middlesbrough===
Before the start of the 1991–92 season, Lawrence moved on to manage Middlesbrough. Under his stewardship, Middlesbrough finished Second Division runners-up in his first season as manager and gained promotion to the new Premier League but they struggled in 1992–93 and were relegated at the end of the season. Lawrence remained in charge until the end of the following season, his departure being confirmed on 2 May 1994. Upon leaving he helped young chairman Steve Gibson contact his replacement Bryan Robson.

===Bradford City and move to Luton Town===
Lawrence joined Bradford City at the beginning of the 1994–95 season. After a mid-table finish in his first season, Bradford were challenging for promotion in his second season in charge before he left to manage struggling Luton Town in the division above. Lawrence was unable to save Luton from relegation to Division Two at the end of the 1995–96 season, which saw them replaced by former club Bradford. He remained in charge at Kenilworth Road until 2000 when he was sacked by the new incoming Luton chairman, Mike Watson Challis, and replaced with former Luton fans favourite, Ricky Hill. 

===Grimsby Town===
He made a quick return to management shortly after the beginning of the 2000–01 season with Division One side Grimsby Town. They avoided relegation and made a reasonable start to the 2001–02 season, and caused an upset in the League Cup third round by knocking out holders Liverpool 2–1 after extra time at Anfield, scoring with a Phil Jevons wonder-goal in the last minute. However, he was sacked later in the season after Grimsby dropped to the bottom of the table.

During the opening weeks of the 2001–02 season, his Grimsby side had briefly led Division One, sparking hopes that he could repeat the promotion success he achieved at Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough with a much smaller club. However, these hopes were quickly extinguished as Grimsby&#x27;s form plunged.

===Cardiff City===
After a short while out of the game he joined Division Two side Cardiff City as a consultant. Owner Sam Hammam had made it clear to manager Alan Cork that he expected back-to-back promotions, which it did not look like Cork was going to deliver. Eventually Cork was sacked, and Lawrence took over the manager&#x27;s chair. In his first full season in charge, Lawrence took Cardiff to promotion after beating Queens Park Rangers in the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off final. He remained at Ninian Park for a further two years before being replaced in May 2005.

===Hartlepool United===
Following the sacking of Darren Sarll in October 2024, Lawrence was appointed caretaker manager of Hartlepool United. He was also previously caretaker manager the previous season. On 8 November 2024, he was permanently appointed manager of Hartlepool until the end of the season. On 3 February 2025, Lawrence announced that he had stepped back from his role to allow head coach Anthony Limbrick to take over as manager.

==Coaching career==
After acting as a consultant at Cardiff for a while, he was appointed Director of Football at Bristol Rovers, working alongside coach Paul Trollope in a two-tier managerial structure. In the pair&#x27;s first full season in charge, Bristol Rovers won promotion into League One after winning the League Two play-offs. He remained in this position until leaving the club on 12 May 2010, with their League One status still intact.

In August 2010 Lawrence joined non-league Carshalton Athletic in a football consultancy role, assisting manager Mark Butler. Four months later he was appointed technical director at Hereford United in League Two, to assist new manager Jamie Pitman.

On 20 January 2011, he was appointed assistant manager at Crystal Palace, to support new rookie manager, Dougie Freedman. In October 2012 Freedman became manager at Bolton Wanderers, and Lawrence was named as a joint-caretaker manager at Crystal Palace with Curtis Fleming, but within a week Lawrence rejoined Freedman at Bolton.

Lawrence&#x27;s first game at Bolton was a victory over former club Cardiff at the Reebok Stadium, in which a Martin Petrov penalty and a further goal from David Ngog gave Wanderers a 2–1 victory. At the end of the season, Bolton missed out on a Play Off place to Leicester City

On 3 October 2014, he left Bolton along with fellow coach Curtis Fleming following the sacking of Dougie Freedman as manager. He later joined Freedman as assistant manager at Nottingham Forest in early 2015.

During the Summer of 2016 Lawrence became assistant manager to Paul Trollope at Cardiff City. However, a poor start to the 2016/2017 season saw Paul Trollope sacked in the October at which time Lawrence also departed from the club.

==Consultancy roles==
On 21 March 2017, Lawrence joined Newport County as First Team Management Consultant to new manager Mike Flynn with Newport 11 points adrift at the bottom of League Two. A remarkable turnaround in the remaining 12 league games saw Newport complete the Great Escape and avoid relegation with a win against Notts County with a 89th-minute winner on the final day of the 2016–17 season. Lawrence departed County in June 2020 at the end of the 2019–20 EFL League Two season.
Lawrence announced his move to Stevenage in June 2020 and is set to start employment there &quot;either the recommencement of the 2019–20 season or the start of the 2020–21 season&quot;, with the club in the relegation spot at the end of the 2019–20 EFL League Two season. He serves as the Managerial Advisor to Alex Revell. In December 2020, Lawrence left the club.

<text>Kenneth John Hore (born 10 February 1947) is an English former footballer who played as a defender. He made 593 appearances in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City. He also served as manager at both clubs.

Hore appeared for Plymouth Argyle in midfield or as full back on 440 occasions. It was his task to mark Pelé when Santos lost to Argyle 3–2 at Home Park in March 1973. He finished his playing career at Exeter City.

He was appointed manager of Argyle on 1 October 1983. However, his managerial career was short-lived, owing to his lack of success in the league, he was dismissed on 19 November 1984.

In his 60-game stint as manager he won 17 games, lost 27 and drew 16. The highlight, for which he is most renowned, was leading Argyle to an FA Cup semi-final. A defeat to Watford meant that Argyle did not become the first team from the Third Division to reach the final.

He returned to Exeter City as coach and then caretaker manager before moving into management in local Non-League football.

<doc id="451234" wikidata="Q948505" url="?curid=451234" title="Neil Warnock">
<text>Neil Warnock (born 1 December 1948) is an English football manager and former player who is currently football advisor at Torquay United. He is also a television and radio pundit. In a managerial career spanning five decades, Warnock has managed sixteen different clubs from the Premier League to non-league. Within English football, he holds the record for the most promotions, with eight, and the most games as a professional manager, with 1626, beating the previous record of 1601 set by Dario Gradi.

Warnock played as a winger for Chesterfield, Rotherham United, Hartlepool, Scunthorpe United, Aldershot, Barnsley, York City and Crewe Alexandra, scoring 36 goals in 327 career league appearances. He retired from league football in 1979, aged 30. His playing career continued in the 1979–1980 season with non-league Burton Albion making nine appearances and scoring six goals until an injury cut his season short. He finished his playing career when returning to Burton Albion as player manager in the 1981–1982 season, playing in 29 games and scoring three goals, before concentrating on management for the rest of his time at Burton.

Warnock&#x27;s first managerial job was with non-League Gainsborough Trinity (1980–1981), he would subsequently manage Burton Albion (1981–1986) and Scarborough (1986–1989), winning promotion to the Football League with the latter in 1987. He then managed Notts County (1989–1993), leading them from the Third Division to the First Division in successive seasons, though he was sacked after the club were relegated the season before the First Division became known as the Premiership. After a brief spell at Torquay United (1993), he moved to Huddersfield Town (1993–1995), with whom he won promotion to the new First Division. He then resigned and joined Plymouth Argyle (1995–1997), leading them to the Second Division. After being dismissed, he spent spells with Oldham Athletic (1997–1998) and Bury (1998–1999).

In 1999, Warnock joined boyhood club Sheffield United, leading them to the semi-finals of the League Cup and FA Cup in 2003 and promotion to the Premier League in 2006. However, he resigned in 2007 after the club were relegated. He then took over at Crystal Palace (2007–2010), saving the club from relegation to League One. When the club went into administration, he left to join Queens Park Rangers (2010–2012), winning promotion to the Premier League with the club in 2011. He was sacked with the club in a precarious position and joined Leeds United (2012–2013). After being dismissed by Leeds following a poor run of form, he was without a club for almost fifteen months until returning to Crystal Palace, then in the Premier League, in August 2014. In December 2014, he was sacked by Crystal Palace after a poor start to the season, which saw the club in the relegation zone. After a month as caretaker at Queens Park Rangers, Warnock returned to Rotherham United as manager in February 2016. He was appointed manager of Cardiff City in October 2016, and led them to Premier League promotion during the 2017–18 season. Warnock became manager of Middlesbrough in June 2020, a role he held until his departure in November 2021. Warnock announced his retirement from football management in April 2022 after 42 years as a manager. He later came out of retirement in February 2023 to return to Huddersfield Town on a short-term contract, successfully guiding the club to Championship safety.

==Playing career==
Warnock started his professional playing career with Chesterfield in 1967, before moving on to Rotherham United, Hartlepool, Scunthorpe United, Aldershot, Barnsley, York City and Crewe Alexandra, making a total of 327 league appearances in an 11-year playing career. At Hartlepool, he won the club&#x27;s Player of the Season award in 1972. Whilst at Hartlepool, at the age of 24, Warnock was inspired to enter football management following his playing days, after a dressing down from manager Len Ashurst after an FA Cup defeat to Boston United. He finished his Football League career at Crewe Alexandra in 1979, aged only 30. His playing career continued at Burton Albion in 1979 which was cut short with an injury and continued when he re-joined Burton as player-manager in 1981–1982, before concentrating on management for the rest of his time at Burton.

==Managerial career==
===Early spells===
After being involved in Sunday League coaching, his first full managerial job was with Northern Premier League side Gainsborough Trinity in 1981. During his time at Gainsborough, Warnock also played for the club. Warnock&#x27;s Gainsborough side went unbeaten for the first home 13 games of the 1980–81 Northern Premier League season, a streak that was not equalled by the club until 2022. Under Warnock&#x27;s management, Gainsborough finished fifth in the Northern Premier League.

Following this he managed Burton Albion and Scarborough. At Scarborough he and Paul Evans, his assistant, won the Football Conference title in 1987, making them the first team to win automatic promotion to the Football League following the abolition of the re-election system.

Warnock had earlier spent time as a coach at Peterborough United, where he met Posh assistant boss Mick Jones. In late 1988, Warnock became manager of Notts County – then in the Third Division – with Jones as his assistant. Also joining the backroom staff were Warnock&#x27;s assistant at Scarborough, Paul Evans, and ex-Scarborough physio Dave Wilson. The four helped County achieve successive promotions to reach the First Division for the 1991–92 season, with Warnock turning down lucrative offers to manage Chelsea and Sunderland during this time. Warnock, however, was dismissed in January 1993 after County&#x27;s relegation had cost them a place in the new Premier League.

On 1 February 1993, Warnock arrived at Torquay United as &quot;consultant&quot;, where he was brought in to assist the team manager, Paul Compton. On 24 March 1993, Warnock officially took over as manager following the resignation of Compton, who reverted to his previous role of youth coach.

After saving the club from relegation from the Football League, Warnock left the club in May 1993 and was replaced by Don O&#x27;Riordan. Soon afterwards Warnock turned down the job at Lincoln City.

===Huddersfield Town===
Warnock resumed his partnership with Jones, Evans and Wilson at Huddersfield Town, his appointment coming in July 1993 where he replaced Ian Ross, who had departed Leeds Road one day previously. His arrival at the club coincided with Huddersfield&#x27;s final season at Leeds Road, which had been their home since their formation in 1908. 

Warnock quickly injected new blood into the side, signing goalkeeper Steve Francis, Darren Bullock, Ronnie Jepson, Tom Cowan and Pat Scully during his first season, all of whom would go on to become mainstays in the 1994–95 promotion season. He also showed faith in Centre of Excellence products such as Chris Billy, Simon Baldry and Andy Booth – a player then struggling to make the breakthrough who would go on to become a club legend in modern times. 

Despite these acquisitions, Town struggled for most of the 1993–94 season and Warnock was quick to offload fan favourites Iwan Roberts, Iffy Onoura and Chris Marsden while introducing a more direct style of play. He was deeply unpopular during those early months of his reign and it wasn&#x27;t until the run to the 1994 Football League Trophy Final (lost on penalties to Swansea City) that opinions began to change. This run coincided with an upturn in league form and a mass optimism further bolstered by the move to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium for the 1994–95 season. 

Warnock&#x27;s side won the Yorkshire Electricity Cup in late 1994 and were genuine contenders for automatic promotion until falling away in the final few games to finish 5th (the final play-off spot that season owing to league re-structuring). They triumphed on penalties over second-placed Brentford after two thrilling ties and went on to beat Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium. He quit Huddersfield just days after their promotion, but made a swift and surprising return to management at Plymouth Argyle, who had just been relegated to Division Three.

===Plymouth Argyle===
In his first season as manager of Plymouth Argyle, Warnock took the club to Division Three play-off glory after finishing fourth in the league. The play-off semi-final was a memorable affair – Argyle played Colchester United and were 1–0 down from the first leg, but won 3–1 at Home Park in the second leg. During this game, Warnock was sent off from the dug-out. Warnock responded to this by jumping into the crowd to watch the remainder of the match with the Argyle supporters.

The final was the first match that the club had played at Wembley. A header from Ronnie Mauge on 65 minutes gave Argyle a 1–0 win over Darlington and promotion to Division Two. In February 1997, Warnock was surprisingly sacked as Argyle manager despite his popularity with the supporters. Following this successful spell, Warnock rounded out the 1990s with two relegations, first at Oldham Athletic in the 1996–97 season, and then in 1998–99 at Bury.

===Sheffield United===

Warnock was appointed as manager of his boyhood club Sheffield United on 2 December 1999. In 2002–03, Warnock led Sheffield United to the semi-finals of the League Cup and FA Cup, only to lose to Liverpool and Arsenal respectively, as well as the First Division play-off final, with the Blades beaten 3–0 by Wolverhampton Wanderers. This was the first time in his management career that he had lost a play-off contest, as he had achieved four promotions via the playoffs in the 1990s.

In 2005, Jones resumed the partnership by taking up the assistant&#x27;s post at Bramall Lane, and at the end of the 2005–06 season, the club were promoted to the Premier League as runners-up in The Championship.

The Blades performed well in their expected relegation battle, and for a long time looked to be heading for survival. However, a turning point in the season occurred with victories for both West Ham United against Manchester United and Wigan Athletic on the final day of the season, condemning Warnock&#x27;s side to relegation. Warnock wrote in his autobiography that minutes after the final game of the season, actor and &quot;Blades&quot; fan Sean Bean burst into his office, blaming Warnock for the team&#x27;s relegation in a &quot;foul-mouthed tirade&quot; while Warnock&#x27;s wife and daughter were present. Bean denied this, calling Warnock &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;hypocritical&quot;, and arguing that he would never use such language in front of another man&#x27;s wife and children. Warnock resigned from the club following relegation to take some time out of football.

A major factor that caused Sheffield United&#x27;s relegation was that West Ham beat Manchester United on the final day of the season 1–0, with the goal scored by Carlos Tevez, whose contract was in question over third party ownership and who then signed for the champions the very next season. While all of this was happening, the Blades played Wigan at Bramall Lane and needed only one point to stay up; however, with the score at 1–1, a penalty was awarded to Wigan in injury time at the end of the first half – David Unsworth converted. The scoreline remained the same till the final whistle, sending the Blades back to the Championship after only one season.

===Crystal Palace===

Warnock spoke to Milan Mandarić about the vacant managerial role at Leicester City in the summer, but was never handed the job. Simon Jordan spoke to Warnock about taking over at Crystal Palace following the sacking of Peter Taylor and, after initially not being keen over the job, he returned to football management with Palace on 11 October 2007. Having his personal friend Simon Jordan as owner and chairman was certainly a help in him getting the job. Jones returned from his own sabbatical to join Warnock&#x27;s team as assistant. Under Warnock and Jones, Palace made a massive turn-around, moving from relegation battlers to promotion contenders in the space of six months, with Warnock&#x27;s use of youngsters a major factor in the improved performances and results. Palace made the play-offs in the end, but were beaten at the semi-final stage by Bristol City, who went on to lose to Hull City in the final.

Warnock stayed on for the 2008–09 season, but on taking the job a year earlier he had made it clear that the Crystal Palace job would be his last managerial role in football, with the club&#x27;s finances beginning to take a turn for the worse. The 2009–10 season saw Palace perform well despite being heavily restricted by the club&#x27;s poor financial position, which resulted in the club being placed in administration late in January. A ten-point deduction was imposed by the Football League for this. Crystal Palace&#x27;s administrator commented that Warnock was &quot;let go&quot; after telling the administrator he did not have the stomach for the fight to save the club.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 1 March 2010, Warnock joined Queens Park Rangers as manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal after agreeing compensation with Crystal Palace. His first match in charge was an emphatic 3–1 home win against West Bromwich Albion.

He helped QPR comfortably avoid relegation in 2009–10 – including a 2–0 win against former club Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Warnock was awarded Manager of the Month for August 2010. Using a new 4–2–3–1 formation built around playmaker Adel Taarabt (who went on to win the Football League Championship Player of the Year 2011), QPR topped the table for the majority of the 2010–11 season and on 30 April 2011 were promoted as Championship champions after a 2–0 win over Watford.

Despite leading the club to the Premier League for the first time in 15 years, he was sacked on 8 January 2012 after the 1–2 home defeat to Norwich City on 2 January 2012. The owner of QPR, Tony Fernandes, said that the club slipped down to a dangerous league position (17th) after recent results. Warnock said, &quot;Obviously I&#x27;m very disappointed but, having achieved so much, I leave the club with a great sense of pride. I have enjoyed my time here more than anywhere else and the QPR fans have been brilliant with me – they deserve success. My biggest regret is that the takeover didn&#x27;t happen earlier, because that would have given me the opportunity to bring in the targets I&#x27;d pinpointed all last summer and probably given us a better chance to succeed in the Premier League. The board at QPR are hugely ambitious and I wish them every success for the future. I&#x27;ve been involved in the game a long time and I will be spending the immediate future with my family and friends before deciding my next career move.&quot;

===Leeds United===
On 18 February 2012, Warnock joined Leeds as manager on a one-and-a-half-year deal taking him up to the end of the 2012–13 season. Before officially taking charge from caretaker manager Neil Redfearn he oversaw Leeds win 3–2 against Doncaster Rovers from the stands on 18 February with Warnock revealing he spoke to the players before the game and at half-time. On 28 February 2012, Warnock made his first signing as Leeds manager by bringing in Danny Webber, whom he managed while at Sheffield United.

Leeds would go on to finish 14th in the Championship, and during the summer of 2012, Warnock revamped the entire Leeds team with several new signings. Warnock started the 2012–13 season with a home win in the League Cup beating Shrewsbury Town 4–0. Leeds would then go on to beat Wolves 1–0 at Elland Road on the opening day of the Championship.

After a string of defeats and Leeds sitting five points off the relegation zone, Warnock parted company with the club on 1 April 2013.

===Return to Crystal Palace===
On 27 August 2014, it was announced that Warnock would be appointed for a second spell in charge at Crystal Palace following the departure of Tony Pulis. However, after a poor run of form, and Crystal Palace ending up in the bottom three, Warnock was sacked by the club on 27 December 2014. He was succeeded by Alan Pardew on 2 January 2015.

In 2015, Warnock returned to Queens Park Rangers as first team advisor. On 4 November, he was placed in temporary charge of QPR following the departure of Chris Ramsey from the club.

===Rotherham United===
On 11 February 2016, Neil Warnock was confirmed as the new Rotherham United manager for the remainder of the 2015–16 season, replacing Neil Redfearn. Warnock drew his first game in charge with a 0–0 draw against Birmingham City in a match which saw both Richard Wood and Joe Mattock sent off. He then lost his next two games, against Reading and Burnley, 2–0. Rotherham then went on an unbeaten run of 11 matches, including wins against Brentford (2–1), Sheffield Wednesday (1–0), Middlesbrough (1–0), drawing against Derby County 3–3 after being 3–0 down with eight minutes to go, and winning 1–0 at Portman Road against Ipswich Town. Warnock was awarded the Championship Manager of the Month for March. The final win of the run was at Milton Keynes Dons, where a 4–0 thrashing all but sealed Rotherham&#x27;s survival in the Championship at the expense of their opponents. The season closed with Warnock stating he wanted one last season managing in the Championship and Rotherham hoping to secure his services for 2016–17.

Despite not staying on as Rotherham manager beyond the end of the season, Warnock later said that keeping Rotherham in the division was the biggest achievement in his managerial career.

===Cardiff City===
On 5 October 2016, Warnock was appointed first team manager of Cardiff City. They finished in 12th place in the Championship in Warnock&#x27;s first season in charge. On 6 May 2018, Warnock guided Cardiff to promotion to the Premier League after a 0–0 draw against Reading. With this promotion Warnock became the first manager to win eight promotions in the professional leagues. 

In January 2019, Warnock said that he considered retirement following the disappearance and eventual death of Emiliano Sala, who he had signed for a club record £15m from FC Nantes that month. However, he was unable to keep the team up and Cardiff were relegated back to the Championship at the end of the season. Warnock left Cardiff on 11 November after just over three years as manager; his final match was a home loss to Bristol City. He described his time at Cardiff as some of the best days in his career.

===Middlesbrough===

On 23 June 2020, Warnock was appointed manager of Championship club Middlesbrough, with the club only outside the Championship relegation zone on goal difference after 38 games. He replaced Jonathan Woodgate who was sacked from his first job in management after less than a year in charge. In his first game in charge, on 27 June, Middlesbrough beat Stoke City 2–0 to climb to 19th in the league. Having been 21st in the table when Warnock took over, they finished 17th in the league. Although initially on a short-term contract, Warnock confirmed that he would continue as manager for the 2020–21 season. On 17 September 2020, Middlesbrough confirmed he had tested positive for COVID-19.

On 30 October 2021, he equalled Dario Gradi&#x27;s record for the most games managed in English professional football at 1,601 with a 2–0 loss to Birmingham City. Three days later he broke the record in the next match, a 3–1 loss away to Luton Town. On 6 November 2021, Warnock left Middlesbrough by mutual consent with the club having already identified his replacement. His assistants Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson also left the club.

On 9 April 2022, Warnock announced his retirement from management after 42 years in the dugout.

===Return to Huddersfield Town===
Ten months later, 74-year-old Warnock came out of retirement on 13 February 2023 after he was appointed manager of Huddersfield Town until the end of the 2022–23 season, returning as manager of the club almost 30 years after his initial appointment. 

He officially took charge of the club three days later, cutting short a holiday in the USA to return to management, when he replaced the previous head coach Mark Fotheringham. He joined the club with 15 games remaining of the 2022-23 season. His first game in charge was a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. On 4 May, Warnock guided Huddersfield to another season in the Championship by beating Sheffield United 1–0, despite having been seven points adrift of safety in March.

On 14 June 2023, Warnock signed a new one-year contract extension with the club. On 18 September 2023, the club confirmed in a statement that the home fixture with Stoke City two days later would be his final match in charge of the club. The change came after just eight matches. Huddersfield played out a 2–2 draw with Stoke City on 20 September with fans staying behind to applaud Warnock on his final game as manager. 

===Aberdeen===
On 5 February 2024, it was announced that Warnock would take charge of Scottish Premiership club Aberdeen until the end of the 2023–24 season, replacing manager Barry Robson. His first game in charge of Aberdeen, on 6 February resulted in a 2–1 defeat by Rangers away at Ibrox Stadium. His first home game as Aberdeen manager was on 10 February against Bonnyrigg Rose with Aberdeen winning 2–0 in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup. Warnock left Aberdeen on 9 March, following a 3–1 win against Kilmarnock in the quarter-final of the Scottish Cup. Those two cup ties were his only victories in eight matches as Aberdeen manager. Following Warnock&#x27;s departure, Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack said that the club were at an &quot;advanced stage&quot; of finding a longer-term appointment.

===Return to Torquay United===
On 14 May 2024, Warnock was appointed football advisor of National League South club Torquay United, assisting the new board following the takeover by the Bryn Consortium.

==Personal life==
Warnock was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. He has been a lifelong supporter of Sheffield United. He is married to Sharon and has four children, James, Natalie, Amy and William. In 2010 he lived in Richmond, London, and as of April 2020 he had a home near Stoke Climsland, Cornwall, and another in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute.

Warnock was in favour of Britain leaving the European Union. In a press conference after a Cardiff City game in January 2019, he remarked that: &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get out of it, if I&#x27;m honest. I think we&#x27;ll be far better out of the bloody thing. In every aspect. Football-wise as well, absolutely. To hell with the rest of the world.&quot;

Warnock is portrayed by Antony Byrne in the 2022 television film &quot;Floodlights&quot;, centred on Bury defender Andy Woodward.

<text>Alloa Athletic Football Club is a Scottish association football semi-professional club based in the town of Alloa, Clackmannanshire.

According to the official club history, they were formed as Clackmannan County in 1878, the football club shortly changing its name to Alloa Association and then to Alloa Athletic in 1883.

They compete in Scottish League One as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League.

The club was elected to the second tier of the Scottish Football League in 1921–22, earning promotion to the top flight in its first season after winning the Second Division. Below the top two tiers, Alloa Athletic has finished runners-up in the third tier a record nine times without ever winning, the most recent coming in 2016–17, when they failed to gain promotion to the Championship via the play-offs.

Alloa Athletic first entered in the Scottish Cup in 1883, its best result reaching the quarter-finals on three occasions, the last in 1988. The club&#x27;s best result in a national cup competition was reaching the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup thrice; winning in 1999 and finishing runners-up in 2001 and 2015.

The club&#x27;s nickname is &#x27;The Wasps&#x27;, referring to its home colours of black and gold hoops. Alloa Athletic has been based at Recreation Park in Alloa since 1895.

==History==
There is some dispute over the foundation date of Alloa Athletic. The official club version has the club being founded in 1878.

However, recent research has produced information that states that The Alloa Football Club was formed on 6 August 1880 at a meeting held in McGechaen&#x27;s Hall and instigated by James Rigg, who became the first captain. The club soon changed its name to &quot;Alloa Association&quot; which led to &quot;A.A.F.C.&quot; being misinterpreted by the Dunfermline secretary in October 1880, and &quot;Alloa Athletic&quot; being reported in the Dunfermline press. The club liked this name better, and so adopted it in 1881. It has often been claimed that the club was originally Clackmannan County. Although several of its players joined Alloa, this was a separate club, formed in September 1879, and who Alloa played several times during the 1880–81 season. 

Admitted to the Scottish Football Association in 1883, the club had to wait until 1921 to be elected to the Scottish Football League.

In 1906–07, the club were Scottish Football Union champions and won the Central Football League six years later, with two runners-up finishes in-between.

Alloa won the Scottish Football League Division Two title in their first season but were immediately relegated from the top flight the following season. Promotion was achieved again in 1938–39 but the onset of the Second World War saw the new season curtailed after just five games. When the leagues were re-organised after the war, Alloa were placed back in Division Two.
The 1950s and 60s were not overly successful for the Wasps although the club did provide the game with John White who went on to play for Scotland and Tottenham Hotspur (where he was part of their famous Double winning side of the 1960–61 season). Promotion was finally achieved again from the new Second Division in 1976–77 under the managership of Hugh Wilson. Relegation soon followed but the Wasps went back up 1981–82 under Alex Totten and managed a 6th-place finish in the First Division the following season. The team was relegated again a year later and a similar pattern followed after further promotions in 1984–85 and 1988–89.

Following further league reconstruction, Alloa found themselves as founder members of the new Third Division in 1995. Under Tom Hendrie, Alloa won this league in 1997–98, the club&#x27;s first championship win since 1921–22. The following season saw the team consolidate in the Second Division and also enjoy a 7–0 derby win over local rivals Stirling Albion.
Following the departure of Tom Hendrie to St Mirren, Terry Christie took over at Alloa and led the club to the Scottish Challenge Cup in 1999 followed by promotion to the First Division a few months later. The team was relegated at the first attempt but bounced back up in 2001–02. Relegation followed once more, this time on goal difference.

From 2003 to 2011 Alloa played in the Second Division. In the 2009–2010 season, Alloa contended for promotion to the Scottish First Division, but they lost out to Stirling by goal difference. In the 2010–2011 season, Alloa were relegated to the Third Division after finishing 9th in the Second Division league table, and failing to negotiate the end-of-season play-offs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Annan.

Days after, however, Alloa pulled off appointed former Aberdeen and Scotland midfielder Paul Hartley as player-manager.
On 7 April 2012, Alloa were confirmed as Scottish Third Division champions after beating Elgin City 8–1 in a home game at Recreation Park. Clyde defeated nearest rivals, Stranraer, 2–1 making it arithmetically impossible for the South of Scotland side to surpass the Clackmannanshire side&#x27;s points total with only 4 games remaining. Alloa secured back-to-back promotions the following season by finishing 2nd in the Scottish Second Division, and defeating Dunfermline in the play-off final, consigning The Pars to the third tier of Scottish football. As 2012–13 was the final season before SPFL reconstruction, Alloa started season 2013–14 in the newly formed Scottish Championship, the current name for the second tier of Scottish football. On 18 January 2014, Hartley resigned as manager following a 5–1 defeat to Dumbarton, with the club sitting eighth in the Championship.

On 7 March 2015, after slipping to a 1–0 defeat to Dumbarton left Alloa in the relegation play-off spot, manager Barry Smith immediately resigned. On 7 April 2015, Danny Lennon was appointed the new manager on a one-year deal. Lennon lasted just eight months with Alloa, resigning on 7 December 2015 after picking up just five points from 16 games. Lennon was replaced by Jack Ross, who despite improved performances was unable to prevent them from being relegated to Scottish League One at the end of the season. Ross&#x27; Alloa started the 2016–17 season with 5 wins in the first 8 matches. However, Ross left the club at the start of October 2016, signing as manager for Scottish Championship side St Mirren. Alloa Athletic player Jim Goodwin was appointed player/manager on 11 October 2016.

==Colours and crest==
Alloa&#x27;s home colours have been black hoops with either orange or gold stripes for the majority of its existence. The club&#x27;s first strip featured black and orange hoops in 1882 and rarely changed up until 1947 when gold was more commonly used with the black. Occasionally the club has adopted an all-gold or all-orange strip to replace the hoops and only once have these colours not been used; in 1897–98 the home strip was blue and white vertical stripes for a solitary season which was reverted to the traditional style the following year.


The first company to supply kits for Alloa Athletic was Litesome in 1977–78. The supplier for the 2018–19 season is Pendle, who have supplied the club&#x27;s kits since 1998–99. Past suppliers include Umbro, Matchwinner and Patrick. The club carried a sponsor on its shirts for the first time in the 1984–85 season; sponsored for two seasons by Maclays until 1987. Sterling sponsored the shirts for a further two seasons followed by short spells displaying Sinclair Haulage and then Campbell Homes until 1995. From the 1995–96 season to 2003–04 the sponsor was Alloa Advertiser which was replaced in 2004 by Machine Tool Engineers (MTE) who sponsored the shirt in 2012–13.

In the same year the home shirts were sponsored in 1985, the club displayed a crest for the first time. The crest reflected the club&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Wasps&quot;, featuring a black wasp on a basic gold shield with the club&#x27;s initials below. The design of the crest was edited slightly in 1994 with an almost identical wasp on a similar gold shield and the club&#x27;s full name was displayed below on a gold scroll banner. The crest colour varied along with the shade of colour on the strip and featured until 2010 when it was again redesigned. The new design features a large cartoon Wasp and is referred to by fans of the club as &#x27;the hornet&#x27;.

==Grounds==
Alloa Athletic has played its home games at several grounds over its history. When the club was founded in 1880 it was based at West End Park, a public park in the west of Alloa. The club moved to Gaberston Park in 1883 and to Bellevue Park in 1890. After five years at Bellevue Park, Alloa moved to Recreation Park in 1895, where the club has played its home games since.

Recreation Park is located in the east of Alloa and has a capacity of . Alloa Athletic played and won its first Scottish Football League match at the ground in August 1921; a 1–0 win against Stenhousemuir. In February 1955, the club&#x27;s record attendance was set at Recreation Park for a Scottish Cup fifth round match against Celtic when 15,467 spectators attended. The pitch at the stadium was replaced with artificial turf in 2007 and one weekend during the winter of 2010, a match at the ground between Alloa and Peterhead was the only fixture in Scotland to be played after all twenty other SPL and SFL matches were postponed due to freezing weather conditions.

Recreation Park was renamed Indodrill Stadium after a sponsorship deal with Indodrill EMEA Ltd was agreed to on Friday 12 September 2014. However, supporters of the club continue to call it Recreation Park or The Recs.

==Supporters==
Most record books list Alloa&#x27;s record attendance as 13,000 for a match against Dunfermline Athletic on 22 February 1939 in a Scottish Cup third round replay. However the recent book &quot;The Roar of the Crowd&quot; by David Ross shows the record attendance to actually be 15,467 for a Scottish Cup 5th round match against Celtic on 5 February 1955. Celtic won the game 4–2. In recent times, the record figure is a more modest 5,050 for a Second Division match against Cowdenbeath in May 1992. With the current capacity just over 3,000, the figure looks unlikely to be beaten.

Nearby club Stirling Albion are generally regarded as Alloa&#x27;s rivals

<text>Arbroath Football Club is a semi-professional Scottish football club based in the town of Arbroath, Angus. They currently play in Scottish League One. The club was founded in 1878 and plays home matches at Gayfield Park. They play in maroon strips and are nicknamed &quot;The Red Lichties&quot; due to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the Burgh&#x27;s harbour. The Red Lichties share a long-standing and fierce rivalry with local neighbours Montrose, as well as with fellow local sides Forfar Athletic and Brechin City.

==History==

===Record score===
The Red Lichties most notable and lasting accomplishment is to hold the world record for the biggest victory in World senior football, set on 12 September 1885 when they beat Bon Accord 36–0 in a Scottish Cup match, with a further five to seven goals disallowed for offside. Jocky Petrie scored 13 goals in that game, a record for the most goals by a single player in a British senior match.

===Recent history===
The Red Lichties have had mixed success in recent years. In the 1996–97 season they hit the bottom of Scottish senior football as they finished last in the Third Division. However, the following season they were promoted back to the Second Division. They spent three years at this level before winning promotion to the First Division. They finished 7th in their first season in the First Division, 13 points clear of relegation troubles. However, in the 2002–03 season, the Red Lichties struggled badly, and finished bottom of the table, 20 points adrift of penultimate side Alloa Athletic. In the 2003–04 season, the Red Lichties narrowly avoided back-to-back relegations, as they escaped the drop on the last day of the season. In 2004–05, however, there was no escaping a 3–0 defeat at Dumbarton on 30 April 2005, which consigned the Red Lichties to the Third Division for the following season.
The club rose from the depths of the Third Division to the heights of the First Division, then fell back down to the basement league in the next few seasons. However, under manager John McGlashan, the Red Lichties competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005–06 and 2006–07, although failing to gain promotion. They finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2–1 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semifinal. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Red Lichties ran out 2–0 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield Park thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Red Lichties goal was pummelled for much of the match and they spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red-carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Red Lichties hold on for a 2–1 aggregate win and promotion.

The Red Lichties managed to consolidate their position in Division 2 in 2008–09. The season had started well but a narrow defeat in the Scottish League Cup at Gayfield Park on penalties to Scottish Premiership side Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC, triggered a sequence of losses and the club found themselves in the bottom half of the table. The performances were boosted by loan additions such as Steven Doris, Craig Forsyth, ex-Scotland international Colin Cameron and they got results when it mattered. Safety was all but assured with a narrow 1–0 win over Queens Park at Hampden Park, courtesy of a fine Robbie Ross strike and a 2–0 victory over Stranraer at Gayfield Park with goals from Ross and Forsyth. A 2–2 draw against Peterhead and a 0–0 draw against Raith Rovers in May was enough to seal 7th spot.

During season 2009–10, results seemed to go into freefall after a 6–0 home defeat to St Johnstone in the Scottish League Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the Red Lichties to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the side threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semifinal, their season ended with a 2–0 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final. Weir resigned to take up the vacant position at Brechin City and was replaced, on 27 May, by Paul Sheerin.

On 23 April 2011, the Red Lichties defeated local rivals Montrose 4–1 to win the 2010–11 Third Division title, securing the club&#x27;s first senior honours in their 133-year history and a return to Second Division at their first attempt. The next few seasons in the third tier (renamed League One) were mixed. A tremendous first season playing lively attacking football saw them run champions Cowdenbeath closely, more than matching them in head-to-head encounters but lacking the professional edge to grind out other results and losing the final three. The Red Lichties finished on 60 points and went out in the playoff semifinal. In 2012–13, a fairly mediocre season saw them end up in 5th spot, on 52 points just pipped for the final playoff spot. One highlight was a 3rd Round Scottish Cup tie at Celtic Park, drawing 1–1 and then exiting in the replay after an equaliser was controversially ruled out.

Season 2013–14 was disastrous. After an average start, a run of 14 games without a win saw the Red Lichties end up bottom of the pile on 31 points and automatically relegated. The attack-minded and purist emphasis of manager Sheerin, who continued as player-manager, meant most fans stayed supportive. Some poor signings were costly. The Red Lichties thus experienced their fourth relegation in 11 years. Sheerin left Gayfield Park in June 2014 to take up a post with the Under-20 side at Aberdeen. Allan Moore was subsequently appointed with Todd Lumsden as assistant. On Sunday, 12 April 2015, after a string of poor results in which the side only won once in 16 games, Moore was relieved of his duties as Manager and Lumsden took the helm. The team had been sitting at the top of the table by eight points in December but ended up finishing third and subsequently lost 3–2 on aggregate to Queens Park in the play-off semi-final.

The team performed poorly under the management of Todd Lumsden in season 2015–16 which was reflected by a lowly league position. With relegation into the Highland League a real threat, Lumsden was sacked in March 2016. Dick Campbell was then appointed and was able to steer the team to safety, finishing 9th and ahead of East Stirlingshire who were subsequently relegated after losing the play off to Lowland League champions Edinburgh City.

The 2016–17 season saw a massive turnaround under the helm of Campbell. They spent much of the season in second place behind Forfar Athletic and in early February were 11 points behind their Angus neighbours after a 1–0 defeat by the Loons at Gayfield Park. The Red Lichties however clawed that difference back and after the penultimate game of the season&#x27;s 3–2 win against Elgin City, found themselves a point ahead at the top of the table with an away match against Stirling Albion remaining. An astonishing 1200 fans travelled to Forthbank to witness a 1–1 draw but with Forfar unexpectedly losing at home to Annan 4–2, the title was secured.

The 2018–19 season saw Arbroath line-up alongside the three other Angus sides in the same League for the first time in 25 years. Despite having to compete with full-time Raith Rovers, the club led from the opening day to win a second promotion in three years and a first league title win in the third tier. The Championship was secured on 13 April with a 1–1 draw at local rivals Brechin.

Returning to the second tier for the first time since being relegated in the 2002–03 season, Arbroath were never in any real danger of an immediate return to League One and spent most of the season on the fringe of the promotion playoff positions. Highlights of the League campaign included two victories against Inverness Caledonian Thistle and a 1–0 win against Dundee United, which made Arbroath the only side to defeat the eventual champions at Tannadice in the League that season. When the season was brought to an early conclusion, Campbell had led Arbroath to an impressive 5th-place finish.

Arbroath&#x27;s good form continued into the first half of the 2021–22 season; as of the beginning of 2022 they were sitting close to the top of the Championship, and in with a serious chance of gaining promotion to the top flight for the first time since the 1974–75 season. The club went on to finish in second place where they had found themselves &quot;minutes from immortality&quot; having led against Kilmarnock thanks to a James Craigen goal. The promotion playoffs loomed but the club missed out on promotion having lost to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in a penalty shootout at Gayfield.

The 2022–23 season saw the club retain their place in the Championship on the final day of the season, securing a point against Hamilton Academical at Gayfield Park.

Midway through the 2023–24 season, after losing to The Spartans in the Scottish Cup, manager Dick Campbell and his coaching team resigned from their positions. The club recruited former Ross County, Dunfermline and Cove Rangers manager Jim McIntyre before going on to suffer the worst injury crisis in the clubs recent history culminating in relegation back to League One after losing 5–0 to Ayr United on 13 April 2024.

The beginning of 2024–25 saw the poor run continue with Manager Jim McIntyre being replaced by co-player-managers Colin Hamilton and David Gold after losing 3–0 to Kelty Hearts on 17 August 2024.

==Stadium==
The Red Lichties Gayfield Park is not the club&#x27;s original ground, which was nearby and was known as Lesser Gayfield. The current ground is the closest to the sea in Britain, a traditional style ground exposed to the elements, where opposition fans mixing as they change ends at half time to stand behind the goal their side is attacking was observed until only a few years ago. There is terracing on three sides and enclosed stands on all four sides. On stormy winter days, waves beat on the walls surrounding the ground.

==Rivalries==

Arbroath&#x27;s main rivalry is with Montrose. The first meeting of the sides was in 1888 and Arbroath ran out 6–2 winners. They also have lesser rivalries with fellow senior Angus clubs Brechin City and Forfar Athletic. In the 2018–2019 season, all four senior Angus teams competed in Scottish League One.

<doc id="451239" wikidata="Q942124" url="?curid=451239" title="John Gregory (footballer)">
<text>John Charles Gregory (born 11 May 1954) is an English former football player and manager. He currently coaches Super League Kerala side Malappuram FC.

As a player, he was a versatile midfielder who started his career at Northampton Town and later played for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, QPR, Derby and Aston Villa. He won six caps for England.

He later managed Portsmouth, Plymouth Argyle, Wycombe Wanderers, Aston Villa, Derby County, Queens Park Rangers, Maccabi Ahi Nazareth, F.C. Ashdod, FC Kairat, Crawley Town and Chennaiyin.

==Playing career==
Gregory was born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, where his father, Jack Gregory, was playing for Scunthorpe United. Gregory made his professional football debut in 1972, at the age of 18, when playing for Northampton Town. He scored eight goals in 187 games over the next five years, before being transferred to First Division Aston Villa in 1977.

Gregory was a considerable success at Aston Villa. Despite playing two divisions higher than he had ever done before, he adapted well to First Division football and scored 10 goals in 65 games over the next two seasons. During his time at Villa, Gregory became the only player to play in every outfield position, wearing every number from 2 to 11 over his two seasons with the club, which remained a record, until Steve Palmer of Watford achieved this with shirt numbers 1 to 14 including playing in goal, in 1997/98 season.

In 1979, Gregory signed for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who had just won promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history. He scored seven goals in 72 games over the next two seasons before dropping down into the Second Division to sign for Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers.

He was part of the QPR side that reached the FA Cup final in 1982 (losing to Tottenham Hotspur in a replay) and won promotion to the First Division a year later as Second Division champions. He also helped QPR finish fifth and qualify for the UEFA Cup in 1984, but 1984–85 was a tough season for Gregory and his colleagues after manager Terry Venables departed to Barcelona and successor Frank Sibley was unable to keep up QPR&#x27;s good form. At the end of a difficult season in which QPR only narrowly stayed in the First Division, Gregory dropped down two divisions to sign for fallen giants Derby County.

Derby County, champions of England in 1972 and 1975, had fallen into the Third Division in 1984 and had failed to win promotion in 1984–85. Gregory was the centerpiece of their midfield as they achieved promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1985–86 season and to the First Division (as Second Division champions) a year later. Gregory stayed for one season as Derby County survived their first top flight season for nearly a decade, before announcing his retirement as a player. He played a total of 93 league appearances for the Rams, scoring 22 goals.

When taking over as caretaker manager of Plymouth Argyle early in 1990, Gregory re-registered himself as a player. After Argyle brought in Dave Kemp as a permanent manager, he stayed and played three games for the club. On departing from the Home Park club, he moved 300 miles north to play for Third Division Bolton Wanderers, making seven appearances before finally retiring as a player at the age of 36.

==Managerial career==
Gregory started his management career in the 1970s as a player/manager of amateur teams in Northamptonshire.

His first two professional spells in management (between January 1989 and June 1990), first with Portsmouth and then with Plymouth Argyle did not last long, with the latter being a caretaker appointment for just 2 games. Shortly afterwards, he linked up as a non-contract player with his former England and Northampton Town teammate Phil Neal, who was then manager at Bolton Wanderers.

He later worked under Brian Little on the coaching staff at Leicester City (1991–1994) and Aston Villa (1994–96) before moving back into management with Wycombe Wanderers in September 1996. Wycombe were bottom of Division Two when Gregory took over, but he oversaw a massive improvement in league form which saw the club climb up to a secure mid-table finish. However, the side he put together failed to progress any further, and they also suffered an embarrassing FA Cup exit to Basingstoke Town. Wycombe were performing well in February 1998 when Gregory quit to take the manager&#x27;s job back at Aston Villa. He helped improve Villa&#x27;s league form during the final 3 months of the 1997–98 season and they qualified for the UEFA Cup.

Halfway through the 1998–99 season, Villa were Premiership leaders but a slump in form saw the club eventually finish sixth in the final table and miss out on a first Premiership title. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost to Chelsea. Gregory quit in January 2002, with Villa going on to finish eighth that season.

Gregory&#x27;s next spell in management was with Derby County (January 2002 – March 2003). When he took charge at Derby they were bottom of the Premiership, but after winning both of his first two games at the helm it looked as though he might be able to save them from relegation. Unfortunately, seven defeats from their final eight fixtures saw Derby slip out of the Premiership after six years. The club&#x27;s financial problems meant that Gregory hadn&#x27;t purchased any players during the 2002–03 season, and their subsequent form in Division One was disappointing.

He was sacked in March 2003 for alleged misconduct but later won £1 million in compensation for unfair dismissal. Due to the ongoing lawsuit, Gregory was unable to apply for another managerial position for some time, so he spent most of the next three years working as a television pundit.

On 20 September 2006 he was unveiled as manager of Queens Park Rangers. He replaced Gary Waddock, who had stepped down following a poor succession of results that had left the club bottom of the Football League Championship. This appointment caused a schism among QPR fans, some of whom saw Gregory&#x27;s friendship with controversial chairman Gianni Paladini as a conflict of interest. After a decent start with successive victories over Hull City and Southampton, Rangers form dipped before winning three on the bounce (including a victory at (then) league leaders Cardiff City). Unfortunately, results did not continue to improve, and relegation looked a distinct possibility for Gregory&#x27;s men. However, following a fine late season run, QPR beat Cardiff 1–0 at Loftus Road on 21 April 2007 to secure their Championship status for another year. Gregory was sacked as QPR manager on 1 October 2007, after another string of poor performances.

On 8 December 2009, Gregory was appointed the manager of Israeli club Maccabi Ahi Nazareth. He led them to relegation.

On 18 May 2010, Gregory signed a three-year contract with Israeli Premier League Club F.C. Ashdod. He resigned from Ashdod on 18 April 2011, with the club facing the possibility of relegation.

On 13 June 2011, Gregory was appointed the manager of Kazakh club FC Kairat from Almaty, Kazakhstan. Kairat survived relegation at the end of the 2011 season to the second tier of Kazakhstan football.

Gregory had his contract as manager of FC Kairat terminated in December 2011, and in April 2012 was paid $120,000 in compensation.

On 3 December 2013, Gregory was named as the manager of Crawley Town, replacing previous manager Richie Barker.

On 27 December 2014, after being Crawley Town manager for just over a year Gregory stepped down as manager due to health problems; on the same day Crawley Town named Welsh former international and former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Dean Saunders as interim manager.

On 3 July 2017, Gregory signed as head coach of Chennaiyin in the Indian Super League.

On 17 March 2018, he led Chennaiyin to their second Indian Super League title by defeating Bengaluru 3–2 in the finals. On 19 March 2018, Gregory extended his contract for one year.

<text>Ayr United Football Club are a football club in Ayr, Scotland, who play in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Formed in 1910 by the merger of Ayr Parkhouse and Ayr F.C., their nickname is The Honest Men, from a line in the Robert Burns poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. They play at Somerset Park.

The club is currently managed by Scott Brown. The club have spent 34 seasons in Scotland&#x27;s top division, the last being 1977–78, and have been the champions of the second tier of Scottish football on six occasions, and of the third tier on three occasions. The club&#x27;s most successful manager, Ally MacLeod, went on to manage the Scotland national team. In 2018, Ayr United secured promotion to the Scottish Championship as champions of League One.

==History==
Ayr United were founded in 1910 by the merger of Ayr Parkhouse and Ayr F.C. Although Inverness Caledonian Thistle are also the product of a merger between two clubs, Ayr United are the only Scottish Football League club to have been formed from a merger of two existing league clubs.

The club&#x27;s honours include winning six Second Division titles (as the second tier championship) and a further three titles (as the third tier championship), most recently in 2017–18. They have not won any national cup competitions, although they were runners-up in the 2001–02 Scottish League Cup, and in the Scottish Challenge Cup in the first two seasons in which the competition was held: 1990–91 and 1991–92. They have won the local competition the Ayrshire Cup on 26 occasions, most commonly facing fierce local rivals Kilmarnock in the final. The Ayrshire Cup was last played for in season 1996–97, since when the competition has been suspended.

The club&#x27;s record scorer in a single season is Jimmy Smith, who scored 66 goals for Ayr in only 38 league matches in 1927–28 and currently holds the British goalscoring record for the most league goals scored in a single season. The club&#x27;s overall record scorer is Peter Price, who scored 213 times in competitive matches for the club between 1955 and 1962.

Former Scotland national team manager Ally MacLeod is regarded as the club&#x27;s most famous and most successful manager. He led the club on three separate occasions spanning 15 years, during which his teams recorded a record 214 wins, and won two league titles. In 1973 MacLeod was voted Ayr&#x27;s Citizen of the Year. More recent managers have also included the recent Scotland national team manager, George Burley, and former Scottish League Cup winner with Raith Rovers, Gordon Dalziel. Gordon Dalziel is the only manager to take Ayr to a National Cup Final on 17 March 2002 when they lost to Rangers 4–0.

Although the club has spent 34 seasons in Scotland&#x27;s top division, they have played in the second and third tiers of Scottish senior football since the 1977–78 season. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the club established a record of defeating teams which played in higher leagues in cup competitions, including Hibernian, Dundee, Dundee United, Motherwell, Dunfermline Athletic and four consecutive wins in cup competitions against their fiercest rivals Kilmarnock.

In 1988, Ayr United fan and businessman Sir David Murray offered to buy the club but the club&#x27;s shareholders rejected the bid by a vote of 60 to 56. The manager at that time, Ally MacLeod, had threatened to leave if Murray&#x27;s bid had succeeded: Murray went on to become chairman of Rangers, which coincided with a period of financial growth and league success for that club. During much of the 1990s and 2000s, a period of relative success both in league and cup competitions, the Ayr United chairman was local construction magnate Bill Barr. After Barr stood down, there were occasional boardroom struggles: the club suffered significant cashflow problems in 2004 although it survived with a combination of efforts. Prestwick-based Roy Kennedy failed to take over the club in 2005, and his company Kennedy Construction went bankrupt in 2006.

On 24 May 2009, Ayr won the Scottish First Division Play-off against Airdrie United 3–2 on aggregate to win promotion to the First Division. The following season, to celebrate the club&#x27;s centenary, Ayr United played in black and white hoops, the club&#x27;s original black and white kit. The away kit was crimson and gold with blue shorts to reflect the original club colours. But it was not a successful season. Ayr were relegated on the last day of the season after losing 2–1 to Morton.
The club bounced back the following season, winning promotion after defeating Forfar Athletic and Brechin City in the play-offs. That same season, they knocked out Hibernian in the Scottish Cup, winning 1–0 at Somerset Park in a replay.

In the 2011–12 season, Ayr enjoyed success in the 2011–12 Scottish League Cup, beating SPL sides Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Heart of Midlothian and St Mirren on their way to the semi-finals. Ayr United played Ayrshire derby rivals Kilmarnock in the semi-finals, the first time the two clubs had met at this stage. Kilmarnock won one-nil. But the league campaign was less successful, as United were relegated to the Second Division following a play-off defeat to Airdrie United.

Following relegation, United announced that Brian Reid&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. The club appointed Mark Roberts, top scorer in the previous three seasons, manager, with head of youth development, Davie White, as his assistant.
In January 2015, Ian McCall was appointed Ayr&#x27;s new manager, taking over from Roberts. After saving the club from relegation on the final day of the 2014–15 season, McCall led Ayr back to the Championship with a penalty shoot-out victory over Stranraer in the play-offs. Following their relegation in 2017, Ayr competed in League One but finished the season as Champions, regaining their Championship status at the first time of asking and winning their first league title in over twenty years in the process.

Ayr United enjoyed a good start to the Championship during the 2018–19 season, and found themselves leading the division for part of the season. However, injuries to key players resulted in a dip of form during the second half of the season. This poor form included a shock Scottish Cup defeat to Junior Champions Auchinleck Talbot. Ayr United eventually finish in fourth place, ensuring a place in the playoffs for promotion to the Scottish Premiership. However, they were beaten on aggregate by Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Key players Lawrence Shankland, Robbie Crawford and Liam Smith departed at the end of 2018–19 and signed for other clubs. Despite these losses, Ayr started the 2019–20 season well and found themselves in 2nd place in September. However, manager Ian McCall departed the club to return to Partick Thistle, ending his -year tenure. After a recruitment process lasting four weeks, midfielder Mark Kerr was appointed as manager on an 18-month contract.

The 2019–20 season was curtailed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. United were fourth place again at the time of curtailment and this stood as their final league standing. However, the playoffs were not contested due to the pandemic.

The 2020–2021 season was played behind closed doors due to the ongoing pandemic. Ayr United became embroiled in a relegation battle, and manager Mark Kerr was sacked in February 2021. He was replaced by ex-Scotland international and former Greenock Morton, Bradford City and Livingston manager David Hopkin.

Ayr United avoided relegation on the final day of the season after a draw with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

After a poor start to the 2021–22 season, David Hopkin resigned as manager. Following a spell as caretaker manager, Jim Duffy was appointed as manager on a contract until the end of the season. However, after a poor run of only one win in twelve league games, Duffy was sacked in December 2021.

On 7 January 2022, former Sheffield Wednesday and Dunfermline player Lee Bullen was appointed as head coach. Under Bullen&#x27;s leadership, Ayr United avoided the relegation play-offs and remained in the Championship.

In the 2022–23 season Ayr would clinch second place on the last day of the season, leapfrogging Queen&#x27;s Park who had lost out in a 5–3 thriller with Dundee for the league title. With Queen&#x27;s dropping 2 in goal difference it allowed Ayr to jump ahead into second due to their superior goal difference. This secured a place in the play-Off semi-final, however they were defeated by Partick Thistle in both legs.

==Crest and colours==

===Crests===

From 1948 to 2016, Ayr United used a crest which is a shield containing a Scottish saltire, with a scroll beneath stating the club&#x27;s name. In 2015, the club became subject to a legal action which claimed that the crest was an unregistered coat of arms. After it had emerged that the club&#x27;s badge was in jeopardy, a petition was started by fans and gained 700 signatures in 24 hours. The campaign gained support and many political, footballing figures and fans alike lent support to keep the Ayr badge intact. Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson stated &quot;If archaic rules are forcing the team to change the badge, then I think we need to look at those rules again. When John Scott brought this issue to my attention, I was happy to take it all the way to the UK Government.&quot; Another prominent name to join the campaign was former Ayr United and Bayern Munich striker and now a Sky Sports pundit on Soccer Saturday, Alan McInally, who said &quot;Badges are so important to football supporters and are treasured by everyone. They are worn with pride by grandfathers, dads and sons as they represent the club that they support. New stadiums get built and re-named but the club badge always stays the same”.

In 2016, after a fan competition to design a new club badge, a design incorporating most of the old features of the old badge was introduced.

===Colours===
The club&#x27;s original jerseys were red and gold, inherited from Ayr, with navy blue shorts and socks. In 1914, Ayr adopted black and white hoops, which were worn, with several modifications, up to 1930, when The &quot;Honest Men&quot; switched to a plain white jersey, with navy blue shorts and socks, worn until the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the club retained the white jersey, and switched back to the black shorts that had originally complemented the hooped shirts, kits similar to these were worn up to 1958, when Ayr had changed the black and white look for a white with a blue trim, used until 1963, when they once again reverted to the black and white hoops, that were kept until 1968 and not used again until the 2009–10 centenary season. From then until 1994, Ayr maintained white jerseys trimmed with black with either black or white shorts and socks, then switching to a striped shirt for a single season. The following season, Ayr wore an all-black jersey for the first time. Ayr went back to keeping an all-white jersey with either white or black shorts and socks until the centenary season. For the 2011–12 season, a half-black-half-white shirt was worn for the first time, however, Ayr FC had previously wore a similar jersey between 1899 and 1903. The 2013–14 season saw Ayr return to the white jersey, black shorts and socks for the first time since 1973.

==Stadium==

Ayr play their football at Somerset Park in Ayr&#x27;s New Town. One of the few surviving traditional stadium designs, it consists of the original Archibald Leitch designed stand, two covered terraces, and, on the North side of the ground, a new stand has been constructed which sits behind an area of older terracing. It has a capacity of . The first match to take place at Somerset Park was between the former Ayr and Aston Villa in a 3–0 victory for Ayr.

During the 1990s, the club&#x27;s chairman, Bill Barr, who owned and managed a company that built modern-style stadiums and stands for several other clubs around the UK, sought — and obtained — planning permission from South Ayrshire Council for a new 10,200 all-seated stadium at Heathfield in Ayr with an associated retail development. The Scottish Executive then &quot;called in&quot; the application and reversed the decision in respect of the retail development. Since the club considered this aspect of the proposal necessary to fund the construction, the development did not proceed.

In November 2006, United signed a contract with Barratt Homes for the sale of Somerset Park, having secured a site in the Heathfield area of Ayr. The site would house a new £29 million stadium seating 7,650 as part of a &quot;sports and business campus&quot;. The project ultimately did not proceed.

<text>Brechin City Football Club is a Scottish football club based in the town of Brechin in Angus. The club was founded in 1906 by players and officials of two local clubs, Brechin Harp and Brechin Hearts. The club currently competes in the Highland Football League after suffering three relegations in four seasons: from the Championship in 2018, League One in 2019, and League Two in 2021 following a 3–1 aggregate play-off defeat by Kelty Hearts.

The club&#x27;s highest achievements include winning the third tier of Scottish football three times, most recently in 2004–05 as champions of the Second Division. The club has also reached the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup on one occasion, losing 2–0 to Queen of the South in 2002. Brechin&#x27;s home ground is Glebe Park which can seat around 1,500 spectators in its capacity of 4,123. The ground opened in 1919.

==History==

===Early years===
The club was founded in 1906 by players and officials from two comparatively successful local junior sides – Brechin Harp and Brechin Hearts. A deputation from the Forfarshire Football Association had met with representatives of the local game at the Temperance Hall in City Road and managed to persuade them that Brechin would benefit from having a single senior club. Although Brechin Harp folded with the establishment of the senior side, Brechin Hearts continued as a viable and successful Junior side until the years of the Great War.

The club won its first important local honour, the Forfarshire Cup, in the 1909–10 season with a side that featured nine players from the town. The club moved to their Glebe Park home in 1919, a stadium which currently has a capacity of 4,123 (1,519 seated) and is famous for the hedge that runs alongside one side of the pitch.

===Joining the league===

The team was admitted to the Scottish league in 1923 with the formation of the original Third Division. However, City struggled, finishing bottom of the League in that first season. The club failed to make any headway in the doomed division and disappeared from the Scottish League at the end of the 1925–26 season along with most of the other teams in the division.

The club was not away long, as it returned to the League for the 1929–30 season following the departure of Bathgate and Arthurlie the previous season. Once again the club finished rock bottom. The club continued to struggle in the bottom half of the Second Division throughout the 1930s before going into hibernation during the Second World War. Indeed, so poor was the club at times that during the 1937–38 season the club were beaten 10–0 by Cowdenbeath, Albion Rovers and Airdrieonians.

===Post-war return===
Brechin City returned to action in the 1946–47 season in the C Division, a competition which did not have full membership of the Scottish Football League and which contained a mix of first teams and reserve sides. The club remained in this set-up until its success in the North-East section (the division having been restructured into two separate competitions) in the 1953–54 season saw it return to full League membership. Their first season back however resulted in another bottom placed finish, although it was not relegated. Despite this shaky return the club enjoyed a halcyon period of sorts in the late 1950s, securing four consecutive top half finishes (without managing to clinch promotion) as well as reaching the semi-finals of the 1957–58 Scottish League Cup.

The 1960s, however, saw the club struggling again, with yet another bottom place its fate for the 1961–62 season and again the following season with a further two wooden spoon efforts before the end of the decade. The unwanted feat of finishing bottom two years in a row was repeated in 1972–73 and 1973–74 as Brechin City continued to be one of the weakest sides in Scottish League football.

===New Second Division===
The club finished 17th out of 20 in the 1974–75 season and as such was placed in the new Division Two, which was the third tier of the restructured League. The new set-up suited the club little better as they remained in and around the bottom. However a mid-table 1979–80 season ushered in something of a change in fortune as the club began to challenge for its first promotion as full League members. With both a new stand and floodlighting added to Glebe Park, the club played with a new ambition until finally breaking its duck with a title win in the 1982–83 season. Under the chairmanship of David Will, the then Scottish Football Association vice-president and a future vice-president of FIFA, and the player-management of ex-Dundee stalwart Ian Fleming, the club pipped Meadowbank Thistle to the title by one point.

===The 1980s===
Under Will&#x27;s progressive leadership City found its feet in the First Division and challenged near the top in the 1983–84 season before finishing in a creditable fifth place. However 1986–87 season saw the club narrowly relegated ahead of Queen of the South although undaunted it challenged at the top of the Second Division before winning the title for the second time in 1989–90 season again by one point, this time ahead of Kilmarnock.

===The 1990s===
Brechin&#x27;s return to the First Division was to prove somewhat inauspicious as it was immediately relegated, although 1992–93 season saw it promoted again, this time as runners-up. Again, however, it was relegated immediately and worse was to follow as it suffered consecutive demotions, dropping into the newly created Third Division, the fourth tier of League football. However once again there was an immediate change as the club finished second in this division for the 1995–96 season, ensuring promotion and five changes of division in five frantic seasons. The club was relegated again after two seasons and finished the decade back in the bottom division.

===The 2000s===
In the new millennium the club experienced a revival in fortune under Dick Campbell, winning the Third Division in 2001–02 season after a narrow miss the previous season. The push continued the following season as the club finished runners-up to secure a second consecutive promotion with Chris Templeman bagging 21 League goals for the club in a season in which it was also beaten Scottish Challenge Cup finalists. However the First Division proved too much for the part-timers as they were immediately relegated. However the topsy-turvy existence of Brechin City continued as the following season it again won the Second Division title, although success was soured by the departure of Campbell to Partick Thistle. Without Campbell the team struggled even more than before in the First Division and managed only two wins all season on its way to relegation under Ian Campbell, the twin brother of their previous manager. The mood was lifted somewhat by the club&#x27;s centenary celebrations which included a 2–2 draw in a prestige friendly against English Championship side Ipswich Town at Glebe Park.

The club, led by the management of Michael O&#x27;Neill and with the goal threat of Iain Russell, finished fourth in the following season&#x27;s Second Division and under new arrangements this entitled it to a place in promotion play-offs, although a 6–1 aggregate mauling at the hands of Airdrie United put paid to any hopes of another immediate return to the second tier. 2007–08 proved somewhat disappointing as City missed out on the play-offs by finishing sixth, and on 31 January 2008, was thrown out of the Scottish Cup after fielding two ineligible players in its 2–1 fourth round replay win over Hamilton Academical. Hamilton Academical took their place in the fifth round. 2008–09 proved a season of upheaval as O&#x27;Neill left on 15 December 2008 to take charge of Republic of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers, although the experienced Jim Duffy followed him into the hotseat on 9 January 2009 and led the club to third place and a play-off place. Once again however the play-offs did not prove rewarding as Ayr United recorded a 5–2 aggregate win over the club to leave Brechin City in the Second Division for 2009–10. Under Duffy, Brechin made the play-offs again the following season but Duffy resigned after Brechin were beaten 3–0 on aggregate by Cowdenbeath.

===The 2010s===
For the 2010–11 season the club appointed Jim Weir as manager, departing Arbroath at short notice after leading them to relegation. That season, Brechin reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish Cup, drawing 2–2 with SPL side St Johnstone at Glebe Park, resulting in a replay which City eventually lost 1–0 after a valiant effort.

On 14 May 2011, Brechin beat Cowdenbeath 4–2 on aggregate, in the 1st Division play-offs semi-final, to set up a final with Ayr United, in which the victors secured First Division football for season 2011–12. In the first leg at Somerset Park the match ended 1–1 however Ayr won the second leg at Glebe Park 2–1 meaning that Brechin stayed in the Second Division.

The club appointed Forfar Athletic defender Darren Dods as player/manager in June 2015. Dods&#x27; first season with the club saw Brechin remain rooted to the bottom of League One for the majority of the 2015–16 season, winning just four of their first twenty-six matches. However, a late burst of form saw the club win eight of the final ten games, pushing the side clear of the relegation and play-off positions to finish the season in seventh. Dods&#x27; second season was in stark contrast to the first, with Brechin remaining in the top four for most of the season 2016–17. Finishing the season in fourth, the club then went on to win promotion to the Scottish Championship for the first time in 11 years, defeating Raith Rovers and Alloa Athletic in the Championship play-offs.

===Back to back relegations===
Brechin&#x27;s return to the second tier proved short lived; having not won a league match and with four points, the club were relegated on 24 March 2018 following a 2–0 loss to Greenock Morton.

Brechin ended their Championship campaign with a 1–5 loss to Queen of the South at Glebe Park. This meant the club became the first senior Scottish side in 126 years to fail to win a single game in a league season. Brechin ended the 2017–18 season with no wins, four draws, 32 defeats and no away points at all.

Brechin went into the 2018–2019 season as favourites for promotion; however they ended up in yet another relegation battle which resulted in the club finishing bottom of League One and back to back relegations.

The 2019–20 season again turned into a battle to stay off the foot of the table and dodge a play-off that could result in relegation to the Highland League. The club were at the bottom of League Two when the league was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and avoided the play-offs due to the league eventually being curtailed.

=== Out of the SPFL ===

On 23 May 2021, Brechin lost 3–1 on aggregate to Lowland League side Kelty Hearts in the relegation playoffs, dropping down to the Highland League, the club&#x27;s first spell out of the national leagues in 67 years. In June 2021, after the departure of player/manager Michael Paton, the club appointed Andy Kirk to the role of club manager. In the club&#x27;s first season in the Highland League, they secured a respectable third-place finish.

The following season, they won the title after beating closest challengers, Buckie Thistle, 0–2 on the final day of the campaign.

On 6 May 2023, Brechin were defeated 3–4 on penalties by Lowland League outfit The Spartans in the pyramid play-offs. They headed into the 2nd leg with a 1–0 deficit to turn around, despite winning the game 3–2 and making it 3–3 on aggregate; they fell short in the penalty shootout.

The 2023-24 Season saw Brechin and Buckie Thistle the front runners for the title. The season came down to the final day for the 2nd year in a row. At the end of the campaign, Brechin were beaten to the title by rivals Buckie Thistle on goal difference, after both teams claimed 81 points for the season. Buckie Thistle were due to compete in the pyramid play-offs but were ineligible due to licensing issues.

<text>Berwick Rangers Football Club is a football team based in the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed in England, who play in the Scottish football system. Founded in 1881, they currently play in the , the fifth tier of Scottish football, despite being based in England. They were the only club from outside Scotland in the Scottish Professional Football League until their relegation in 2019.

The club play at Shielfield Park, which has a capacity of just over 4,000.

==History==
Berwick Rangers was officially formed on 7 January 1881 after a match was played in the town between a team of millworkers from Dunbar and a team of railway clerks from Newcastle. For much of the club&#x27;s history it was believed that they had formed in 1881, though recent research indicates that 1884 is the more likely date of formation. Their first competitive match was against another team from Berwick, &#x27;The Royal Oaks&#x27; on 16 February 1884. Berwick Rangers won the match by &quot;one goal to nil&quot;.

Berwick Rangers affiliated to the Scottish Football Association around 1905 and entered the Scottish Border League in 1905, followed by the Border Amateur League (1908–09). Recent research has revealed that the club joined the East of Scotland League immediately after the First World War, a new competition formed to replace the Borders League. The club made several attempts to join the North Northumberland League but were rebuffed. It was not until 1951 that they were admitted to Scottish Football League C Division (North &amp; East). This third tier, made up largely of reserve sides, had been created in 1946 and was regionalised in 1949. The division was scrapped in 1955 and Berwick, along with the other non-reserve teams, were placed in an enlarged Division B (renamed Division Two the following season). Berwick Rangers have played in the Scottish football league system ever since, despite low attendances and frequent financial problems.

Following its foundation, the club had had a nomadic existence before eventually settling down at Shielfield Park in 1954.

A notable early success was a 3–0 win over Dundee in the Scottish Cup in 1954 in a run which saw them reach the quarter-final, only to lose to Rangers 4–0. Ten years later they reached the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup, losing to Rangers 3–1.

Arguably their greatest success came in 1967, when they beat Rangers 1–0 in the Scottish Cup under the management of player manager Jock Wallace. It was the highlight of a memorable cup run, which had seen them break a club record in beating Vale of Leithen 8–1 in the first round. The result sent shockwaves around Scottish football and led to a number of the Rangers players leaving Ibrox; it was also the club&#x27;s greatest home attendance of 13,365. They were paired with Hibernian in the following round but lost 1–0 in front of a crowd of nearly 30,000.

The following years saw little progress until the late 1970s, when under the management of Dave Smith they won the Division Two title in 1979. Despite that success they were unable to build and suffered a slow decline through the 1980s. The nadir came in season 1988–89 when they were nearly bankrupted and the club were locked out of Shielfield, having to play their games elsewhere. In 1988 Jim Jefferies took over as manager and led the team to a club record 21 game unbeaten run.

The club weathered this and other crises in the early 1990s, narrowly avoiding going into administration in 1994. Later in the decade Berwick enjoyed a bit more in the way of success only missing out on promotion to Division One due to league reorganisation in 1994. They were relegated to Division Three in 1997 but under the management of Paul Smith regained promotion in 2000. Under Smith&#x27;s stewardship they took both Rangers and Heart of Midlothian to replays in the Scottish Cup.

They were again relegated to the Third Division in 2005, and narrowly missed out on an instant return to the Second Division the following season, this time losing to Alloa Athletic in the Second Division play-offs. Despite losing a good deal of the squad to other clubs in the close season, manager John Coughlin exceeded expectations by rebuilding the team and guiding them to the Third Division championship in 2007, their first title in 28 years, in a season which also saw a new record for consecutive league wins.

John Coughlin resigned as Berwick Rangers manager after a 3–0 home loss to Alloa Athletic on 6 October 2007. He left with Berwick at the foot of the table with only 5 points after 9 games. Cowdenbeath coach Michael Renwick was appointed new manager on 25 October 2007. However, after a dismal season which saw Berwick finish bottom and ship 101 goals, including a 9–2 defeat to Peterhead, Renwick was relieved of his duties on 19 April 2008. The official website reported on 12 May 2008 that Camelon manager Allan McGonigal would take over as manager. He resigned from his post on 13 November 2008. His announcement came in the wake of a deal which saw a fan led consortium take control of the club. On 27 January the consortium concluded their deal to buy the club.

Following McGonigal&#x27;s resignation Jimmy Crease became manager for the fourth time, initially as a caretaker, but then on a permanent basis in December 2008. Following a 4–0 defeat to Deveronvale in the second round of the 2011–12 Scottish Cup Crease stood down as manager. Player Ian Little was named caretaker manager until the end of 2011 when his position was to be reviewed. On 28 December 2011, Little was given the managers job at least until the end of the 2011–12 season. On 26 August 2012, Rangers FC played their first ever league game in England when they faced Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park, similar to when the previous Glasgow Rangers played their famous cup game in 1967. Berwick Rangers earned another famous result, with a 1–1 draw – Fraser McLaren scoring in the 62nd minute of the game.

On 12 January 2014, Berwick Rangers sacked manager Ian Little, with the club third bottom in Scottish League Two. A few days later Colin Cameron was appointed as the club&#x27;s new player manager.

On 18 May 2019, Berwick Rangers became the second club after East Stirlingshire to be relegated out of the SPFL pyramid and into the Lowland Football League, after a 7–0 loss on aggregate to Highland League champions Cove Rangers.

The Berwick Rangers Community Foundation was established in 2020.

Berwick Rangers record league performance was an 11–0 win over Vale of Leithen in the Scottish Lowland League on the 9 October 2021.

==Status==
Berwick Rangers are one of the few teams in the world to play in a football league system other than their own country&#x27;s.

Berwick-upon-Tweed is south of the Scottish border but is still closer to the Scottish capital Edinburgh than it is to Newcastle upon Tyne, the nearest major city on the English side of the border. It is also on the same latitude as the southern part of Glasgow. The town had previously been part of Scotland and changed hands many times until finally being taken by England in 1482. The club also formerly played in the East of Scotland League, which contains other nearby Borders teams, prior to joining the Scottish League.

There is also some controversy over the town&#x27;s identity. Berwick&#x27;s status as a club located in England led to the anomaly of their being the only team in the Scottish leagues who were subject to the implementation of the Taylor report following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.

<doc id="451243" wikidata="Q1059415" url="?curid=451243" title="Clyde F.C.">
<text>Clyde Football Club is a Scottish semi-professional football club who play in Scottish League Two. Formed in 1877 at the River Clyde in Glasgow, the club host their home matches at New Douglas Park, having played at Broadwood Stadium from 1994 until 2022.

Their biggest accomplishments were winning the Scottish Cup on three occasions: 1939, 1955 and 1958; they reached the final a further three times, all during a long period based at Shawfield. They have not played in the top division of Scottish football since 1975.

The club have been managed by Darren Young since October 2024.

==History==
===1877–1898===
The Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the River Clyde at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the Glasgow press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day. This is how the SFA recorded Clyde&#x27;s origins:

Sitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile work with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged, it appears the ground consisted of a grandstand running north–south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.

Today this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area, so it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield got initially shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.

The club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. was a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde&#x27;s Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.

The first mention of Clyde was in Monday&#x27;s Evening Times of 17 September 1877:
Although most fixtures were informal, the Scottish Cup had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup and the Glasgow Cup which in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. Third Lanark were the visitors once again, and triumphed 1–0.

On 6 March 1883, the Glasgow Football Association was established (formed to compete with the older - 1877 - rival Edinburgh Association), with Clyde one of the six clubs represented at that first meeting. The club are one of only three founding members clubs still in existence today (with Queen&#x27;s Park and Rangers).

Clyde joined the Scottish Football League in 1891, its second edition. Following acceptance, Vale of Leven provided the opposition for Clyde&#x27;s first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to the format Clyde triumphed 10–3, and a mid-table finish saw the club complete a confident season in League football. While it was an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities, and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League. The club had the pitch dug up in the off season in 1893 to have the clayey surface replaced by ashes to lend additional facilities to the draining powers of the field.

The club enjoyed cup success in local competitions as the 19th century drew to a close. The team won the North Eastern Cup and Graham Cup four times apiece. Both tournaments featured teams from the East End of Glasgow. However, Clyde endured a terrible final season at Barrowfield, finishing bottom of Division 1 with only 5 points, but remained in the top division. The last action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of Sunderland on 30 April 1898, ending in a 3–3 draw.

===1899–1919===
The club left Barrowfield in 1898 and purchased some open ground (Shawfield) directly across the river between the Glasgow neighbourhood of Oatlands and the Lanarkshire town of Rutherglen. The move was largely financed by the club becoming incorporated and issuing shares in &quot;The Clyde Football Club Limited&quot;. On the eve of a new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about . A grandstand seating of 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well underway.

Local rivals Celtic provided the first opposition at Shawfield Stadium on 27 August 1898. An attendance of 10,000 witnessed a goalless draw and return gate receipts of £203. The 1899–1900 season saw the team relegated by finishing bottom of top division.

They were Division Two champions in 1904–05 (and runners up in 1903–04 and 1905–06), but there was no promotion until the latter second-place finish. Automatic promotion and relegation was not established until 1921. The following seasons up to World War I would be far more successful and represented the most consistent period of success for the club.

From 1908 to 1913, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the Scottish Cup final in 1910 and 1912. The team placed third in 1908–09 (three points behind champions Celtic) and in 1911–12 and reached further semi finals (in 1908–09 and 1912–13).

The 1910 final was a bitter disappointment. For 83 minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson &amp; Blair; Walker, McAteer &amp; Robertson; Stirling &amp; McCartney; Chalmers; Jackson &amp; Booth) held a 2–0 lead (Chalmers and Booth both scored). However, Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dundee then netted a last minute equalizer from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey and ended goalless after extra time, but with Dundee looking physically stronger. Chalmers struck after three minutes to give Clyde a 1–0 lead in the third match. Dundee equalized before half time, and as Clyde looked jaded, John Hunter won the cup for Dundee. The 1912 final was a 2–0 defeat to Celtic.

International honours were awarded to Clyde for the first time in March 1909, as William Walker represented Scotland against club mate Jack Kirwan of Ireland at Ibrox (5–0 to Scotland). The Glasgow Charity Cup (in 1910) and Glasgow Cup (in 1914) were won for the first time. Both were highly prestigious competitions before European football was introduced. All six clubs (Celtic, Clyde, Partick Thistle, Queen&#x27;s Park, Rangers and Third Lanark) were more often than not resident in Division One.

In September 1914, a fire destroyed the grandstand, and with it much of the club&#x27;s early history. After the war broke out in November 1914, the Scottish League would continue playing. Many players signed up for &#x27;King &amp; Country&#x27; – some never returned, such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots) – and teams like Clyde found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides and the League eventually reduced back to a single division.

===1920–1945===
The club had managed to sustain football through the war years, but the Scottish League continued through 1919–21 with only one division. Division Two restarted in 1921–22, with automatic promotion and relegation adopted. Benefits were evident for ambitious teams, but the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.

Relegated in 1923–24, Clyde spent two seasons playing teams like Armadale, Arthurlie, Bathgate, Bo&#x27;ness, Broxburn, and King&#x27;s Park until promotion (and another Glasgow Cup) in 1925–26. From 1926 to 1939, Clyde remained a Division One club, as the team maintained a respectable mid-table status. International honours returned to Shawfield, as Danny Blair was a prominent Scotland full back of this era and leading goalscorer Billy Boyd (with 32 goals in 1932–33) earned two international caps.

Liquidation was narrowly averted in 1930. Greyhound racing was booming in the 1920s and many clubs used this a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde, but animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was dead set against the sport in general. Chairman John McMahon would not let go of the idea. After years of wrangling, the Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Ltd started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde.

The team conceded a solitary goal on the run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Clean sheets were kept against St Johnstone (2–0), Dundee (0–0 at Dens Park, followed by 1–0 in a replay), city rivals Third Lanark (1–0), and the Hibernian semi final match (1–0 at Tynecastle). The single goal against came at Rangers in the 3rd round, where prolific centre forward Willie Martin set a record for an opposition at Ibrox by scoring all four goals in a 4–1 win.

Clyde (Brown; Kirk and Hickie; Beaton, Falloon and Weir; Robertson and Gillies; Martin; Noble and Wallace) faced Motherwell, who had scored the most goals on route to the final, in front of 94,000 at Hampden on 22 April 1939. After losing the coin toss, Clyde goalkeeper Brown was under the most pressure early on. Assisted by a Robertson delivery, Wallace fired the opener in the roof of the net. Despite further opposition pressure before the interval, Martin doubled the lead with an opportunistic strike after the break. Late goals from Noble (netting from a rebound) and Martin (assisted by Noble for his second) sealed an emphatic 4–0 win and a maiden Scottish Cup triumph.

War with Nazi Germany caused the suspension of the Scottish League in 1939–40, and all players&#x27; contracts declared void. Unofficial competitions soon restarted with an East/West regional split. The geographical separation meant Clyde were placed in the Southern League. Runners up behind champions Rangers in 1940–41 (by three points), the team would continue to perform relatively well in wartime competitions.

A second major cup competition, the Scottish League Cup would be inaugurated in 1946. It was the then Clyde and SFL chairman John McMahon who donated the trophy that is still awarded to the winners of the competition to this day.

===1946–1969===
The club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Also in 1953, future Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Stanley Matthews (and Blackpool teammate Ernie Taylor) turned out for Clyde against Everton in a benefit match at Celtic Park in Belfast.

Leslie Johnston, a then Scotland internationalist, twice broke the Scottish transfer record as a Clyde player in the 1940s.

The team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth Scottish Cup final in 1948–49. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938–39, their opponents Rangers ran out comfortable 4–1 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at Hampden, with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde&#x27;s consolation goal. It was claimed that both Rangers penalties were of a dubious nature.

The 1950s began with relegation from Division A in 1950–51, but returned as Division B champions in 1951–52. The team repeated the feat in 1955–56 and 1956–57. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to solid finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was Huddersfield Town in a friendly match. Huddersfield won 3–2. Domestic cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the Scottish Cup in 1954–55 and 1957–58 and were beaten semi-finalists in 1955–56 and 1959–60. They also reached Scottish League Cup semi-finals in 1956–57 and 1957–58, but lost on both occasions to Celtic.

The route to the 1954–55 Final began with three straight home victories in the competition against Albion Rovers (3–0), Raith Rovers (3–1) and Falkirk (5–0). Aberdeen provided Clyde&#x27;s semi-final opponents. After a 2–2 draw at Easter Road, a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde into the final. On 23 April 1955 at Hampden in front of over 96,000, Celtic, installed as firm favourites, provided the opposition in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live. Without forward McPhail and goalkeeper Wilson, Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, Murphy &amp; Haddock; Granville, Anderson &amp; Laing; Divers &amp; Robertson; Hill; Brown &amp; Ring. Celtic held a 1–0 lead with three minutes left until Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, with the same Clyde line up, a Tommy Ring goal was enough to win a more open affair.

The first half of the League Cup tie with Aberdeen at Shawfield on 3 September 1955 was also televised live (a competition first) by the BBC as an experiment.

Back at Hampden on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a strong Hibernian team, Clyde lined up:- McCulloch, Murphy &amp; Haddock; Walters, Finlay &amp; Clinton; Herd &amp; Currie; Coyle; Robertson &amp; Ring. A deflected strike from Coyle in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1–0 win and a second Scottish Cup in four seasons and third overall. Fourth place in the final league table and another League Cup semi-final spot completed an impressive season in 1957–58. Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were confirmed in the final Scotland squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional squad, but did not make the final cut.

Clyde gained entry into the Friendship Cup in 1960. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from England, France and Scotland, with results aggregated to provide the &#x27;best&#x27; League. It proved to be an unpopular format and ended in 1962. For the record, Clyde was drawn against RC Lens of Ligue 1 and beat them 4–0 away and 2–1 at Shawfield. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in 1960–61 and 1962–63 were followed by immediate promotions in 1961–62 and 1963–64, the former as Division Two champions.

At home to Celtic on 10 September 1966, the Clyde team unusually started the match with squad numbers instead of the traditional (1–11) positional numbers on their shirts. The team actually returned from the interval with the routine numbering of 1–11.

The 1966–67 season led Clyde to their highest league finish in forty-five years and another Scottish Cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the Old Firm clubs. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club&#x27;s fortunes to date, European football will forever love denying itself. The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow; they were from Rutherglen. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde&#x27;s non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the Glasgow Cup. Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in 1968–69. The club journeyed on a 10-match tour of Rhodesia in 1969 and remained unbeaten (9 wins and 1 draw).

As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde was competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow&#x27;s slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in Bridgeton, Dalmarnock, Gorbals, Oatlands and Rutherglen were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde&#x27;s core support was drawn from these areas, and many of them have never returned to follow the team.

===1970–1993===
The club began the 1970s as in previous decades, with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with Hamilton Academical, who were in dire financial trouble and had resigned from the Scottish League. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, Dumbarton of Division Two made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in Division One at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back-door entry into the top division.

After relegation in 1971–72, many club legends such as Harry Glasgow, Sam Hastings, Tommy McCulloch, Graham McFarlane and Eddie Mulheron moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in 1972–73. Two years in the top division until another relegation in 1974–75 would be their last in the top division to date. The Premier Division was introduced ahead of the season 1975–76 as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974–75 meant Clyde was never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the First Division.

The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future Scotland internationalists like Steve Archibald, Ian Ferguson and Pat Nevin. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move into freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in 1975–76, they found themselves in the Second Division, the third tier, for the season 1976–77. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the Scottish football league system. Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown Craig Brown, and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in 1977–78.

Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair, and the grounds were not well maintained. By the late 1970s, Shawfield came into the hands of the Greyhound Racing Association (GRA). Greyhound racing had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this, the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.

They became the first Scottish club to adopt a shirt sponsor in 1979–80. The club secured a deal with the British Oxygen Company. As a guest of the SFA, Fabio Capello worked with manager Craig Brown and the team at Shawfield for a short stint in the early 1980s when he started coaching.

Relegation from the First Division in 1979–80 was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in 1981–82. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a £500,000 price tag. The club was served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. Alloa Athletic provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4–2 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill, and there was a sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club was grateful for the use of Firhill, but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.

The &#x27;Gypsy Army&#x27; reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club&#x27;s homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at Douglas Park with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in Cumbernauld. Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in 1990–91, was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in 1992–93 and an immediate relegation in 1993–94. However, this continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.

===1994–2022===
The Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and Cumbernauld, with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow new support. A new site called &quot;Broadwood&quot; was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing, two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.

The Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid-season, and former landlords, Hamilton Academical, were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the &quot;Accies&quot; 2–0.

Clyde dropped to the third tier of football, and in 1998 they almost fell into the lowest reaches of Senior football. However, this was enough for the new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald got appointed as manager, having worked at Maryhill Juniors. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks, and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion. Subsequently, Allan Maitland won promotion to the Scottish First Division in 1999.

The 2003–04 season saw Clyde atop the League and looking set for the SPL. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde was on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman&#x27;s fortune was well spent on players&#x27; wages, very little else got serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand got built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde&#x27;s financial plight. Plan B, playing at Kilmarnock, was investigated. In the event, a draw with Ayr United and a home loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.

The Clyde Supporters&#x27; Trust formed during the 2003–04 season. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely. The timing of the Trust&#x27;s formation coincided with Clyde&#x27;s failure to gain promotion, and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations, a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors increased the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed, and Clyde was mostly debt free.

In a season, 2005–06, that saw Clyde lead 2–1 from 1–0 behind at Rangers in a League Cup tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time, the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic visited Broadwood in the Scottish Cup on 8 January 2006. Celtic were such heavy favourites that the game was presented as a gentle introduction for their new signing, Roy Keane. Clyde, however, won 2–1. The goal scorers for Clyde were Eddie Malone and Craig Bryson while Celtic&#x27;s goal scorer was Maciej Zurawski. Clyde reached the 2006 Challenge Cup Final, their first final for 48 years, since their Scottish Cup success in 1958. They lost the game 5–4 on a penalty shootout, after the game finished 1–1 following extra time.

Former Scotland captain Colin Hendry was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when Michael Doherty became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match, a feat later broken by Connor Stevenson in a league match at Palmerston on 25 April 2009.

Hendry resigned in January 2008, due to family reasons. Former Rangers defender John &quot;Bomber&quot; Brown replaced him as manager. Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton&#x27;s result to avoid getting forced into the playoffs. Clyde won their game 3–0, but in a cruel twist of fate, Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side Alloa Athletic. Clyde lost the first leg 2–1 and at 3–1 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fightback saw Clyde level at 5–5 on aggregate (4–3 on the day) before adding another goal in extra time to progress. Home and away victories over Airdrie United in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.

However, the following season Clyde finished bottom of the First Division and got relegated to the Second Division. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try to avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first-team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club. The squad for 2009–10 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005. However early results were not good, and the board appointed Neil Watt as Director of Football and John McCormack as first team coach. After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win, and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced that John Brown had left his position as manager. On Monday, 5 April, John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.

More history was made in a home match with Peterhead on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded. Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for a consecutive season, dropping down to the Third Division where they made a disastrous start to the campaign, including an 8–1 thrashing at the hands of Montrose. On Wednesday 2 February 2011, Stuart Millar was sacked as manager of Clyde. They finished 10th in the Third Division, which at 42nd and last place overall is the lowest position in the Scottish league system.

On 20 April 2013, Clyde&#x27;s owners voted to move to East Kilbride and rename the club EK Clyde FC, however, this plan would later be abandoned. The 2013–14 season saw a significant improvement on the field when a League One play-off spot was secured in the penultimate league match of the season. In the previous six seasons Clyde had finished in the bottom two positions of every league campaign. However, the club missed out on promotion after a play-off semi-final defeat on penalties to East Fife. Gordon Young became the first Clyde player to score with their first touch on their club debut in a match against Elgin City on 1 March 2014.

Duffy resigned as manager of Clyde on 19 May 2014 to take up the vacant managerial post at Greenock Morton, while John Taylor, a member of the boardroom since 1986, and the club&#x27;s longest serving director had stepped down in April. In October 2014, the club were declared officially debt free, having accumulated an unsustainable debt of £1.4 million as a result of the club&#x27;s failed promotion bid to the SPL during season 2003–04, with the burden of debt having weighed heavily on the shoulders of the club for the next decade. Scott Durie became the first Clyde player to play every single minute of every competitive match in a season, during the 2014–15 season.

Former Rangers, Blackburn and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson was appointed as player-manager of Clyde in June 2014 and took the club to a 6th-place finish in his first season in charge. Ferguson officially retired as a player towards the end of that season. The following year, Clyde finished 3rd in League Two but got beaten in the playoff final. On 25 February 2017, with the club in 8th place in League Two after a 1–0 defeat to Annan Athletic and with no realistic prospect of gaining promotion after a ten-match winless run, Ferguson resigned as manager of Clyde, with his assistant Bob Malcolm taking interim charge of the side until a new manager was appointed.

After nine years in the bottom tier of Scottish football, at the end of the 2018–19 season, Danny Lennon led Clyde to promotion to Scottish League One, beating Annan Athletic 2–1 on aggregate to win the promotion play-off final.

In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021–22 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022–23 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.

Clyde&#x27;s last match at Broadwood was a defeat by Airdrieonians on 23 April 2022.

== Grounds ==
=== Barrowfield ===

Clyde have had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, situated on the banks of the River Clyde between the Glasgow neighbourhoods of Bridgeton and Dalmarnock.

=== Shawfield ===

By 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as Shawfield Stadium.

A crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against Celtic. In 1908, a group of 52,000 gathered for a game against Rangers, which remains Clyde&#x27;s record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it to their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.

=== Broadwood ===

In 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team. The new all-seater Broadwood Stadium would not be ready until 1994.

Clyde moved into the venue midway through the 1994–95 season. Broadwood has hosted Scotland U21 matches and four Scottish Challenge Cup finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to Airdrieonians for four seasons from 1994 to 1998 and Rangers reserves for a while.

On 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere. Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to East Kilbride, the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team. Another option was to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This had received approval from current tenants Rutherglen Glencairn.

In April 2022, the club announced they would be leaving Broadwood at the end of the 2021–22 season, ending their 28-year stay in Cumbernauld. They will be ground-sharing with Hamilton Academical at New Douglas Park from the start of the 2022–23 season, with a view of relocating to a new home back in Glasgow in the near future.

=== Groundsharing ===

After the Great War began, in September 1914, a fire completely destroyed the grandstand at Shawfield. Clyde were forced to switch their home games for a while. Celtic, the club&#x27;s East End neighbours, offered up Celtic Park as an alternative venue for home games.

After Celtic Park suffered similar damage in March 1929, they had to play the rest of their matches in the 1928–29 season at nearby Shawfield, thus reciprocating the earlier arrangement in 1914.

On 1 March 1958 Clyde hosted Celtic in the Scottish Cup. Set for Shawfield, the match was moved to Celtic Park over safety concerns. However, Clyde still had home advantage because the home stand tickets were initially reserved for Clyde ticket holders with Celtic tickets ineligible. The &quot;Bully Wee&quot; won 2–0 in front of 65,000, with goals from Ring and Currie.

After quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated several local options. Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals Partick Thistle to share their ground Firhill for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the ground was ready, so Clyde shared with Hamilton Accies at their Douglas Park stadium for a further three seasons.


The club negotiated a groundshare with Alloa to use Recreation Park for the club&#x27;s first home game of the 2012–13 season, a first round Challenge Cup match against Partick Thistle. During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface (astroturf) and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season. Clyde were confident that the pitch would be completed and all the details finalised for the club&#x27;s first home league match of the season in time for the visit of Peterhead. The match was switched to Recreation Park for the second successive home game after a pitch inspection carried out earlier in the week by the SFL decided that the pitch was not at the stage of completion as expected. Installation of the new surface was completed in time for the club&#x27;s next home match of the league season.

==Supporters==

Clyde Football Club is 100% owned by the supporters.

The supporters&#x27; fiercest rivalry is with Partick Thistle, given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of Rangers and Celtic. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the Scottish Premiership, and Clyde&#x27;s recent relegation to the Scottish League Two, such derby games have become a rarity in past years. Both clubs were in League One together in the 2020–21 season.

The number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own led to the fans identifying themselves as the &quot;Gypsy Army&quot;.

The Clyde Supporters Social Club on Rutherglen Main Street burned down in the early 2000s and has never been rebuilt or re-opened. There was also a Supporters Club located in Kirkintilloch.

The Clyde Supporters&#x27; Trust got formed during season 2003–04. A group of fans became aware of the club&#x27;s severe financial problems as Billy Carmichael&#x27;s reign as chairman came to an end. It was formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter&#x27;s hands in a time that coincided with Clyde&#x27;s failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.

In the past the Supporters&#x27; Trust has financed the signings of players such as John Potter and Tom Brighton, and retaining the signatures of players such as Neil McGregor and David Hutton.

The Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United. Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League with matches well played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporter&#x27;s teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United is unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde is also represented in the Scottish Central Amateur League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They got formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005. They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004 and SSFL Inter-Division Cup in 2003 making them the most successful Clyde supporters team. Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.

===The Clyde View===
The Clyde View is Clyde&#x27;s official matchday programme. It won the Scottish Programme of the Year Award every season from 1995–96 to 2006–07, and again in 2008–09. It also won the Scottish Divisional Programme of the Year Award every season from 1991–92 to 2011–12. It won the inaugural Scottish Divisional Programme Best Design of the Year Award for season 2011–12.

On Wirral&#x27;s UK Programme of the Year, it achieved a top ten finish on three consecutive occasions from 2002–03 to 2004–05; 8th (2002–03), 6th (2003–04) and 5th (2004–05).

==Nickname==
The club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Bully Wee&quot;, is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.

The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from Bridgeton, Glasgow, a tight working-class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as &quot;wee bullies&quot;, with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.

Alternatively, it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark &quot;But il&#x27;y, oui?&quot; or &quot;Their goal, yes&quot;. Supporters heard this unfamiliar phrase as &quot;Bully Wee&quot;, and the name stuck.

Finally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom &quot;bully&quot; meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as &quot;Bully Wee Clyde&quot;, with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.

Clyde&#x27;s supporters also go by the name of &quot;Gypsy Army&quot;. Due to the number of years the club spent homeless, rival fans called Clyde fans &quot;gypsies&quot; as a slur. The supporters of Clyde adopted this as a badge of honour and the &quot;Gypsy Army&quot; was born. Despite now having a settled home at Broadwood Stadium the nickname lives on in terracing songs, supporters buses and supporters football teams.

== Rivalries ==

Historically seen as a Glasgow club, local rivalries (Glasgow derby) were developed and forged with other teams from in and around the city, in particular Celtic (also from the East End), Rangers, Partick Thistle and Queen&#x27;s Park and the now-defunct Third Lanark.

For most of the 20th century, they were six of leading clubs in the country. More often than not all six clubs reside in the top division, with fiercely contested competitions such as the Glasgow Cup and Glasgow Charity Cup (before European football) on top of national tournaments, it saw the clubs pitted against one another multiple times a season.

A team called Thistle FC, also known Glasgow or Bridgeton Thistle, were early rivals to the club. Formed a decade before Clyde in 1868, Thistle&#x27;s first ground was situated nearby at the club&#x27;s original home Barrowfield Park. Thistle&#x27;s last fixture was a friendly against the full first team of Clyde at Barrowfield before going out of existence in 1894.

The Clyde vs Partick Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow&#x27;s smaller clubs, in comparison to the Old Firm. The rivalry intensified when Thistle became Clyde&#x27;s landlords at Firhill for five years in the 1980s. The decision to groundshare was never fully accepted by either set of fans. After quitting Clyde on free transfer to sign for the Firhill club (newly promoted to the SPL) in 2002, Jamie Mitchell stated he was shocked by the reaction of Clyde supporters to the move. He referred to it as getting the &quot;Mo Johnston treatment&quot;. Former &quot;Jags&quot; midfielder Scott Chaplain (once a signing target for Clyde) spoke of the &quot;competitive edges to those particular matches&quot; after playing in the fixtures many times. When talking about a possible groundshare again, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry saying &quot;the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical&quot;. Due to Partick Thistle&#x27;s promotion to Scotland&#x27;s highest professional league, the Scottish Premiership, in the 2010s and Clyde&#x27;s relegations to the lower leagues in the same period, matches between the two clubs became less common. However, by 2020 they found themselves in the same division (Scottish League One) once again, with a revived version of the Glasgow Cup also offering more meetings.

During the 2010s, Queen&#x27;s Park became the natural rivals to Clyde, as both clubs were stuck in the bottom league (fourth tier) for the majority of the decade. From 2010 to 2016, Clyde were on a demoralising run of results against Queen&#x27;s Park: the &quot;Spiders&quot; won 17 and drew 3 of the 26 matches. This included a run of 11 successive wins (scoring 29 goals in that run).

Geographically classed as a North Lanarkshire club since the 1994 move to Cumbernauld, Clyde&#x27;s matches against Airdrieonians, Albion Rovers, Motherwell or Hamilton Academical can be considered a Lanarkshire derby.

==Reserve and youth teams==
===Reserve League Cup===
Clyde put together a reserve team for the SFL&#x27;s Reserve League Cup competition, which included a mixture of first team fringe players and youngsters. The club won the Reserve League Cup for the first time in May 2008. They defeated Livingston 4–1 on their own ground at Almondvale with Dave McKay scoring all four goals for Clyde. It was the team&#x27;s first piece of silverware at reserve level for twenty years. The following season the club were knocked out by Ross County in the semi-finals losing 3–0 in Dingwall.

===Reserve team history===
====&#x27;A&#x27; Team====
It was common from the beginning of reserve football for the majority of club&#x27;s reserve teams (second XI&#x27;s) to go by the tag ‘A’ or sometimes ‘B’ or even ‘C’ if a club had more than one reserve side. It wasn&#x27;t until after the formation of the new Scottish Reserve League in 1955 that today&#x27;s reserve teams go by the actual tag ‘reserves’ and have done since 1957.

During the 1881–82 season, Clyde reached the semi-finals of the Scottish 2nd XI Cup in the competitions the first season. In 1896-97 they reached their first &#x27;major&#x27; cup final, the Scottish 2nd XI Cup final eventually losing 4–0 to Hearts. After reaching the semi-finals again in 1905–06, they were thwarted by arch-rivals Partick Thistle this time.

The club first joined the Scottish Reserve League in 1909-10 and found the first few years of competing in the league though. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1913–14 season when they made their mark when they lost 1–0 at Hearts in a league decider for the Reserve League title. It meant that the club missed out on a unique League and Cup double after they captured the Scottish 2nd XI Cup for the first time that season. They dispatched of St Mirren in the final over two legs (1–1 away and 3–1 at home). They successfully defended the Scottish 2nd XI Cup the following season when Clyde overcame Falkirk in the final over two legs (2–1 loss away and a 3–1 home win).

Their third and final Scottish 2nd XI Cup triumph came in 1941–42. It would be the team&#x27;s last &#x27;major&#x27; cup success for the next sixty-six years. In 1945-46 they reached their last Scottish 2nd XI Cup final losing to Hibs, after a superb 6-2 derby victory over arch-rivals Partick Thistle in the semifinals.

The Scottish Reserve League merged with the Scottish C Division (third tier) for the 1949–50 season creating two regionalised divisions (South/West and North/East) with Clyde entering a reserve team in the South &amp; West region. The club was crowned champions in 1949–50 and they retained their title in 1950–51. Despite successive titles, there was no promotion as only first teams could gain promotion to Division B. As reserve teams got excluded from the Scottish League Cup, the C Division had their League Cup. Clyde couldn&#x27;t quite match the success in the cup that they had in the league as they never won the competition. The best they could manage were semi-final appearances in 1951-52 and in 1953–54.

====League restructuring====
After both regional C Divisions got scrapped in June 1955, a new Scottish Reserve League started up. The new Reserve League was an exclusively all First Division league (a mirror image of the senior league) and all Second Division clubs&#x27; reserve sides got excluded from joining. There were several seasons when not all clubs took part. As for teams who were turned away or excluded from joining, they joined various supplementary leagues over the next few years.

For the first few seasons between 1955 and 1960, Clyde regularly finished quite high up the table or at least in a mid-table position. From then onwards in the seasons they spent in the league, the team were often at the wrong end of the table.

In one of the seasons that Clyde didn&#x27;t participate in the Reserve League, they joined the Combined Reserve League for a single season in 1961–62. Due to the small number of teams involved, the competition got split into an Autumn Series and Spring Series. The club won the Autumn Series and finished second overall in the Combined Table.

Just like Clyde&#x27;s first team, whose last spell in the Scottish top flight came in 1974–75, the same fate happened to their reserve team following a further league restructure at senior and reserve level. The Reserve League set-up changed again in 1975 after a reorganisation of the &#x27;senior&#x27; Scottish League into Premier-First-Second Divisions. The new Premier Reserve League was a mirror image of the new Scottish Premier Division in terms of membership. Lower league clubs used varying set-ups such as east–west sections and midweek competitions. In later games, clubs didn&#x27;t always participate as running a reserve side became expensive.

It wasn&#x27;t until season 1979–80 when Clyde gained membership to re-enter a reserve team in the Scottish Reserve League. They got placed in the regional West division. Finishing bottom in their first season, it was a further two seasons before they returned. They fared much better during the 1987–88 season when they won the division. It proved to be a one-off, though. Season 2000–01 was Clyde&#x27;s last in the West Reserves League eventually before all reserves leagues got scrapped after season 2007–08.

===Youth teams===
The club ran youth teams at under-20, under-17, under-15, under-14, under-13, under-12, and under-11 level. There was an under-18 team until 2003, when it made way for under-17 and under-19 teams. The under-20 team replaced the under-19 team in 2014. The club also run Football Schools in Cumbernauld (since 2006) and Glasgow Southside (since 2008). Both schools have since been awarded the SFA Quality Mark Award at Standard Level and then at Development Level.

The Community Foundation received the Gold award in the SFA Quality Mark category for grassroots football. The Foundation also received the Young Start Award in 2017 to run a project called &quot;Start Young, Grow Young&quot;. The club were forced to scrap their youth academy from under 11 to under 17 levels in 2015 citing a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA, with the under-20 side the only youth team remaining, which acts as a feeder to the first team for young players.

The team reached the Scottish Youth Cup semi finals in 1988, but were beaten by Dunfermline Athletic. The under-17 team reached the SFL Youth Cup final in 2004 losing 4–1 on penalties to Hamilton Accies at New Douglas Park despite scoring in stoppage time of extra time to make it 1–1. Both of the under-19 and under-17 teams reached the semi-finals of their SFL Youth Cups in 2006. The under-19 team finished runners-up behind Celtic in the inaugural SPFL under-19 league in 2014.

The under-19 team travelled to the Netherlands in 2003, taking part in a highly rated youth football programme called the &quot;Leonardo Project&quot; hosted by FC Dordrecht. They played three times against an under-19 team of the hosts, which contained Dutch youth internationalists, winning two and drawing one. In the third match, the opposition was made up of reserves and first team fringe players. They followed this up with a win over local amateur team vv Capelle and a narrow defeat to a youthful FC Utrecht team.

The Lanarkshire FA started the Lanarkshire Supercounty Trophy for all four senior Lanarkshire clubs&#x27; under-17 teams in 2013. Clyde beat Motherwell in the semi-final, but lost to Accies in the final. The under-17&#x27;s also reached their sectional League Cup final in 2017. The Community Foundation youth teams reached Divisional Cup finals in 2018 and 2019.

From the 2018–19 season, Clyde have replaced their Under 20 side with a project alongside North Lanarkshire Council called Project Braver, which will see young players play at youth level with a chance to progress to the first team, alongside providing further education or apprenticeship opportunities for the players.

<text>Cowdenbeath Football Club ( ) is a Scottish semi-professional football team based in Cowdenbeath, Fife. They are members of the Lowland Football League, the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system after their relegation from Scottish League Two on 14 May 2022 following a 4–0 aggregate defeat to Bonnyrigg Rose. Formed in 1881, the club has played at Central Park since 1917. They first joined the Scottish Football League (SFL) in 1905. The club has never won any of the major honours in Scottish football, but have won lower tier divisional titles on five occasions. They competed in the top division of the SFL from 1924 to 1934, but have only completed one further top flight season since, in 1970–71.

==History==
Cowdenbeath traditionally date their origin to the merger of two local clubs, Cowdenbeath Rangers (formed 1880) and Cowdenbeath Thistle, which occurred in 1881. However, research by the club&#x27;s historian suggests the Cowdenbeath Rangers name continued to be used at this time and the founding of Cowdenbeath F.C. should properly be dated to 1882, when another merger saw Rangers combine with a local club called Raith Rovers (formed 1881 and unrelated to the present Kirkcaldy club). The establishment of one club to represent the town thus coincided with the establishment of the Fifeshire Football Association that year. Cowdenbeath, who are the oldest surviving football club in Fife, lost in the inaugural Fife Cup final in 1883 but won the Cup for the first time in 1885.

In 1888 the club moved to North End Park, and in 1905 were admitted to Division Two of the Scottish Football League. They won Division Two in 1913–14 and 1914–15, but were not promoted to Division One on either occasion. The SFL was suspended due to World War I in 1915, and the club moved to Central Park in 1917. They were placed in Division Two when it was reformed in 1921, and after finishing as runners-up in 1923–24, the club were promoted to Division One for the first time.

The club remained in Division One until being relegated at the end of the 1933–34 season but claimed their third Division Two championship in 1938–39. This feat was in no small part aided by Rab Walls&#x27; 54 League goals – the second highest seasonal total in Scottish League history, behind only Jimmy Smith&#x27;s 66 goals for Ayr United in 1927/28. However, the outbreak of World War II cut short Cowden&#x27;s return to Division One, and the club closed down for the duration of hostilities. When peacetime football resumed in 1946, the club were controversially placed in the new (second tier) B Division.

While a 1949 League Cup success over Rangers at Ibrox was a highlight of the early post-war period, Cowden struggled to return to the elite level of Scottish football. This was finally achieved under popular manager Andy Matthew in the 1969–70 season, but the solitary season in Division One that followed remains the club&#x27;s only top flight campaign since the 1930s. More recently, hopes for the future were raised when Cowden were promoted to the First Division in season 1991–92, but they soon slumped back to the basement of the Scottish League amidst a run of 38 League games without a win at Central Park.

A more professional approach was ushered in with the appointment of former Scotland defender Craig Levein, who had begun his playing career with Cowdenbeath, as manager in 1997. Promotion from the Third Division was achieved in the 2000–01 season, although they would be relegated again two years later. After a third-place finish in the 2004–05 season. The 2005–06 campaign saw the team achieve their first divisional title win for 67 years with player-manager Mixu Paatelainen when they won the Third Division. Season 2008–09 saw Danny Lennon&#x27;s side miss out on promotion in a penalty shoot-out after a scoreless two-legged match and extra time against Stenhousemuir. However, they were promoted to the second division for the 2009–10 season as Livingston were demoted to the Scottish Third Division after breaching the league&#x27;s rules on insolvency. After a tough start to life in the Scottish Second Division, Cowden soon found their feet and finished in third place. Amazingly they went on to defeat Alloa and Brechin in the play-offs to secure promotion.

Prior to the 2010–11 season Jimmy Nicholl was appointed new manager. They were relegated from the First Division to the Second Division on Saturday 14 May 2011 after losing their relegation/promotion play-off semi-final tie 4–2 on aggregate to Brechin City with the first leg at Glebe Park ending 2–2 and the second leg at Central Park ending 2–0 to Brechin City. It was a massive blow to the club especially after being 2–0 up at half time in the first leg in Brechin.

Under new manager Colin Cameron, Cowdenbeath immediately regained promotion the following season, winning the league with two games remaining. The season after, they ensured survival on the final matchday with a 3–1 away win over Hamilton Academical.
The following season they avoided relegation again by defeating local rivals Dunfermline Athletic 4–1 on aggregate in the Championship Play Off final thanks to goals from Kane Hemmings, Greg Stewart and Thomas O&#x27;Brien.

The following season they finished bottom of the Championship after losing 3–0 on the final day to fellow strugglers Alloa Athletic. Before kick off Cowdenbeath had sat in eighth place but were overtaken by Alloa and Livingston who also won. Jimmy Nicholl handed in his resignation shortly after the match leaving Colin Nish to rebuild the team for life in Ladbrokes League One. Nish was unable to stop the slide and Cowdenbeath suffered successive relegations, finishing 9th but being defeated 2–1 on aggregate by Queen&#x27;s Park in the semi-finals of the play-offs. Nish was sacked on 12 May 2016, being replaced by Liam Fox. Continuing Cowdenbeath&#x27;s woeful run, they finished 10th in the 2016–17 Scottish League Two. They avoided a third consecutive relegation, and dropping out of the SPFL, by winning a play-off against Lowland League champions East Kilbride. The 2017–18 season was no improvement at all, with Cowdenbeath finishing last again and having to go through the play-off to avoid relegation. Their opponents were Highland League champions Cove Rangers and Cowdenbeath survived once again thanks to a 3–2 home win following an away goalless draw. Comparatively, season 2018–19 saw a successful campaign. The club finished in sixth place, comfortably avoiding the play-off spot by 24 points. This improvement in form continued into the truncated season of 2019–20, with the club finishing in fourth place after 27 games played.

In June 2020, it was announced that fans had donated over £14,000 across three months via the &#x27;Club 135&#x27; initiative, to assist the club financially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>East Fife Football Club is a semi-professional football club established in 1903 in Methil, Fife, Scotland. They are members of the Scottish Professional Football League and compete in Scottish League Two, the fourth tier of the Scottish football league system.

The club were the first to win the Scottish League Cup three times and the first of only two sides from the second tier of the Scottish league system to win the Scottish Cup. This makes them the most successful club in Fife in terms of major honours won.

East Fife are one of four SPFL clubs based in Fife, but are the only one to bear the name of the area. The three others are Dunfermline Athletic, Kelty Hearts and the Kirkcaldy-based Raith Rovers (Cowdenbeath play in the Lowland Football League), all of whom have historically shared rivalries with East Fife.

== History ==

=== Formation and early years ===
Local demand for the establishment of a senior football team led to a public meeting being held in January 1903 and resulted in the formation of East Fife Football Club. After spending its first season competing in the Fife League and the Scottish Qualifying Cup, as well as playing in a number of challenge matches, the club joined the Eastern League for season 1904–05. The following season East Fife joined the Northern League, which included clubs such as Dunfermline Athletic and St Johnstone. The club remained in the Northern League until the 1908–09 season. In 1909, East Fife joined the Central League, which consisted of many of the teams who had played in the Northern League, with the addition of Alloa Athletic, Stenhousemuir and King&#x27;s Park from Stirling.

=== 1920s and 30s ===
East Fife remained in the Central League until 1921, apart from a period during the First World War when the Eastern League was reformed. In the period following the war, the clubs competing for the Central League were mainly from the coal and shale mining communities of Fife and West Lothian. As the mining towns thrived with the growth of the mining industry and its associated influx of miners and their families, so did the local football clubs. The result of this was that by the end of the decade, the Central League clubs could afford to pay their players higher wages than they would receive in the Scottish Football League. In an effort to stop the migration of its players to the Central League, the Scottish League decided to admit the Central League clubs, including East Fife, to its membership. The Central League therefore became the Scottish Division Two at the start of the 1921–22 season.

Only six years after becoming members of the Scottish League, East Fife appeared in the 1927 Scottish Cup Final, which it lost 3–1 to Celtic at Hampden Park.

East Fife&#x27;s only season in Scottish football&#x27;s top division before World War II was 1930–31 after finishing Second Division runners-up the year before.

The 1927 cup feat was surpassed just over a decade later when &quot;The Fifers&quot; won the 1937–38 Scottish Cup. The prestigious trophy was secured with a 4–2 win over Kilmarnock in the replayed final. The game was watched by a crowd of almost 92,000 spectators.

=== Golden age ===
East Fife&#x27;s best years were undoubtedly in the decade following the Second World War. In 1946–47, the first season after the war, the club finished third, missing promotion by one place. Scot Symon joined as manager in 1947. At the end of 1947–48, East Fife were promoted to the top flight of Scottish football as &#x27;B&#x27; Division champions.

During this &quot;Golden Period&quot;, the club won the Scottish League Cup on three separate occasions (1947–48, 1949–50, and 1953–54) in seven seasons. A third Scottish Cup final appearance was added to its achievements list in 1949–50.

The club&#x27;s league record was also impressive. In the six seasons between 1948 and 1954, East Fife finished its Scottish Division One (then the pinnacle of Scottish football) campaigns in fourth, fourth, tenth, third, third and sixth respectively. In one of these seasons, 1952–53, they were still in the running for the league title with only a few games remaining.

Among the players who were at the club for at least part of this era were Tommy Adams and Willie Laird – both had played in the Scottish Cup-winning side before the war. Others joined and would go on to represent Scotland while at the club – George Aitken, Davie Duncan, Allan Brown, Henry Morris, Charlie Fleming and Andy Matthew. Others such as Jimmy Philp and winger and later Scottish League cap Bobby Black were among those who picked up cup winners&#x27; medals at the club. Harold Davis was on the books for a number of seasons but rarely played due to fulfilling his national service in the Korean War in which he was seriously injured in combat. Davis took two years to recover from his injuries, then played a couple of games for the first team before following Symon to Rangers where both had much success.

=== Late 20th century ===
Having spent ten successive seasons in Scotland&#x27;s top league, East Fife were relegated from Division One at the end of season 1957–58. Since then, the Methil outfit has struggled to match previous success, emphasised by the fact that aside from three seasons during the early 1970s, the club has played all of its football outside the top league since the 1950s.

In November 1998, East Fife moved to a purpose-built stadium near Methil power station.

=== 21st century ===
The 2006–07 season saw East Fife begin the Scottish Third Division campaign impressively, at one point amassing a commanding nine point lead over their nearest rivals. The Fifers&#x27; form declined markedly but recovered to qualify for the newly implemented promotion play-offs. East Fife beat Second Division outfit Stranraer 4–2 on aggregate before losing 7–2 to Queen&#x27;s Park on aggregate in the final. Season 2007–08 commenced with high expectations for The Fifers amidst a flurry of preseason signings. The new acquisitions proved successful as the team thoroughly dominated the early stages, culminating in a twelve-point lead at the top of the division by Christmas. East Fife also revived their historic tradition in the Scottish League Cup by reaching the third round, beating Queen of the South and SPL side St Mirren, before losing out to Old Firm heavyweights Rangers.

The new ground was officially renamed Bayview Stadium in 2007.

East Fife secured the 2007–08 Scottish Third Division title after beating East Stirlingshire at Firs Park, Falkirk 3–0 on 15 March 2008. This gave them a points total of 74, 26 points ahead of Stranraer. This was East Fife&#x27;s first league title for 60 years and their first piece of silverware since 1954. Having lead the team to league success the previous campaign, manager David Baikie resigned from his position on 14 April 2009. Baikie was replaced by Stevie Crawford, who had joined the playing staff the previous summer.

On 23 August 2011, the Fifers delivered an emphatic victory against Dunfermline Athletic of the SPL in the League Cup. Then on 20 September 2011, East Fife recorded yet another cup shock, defeating SPL Aberdeen 7–6 on penalties, after a 3–3 draw, at Pittodrie, to advance to the quarter finals of the Scottish League Cup.

East Fife remained in the Second Division for six seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2013–14 season after defeat in the relegation playoff final, losing 3–2 on aggregate to Stirling Albion. In the preceding season they won the playoff final 1–0 on aggregate with the only goal of the tie coming from David Muir at Peterhead&#x27;s Balmoor Stadium. They spent two seasons in League Two before winning the league in 2015–16 with 62 points to return to League One, with Gary Naysmith at the managerial helm. Nathan Austin finished the championship-winning season as top scorer, with 22 goals from 25 games.

The Fifers enjoyed a period of relative stability in League One over the coming years, registering several mid-table finishes, including a 5th-place finish in the 2016–17 season, just four points away from a promotion play-off berth. The 2021–22 season saw a downturn in fortunes for the club, leading to their automatic relegation down to League Two for the 2022–23 season.

== Stadium ==

East Fife&#x27;s original ground was Bayview Park, in Wellesley Road in the centre of Methil. Since 1998, home matches have been played at the new all-seated Bayview Stadium situated at the old Lower Methil docks, capacity . The ground has one stand and is open at the three remaining sides. The far side was overshadowed by the derelict Methil power station until its demolition in April 2011 and has a growing business park being built around it as well as a local train station for the Levenmouth rail link which was opened to the public in June 2024.

In 2013–14 East Fife hired in three temporary stands to increase the ground capacity for the two fixtures with Rangers and one fixture with Dunfermline Athletic who visited the ground on 1 February 2014 with only two of the temporary stands open, one for the home support and one for the away support. These boosted the capacity of the Stadium to 4,900. The three temporary stands were removed at the end of the season after the club was relegated.

At the Stadium there is a club shop/cabin for the home supporters, and two bars which are open for both sets of supporters while attending the match.

The stadium was renamed the &quot;MGM Timber Bayview Stadium&quot; in March 2023 following a new partnership with MGM Timber.

<doc id="451247" wikidata="Q12810271" url="?curid=451247" title="History of the Jews in Carpathian Ruthenia">
<text>Jews settled in this small region variously called Ruthenia, Carpathian Ruthenia, Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia or simply Transcarpathia as early as the 15th century. Local rulers allowed Jewish citizens to own land and practice many trades that were precluded to them in other locations. Jews settled in the region over time and established communities that built great synagogues, schools, printing houses, businesses, and vineyards. By the end of the 19th century there were as many as 150,000 Jews living in the region.

==Haredi Judaism in Subcarpathian Ruthenia==
Interwar Subcarpathian Ruthenia was an important centre of Haredi (&quot;Ultra-Orthodox&quot;) Judaism, including Hasidic groups. Many outstanding rabbis lived here or found refuge from neighbouring countries, leading &quot;yeshivot&quot; (religious schools) and keeping a &quot;hatzer&quot; (court), specifically in Munkacs. These groups were often fiercely competing with each other, and with secular or liberal Jewish groups.

==Beginning of the 20th Century==

The last antebellum census in Hungary was in 1910. The four counties of Kingdom of Hungary that covered the territory (now known as Carpathian Ruthenia) were Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa and Máramaros.

Counties of Kingdom of Hungary, Ugocsa and Máramaros were split between Czechoslovakia and Romania in 1920 by Treaty of Trianon after the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which lost the World War I. In 1939, Hungary annexed back the northern parts of its former counties from the short lived Ruthenian state of Carpatho-Ukraine after the breakup of the Second Czechoslovak Republic. And in 1940, their southern parts of the former counties returned from Romania by the Second Vienna Award. After the World War II, the Soviet Union annexed the northern parts and today it belongs to Ukraine as a successor state to the Soviet Union. The southern parts were reverted to Romania after the World War II.

Counties of Kingdom of Hungary, Ung and Bereg became part of Czechoslovakia in 1920 by Treaty of Trianon, except a small part of Bereg that stayed in Hungary. The southern parts its former counties returned to Hungary from Czechoslovakia in 1938 by the First Vienna Award, and their northern parts from the short lived Ruthenian state in 1939.

==Czechoslovakia==
In 1921, about 27% of the Jews of Subcarpathian Rus lived from agriculture, making it the highest percentage of Jewish peasantry in all of Europe. In the 1921 and 1930 censuses, 87 and 93 percent respectively of all Subcarpathian Jews considered themselves to be Jews by nationality. It was, therefore, the least assimilated, Yiddish-speaking group in Czechoslovakia.

==Jewish-local relations on the eve of World War II ==
Memoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the 19th and early 20th centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful and harmonious. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia.

The attitude of some Ruthenians to their Jewish neighbors is vividly represented in the play by Alexander Dukhnovych (1803–1865), &quot;Virtue is More Important than Riches&quot; briefed here as well as in short-story triptych &quot;Golet v údolí&quot; by Ivan Olbracht. In contrast to other areas of Ukraine, Ruthenia never experienced chaotic riots and pogroms.

==The Holocaust ==
During World War II, once the legal government of Hungary was overthrown by the Germans, the &quot;Final Solution&quot; of the Holocaust was also extended to Carpathian Ruthenia. To be sure, the legal government of Hungary and its fascist elements had already played a prominent role in killing Jews even before this.

Beginning in 1939, draconian laws had been passed banning Jews from going to school or from operating their previous businesses. Then in the summer of 1941, Hungarian authorities deported about 18,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia to the Galician region of Poland-Ukraine. This was done under the guise of expelling alien refugees, but in practice most of those expelled were from families that had lived in the region for the previous 50–100 years. Many who might have been able to prove their long-term residency were taken without being given the chance. Most of the deportees were immediately handed over to Nazi German &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units at Kaminets Podolsk and machine-gunned over a three-day period in late 1941. A few thousand others were simply left to their own devices after being pushed across the border into Galicia, in the area near Kaminets Podolsk. The vast majority of this group subsequently perished over the next two years in ghettos and death camps with other Jewish residents of the region.

Those Jews fortunate enough to avoid the 1941 deportations faced further privations under Hungarian rule. Men of working age were conscripted into slave labor gangs in which a high proportion perished. The remnant were ultimately returned to their homes in time to suffer deportation to concentration camps under Nazi rule after 1944.

In April 1944, 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Ruthenia. 144,000 Jews were rounded up and held there. Starting on May 15, 1944: 14,000 Jews were taken out of these sites to Auschwitz every day until the last deportation on June 7, 1944.

The following table shows the death trains originating from these four counties that went through Kassa (Košice). (Some Jewish males were on forced labor (munkaszolgálat); some trains did not pass through Kassa; and some Jews from the area were forced to board trains departing from neighboring counties):

By June 1944, nearly all the Jews from ghettos of Carpathian Ruthenia had been exterminated, together with other Hungarian Jews. Of more than 100,000 Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia, around 90,000 were murdered. Except for those who managed to flee, only a small number of Jews were saved by Rusyns who hid them.

Since the fall of Communism, archives have been opened to allow study of the facts about the implementation of the Final Solution in the province. The most discussed issue is whether, and to what extent, local collaborators helped the Nazis in performing the tasks and to what extent such collaboration was forced upon those collaborators by the threat—or actuality—of brutal violence against themselves.

==Post World War II==

The estimated number of surviving Jews from the area was 15,000–20,000 people. Most of them left Carpatho-Ruthenia before the new Soviet borders were sealed in the fall of 1945, so there were only 4,000 Jews left in 1948. At the time of the first post-World War II census in the Soviet Union, in 1959, the number of Jews in the Zakarpattia Oblast was 12,569 - most of which were immigrants from other parts of the Soviet Union.

Most Jews who remained in the region emigrated to the United States and Israel during the 1970s in the wake of the Jackson–Vanik amendment, while a few went to Hungary. The last Soviet census in 1989 found only 2,700 Jews living in the area. In the 1990s the remaining Hasidic population of Mukachevo had left.

Today some synagogues have survived. The following cities have synagogues that existed prior to World War II:
* Khust
* Uzhhorod
* Mukachevo

<text>1 Utama is a shopping mall in Bandar Utama, Selangor, Malaysia, with an area of and containing 713 stores. It is one of the largest shopping malls in Malaysia and the seventh-largest shopping mall in the world before IOI City Mall in Putrajaya surpassed it in 2022. The first phase of the mall, now known as the &quot;Old Wing&quot;, was opened in September 1995. With the increase in customer traffic and demand for retail spaces inside the mall, a second phase called &quot;New Wing&quot; was added in 2003.

An additional expansion of was added in 2018 with the addition of 1 Utama E. Today the mall houses multiple retail areas, restaurants, cafes, sports facilities, a rainforest, and a bus station with national and international services. Current anchor tenants of the mall include AEON Department Store and Supermarket, Jaya Grocer, and department store Parkson. The mall formerly housed Singaporean department store Tangs, Japanese department store Isetan, and the first IKEA store in Malaysia in 1996. The mall has received several awards, including Gold in EdgeProp Malaysia&#x27;s Best Managed Property Awards 2019 (retail category) and the Platinum Award for Shopping Complex of the Year in the Retail World Excellence Awards 2006/07 edition.

==History==

In the 1990s, See Hoy Chan Holdings Group started developing a new town known as Bandar Utama comprising both residential and commercial areas. As market demand for this location surged, the developer planned to build a mall in this town. The developer looked for inspiration for such a mall in the United States in 1993 before designing the first phase of the mall known as the &quot;Old Wing&quot; today. As the developer believed that the mall should come with anchor tenants, they signed an agreement with AEON to open Jusco (later rebranded as AEON) as the main tenant in the mall.

The mall was officially opened in September 1995 with all premises fully rented by various tenants. The cost of the construction of the first phase of the mall was RM89 million. The first IKEA store in Malaysia opened on April 25, 1996 in the mall with a good reception from customers during the first few days after opening. At that time, most IKEA products sold there were made in Malaysia including dining tables, chairs, coffee tables, venetian blinds, cutting boards, toys and bed frames. The IKEA store covered of space inside the mall. Due to increased demand for IKEA products, the store was relocated to a bigger space in Mutiara Damansara on August 14, 2003, becoming the largest IKEA store in Asia-Pacific at that time until it was surpassed by another store in Gwangmyeong, South Korea in 2014.
As the mall faced increased demand for retail spaces, leading to a long tenant waiting list, the director of See Hoy Chan Holdings Group, Teo Chiang Kok, planned an expansion of the mall. This led to construction of the second phase, known as the &quot;New Wing&quot;, to further accommodate increasing numbers of customers. Construction cost RM300 million and increased the number of retail lots from 220 units to 600 units. The two blocks are connected by a covered pedestrian bridge. The new section also includes an aviary, zoo, diving pool and climbing wall. The mall soft-opened on December 13, 2003, with the grand opening taking place on April 2, 2004, officiated by the Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah. Ownership and management of the mall was transferred to Bandar Utama City Centre.

The first renovation of the first phase (or &quot;Old Wing&quot;) took place in June 2011, 16 years after it opened, and cost RM160 million. The renovation included a relocation of the Jusco supermarket to the new area, additions of cinema screens, and a new entrance to the 1 First Avenue office building. An additional expansion of inside the mall included the third phase (known as 1 Utama E) which was opened on January 24, 2018. It features a surfing pool, a skydiving wind tunnel and several restaurants and cafes which aim to make the mall a multi-sport and entertainment venue alongside shopping. The mall also added 500 more parking bays and pedestrian access to Bandar Utama MRT station. Development of this phase cost RM150 million.

==Features==

1 Utama contains of retail space. Its 713 stores appeal to all economic strata, from department stores such as AEON and Parkson, to high-end international chains and multiple restaurants such as the Food District food court, Din Tai Fung, KFC, McDonald&#x27;s, Texas Chicken, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and Carl&#x27;s Jr. and two cinema chains, TGV Cinemas and GSC. This mall previously housed the first IKEA store in Malaysia, Cold Storage, MPH Bookstores. and Isetan department store. Aside from retail, 1 Utama offers sport amenities to the public including a bowling alley, baseball cage, climbing wall, surfing pool and skydiving wind tunnel. The rainforest inside the mall was grown on October 25, 2003. It was done by extracting a &quot;Tabebuia rosea&quot; tree from a nearby forest carried into the mall to create the forest canopy, whereas an additional 200 samplings of other species such as &quot;Alocasia&quot;, wild banana, &quot;Johanesteijsmannia&quot;, &quot;Aglaonema&quot; and &quot;Phyllagathis&quot; will be used as shrub layer. The rainforest opened to the public in November 2003. As of 2019, the mall attracts more than 33 million visitors annually, with peak traffic occurring during the holiday season.
==Transport==

The mall is connected to several major roads including Lebuhraya Damansara Puchong and Lebuh Bandar Utama. In addition to providing 14,000 parking bays for cars, the mall also provides bicycle parking. The car park is also equipped with electric vehicle charging points. The mall is accessible via public transport, including MRT via Bandar Utama MRT station or via buses from RapidKL bus service.

==Incidents==
===Fires===
There were two fires that broke out in the mall. The first fire was on February 25, 2013, which started in a storage facility in the children&#x27;s playground equipment store which caused the whole building to experience a power outage. The second fire occurred on July 11, 2014, when the fire broke out from the kitchen of one of the food court. Both fires were minor, and no casualties were reported.

===Crime===
In response to the abduction of Canny Ong in a shopping center in Bangsar which led to her death on June 13, 2003, many shopping malls in Klang Valley strengthened their security in order to protect their customers, including One Utama shopping mall where the management deployed additional policemen, guard dogs and security guards to patrol the mall. Despite this, there were several false alarms when some customers reported to police that their cars were stolen, when in fact the customers forgot where they had parked their cars. During Chinese New Year in 2014, a burglar stole jewellery worth RM10 million in one of the jewellery shops. The heist was planned by a Latin American gang in advance before executing the burglary, which included hiding inside the mall as it closed, cutting off electricity, disabling the burglar alarm system, stealing CCTV recording units and melting safe doors using an oxy acetylene torch.

=== Suicide ===
A woman fell to her death from the 4th floor at the new wing on 19 May 2021. The incident happened at 1 pm. The mall emergency response team quickly handled the situation before handing it over to the police. The management of One Utama has confirmed that the police will be investigating the matter further.

<doc id="451255" wikidata="Q335273" url="?curid=451255" title="Jayavarman VII">
<text>Jayavarman VII (), known posthumously as Mahaparamasaugata (, c. 1122–1218), was king of the Khmer Empire. He was the son of King Dharanindravarman II (r. 1150–1160) and Queen Sri Jayarajacudamani.
 He was the first king devoted to Buddhism, as only one prior Khmer king had been a Buddhist. He then built the Bayon as a monument to Buddhism. Jayavarman VII is generally considered the most powerful of the Khmer monarchs by historians. His government built many projects including hospitals, highways, rest houses, and temples. With Buddhism as his motivation, King Jayavarman VII is credited with introducing a welfare state that served the physical and spiritual needs of the Khmer people.

== Defeat of the Cham and coronation ==

In 1177 and again in 1178, the Cham invaded the Khmer Empire. In 1177, Champa King Jaya Indravarman IV launched a surprise attack on the Khmer capital by sailing a fleet up the Mekong River, across Lake Tonlé Sap, and then up the Siem Reap River, a tributary of the Tonle Sap. The invaders pillaged the Khmer capital of Yasodharapura and put king Tribhuvanadityavarman to death. Also in 1178, when he was in his mid 50s, Jayavarman came to historical prominence by leading a Khmer army that ousted the invaders, which included a naval battle depicted on the walls of the Bayon and Banteay Chmar. Returning to the capital, he found it in disorder. He put an end to the disputes between warring factions and in 1181 was crowned king himself.

Early in his reign, he probably repelled another Cham attack and quelled a rebellion of the vassal Kingdom of Malyang (Battambang). He was greatly helped by the military skill of refugee Prince Sri Vidyanandana, who also played a part in the subsequent sacking and conquest of Champa (1190–1191). 
His conquest of Champa made it a dependency of the Khmer Empire for thirty years. Jayavarman expanded Khmer control of the Mekong Valley northward to Vientiane and to the south, down the Kra Isthmus.

==Public works and monuments==

Over the 37 years of his reign, Jayavarman embarked on a grand program of construction that included both public works and monuments. As a Mahayana Buddhist, his declared aim was to alleviate the suffering of his people. One inscription tells us, &quot;He suffered from the warts of his subjects more than from his own; the pain that affected men&#x27;s bodies was for him a spiritual pain, and thus more piercing.&quot; This declaration must be read in light of the undeniable fact that the numerous monuments erected by Jayavarman must have required the labor of thousands of workers, and that Jayavarman&#x27;s reign was marked by the centralization of the state and the herding of people into ever greater population centers.

Historians have identified many facets in Jayavarman&#x27;s intensive building program. In one phase, he focused on useful constructions, such as his famous 102 hospitals, rest houses along the roads, and reservoirs. Thereafter, he built a pair of temples in honor of his parents: Ta Prohm in honor of his mother and Preah Khan in honor of his father.

Finally, he constructed his own &quot;temple-mountain&quot; at Bayon and developed the city of Angkor Thom around it. He also built Neak Pean (&quot;Coiled Serpent&quot;), one of the smallest but most beautiful temples in the Angkor complex, a fountain with four surrounding ponds set on an island in that artificial lake.

The Preah Khan inscription states that the King erected Buddha stone images, the Jayabuddhamahanatha, in twenty-three towns in different parts of his empire. Among those towns were Lavodayapura (modern Lopburi), Svarnapura, Sambukapattana, Srijayarajapuri (modern Ratchaburi), Srijayasimhapuri (modern Kanchanaburi), and Srijayavajrapuri (modern Phetburi), believed to have been situated more.

===Ta Prohm===
In 1186, Jayavarman dedicated Ta Prohm (&quot;Ancestor Brahma&quot;) to his mother. An inscription indicates that this massive temple at one time had 80,000 people assigned to its upkeep, including 18 high priests and 615 female dancers.

===Angkor Thom and Bayon===
Angkor Thom (&quot;Grand Angkor&quot; or &quot;Angkor of Dham(ma)&quot;) was a new city centre, called in its day Indrapattha. At the centre of the new city stands one of his most massive achievements—the temple now called the Bayon, a multi-faceted, multi-towered temple that mixes Buddhist and Hindu iconography. Its outer walls have startling bas reliefs not only of warfare but the everyday life of the Khmer army and its followers. These reliefs show camp followers on the move with animals and oxcarts, hunters, women cooking, female traders selling to Chinese merchants, and celebrations of common foot soldiers. The reliefs also depict a naval battle on the great lake, the Tonle Sap.

=== Popular icon ===
Jayavarman VII&#x27;s bust has been a favorite of Khmer households and a masterpiece of the National Museum for many years. The recent discovery of portions of the rest of his statue confirmed speculations about his spiritual aura as a sovereign.
==Chronology==

King Suryavarman (Sun Shield) II, builder of the great Angkor Wat, died in 1150. He was succeeded by Dharanindravarman II, who ruled until 1160. Due to the absence of Jayavarman VII, Yashovarman II succeeded the throne, who was himself overthrown by Tribhuvanadityavarman (Protegee of the Sun of three worlds), assumed to be a usurper. In 1177, the Chams, led by Jaya Indravarman IV, invaded and Angkor was sacked. Nonetheless, this date, not to mention the event itself, has been questioned by Michael Vickery, who doubts the reliability of the Chinese sources for this period. In 1181 Jayavarman VII became king after leading the Khmer forces against the Chams. Jayavarman VII then exacted vengeance against Champa in 1190, for the earlier raid in 1177.

Jayavarman died around 1218. He was succeeded by Indravarman II, who died by 1243. Indravarman was succeeded further by Jayavarman VIII, a Shivaite. He embarked on the destruction or defacement of Jayavarman VII&#x27;s Buddhist works. The niches all along the top of the wall around the city contained images of the Buddha, and most of these were removed. This included the great statue of Buddha at Bayon, and the Buddha images in Angkor Thom, which were converted into linga.

==Legacy==
The history of the Khmer empire cannot be read in the manner of European patterns of kingship, inheritance, or nationhood. The sons of a Khmer king did not necessarily inherit their father&#x27;s thrones; Jayavarman VII himself had many sons, such as Suryakumara and Virakumara (the suffix kumara usually is translated as &quot;prince&quot;, one of the king&#x27;s sons), and Srindrakumaraputra, the crown prince who died before his father, but only Indravarman II inherited the throne.

Jayavarman VII built 121 &quot;houses with fire&quot; rest houses built every fifteen kilometers along raised highways for travellers, and 102 hospitals. His was the &quot;Buddhism of the Greater Vehicle&quot;. However, Brahmans continued to play a &quot;role at court&quot;, with Hrishikesa being made chief priest, with the title Jayamahapradhana.

He married Princess Jayarajadevi and then, after her death, married her sister Indradevi. The two women are commonly thought to have been a great inspiration to him, particularly in his strong devotion to Buddhism.

Though he had many sons, we know the names of only four, Suryakumara (mentioned in Ta Prohm), Virakumara (mentioned in Preah Khan), Srindrakumara (mentioned in Banteay Chhmar), and Tamalinda (later became a bhikku). He also fathered Sikhara Mahadevi, chief consorts of Pho Khun Pha Mueang, that appeared in Stele of Wat Sri choom Script of Sukhothai Historical Park.

She was the daughter of Harshavarman III.

She married before 1125. She best known for being the mother of Jayavarman VII, who was born circa 1125.

Her spouse became king in 1150, and she became queen.

An inscription described Queen Jayarajadevi after her husband went into exile:
:&quot;[her] asceticism, her virtuous conduct, her tears, her likeness to Sita, found by her husband and then separated from him, her body thinned by observances, her religion, her devotion to him, her joy at this ultimate return.&quot;

<text>Jayarajadevi (&quot;fl.&quot; 1181), was the first queen consort of King Jayavarman VII of the Khmer Empire.

She was the daughter of ‘kshatriyas, amongst the elite of the royal family’, and the younger sister of queen Indradevi. She and her sister were well-educated Buddhists. Indrani later stated that their father was ‘Ja … ’, descended from ‘Rudravarman’ and a woman entitled ‘queen’, and their mother was a descendant of Rajendradevi. 

Her spouse became king in 1181, making her queen. Her sister Indradevi are said to have ‘initiated [Jayarajadevi] into the peace and tranquillity of the teachings of the Buddha, away from the fire of torment’. After her conversion, queen Jayarajadevi became a teacher herself and:
:‘took for her own daughters members of a group of girls who had been abandoned by their mothers … [and] entered them in the religious life with clothes and gifts, according to the prescribed rites’. 
She trained the students to perform scenes from the Jataka as a means of instruction to others. When Jayavarman VII succeeded to the throne, queen Jayarajadevi was praised for donating all her property to the poor. 

Jayarajadevi died early on in her husband&#x27;s reign. After her death, the king married her sister, Indradevi, who became the next queen. Queen Indradevi also took over her sister&#x27;s schools and was appointed head of Nagendratunge, Tilakottare and Narendraśrama, the three ‘colleges’ of Buddhist doctrine and other sciences, which appeared to have been particularly for women and girls, maybe primarily from elite families.

<text>The Ancient Khmer Highway was a roadway going northwest between Angkor (in Cambodia) and Phimai (Vimayapura) (now in Thailand). While it was not the only such road built by the Khmer, it was the most important one.

Most of the road is overgrown by the jungle and is only visible today on aerial photographs. Few of &quot;dharmasala&quot; or houses with fire, the rest house chapels or hospital chapels survive (only the chapels remain as they were the only buildings built of sandstone or laterite, and all wooden constructions rotted away long ago). The only part of the road which is still driveable is at the entrance to the town of Phimai (state route 2163).

The road has been proven to exist in the 12th and 13th century, but it is quite certain that it existed earlier. Most of the buildings along the road date from the reign of King Jayavarman VII.

The road used the Ta Muen Thom pass over the Dângrêk Mountains, and the first major stop was the Phanom Rung temple.

<doc id="451261" wikidata="Q578075" url="?curid=451261" title="Phnom Bakheng">
<text>Phnom Bakheng ( ) is a Hindu temple in the form of a temple mountain in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. Dedicated to Shiva, it was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman (889–910). Located atop a hill, it is nowadays a popular tourist spot for sunset views of the much bigger temple Angkor Wat, which lies amid the jungle about 1.5 km to the southeast. The large number of visitors makes Phnom Bakheng one of the most threatened monuments of Angkor. Since 2004, World Monuments Fund has been working to conserve the temple in partnership with APSARA.

==History==
Phnom Bakheng, built more than two centuries before Angkor Wat, was once the main temple in the Angkor region. It was the central architectural feature of a new capital called Yasodharapura, established by Yasovarman when he moved the court from the old capital, Hariharalaya, in the southeast Roluos area.

An inscription dated 1052 AD and found at the Sdok Kak Thom temple in present-day Thailand states in Sanskrit: &quot;When Sri Yasovardhana became king under the name of Yasovarman, the able Vamasiva continued as his guru. By the king&#x27;s order, he set up a linga on Sri Yasodharagiri, a mountain equal in beauty to the king of mountains.&quot; Scholars believe that this passage refers to the consecration of the Phnom Bakheng temple approximately a century and a half earlier.

Phnom Bakheng is one of 3 hilltop temples in the Angkor region that are attributed to Yasovarman&#x27;s reign. The other two are Phnom Krom to the south near the Tonle Sap lake, and Phnom Bok, northeast of the East Baray reservoir.

Workers built a protective outer moat around the mountain and temple. There were avenues extending in the north, south, east, and west directions from the mountain. A raised pathway, first going northwest to southeast from the old capital to the new capital&#x27;s outer moat, and then turning to go east to west, connected directly to the east entrance of the temple.

Later in its history, Phnom Bakheng was converted into a Buddhist temple. A monumental Sitting Buddha, now lost, was created on its upper tier. Across its west side, a Reclining Buddha of similar scale was crafted in stone. The outlines of this figure are still visible.

==Symbolism==
Phnom Bakheng is a symbolic representation of Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods, a status emphasized by the temple&#x27;s location atop a steep hill 65 m above the surrounding plain. The temple is built in a pyramid form of seven levels, representing the seven heavens. At the top level, five sandstone sanctuaries, in various states of repair, stand in a quincunx pattern—one in the center and one at each corner of the level&#x27;s square. Originally, 108 small towers were arrayed around the temple at ground level and on various of its tiers; most of them have collapsed.

Jean Filliozat of the Ecole Francaise, a leading western authority on Indian cosmology and astronomy, interpreted the symbolism of the temple. The temple sits on a rectangular base and rises in five levels and is crowned by five main towers. One hundred four smaller towers are distributed over the lower four levels, placed so symmetrically that only 33 can be seen from the center of any side. Thirty-three is the number of gods who dwelt on Mount Meru. Phnom Bakheng&#x27;s total number of towers is also significant. The center one represents the axis of the world and the 108 smaller ones represent the four lunar phases, each with 27 days. The seven levels of the monument represent the seven heavens and each terrace contains 12 towers which represent the 12-year cycle of Jupiter. According to University of Chicago scholar Paul Wheatley, it is &quot;an astronomical calendar in stone.&quot;

Following Angkor&#x27;s rediscovery by the outside world in the mid-19th century, decades passed before archeologists grasped Phnom Bakheng&#x27;s historical significance. For many years, scholars&#x27; consensus view was that the Bayon, the temple located at the center of Angkor Thom city, was the edifice to which the Sdok Kak Thom inscription referred. Later work identified the Bayon as a Buddhist site, built almost three centuries later than originally thought, in the late 12th century, and Phnom Bakheng as King Yasovarman&#x27;s state temple.

==Phnom Bakheng in popular media ==
The view of the Angkor Wat from the top of Phnom Bakheng is featured in the movie Tomb Raider (when Lara Croft looks through the binoculars upon arriving in Cambodia).

<text>Phnom Krom (, lit. &quot;downstream hill&quot;) is a 140 m high hill close to Siem Reap city, Cambodia. There is a temple on the top which derived its name from the hill, Prasat Phnom Krom ().

==Location==
Phnom Krom is about 12 kilometers southwest of Siem Reap town.

Phnom Krom hill is very rocky; local legend has it that the rocks were exposed by the monkey general Hanuman during a hunt for medicine in the Ramayana epic. The area beyond the temple’s west gate affords views of the Tonle Sap lake.

==Phnom Krom railway==
Phnom Krom was at the southern end of the Phnom Krom railway, a narrow-gauge French colonial railway that was most likely constructed to take stone from the now-defunct quarries on Phnom Krom to Siem Reap.

<text>Spean Thma (, &quot;Spéan Thmâ&quot;; lit. &quot;stone bridge&quot;) in Angkor, Cambodia is known as the &quot;bridge of stone&quot; and it is located west of Ta Keo. It is one of the few Khmer Empire era bridges to have survived to the modern day.

It was built on the former path of the Siem Reap River between Angkor Thom and the Eastern Baray and it was probably rebuilt after the Khmer period (around the 15th century), as it includes many reused sandstone blocks.

The 14 narrow arches are 1.10 m wide.

Several other bridges on the same model are visible: in the Angkor site (Spean Memai) and at several locations of the former empire. On the road from Angkor to Beng Mealea, the Spean Praptos is one of the longest with 25 arches.

<doc id="451268" wikidata="Q7142801" url="?curid=451268" title="Passive attack">
<text>A passive attack on a cryptosystem is one in which the cryptanalyst cannot interact with any of the parties involved, attempting to break the system solely based upon observed data (i.e. the ciphertext). This can also include known plaintext attacks where both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext are known.

While active attackers can interact with the parties by sending data, a passive attacker is limited to intercepting communications (eavesdropping), and seeks to decrypt data by interpreting the transcripts of authentication sessions. Since passive attackers do not introduce data of their own, they can be difficult to detect.

While most classical ciphers are vulnerable to this form of attack, most modern ciphers are designed to prevent this type of attack above all others.

== Attributes ==
*Traffic analysis
*Non-evasive eavesdropping and monitoring of transmissions
*Because data unaffected, tricky to detect
*Emphasis on prevention (encryption) not detection
*Sometimes referred to as &quot;tapping&quot;

The main types of passive attacks are traffic analysis and release of message contents.

During a traffic analysis attack, the eavesdropper analyzes the traffic, determines the location, identifies communicating hosts and observes the frequency and length of exchanged messages. He uses all this information to predict the nature of communication. All incoming and outgoing traffic of the network is analyzed, but not altered.

For a release of message content, a telephonic conversation, an E-mail message or a transferred file may contain confidential data. A passive attack monitors the contents of the transmitted data.

Passive attacks are very difficult to detect because they do not involve any alteration of the data. When the messages are exchanged neither the sender nor the receiver is aware that a third party may capture the messages. This can be prevented by encryption of data.

A recent study on the cybersecurity of wearable devices used passive attacks on different smartwatches to test whether they have significant vulnerabilities and whether they are the best targets during the pairing process.

<text>John Franklin Street (born October 15, 1943) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 97th Mayor of the City of Philadelphia. He was first elected to a term beginning on January 3, 2000, and was re-elected to a second term beginning in 2004. He is a Democrat and became mayor after having served 19 years in the Philadelphia City Council, including seven years as its president, before resigning as required under the Philadelphia City Charter in order to run for mayor. He followed Ed Rendell as mayor, assuming the post on January 3, 2000. Street was Philadelphia&#x27;s second black mayor.

Street floated the possibility of being a candidate for statewide office in Pennsylvania. In light of corruption scandals, those prospects never materialized. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; listed him as one of the three worst big-city mayors in the United States in 2005.

==Background and early career==
Street was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and grew up as a member of a farming household. He graduated from Conshohocken High School, received a B.A. degree in English from Oakwood College in Huntsville, Alabama, and his J.D. degree from Temple University, which he had to apply to several times before he was accepted. Following his graduation from law school, Street served clerkships with Common Pleas Court Judge Mathew W. Bullock, Jr. and with the United States Department of Justice from which he was quickly terminated for poor performance. In his first professional job Street taught English at an elementary school and, later, at the Philadelphia Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC). He then practiced law briefly prior to entering into public service. Street is married and has four children, including Sharif Street, and is a practicing Seventh-day Adventist. His deceased brother, Milton, was a former member of the state legislature, and a two-time mayoral candidate.

Inspired by his brother&#x27;s successful election in 1978, Street made his initial foray into elected politics in 1979, when he challenged incumbent Fifth District Councilman Cecil B. Moore. Moore was a popular and respected civil rights leader in the city who was active within the NAACP, and Street&#x27;s decision to challenge him drew the ire of some. Moore, who was in failing health, initially sought to see-off the challenge from Street but died before the May primary. Street won the election, and quelled some of the tensions over his original challenge to Moore by sponsoring a bill to rename the former Columbia Avenue in Moore&#x27;s honor.

Street was chosen unanimously by members of the Council to serve as President in 1992, after incumbent Joe Coleman retired, and was re-elected in 1996. Street, working closely with former Mayor Ed Rendell, was instrumental in crafting and implementing a financial plan that passed Council unanimously, and turned a $250 million deficit into the largest surplus in city history. Despite decreasing the business and wage tax four years in a row, Philadelphia still has the 10th largest tax burden in the United States. This is due to the financial burden to run the city&#x27;s prisons, pay debt service, and employee pensions and health benefits.

==Mayor of Philadelphia==

===Elections===

====1999====
Street was elected in one of the closest elections in Philadelphia history, defeating Republican Sam Katz by a margin of fewer than 7,500.

In an unusual circumstance, the City Council President at the time, Anna Verna, was briefly in the position of running the city before Mayor Street was sworn in, as Rendell resigned the post in December 1999 to become the head of the DNC (per Article III, Chapter 5, Section 3-500 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter).
In 2001, he was named runner up &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; by PoliticsPA.

====2003====
Street was once again challenged by Sam Katz in the 2003 mayoral election. Despite an ongoing FBI investigation, Street was aided by Pennsylvania Governor and former Mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell endorsing and campaigning for him. He was named the 2003 Politician of the Year by the political website PoliticsPA, because &quot;It takes an extremely shrewd and effective politician to turn an FBI bugging of the mayor&#x27;s office into a positive but that&#x27;s exactly what Mayor John Street did.&quot; Street won with 58% of the vote for reelection.

The race was covered in the documentary film &quot;The Shame of a City&quot;.

===Policy===
His relationship with the City Council was tenuous at best. He and former councilman Michael Nutter, who became the 98th Mayor of Philadelphia, often engaged in public political sparring. Regardless, Street ultimately agreed to a 2005 revision of Nutter&#x27;s New York-style smoking ban (after much public criticism over his failure to support a smoking ban in Philadelphia).
During Street&#x27;s first term, much emphasis was placed on the &quot;Neighborhood Transformation Initiative.&quot; The Neighborhood Transformation Initiative (NTI), which was unveiled in April 2001 was an unprecedented effort to counter the history of decline in the City of Philadelphia and revitalize its neighborhoods. The program was designed to revitalize and restore communities, to develop or restore quality housing, to clean and secure streets, and to create opportunities for vibrant cultural and recreational facilities.

Initially, opponents raised objections to the program&#x27;s emphasis on demolishing abandoned buildings rather than seeking re-use or restoration of the sometimes historic properties. Others hailed the program for bringing much-needed investment to the city&#x27;s many poor neighborhoods. However, initial results have been positive. Since 2000, the average home in Philadelphia has appreciated by approximately 30 percent. The housing market continues to thrive, and developers have created more than 4,880 market-rate apartments and condominiums in the past several years.

Street also made children and their welfare a focus of his first term in office. In his first inaugural address in January 2000, Street officially proclaimed the year 2000 &quot;The Year of the Child&quot; in Philadelphia. He sought to increase funding for after-school programs, and formed the Philadelphia Children&#x27;s Commission, a diverse group of government, civic, business, and faith-based leadership, whose job it was to advise Street on policies and programs that would have a positive impact in the lives of Philadelphia&#x27;s children. He also sought to fight truancy among school aged children.

The city&#x27;s public schools were among the worst in the country when Street took office, and much of his attention early on went into difficult decisions about the schools. In November 2001, a compromise between Street and the Republican-controlled General Assembly allowed for the privatization of the Philadelphia Public Schools. Edison Schools took over day-to-day operations of some of the worst-performing city schools, while a small number were taken over by other institutions, primarily area universities.

In August 2001, the lucrative Philadelphia Parking Authority was taken over by the Pennsylvania government in a compromise designed to help the Philadelphia School District out of its fiscal crisis. Many believed that the Parking Authority&#x27;s revenues were politically insubstantial in comparison with the high-profile patronage positions on the Parking Authority&#x27;s board that were transferred from Democratic to Republican hands in the move.
Drawing ire from skateboarders, he banned skateboarding from the internationally famous Love Park after the city had hosted the X-Games in 2001 and 2002 at the Wachovia Center. In 2004, he turned down a $1-million offer from DC Shoes to maintain and renovate the park to allow skating. Instead the city spent $800,000 on adding obstacles to prevent skaters from skating in the park.

Street created the Office of Health and Fitness after the city was named the fattest city in the nation by &quot;Men&#x27;s Fitness&quot; magazine in 1999. The magazine cited the low number of athletic facilities and high number of fast-food restaurants. Street also signed into law a smoking ban on September 12, 2006.

Street also advocated the construction of a citywide Wi-Fi network. The network is to be run by the non-profit organization Wireless Philadelphia in partnership with the city and commercial internet service providers. Opponents of the plan suggest that government involvement will quash innovation. Supporters hope that the plan will help bring information access to poor Philadelphians and make the city more attractive to young and educated people.

In a 2002 address at a convention of the NAACP, Street said that &quot;the brothers and sisters are running the city. Oh, yes. The brothers and sisters are running this city. Running it! Don&#x27;t you let nobody fool you, we are in charge of the City of Brotherly Love. We are in charge! We are in charge!&quot; This observation attracted some criticism and charges of racial divisiveness.

The murder rate in Philadelphia hit a seven-year high during Street&#x27;s tenure, but the overall trend was significantly lower than in the 1970s under Frank Rizzo. In 2005 there were 380 murders, up from 330 in 2004. Forty-five percent of those murdered were 25 or younger. 2006 saw 406 murders in the city, including a Philadelphia police officer. This murder trend continued to escalate into 2007, with 127 murders occurring by the end of April, 2007, a rate far in excess of the larger cities of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. At least one commentator referred to Street as being &quot;strangely silent&quot; in his efforts to reduce the city&#x27;s murder rate.

On July 27, 2006, Street launched the Adolescent Violence Reduction Partnership (AVRP) as a way to prevent high risk youth (target age 10-15) from being victims of combat violence. He also expanded the Youth Violence Reduction Partnership (YVRP) into the 19th Police District in West Philadelphia.

On September 12, 2007, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson, an African-American, supported by Street, called on &quot;10,000 black men&quot; to patrol the streets to lessen crime. On Halloween Day, with the 2007 murder total above 335, a Philadelphia police officer was shot and killed for the second time in as many years (he was the third officer to be shot in a four-day period).

==Controversies==

===City Hall corruption scandal===
During the re-election campaign against Sam Katz, the FBI acknowledged that it had placed listening devices in the Mayor&#x27;s office as part of a sweeping investigation of municipal corruption. The FBI&#x27;s investigation uncovered a corruption scheme led by Street&#x27;s friend and fund raiser Ron White, who died before going to trial. Former city treasurer Corey Kemp, a member of Street&#x27;s administration, was sentenced to 10 years in jail after being found guilty on 27 corruption-related charges in May 2005. Eventually at least 15 individuals connected to Street were convicted of crimes related to City Hall corruption. One additional prosecution of members of Street&#x27;s administration took place in the wake of the Kemp conviction and resulted in an acquittal of Mayoral Aide John D. Christmas.

In September 2005, a prominent Muslim clergyman, Shamsud-din Ali, in Philadelphia was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on racketeering and other charges. Prosecutors said the cleric, who was once a member of Mayor John F. Street&#x27;s transition team, used his political connections to obtain dubious loans, donations and city contracts. Ali was sentenced to 87 months in prison. His conviction was affirmed on July 18, 2007, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (493 F.3d 387).

Leonard Ross, a lawyer and close advisor of Mayor Street, who led a committee trying to develop a crucial piece of city-owned property, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in December 2005, and later pleaded guilty to the charges.

The 2003 Philadelphia mayoral election was captured in the documentary film &quot;The Shame of a City&quot; by Tigre Hill, which gave viewers an inside look at the campaign and portrayed Street in a negative light.

In November 2006, federal authorities charged that Milton Street, Street&#x27;s older brother, traded on his last name to obtain lucrative city contracts and failed to pay taxes on more than $2 million in income. It was alleged that soon after Mayor Street took office in 2000, Milton Street began hiring himself out as consultant to companies that thought he could help them get city contracts. One company paid Milton Street $30,000 a month consulting fee. Milton Street was found guilty on tax charges.

===Boy Scout controversy===

On July 31, 2006, Mayor Street ordered the local Boy Scouts council, Cradle of Liberty Council, to admit gay scout leaders, vacate the city-owned building that it has occupied since 1928, or pay market rent. Although the city subsidizes rental space for more than 75 community and activist organizations, including 14 other youth organizations and several religious groups that have restrictive membership policies, the Mayor took the position that the Boy Scouts were not in compliance with the city&#x27;s anti-discrimination ordinance. The Scouts argued that the city&#x27;s action violated their right to freedom of assembly guaranteed under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case ended with the court ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts of America. The Cradle of Liberty Council was also awarded $877,000 for legal costs arising from the city&#x27;s unlawful action.

==Post-mayoral career==
John Street&#x27;s mayoral tenure ended on January 7, 2008. Upon leaving office, Street accepted an adjunct faculty position in the Temple University Department of Political Science. That spring, he taught two sections of a class on urban politics. Asked about his transition from public life to academia, the former mayor was quoted as saying, &quot;You know what? I think I&#x27;m really going to like it here!&quot;

Street was Chairman of the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) board when it came under criticism for poor oversight and mismanagement. The board was accused of improprieties in its legal spending, of failing to oversee president Carl R. Greene before he was fired from the agency, and of other ethical violations. Control of the PHA was taken from the city of Philadelphia and given to Housing and Urban Development in 2011 to address these issues and was then returned to the city in 2013 under the direction of a new board.

In 2011, he changed his voter registration from Democrat to Independent. Though Street maintained the switch was only, &quot;..a means of keeping a variety of options available as a matter of good politics...&quot;, some had speculated that he intended to challenge incumbent Democratic Mayor Michael Nutter in the 2011 mayoral election. He ultimately did not participate in the primary, and instead his brother, Milton Street challenged and lost to Mayor Nutter.

<doc id="451281" wikidata="Q42402" url="?curid=451281" title="Andrea Bocelli">
<text>Andrea Bocelli (; born 22 September 1958) is an Italian tenor. He rose to fame in 1994 after winning the newcomers&#x27; section of the 44th Sanremo Music Festival performing &quot;Il mare calmo della sera&quot;.

Since 1994, Bocelli has recorded 15 solo studio albums of both pop and classical music, three greatest hits albums, and nine complete operas, selling over 90 million records worldwide. He has had success as a crossover performer, bringing classical music to the top of international pop charts. His album &quot;Romanza&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time, while &quot;Sacred Arias&quot; is the biggest selling classical album by any solo artist in history. &quot;My Christmas&quot; was the best-selling holiday album of 2009

 and one of the best-selling holiday albums in the United States. The 2019 album &quot;Sì&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming Bocelli&#x27;s first number-one album in both countries. His song &quot;Con te partirò&quot;, included on his second album &quot;Bocelli&quot;, is one of the best-selling singles of all time.

In 1998, Bocelli was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People. He duetted with Celine Dion on the song &quot;The Prayer&quot; for the animated film &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;, which won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1999, he was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards. He captured a listing in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; with the release of his classical album &quot;Sacred Arias&quot;, as he simultaneously held the top three positions on the US Classical Albums charts.

Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2006, and was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 2 March 2010, for his contribution to Live Theater, and he was awarded a gold medal for Merit in Serbia in 2022. Singer Celine Dion has said that &quot;if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli&quot;, and record producer David Foster has often described Bocelli&#x27;s voice as the most beautiful in the world.

Bocelli was born to Alessandro and Edi Bocelli on 22 September 1958. His sight was impaired from birth due to congenital glaucoma. He stated that his mother&#x27;s decision to give birth to him and overrule the doctor&#x27;s advice was the inspiration for him to oppose abortion.

Bocelli grew up on his family&#x27;s farm, with a younger brother Alberto, where they sold farm machinery and made wine in the small village of La Sterza, near Lajatico, Tuscany, Italy, about south of Pisa.

Bocelli showed a great passion for music as a young boy. His mother has said that music was the only thing that would comfort him. He started piano lessons at age 6 and later learned to play the flute, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, guitar, and drums. His nanny Oriana gave him the first record of Franco Corelli, and he began to show interest in pursuing the career of a tenor. By age 7, he was able to recognize the famous voices of the time and tried to emulate the great singers.

At age 12, Bocelli lost his vision completely after being hit in the eye with a football. Doctors resorted to leeches in a last-ditch effort to save his sight, but they were unsuccessful and he remained blind.

Bocelli also spent time singing during his childhood. He gave his first concert in a small village not far from where he was born. He won his first song competition at age 14 with &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot; at the Margherita d&#x27;Oro in Viareggio. He finished secondary school in 1980, and then studied law at the University of Pisa. To earn money, he performed evenings in piano bars, and it was there that he met his future wife Enrica in 1987. He completed law school and spent one year as a court-appointed lawyer.

==Career==

===1992–1994: Sanremo and &quot;Il mare calmo della sera&quot;===
In 1992, Italian rock star Zucchero held auditions for tenors to make a demo tape of his song &quot;Miserere&quot;, to send to Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. After hearing Bocelli on tape, Pavarotti urged Zucchero to use Bocelli instead of him. Pavarotti eventually persuaded Zucchero to record the song with Bocelli, and it became a hit throughout Europe. In Zucchero&#x27;s European concert tour in 1993, Bocelli accompanied him to sing the duet, and he was also given solo sets in the concerts, singing &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; from Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot;. Bocelli signed with the Sugar Music label in Milan after Caterina Caselli heard him sing &quot;Miserere&quot; and &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; at a birthday party for Zucchero.

In December, Bocelli entered the preliminary round of the Sanremo Music Festival in the category of Giovani, performing &quot;Miserere&quot;. He won the preliminary competition with the highest marks ever recorded in the newcomers&#x27; section. On 28 December, he debuted in the classical world in a concert at the Teatro Romolo Valli in Reggio Emilia. In February 1994, he entered the main Sanremo Festival competition with &quot;Il mare calmo della sera&quot;, and he won the newcomers section, again with a record score. Following his win, Bocelli released his debut album of the same name in April, and it entered the Italian Top Ten, being certified platinum within weeks.

In May 1994, he toured with pop singer Gerardina Trovato. In September, he sang at Pavarotti&#x27;s annual Charity Gala concert, &quot;Pavarotti International&quot; in Modena, where he sang Ruggiero Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Mattinata&quot; and sang a duet with Pavarotti, :it:Maurizio Morante&#x27;s &quot;Notte e Piscatore&quot;. In September, he made his opera debut as Macduff in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Teatro Verdi in Pisa. Bocelli had been an agnostic, but around 1994, partly as a result of immersing himself in the works of Russian author Leo Tolstoy, he returned to the practice of the Catholic faith. He performed the hymn &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; in Rome before Pope John Paul II in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica at Christmas.

===1995–1997: &quot;Bocelli&quot; and &quot;Romanza&quot;===
As winner of the newcomers&#x27; section at the 1994 Sanremo Festival, Bocelli was invited to return the following year. He entered the main competition with &quot;Con te partirò&quot; and finished in fourth place. The song was included on his second album, &quot;Bocelli&quot;, produced by Mauro Malavasi and released in November 1995. In Belgium, &quot;Con te partirò&quot; became the best-selling single of all time.

His third album, &quot;Viaggio Italiano&quot;, was released in Italy in 1996. He was invited to sing a duet with English soprano Sarah Brightman at the final bout of German boxer Henry Maske. Brightman approached Bocelli after she heard him singing &quot;Con te partirò&quot; while she was dining in a restaurant. Changing the title lyric of the song to &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, they re-recorded it as a duet with members of the London Symphony Orchestra and sang it as a farewell for Maske. The single debuted atop the German charts, where it stayed for fourteen weeks. With sales nearing three million copies, and a sextuple platinum award, &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot; eclipsed the previous best-selling single by more than one million copies. In 1996 he topped the Spanish singles chart with a duet with Marta Sánchez, &quot;Vivo por ella&quot;, the Spanish version of &quot;Vivo per lei&quot;, recorded with Giorgia for his 1997 compilation album, &quot;Romanza&quot;. He also recorded a Portuguese version of the song with Brazilian singer Sandy.

The same year, Bocelli recorded &quot;Je vis pour elle&quot;, the French version of &quot;Vivo per lei&quot;, as a duet with French singer Hélène Ségara. Released in December 1997, the song became a hit in Belgium (Wallonia) and France, where it reached No. 1 on the charts. To date, it is the best-selling single for Ségara, and the second for Bocelli after &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;. On 3 March, he appeared in Hamburg, Germany, with Sarah Brightman to receive the ECHO music award for &quot;Best Single of the Year&quot;.

In the summer of 1997, he gave 22 open-air concerts in Germany, and an indoor concert in Oberhausen on 31 August. In September, he performed in concert at the Piazza dei Cavalieri in Pisa for the home video &quot;A Night in Tuscany&quot; () with guests Nuccia Focile, Sarah Brightman and Zucchero.

==Voice==
Bocelli is a widely popular singer with a substantial fan base worldwide. However, he is also a polarizing figure in classical music, whose voice and performances
have routinely been the subject of negative reviews by critics. Italian spinto tenor Franco Corelli praised Bocelli&#x27;s voice after hearing it for the first time during a master class in 1986, in Turin, and he later gave Bocelli private lessons.

Puerto Rican soprano Ana María Martínez, who regularly performs with Bocelli, said, &quot;More than anything, Andrea has something that is unique in that he brings this light that is always around him. And this purity of heart and beauty of sound just touches the listener. It can&#x27;t be described.&quot;

Celine Dion said while introducing him during her Christmas Special for &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;, in 1998, that &quot;if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli,&quot; and David Foster, a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli&#x27;s voice as the most beautiful in the world. Similarly, jazz singer Al Jarreau, who performed with Bocelli on the &quot;Night of the Proms&quot; tour in Europe in 1995, described him as &quot;the most beautiful voice in the world,&quot; and American talk show host Oprah Winfrey commented on her talk show that, &quot;when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears.&quot; After attending Bocelli&#x27;s concert at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor said, &quot;My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being. God has kissed this man and I thank God for it.&quot; Taylor had been a passionate fan of Bocelli since the beginning of his music career in the mid-1990s. Other fans include Albert II, Prince of Monaco, who invited the tenor to sing at his wedding, as well as Sarah, Duchess of York, and actress Isabella Rossellini.

Bocelli&#x27;s voice, more specifically his interpretation of opera, has been regularly criticized by classical music critics. These include Bernard Holland of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Andrew Clements of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; chief music critic Anthony Tommasini in his review of Bocelli&#x27;s North American opera debut at the Detroit Opera House in the title role of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; commented, &quot;The basic colour of Mr. Bocelli&#x27;s voice is warm and pleasant, but he lacks the technique to support and project his sound. His sustained notes wobble. His soft high notes are painfully weak. Inadequate breath control often forces him to clip off notes prematurely at the end of phrases.&quot; In December 2000, Tommasini again criticised Bocelli, this time for his &quot;La bohème&quot; album when he stated that Bocelli &quot;still has trouble with basic things, like breath support&quot; and his voice had been &quot;carefully recorded ... to help it match the trained voices of the other cast members in fullness and presence.&quot;

In describing Bocelli&#x27;s singing, &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Bernard Holland noted, &quot;the tone is rasping, thin and, in general, poorly supported. Even the most modest upward movement thins it even more, signalling what appears to be the onset of strangulation. To his credit, Mr Bocelli sings mostly in tune. But his phrasing tends toward carelessness and rhythmic jumble... The diction is not clear.&quot; Furthermore, Holland observed that &quot;The critic&#x27;s duty is to report that Mr Bocelli is not a very good singer.&quot; The Associated Press reported &quot;Passion? Yes. Power. No. Bocelli&#x27;s voice – though robust in spirit and precisely in tune, even in the upper register – had a thin quality that never opened up.&quot; Similarly, classical music critic Andrew Clements found Bocelli&#x27;s studio opera recordings consistently disappointing in quality: &quot;Bocelli&#x27;s profoundly unmusical contribution, with its unvaryingly coarse tone, wayward intonation and never a phrase properly shaped, fatally undermines all their contributions.&quot; Anne Midgette of &quot;The New York Times&quot; agreed, noting &quot;a thinness of voice, oddly anemic phrasing (including shortchanging upper notes of phrases in a most untenorial manner), a curious lack of expression.&quot;

During a 2009 performance in New York, the music critic Steve Smith wrote &quot;For cognoscenti of vocal artistry the risks involved in Mr. Bocelli&#x27;s undertakings, both then and now, need no explanation. Substantial technical shortcomings masked by amplification are laid bare in a more conventional classical setting. Mr. Bocelli&#x27;s tone can be pleasant, and his pitch is generally secure. But his voice is small and not well supported; his phrasing, wayward and oddly inexpressive.&quot;

In 2010, Joe Banno of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave an unfavourable review of Bocelli&#x27;s , describing the oft-noted failings in Bocelli&#x27;s vocal resources on full display in this performance: &quot;Bocelli, to be fair, possesses an essentially lovely tenor and knows his stuff when it comes to selling a pop ballad. And Decca&#x27;s close miking of his puny voice inflates his sound to near-Franco Corelli-like dimensions. But his short-breathed, clumsily phrased, interpretively blank and often pinched and strained singing makes his Don Jose a tough listen.&quot;

Bocelli met his first wife, Enrica Cenzatti, while singing at piano bars early in his career. They were married on 27 June 1992. Their first child, son Amos, was born on 22 February 1995. Their second son, Matteo, was born on 8 October 1997. The couple separated in 2002.

On 30 April 2000, Bocelli&#x27;s father, Alessandro Bocelli, died. His mother encouraged him to honor his commitments, and so he sang for Pope John Paul II, in Rome, on 1 May, and immediately returned home for the funeral. At his 5 July performance, filmed for PBS as &quot;American Dream—Andrea Bocelli&#x27;s Statue of Liberty Concert&quot;, Bocelli dedicated the encore &quot;Sogno&quot; (Dream), from his 1999 album &quot;Sogno&quot;, to the memory of his father. His mother and brother continued to live in the family home after his father&#x27;s death.

Bocelli lives with his second wife and manager, Veronica Berti. They met in 2002 and married on 21 March 2014, at the Sanctuary of Montenero in the coastal town of Livorno, Italy. In September 2011, the couple announced that Berti was expecting her first and Bocelli&#x27;s third child. His daughter Virginia was born 21 March 2012. The couple lives in Forte dei Marmi on the Mediterranean. Bocelli&#x27;s first wife and two sons live in the couple&#x27;s previous residence in the same comune, in Versilia.

On 12 November 2022, Andrea, Matteo and Virginia (aged 10) sang together at The Royal Albert Hall at the UK Festival of Remembrance.

Bocelli has enjoyed horseback riding for much of his life.

A section of the beach in Jesolo, on the Italian Adriatic coast, was named after Bocelli on 11 August 2003.

In October 2013, Bocelli bought a second home in North Miami Beach.

Bocelli is a self-declared fan of the Italian football club Inter Milan. In an interview in Pisa, he told a group of Inter fans that &quot;My passion for Inter started during my college years, when Inter was winning everything in Italy and the world. When Inter won the Champions League in 2010, I was with my friends and I was listening to the game on the radio, and everything was a little bit in advance so I was celebrating before them. That night I was also brought to tears of joy. The treble is a feeling no one in Italy will be able to equal&quot;.

On 12 November 2023, Bocelli performed &#x27;Hallelujah&#x27; with his daughter Virginia on the BBC One programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Bocelli performed &#x27;Oh Holy Night&#x27; with his son Matteo on the December 2023 theatrical release of &quot;Christmas with the Chosen: Holy Night&quot;.

===Teatro del Silenzio===

In 2006, Bocelli convinced the municipality of his hometown Lajatico to build an outdoor theatre, the &quot;Teatro del Silenzio&quot;. He serves as its honorary president and performs usually for one night only, every July; the rest of the year, the theatre does not operate.

Since its opening in 2006, guest performers have included Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Sarah Brightman, Katherine Jenkins, Zucchero, Laura Pausini, and Elisa. Bocelli&#x27;s guests have also included instrumentalists Lang Lang, Chris Botti, and Kenny G. The 2007 concert was released on CD and DVD in 2008.

<text>The Rabin cryptosystem is a family of public-key encryption schemes
based on a trapdoor function whose security, like that of RSA, is related to the difficulty of integer factorization.

The Rabin trapdoor function has the advantage that inverting it has been mathematically proven to be as hard as factoring integers, while there is no such proof known for the RSA trapdoor function.
It has the disadvantage that each output of the Rabin function can be generated by any of four possible inputs; if each output is a ciphertext, extra complexity is required on decryption to identify which of the four possible inputs was the true plaintext.
Naive attempts to work around this often either enable a chosen-ciphertext attack to recover the secret key or, by encoding redundancy in the plaintext space, invalidate the proof of security relative to factoring.

Public-key encryption schemes based on the Rabin trapdoor function are used mainly for examples in textbooks.
In contrast, RSA is the basis of standard public-key encryption schemes such as RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSAES-OAEP that are used widely in practice.

==History==
The Rabin trapdoor function was first published as part of the Rabin signature scheme in 1978 by Michael O. Rabin.
The Rabin signature scheme was the first digital signature scheme where forging a signature could be proven to be as hard as factoring.

The trapdoor function was later repurposed in textbooks as an example of a public-key encryption scheme,
which came to be known as the Rabin cryptosystem even though Rabin never published it as an encryption scheme.

==Encryption Algorithm==
Like all asymmetric cryptosystems, the Rabin system uses a key pair: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key is published for anyone to use, while the private key remains known only to the recipient of the message.

===Key generation===

The keys for the Rabin cryptosystem are generated as follows:

# Choose two large distinct prime numbers formula_1 and formula_2 such that formula_3 and formula_4.
# Compute formula_5. 
Then formula_6 is the public key and the pair formula_7 is the private key.

===Encryption===
A message formula_8 can be encrypted by first converting it to a number formula_9 using a reversible mapping, then computing formula_10. The ciphertext is formula_11.

===Decryption===
The message formula_12 can be recovered from the ciphertext formula_11 by taking its square root modulo formula_6 as follows.

# Compute the square root of formula_11 modulo formula_1 and formula_2 using these formulas:
#: formula_18
# Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find formula_19 and formula_20 such that formula_21. 
# Use the Chinese remainder theorem to find the four square roots of formula_11 modulo formula_6: 
#: formula_24

One of these four values is the original plaintext formula_12, although which of the four is the correct one cannot be determined without additional information.

====Computing square roots====
We can show that the formulas in step 1 above actually produce the square roots of formula_11 as follows. For the first formula, we want to prove that formula_27. Since formula_28 the exponent formula_29 is an integer. The proof is trivial if formula_30, so we may assume that formula_1 does not divide formula_11. Note that formula_33 implies that formula_34, so c is a quadratic residue modulo formula_1. Then
: formula_36
The last step is justified by Euler&#x27;s criterion.

===Example===
As an example, take formula_37 and formula_38, then formula_39. Take formula_40 as our plaintext. The ciphertext is thus 
formula_41.

Decryption proceeds as follows:
# Compute formula_42 and formula_43. 
# Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to compute formula_44 and formula_45. We can confirm that formula_46.
# Compute the four plaintext candidates:
#: formula_47

and we see that formula_48 is the desired plaintext. Note that all four candidates are square roots of 15 mod 77. That is, for each candidate, formula_49, so each formula_50 encrypts to the same value, 15.

==Digital Signature Algorithm==

The Rabin cryptosystem can be used to create and verify digital signatures. Creating a signature requires the private key formula_7. Verifying a signature requires the public key formula_6.

===Signing===
A message formula_12 can be signed with a private key formula_7 as follows.
# Generate a random value formula_55.
# Use a cryptographic hash function formula_56 to compute formula_57, where the double-bar denotes concatenation. formula_11 should be an integer less than formula_6.
# Find a square root of formula_11 using the private key formula_7. This will produce the usual four results, formula_62.
# One might expect that squaring each formula_50 would produce formula_11. However, this will be true only if formula_11 happens to be a quadratic residue modulo formula_1 and formula_2. To determine if this is the case, square formula_68. If this does not yield formula_11, repeat this algorithm with a new random formula_55. The expected number of times this algorithm needs to be repeated before finding a suitable formula_11 is 4.
# Having found a square root formula_68 of formula_11, the signature is formula_74.

===Verifying a signature===
A signature formula_75 for a message formula_12 can be verified using the public key formula_6 as follows.
# Compute formula_57.
# Compute formula_79
# The signature is valid if formula_80 and a forgery otherwise.

==Evaluation of the algorithm==
===Effectiveness===
Decrypting produces three false results in addition to the correct one, so that the correct result must be guessed. This is the major disadvantage of the Rabin cryptosystem and one of the factors which have prevented it from finding widespread practical use.

If the plaintext is intended to represent a text message, guessing is not difficult; however, if the plaintext is intended to represent a numerical value, this issue becomes a problem that must be resolved by some kind of disambiguation scheme. It is possible to choose plaintexts with special structures, or to add padding, to eliminate this problem. A way of removing the ambiguity of inversion was suggested by Blum and Williams: the two primes used are restricted to primes congruent to 3 modulo 4 and the domain of the squaring is restricted to the set of quadratic residues. These restrictions make the squaring function into a trapdoor permutation, eliminating the ambiguity.

===Efficiency===
For encryption, a square modulo &quot;n&quot; must be calculated. This is more efficient than RSA, which requires the calculation of at least a cube.

For decryption, the Chinese remainder theorem is applied, along with two modular exponentiations. Here the efficiency is comparable to RSA.

===Security===
It has been proven that any algorithm which finds one of the possible plaintexts for every Rabin-encrypted ciphertext can be used to factor the modulus formula_6. Thus, Rabin decryption for random plaintext is at least as hard as the integer factorization problem, something that has not been proven for RSA. It is generally believed that there is no polynomial-time algorithm for factoring, which implies that there is no efficient algorithm for decrypting a random Rabin-encrypted value without the private key formula_7.

The Rabin cryptosystem does not provide indistinguishability against chosen plaintext attacks since the process of encryption is deterministic. An adversary, given a ciphertext and a candidate message, can easily determine whether or not the ciphertext encodes the candidate message (by simply checking whether encrypting the candidate message yields the given ciphertext).

The Rabin cryptosystem is insecure against a chosen ciphertext attack (even when challenge messages are chosen uniformly at random from the message space). By adding redundancies, for example, the repetition of the last 64 bits, the system can be made to produce a single root. This thwarts this specific chosen-ciphertext attack, since the decryption algorithm then only produces the root that the attacker already knows. If this technique is applied, the proof of the equivalence with the factorization problem fails, so it is uncertain as of 2004 if this variant is secure. The Handbook of Applied Cryptography by Menezes, Oorschot and Vanstone considers this equivalence probable, however, as long as the finding of the roots remains a two-part process (1. roots formula_83 and formula_84 and 2. application of the Chinese remainder theorem).

<text>The University of Bristol Students&#x27; Union (known as Bristol SU) is the students&#x27; union of the University of Bristol, England. It is among the oldest of the UK students&#x27; unions and was a founding member of the National Union of Students. The Union is a multi-site organisation which can be found at Senate House, Tyndall Avenue, Bristol, BS8 1TH and The Richmond Building, 105 Queens Road, Clifton, Bristol BS8 1LN.

==History==
The original home of the students&#x27; union was the Victoria Rooms, which was given to the University in 1920. In 1934, a serious fire destroyed the main hall and electric organ of the building, though many of the other areas were saved from serious damage. In 1965, the students&#x27; union moved to the Richmond Building on Queens&#x27; Road.

A fire in the Richmond building on 15 September 2009 caused its closure. Canoes and other water sporting equipment in a storage area in front of the building caught fire and by 9am was sending &quot;thick black smoke&quot; along the road.

For two days, starting 24 November 2010, a room of the building was occupied by students following the protests in Bristol on the same day. Among other things, the students claimed the union was failing to represent them on issues such as government funding for higher education, and rises to tuition fees. The union was also criticised for not holding an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to discuss these issues. The occupation was ended when the union agreed to call an EGM, which resulted in motions mandating the union to support students opposing tuition fees and cuts in funding to higher education.

An extensive refurbishment of the union building took place in 2014–15. The building was reopened as &#x27;the Richmond Building&#x27; in April 2015, and the union was rebranded from &#x27;the University of Bristol Union (UBU)&#x27; to &#x27;Bristol SU&#x27;.

The University of Bristol and Bristol students&#x27; union announced in March 2017 that they would be divesting from fossil fuels. This means they stated as part of a deal that they would dump investments in companies which extract coal and tar sands within a year; review investments in companies extracting oil and gas annually and gradually remove them depending on their polluting potential; and invest three million pounds into a green fund.

In April 2024, Bristol SU became more of a multi-site organisation. Based on student feedback, they brought some of the support and services to Senate House from 22 April 2024. This includes the Welcome Desk, Academic Advice Service, elected SU Officers and other staff right to the heart of campus. Students are still able to access events, activity rooms, study space, and more in the Richmond Building.

===Former Sabbatical Officers===
Former union presidents have included the broadcaster, Sue Lawley; St Lucia&#x27;s foreign minister and ambassador to the United Nations, George W. Odlum; and former Liberal Democrat MP and Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Lembit Öpik.

==Facilities and activities==
===Richmond Building===
The union was originally housed in the grand Victoria Rooms on the corner of Queen&#x27;s Road and Whiteladies Road. Today this building houses the University of Bristol&#x27;s music department. The union is now a multi-site organisation, with spaces in Senate House and the Richmond Building, Queens Road, Clifton.

The Richmond Building is one of the largest students&#x27; union buildings in Great Britain. It houses the Anson Rooms gig and performance venue; the 200-seat Winston Theatre; Burst Radio; Photography Dark Rooms; Pottery Studio; Computer Rooms; Epigram (student newspaper) and UBTV offices; various meeting rooms, study spaces and society headquarters. It is also home to the Balloon Bar.

===Elected officers===
Bristol SU is run by a team of seven officers who are elected by the student body annually in March. They represent students and have the job of improving the student experience at Bristol. The officer team is made up of Liberation, Equality and Access Officer, Postgraduate Education Officer, Sport and Student Development Officer, Student Living Officer, Undergraduate Education Officer, Union Affairs Officer and International Students Officer.

===Activities===
Bristol SU currently offers over 400 societies, sports clubs and networks covering a wide range of activities. All societies and clubs are entirely student-run by their elected committees, and are supported by the union.

<doc id="451285" wikidata="Q7883037" url="?curid=451285" title="Undeniable signature">
<text>An undeniable signature is a digital signature scheme which allows the signer to be selective to whom they allow to verify signatures. The scheme adds explicit signature repudiation, preventing a signer later refusing to verify a signature by omission; a situation that would devalue the signature in the eyes of the verifier. It was invented by David Chaum and Hans van Antwerpen in 1989.

== Overview ==
In this scheme, a signer possessing a private key can publish a signature of a message. However, the signature reveals nothing to a recipient/verifier of the message and signature without taking part in either of two interactive protocols:
* Confirmation protocol, which confirms that a candidate is a valid signature of the message issued by the signer, identified by the public key.
* Disavowal protocol, which confirms that a candidate is not a valid signature of the message issued by the signer.

The motivation for the scheme is to allow the signer to choose to whom signatures are verified. However, that the signer might claim the signature is invalid at any later point, by refusing to take part in verification, would devalue signatures to verifiers. The disavowal protocol distinguishes these cases removing the signer&#x27;s plausible deniability.

It is important that the confirmation and disavowal exchanges are not transferable. They achieve this by having the property of zero-knowledge; both parties can create transcripts of both confirmation and disavowal that are indistinguishable, to a third-party, of correct exchanges.

The designated verifier signature scheme improves upon deniable signatures by allowing, for each signature, the interactive portion of the scheme to be offloaded onto another party, a designated verifier, reducing the burden on the signer.

== Zero-knowledge protocol ==
The following protocol was suggested by David Chaum.

A group, &quot;G&quot;, is chosen in which the discrete logarithm problem is intractable, and all operation in the scheme take place in this group. Commonly, this will be the finite cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot; contained in Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, with &quot;p&quot; being a large prime number; this group is equipped with the group operation of integer multiplication modulo &quot;n&quot;. An arbitrary primitive element (or generator), &quot;g&quot;, of &quot;G&quot; is chosen; computed powers of &quot;g&quot; then combine obeying fixed axioms.

Alice generates a key pair, randomly chooses a private key, &quot;x&quot;, and then derives and publishes the public key, &quot;y = gx&quot;.

=== Message signing ===
# Alice signs the message, &quot;m&quot;, by computing and publishing the signature, &quot;z = mx&quot;.

=== Confirmation (i.e., avowal) protocol ===
Bob wishes to verify the signature, &quot;z&quot;, of &quot;m&quot; by Alice under the key, &quot;y&quot;.
# Bob picks two random numbers: &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, and uses them to blind the message, sending to Alice: 
# Alice picks a random number, &quot;q&quot;, uses it to blind, &quot;c&quot;, and then signing this using her private key, &quot;x&quot;, sending to Bob: Note that 
# Bob reveals &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;.
# Alice verifies that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the correct blind values, then, if so, reveals &quot;q&quot;. Revealing these blinds makes the exchange zero knowledge.
# Bob verifies &quot;s1&quot; = &quot;cgq&quot;, proving &quot;q&quot; has not been chosen dishonestly, and proving z is valid signature issued by Alice&#x27;s key. Note that 

Alice can cheat at step 2 by attempting to randomly guess &quot;s2&quot;.

=== Disavowal protocol ===
Alice wishes to convince Bob that &quot;z&quot; is not a valid signature of &quot;m&quot; under the key, &quot;gx&quot;; i.e., &quot;z ≠ mx&quot;. Alice and Bob have agreed an integer, &quot;k&quot;, which sets the computational burden on Alice and the likelihood that she should succeed by chance.
# Bob picks random values, &quot;s ∈ {0, 1, ..., k}&quot; and &quot;a&quot;, and sends: where exponentiating by &quot;a&quot; is used to blind the sent values. Note that 
# Alice, using her private key, computes &quot;v&quot; and then the quotient, Thus, &quot;vv&quot; = 1, unless &quot;z&quot; ≠ &quot;m&quot;.
# Alice then tests &quot;vv&quot; for equality against the values: which are calculated by repeated multiplication of &quot;mz&quot; (rather than exponentiating for each &quot;i&quot;). If the test succeeds, Alice conjectures the relevant &quot;i&quot; to be &quot;s&quot;; otherwise, she conjectures random value. Where &quot;z&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, &quot;(mz)&quot; = &quot;vxv&quot; = 1 for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;s&quot; is unrecoverable.
# Alice commits to &quot;i&quot;: she picks a random &quot;r&quot; and sends &quot;hash(r, i)&quot; to Bob.
# Bob reveals &quot;a&quot;.
# Alice confirms that &quot;a&quot; is the correct blind (i.e., &quot;v&quot; and &quot;v&quot; can be generated using it), then, if so, reveals &quot;r&quot;. Revealing these blinds makes the exchange zero knowledge.
# Bob checks &quot;hash(r, i)&quot; = &quot;hash(r, s)&quot;, proving Alice knows &quot;s&quot;, hence &quot;z&quot; ≠ &quot;m&quot;.

If Alice attempts to cheat at step 3 by guessing &quot;s&quot; at random, the probability of succeeding is &quot;1/(k + 1)&quot;. So, if &quot;k = 1023&quot; and the protocol is conducted ten times, her chances are 1 to 2100.

<doc id="451286" wikidata="Q228184" url="?curid=451286" title="Random oracle">
<text>In cryptography, a random oracle is an oracle (a theoretical black box) that responds to every &quot;unique query&quot; with a (truly) random response chosen uniformly from its output domain. If a query is repeated, it responds the same way every time that query is submitted.

Stated differently, a random oracle is a mathematical function chosen uniformly at random, that is, a function mapping each possible query to a (fixed) random response from its output domain.

Random oracles first appeared in the context of complexity theory, in which they were used to argue that complexity class separations may face relativization barriers, with the most prominent case being the P vs NP problem, two classes shown in 1981 to be distinct relative to a random oracle almost surely. They made their way into cryptography by the publication of Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway in 1993, which introduced them as a formal cryptographic model to be used in reduction proofs.

They are typically used when the proof cannot be carried out using weaker assumptions on the cryptographic hash function. A system that is proven secure when every hash function is replaced by a random oracle is described as being secure in the random oracle model, as opposed to secure in the standard model of cryptography.

== Applications ==
Random oracles are typically used as an idealised replacement for cryptographic hash functions in schemes where strong randomness assumptions are needed of the hash function&#x27;s output. Such a proof often shows that a system or a protocol is secure by showing that an attacker must require impossible behavior from the oracle, or solve some mathematical problem believed hard in order to break it. However, it only proves such properties in the random oracle model, making sure no major design flaws are present. It is in general not true that such a proof implies the same properties in the standard model. Still, a proof in the random oracle model is considered better than no formal security proof at all.

Not all uses of cryptographic hash functions require random oracles: schemes that require only one or more properties having a definition in the standard model (such as collision resistance, preimage resistance, second preimage resistance, etc.) can often be proven secure in the standard model (e.g., the Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem).

Random oracles have long been considered in computational complexity theory, and many schemes have been proven secure in the random oracle model, for example Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding, RSA-FDH and PSS. In 1986, Amos Fiat and Adi Shamir showed a major application of random oracles – the removal of interaction from protocols for the creation of signatures.

In 1989, Russell Impagliazzo and Steven Rudich showed the limitation of random oracles – namely that their existence alone is not sufficient for secret-key exchange.

In 1993, Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway were the first to advocate their use in cryptographic constructions. In their definition, the random oracle produces a bit-string of infinite length which can be truncated to the length desired.

When a random oracle is used within a security proof, it is made available to all players, including the adversary or adversaries.

== Domain separation ==

A single oracle may be treated as multiple oracles by pre-pending a fixed bit-string to the beginning of each query (e.g., queries formatted as &quot;1||x&quot; or &quot;0||x&quot; can be considered as calls to two separate random oracles, similarly &quot;00||x&quot;, &quot;01||x&quot;, &quot;10||x&quot; and &quot;11|x&quot; can be used to represent calls to four separate random oracles). This practice is usually called domain separation. &quot;Oracle cloning&quot; is the re-use of the once-constructed random oracle within the same proof (this in practice corresponds to the multiple uses of the same cryptographic hash within one algorithm for different purposes). Oracle cloning with improper domain separation breaks security proofs and can lead to successful attacks.

== Limitations ==
According to the Church–Turing thesis, no function computable by a finite algorithm can implement a true random oracle (which by definition requires an infinite description because it has infinitely many possible inputs, and its outputs are all independent from each other and need to be individually specified by any description).

In fact, certain contrived signature and encryption schemes are known which are proven secure in the random oracle model, but which are trivially insecure when any real function is substituted for the random oracle. Nonetheless, for any more natural protocol a proof of security in the random oracle model gives very strong evidence of the &quot;practical&quot; security of the protocol.

In general, if a protocol is proven secure, attacks to that protocol must either be outside what was proven, or break one of the assumptions in the proof; for instance if the proof relies on the hardness of integer factorization, to break this assumption one must discover a fast integer factorization algorithm. Instead, to break the random oracle assumption, one must discover some unknown and undesirable property of the actual hash function; for good hash functions where such properties are believed unlikely, the considered protocol can be considered secure.

== Random oracle hypothesis ==

Although the Baker–Gill–Solovay theorem showed that there exists an oracle A such that PA = NPA, subsequent work by Bennett and Gill, showed that for a &quot;random oracle&quot; B (a function from {0,1}n to {0,1} such that each input element maps to each of 0 or 1 with probability 1/2, independently of the mapping of all other inputs), PB ⊊ NPB with probability 1. Similar separations, as well as the fact that random oracles separate classes with probability 0 or 1 (as a consequence of the Kolmogorov&#x27;s zero–one law), led to the creation of the Random Oracle Hypothesis, that two &quot;acceptable&quot; complexity classes C1 and C2 are equal if and only if they are equal (with probability 1) under a random oracle (the acceptability of a complexity class is defined in BG81). This hypothesis was later shown to be false, as the two acceptable complexity classes IP and PSPACE were shown to be equal despite IPA ⊊ PSPACEA for a random oracle A with probability 1.

== Ideal cipher == 

An ideal cipher is a random permutation oracle that is used to model an idealized block cipher. A random permutation decrypts each ciphertext block into one and only one plaintext block and vice versa, so there is a one-to-one correspondence. Some cryptographic proofs make not only the &quot;forward&quot; permutation available to all players, but also the &quot;reverse&quot; permutation.

Recent works showed that an ideal cipher can be constructed from a random oracle using 10-round or even 8-round Feistel networks.

== Ideal permutation ==
An ideal permutation is an idealized object sometimes used in cryptography to model the behaviour of a permutation whose outputs are indistinguishable from those of a random permutation. In the ideal permutation model, an additional oracle access is given to the ideal permutation and its inverse. The ideal permutation model can be seen as a special case of the ideal cipher model where access is given to only a single permutation, instead of a family of permutations as in the case of the ideal cipher model.

== Quantum-accessible random oracles ==
Post-quantum cryptography studies quantum attacks on classical cryptographic schemes. As a random oracle is an abstraction of a hash function, it makes sense to assume that a quantum attacker can access the random oracle in quantum superposition. Many of the classical security proofs break down in that quantum random oracle model and need to be revised.
