<text>Lincoln City Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England. The team competes in , the third level of the English football league system.

Nicknamed the &quot;Imps&quot; after the legend of the Lincoln Imp, they have played at 10,669-capacity Sincil Bank since their move from John O&#x27;Gaunts in 1895. Traditionally they play in red and white striped shirts with black shorts and red and white socks. They hold rivalries with other Lincolnshire clubs, particularly Scunthorpe United and Grimsby Town. Founded in 1884, Lincoln won the Midland League in 1889–90, their first full season playing league football. They moved on from the Football Alliance to become founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892, remaining there until they failed re-election in 1908. They won immediate re-election after winning the next year&#x27;s Midland League, and would repeat this feat after failing re-election again in 1911 and 1920. Founder members of the Football League Third Division North in 1921, they won promotion as champions in 1931–32, but were relegated two seasons later. Crowned Third Division North champions again in 1947–48, they were relegated the next year, but would remain in the second tier for nine seasons after again winning the Third Division North title in 1951–52. Two successive relegations left them in the Fourth Division by 1962, where they would remain until Graham Taylor&#x27;s title winning campaign of 1975–76.

Relegated in 1978–79, they secured promotion again two years later but suffered a double relegation to find themselves in the Conference by 1987. Lincoln made an immediate recovery however, regaining their Football League status with the Conference title in 1987–88. They were promoted again in 1997–98, but were relegated the next season. They reached the play-offs in five consecutive seasons, from 2002 to 2007, losing in the final twice (2002–03 and 2004–05) and the semi-finals three times, which is a competition record. However they exited the division at the other end when they were returned to the Conference after relegation at the end of the 2010–11 campaign. A six-season stay in non-League was ended when Cowley brothers Nicky and Danny led the club to the National League title in 2016–17, as well as a run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup – this made them the first non-League side to reach that stage in 103 years. They won the EFL Trophy in 2018 and the League Two title in 2018–19.

==History==

Football in the city of Lincoln had been prominent since the 1860s although not strictly connected to the modern day club. After the disbanding of Lincoln Rovers (formerly Lincoln Recreation) in 1884, Lincoln City FC was formed as an amateur football association, and the first game Lincoln played was an emphatic 9–1 victory over local rivals Sleaford, on 4 October 1884. Originally they played at the John O&#x27;Gaunts ground, provided by wealthy local brewer Robert Dawber.

Lincoln turned professional in the 1891–92 season, and soon helped to form what was then the Second Division in 1892–93 season, as an increasing number of clubs wished to join the Football League. Their first game in the Football League was a 4–2 away defeat to Sheffield United on 3 September 1892. Their first home game was also against Sheffield United, this time, however, Lincoln won 1–0. Due to Dawber&#x27;s death in 1895, Lincoln moved from the John O&#x27;Gaunts Ground to Sincil Bank. On 2 September 1899, Lincoln became only the third club to be represented by a Black player in an English Football League game when John Walker made his debut for them in a home game against Middlesbrough.

They failed re-election to the Football League in 1908. They won immediate re-election after winning the next year&#x27;s Midland League, and would repeat this feat after failing re-election again in 1911 and 1920. Founder members of the Football League Third Division North in 1921, they won promotion as champions in 1931–32, but were relegated two seasons later. Crowned Third Division North champions again in 1947–48, they were relegated the next year, but would remain in the second tier for nine seasons after again winning the Third Division North title in 1951–52. Two successive relegations left them in the Fourth Division by 1962, where they would remain until Graham Taylor&#x27;s title winning campaign of 1975–76. The next would oscillate between the Third and Fourth division for the next 10 years, missing out on promotion to the Second Division in 1982 and 1983.

Lincoln were relegated to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1985–86 season, and the year after that they became the first team to suffer automatic relegation from the Football League. They regained their Football League place automatically via promotion as champions of the Conference at the first attempt. In the 1997–98 season, Lincoln were promoted from the Third Division (previously the Fourth Division), but were immediately relegated back on the next season. On 3 May 2002 Lincoln entered into administration. Lincoln City were relegated again from League Two on the last day of the end of the 2010–11 season after a home defeat to Aldershot Town.

In the 2016–17 season, Lincoln City under Danny Cowley were promoted as champions back to the Football League. In the 2016–17 FA Cup, Lincoln beat Championship side Ipswich Town, and Championship leaders Brighton and Hove Albion before defeating top flight side Burnley 1–0 to reach the quarter-final, the first time a non-League club had progressed to the last eight since 1913–14. In the quarter-finals, they were defeated 5–0 at eventual Cup champions Arsenal.

In the 2017–18 season, Lincoln won the EFL Trophy by beating Shrewsbury Town 1–0 in the final in their first visit to Wembley Stadium. After an unsuccessful play-off campaign in their first season back in the EFL, Lincoln were promoted as champions at the end of the 2018–19 season.

On 5 April 2019, Lincoln announced that Nettleham Ladies FC would be rebranded as Lincoln City Women from 1 June.

On 9 September 2019, manager Danny Cowley announced his departure to join Championship side Huddersfield Town, having guided Lincoln to two promotions in his previous three seasons alongside brother and assistant manager Nicky. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Football League matches were suspended on 13 March 2020 with Lincoln in 15th place. Clubs voted to end the season in June 2020 with final league positions decided on a points per game basis with Lincoln subsequently being placed in 16th.

In the 2020–21 season, Lincoln finished the season in 5th place, qualifying for the play-offs. After defeating Sunderland in the semi-finals, the first match fans could attend since the start of the pandemic, Lincoln lost the play-off final to Blackpool.

==Stadium==
The club have played at Sincil Bank since 1895. Previously, Lincoln City had played at the nearby John O&#x27;Gaunts ground since the club&#x27;s 1884 inception. Sincil Bank has an overall capacity of 10,669 and is colloquially known to fans as &quot;The Bank&quot;. Former Lincoln City chairman John Reames re-purchased the ground from the local council in 2000 at a cost of £175,000; the club had sold it in 1982 for £225,000 to fend off the threat of eviction, arranging a 125-year lease.

Sincil Bank hosted England U16&#x27;s 2–0 win over the Scotland U16 team in the Victory Shield on 28 November 2008. Martin Peters paraded the FIFA World Cup Trophy at the ground in March 2010 as part of its global tour. FA WSL club Lincoln Ladies played home games at Sincil Bank in their 2011 season. The Ladies&#x27; club had previously hosted Arsenal Ladies there in an FA Women&#x27;s Cup semi-final in March 2008.

==Rivals==


Lincoln City is one of three professional football clubs in Lincolnshire. Lincoln City&#x27;s main rivals are Grimsby Town and Scunthorpe United, which at various points fans have considered one bigger than the other. Other prominent Lincolnshire rivals of the past include Gainsborough Trinity and Boston United, however, meetings between the clubs are limited nowadays.

Nottinghamshire clubs Mansfield Town and Notts County are also considered rivals, and Peterborough United, Hull City and York City are clubs that have had some sort of rivalry with The Imps in the past. Lincoln United, the other football club based in Lincoln, are further down the footballing pyramid and are not a considered rival.

==Badge and colours==

===Badge===

Lincoln City currently sport a &quot;traditional&quot; Lincoln Imp badge, synonymous with the success of the 1970s and 1980s. The badge was returned in 2014, with general manager John Vickers billing it the start of a &quot;new era&quot;. Between the two spells the club used two badges, the first of which being the city&#x27;s heraldic shield with the letters &quot;L.C.F.C&quot; inscribed onto it. This badge was used until 2001, when the club used a similar design; however, it featured a yellow imp in the centre, with the nickname of &quot;The Imps&quot; written across.

===Colours===
Traditionally, the colours and design of the Lincoln City strip are a red and white striped shirt along with black shorts and red socks. This varied in the late 1960s and early 70s, the club opted to field a predominantly red strip with white shorts, and also in the 2000–01 season when the shirt was quartered red and white with white shorts. Currently, the home kit is largely red with white pinstriping down the length of the shirt, as well as black and white accents around the collar and cuff of the shirt. The shorts of the kit are also largely black, sporting red accents, and the socks red with black and white accents. Their away kit has never retained any single pattern or design, and areas varied vastly throughout the seasons, but is currently black across the shirt, shorts and socks with red accents on the edges of each piece. In recent years, the club have also released a third kit. Currently, the kit is green in colour, with a chevron pattern across it. This kit features white accents on the shirt, and white shorts with green accents.

<text>Mansfield Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England. The team competes in , the third level of the English football league system.

The club was formed in 1897 as Mansfield Wesleyans and entered the Mansfield &amp; District Amateur League in 1902, before changing its name to Mansfield Wesley and joining the Notts &amp; District League in 1906. They then finally became Mansfield Town in 1910, and moved from the Notts &amp; Derbyshire League to the Central Alliance the following year. Crowned Alliance champions in 1919–20, they joined the Midland League in 1921 and would win this league on three occasions – 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1928–29 – before they were admitted into the Football League in 1931. They were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960, but won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1962–63, remaining in the third tier for nine seasons until their relegation in 1972. They reached the Second Division for the first time after winning the Fourth Division title in 1974–75 and the Third Division title in 1976–77, only to suffer two relegations in three seasons.

Promoted out of the Fourth Division under the stewardship of Ian Greaves in 1985–86, they went on to win the Associate Members&#x27; Cup in 1986–87. Mansfield were however relegated in 1991 and promoted again in 1991–92, only to suffer an immediate relegation the following season. They won promotion once again in 2001–02, but were relegated to League Two in 2003 and lost their Football League status with a further relegation in 2008. They spent five seasons in the Conference until they were promoted back into the Football League after winning the Conference in 2012–13 following investment from new club owner John Radford. They were promoted from League Two in the 2023–24 season.

Nicknamed &#x27;The Stags&#x27;, they play in a blue and yellow kit. Since 1919, Mansfield have played at Field Mill, which is now an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 9,186. Their main rivals are Chesterfield. The club also competes in local derby games against fellow Nottinghamshire club Notts County. Recently, a rivalry has grown between Mansfield and Lincoln City

==History==
===Early years===

Mansfield Town was formed under the name of Mansfield Wesleyans in 1897, the name of the club coming from the local Wesleyan church. The club played friendlies up until the 1902–03 season, when it joined the Mansfield and District Amateur League. When the league dropped its amateur tag in 1906, the church abandoned the club, which changed its name to Mansfield Wesley and moved into the Notts and District League.

In the summer of 1910, despite having lost the previous season to Mansfield Mechanics in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup, the team changed its name to Mansfield Town (much to the disgust of the Mechanics). In the following years, Mansfield Town swapped between the Notts and District League, Central Alliance League and Notts and Derbyshire League, before World War I brought a halt to proceedings.

After the war, Mansfield became occupants of the Field Mill ground, after Mansfield Mechanics failed to pay their rent. In 1921, the club was admitted into the Midland Counties League, and celebrated by reaching the sixth qualifying round of the FA Cup twice in a row. The club won the league in 1923–24 and was the runner-up the following season, but on both occasions failed to win election to the Football League.

In 1928–29, Mansfield won the Midland League again, but more famously reached the fourth round proper of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 to First Division club Arsenal, after a cup run which saw them beat Second Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, York City beat the Stags in elections for a League place.

===Into the Football League===
In 1931, Mansfield were finally elected to the Southern Section of the Third Division. However, the club struggled to adapt to League surroundings and were frequently in the lower reaches of the table. One of very few highlights in the years before the Second World War was Ted Harston, who scored 55 goals in one season before transferring to Liverpool.

After the war, Mansfield started to see some progress. Lucky to escape the need for re-election when it was decided that no club would be relegated after the 1946–47 season, the Stags started to move up the table. In 1950–51, Mansfield reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and became the first Football League team to complete a 23–game home schedule unbeaten, although missed out on the only Third Division promotion spot.
On 23 August 1958 Mansfield fielded a Black player, the Jamaican-born Lindy Delapenha, for the first time. He joined from Middlesbrough F.C. where he had spent nine successful seasons. He went on to make 115 League appearances for Mansfield, scoring 27 goals. In 1959–60 the club was relegated to the recently created Fourth Division, before gaining promotion back to the Third Division in 1962–63. This promotion was later tainted by life-time suspensions handed out to players Brian Phillips and Sammy Chapman for bribing opponents, including players of Hartlepools United in a vital match which Mansfield won 4–3. Two seasons later, the club again narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division. The season after avoiding relegation due to a points deduction for Peterborough United, Mansfield made another headline-grabbing cup run. Mansfield beat First Division West Ham United 3–0 in the fifth round of the 1968–69 FA Cup, before narrowly losing to Leicester City in the quarter-finals. In 1971–72 Mansfield were relegated, again, to the Fourth Division.

By 1976–77, the club was back in the Third Division, and despite the distraction of a 5–2 FA Cup defeat to Matlock Town, beat Wrexham to the Third Division title. The club went straight back down, and only a good run of form at the end of the 1978–79 season saved Mansfield from a double relegation.

Mansfield won the Football League Trophy in front of 58,000 fans in May 1987, beating Bristol City on penalties after a 1–1 draw. However, the years that followed were inconsistent, with Mansfield becoming a &quot;yo-yo&quot; team between the Third and Fourth Divisions. Also at that time, the controversial Keith Haslam bought the club.

===21st century===
In 2001–02, Mansfield were again promoted to the third tier of English football, beating Carlisle United to take third place from Cheltenham Town, who lost at Plymouth Argyle. A poor season in Division Two did not pick up even with the arrival of Keith Curle as manager, as the club was relegated straight back to the fourth tier of English football. In 2003–04, Mansfield beat Northampton Town in a penalty shoot-out in the Division Three play-off semi-finals, but lost to Huddersfield Town on penalties in the final.

In 2007–08, Mansfield&#x27;s 77-year stay in the Football League came to an end as the club was relegated to the Conference. A fluke goal in a 1–0 loss to rivals Rotherham United in the last home game of the season all but guaranteed relegation. Ugly scenes erupted at the final whistle, with controversial owner Keith Haslam being attacked by fans.

Haslam left the club, with the trio of Perry, Middleton and Saunders purchasing the club (but not the ground) for £1 and installed Billy McEwan as manager. He was replaced after Christmas by David Holdsworth. Holdsworth&#x27;s less than two-year reign bought little improvement to the club and he was dismissed as manager in November 2010. Duncan Russell led Mansfield to an FA Trophy final appearance in 2010–11, Louis Briscoe scoring a late extra-time winner against Luton Town in the semi-final second leg. However, the Stags lost 1–0 to Darlington at Wembley Stadium in the final after a 120th-minute extra-time goal by Chris Senior. A league position of 12th was not good enough for Russell to keep his job. His replacement, Paul Cox, led Mansfield to their highest Conference finish in his first season. A good run of form after Christmas saw the Stags finish in third in the league, although they lost 2–1 on aggregate to York City after extra time in the promotion play-off semi-final.

An indifferent start to the 2012–13 season left Mansfield lingering around mid-table, with some fans calling for the manager&#x27;s head. One good point to the first half of the season was the club&#x27;s FA Cup run. In the third round, the Stags faced Premier League side Liverpool. A controversial Luis Suárez goal helped the Reds to a 2–1 victory, but a brave display from the Mansfield team gave the team momentum in the weeks to follow. Following the cup game the Stags won 20 of their last 24 games, including a club record run of 12 consecutive wins, to clinch the Conference Premier title, and promotion back to the Football League. The title was sealed with a 1–0 victory over Wrexham on 20 April 2013.

Mansfield finished their first season back in the Football League in 11th place. In 2018–19, the Stags narrowly missed out on promotion on the final day of the season after a defeat to promotion rivals MK Dons. They lost in the play-off semi-finals to Newport County on penalties. In 2021–22, Mansfield reached the play-offs again but lost 3–0 to Port Vale in the final. In the 2023–24 season, Mansfield were promoted to League One, finishing in 3rd place.

==Ownership==
The 2006–07 season saw the creation of the &quot;SFFC (Stags Fans for Change)&quot; an organisation aiming for the removal of then owner Keith Haslam from the club. The organisation undertook many projects over the year to get their message over in a different and non-aggressive way. This included hiring a plane to fly over the local derby match with Notts County towing a banner declaring that the club was for sale and calling for Haslam to leave. On 29 November 2007 Haslam rejected a bid from James Derry&#x27;s consortium and the Mansfield fans pledged to have a TV protest against him on 2 December 2007 against Harrogate Railway Athletic live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot; programme.

In March 2008, it was reported that John Batchelor, a bidder for Mansfield Town, planned to rename the club to Harchester United after the fictional squad from the TV series &quot;Dream Team&quot; to make the club &quot;more promotable&quot; if his bid were a success. Fans and executives within the club both stated that they would oppose the name change.

Following the club&#x27;s relegation in 2008, Colin Hancock, then the chairman of Glapwell, emerged as the leading bidder as he agreed to purchase a controlling share of the Stags, Field Mill, and some land surrounding the stadium from Haslam. However, three businessmen who are also Mansfield Town fans, Andrew Perry, Andrew Saunders and Steve Middleton, bought the club from Keith Haslam for an undisclosed fee, but they were still renting the stadium from him. At the start of the 2010–11 season Mansfield were bought by John Radford.

On 2 December 2010 the club was locked out of Field Mill in a dispute over unpaid rent. Since returning to Field Mill after securing a lease on the ground for a further year and a half, John Radford began to seek a way by which the club would once again own Field Mill. It was reported that Keith Haslam rejected an offer from Radford for Field Mill; the offer was alleged to have been worth in between £2 million and £4 million.

On 1 March 2012, Chairman John Radford purchased the ground from Keith Haslam. Since then, 1 March is considered &quot;Amber Day&quot; at the club to commemorate the retrieval of Mansfield&#x27;s stadium. In April 2012, Radford changed the stadium&#x27;s name from &quot;Field Mill&quot; to the &quot;One Call Stadium&quot; for sponsorship reasons.

==Club culture==
===Rivalries===
The 2003 Football Fans Census indicates that Mansfield&#x27;s biggest rivalries are with Chesterfield and Notts County, with Doncaster Rovers tertiary rivals. Bad blood between Chesterfield and Mansfield has links to the miners&#x27; strike. Fixtures between Town and County are referred to as Nottinghamshire derbies. More recently, a lesser rivalry has grown with Grimsby Town as well as Lincoln City.

===Club colours===
During the Wesleyans era, Mansfield played in chocolate and sky blue shirts, firstly striped until 1902, and then halved. Upon assuming the Mansfield Town moniker, the club switched to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, though this identity only lasted the 1910–11 season. A five-year stint in black and white quartered shirts with black shorts and socks followed before the club closed down.

Upon their return in 1919, Town introduced their now-familiar blue and amber club colour scheme, initially in halves. Becoming a league side in 1931 coincided with a change to pale blue shirts with white shorts, which the club would wear until October 1934, when the blue and amber returned (albeit in quarters for the remainder of the 1934–35 season). They would continue to wear this colour combination in various arrangements (including a blue shirt with amber sleeves from January 1948) for two decades. From 1954 to 1961 Town played in white shirts and black shorts, before amber shirts with blue shorts returned for seven years. All-blue with amber trim was selected in 1968, before a new look of white shirts with blue shorts was introduced in 1970.

1974 saw the classic colour scheme return, and though the composition might vary, amber and blue has reigned ever since. The only exception to this was the centenary kit worn in the 1997–98 season, which was a retro kit design styled after Mansfield Wesleyans&#x27; first, albeit with sky blue shorts and socks.

<doc id="451165" wikidata="Q48946" url="?curid=451165" title="Oxford United F.C.">
<text>Oxford United Football Club () is a professional football club based in Oxford, England. The club compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football, after achieving promotion in the 2024 EFL League One play-off final. Founded as Headington Football Club in 1893, the club adopted its current name in 1960. Nicknamed The U&#x27;s, it has played its home games at the Kassam Stadium, replacing its former home of Manor Ground in 2001.

The club joined the Football League in 1962 after winning the Southern Football League, reaching the Second Division in 1968. After relegation in 1976, between 1984 and 1986 the club earned successive promotions into the First Division, and won the League Cup in 1986. However, Oxford were unable thereby to enter the 1987 UEFA Cup because of the UEFA ban on English clubs in European competitions. Relegation from the top flight in 1988 began an 18-year decline which saw the club relegated to the Conference in 2006, becoming the first winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the Football League. After four seasons, Oxford returned to League Two in 2010 via the play-offs, and six seasons later achieved promotion to League One, after finishing second in League Two in 2016. In 2024 they were promoted to the EFL Championship via the play-offs.

Some of the club&#x27;s notable players, such as Ron Atkinson who holds the record for the most overall appearances (560); John Shuker who holds the record for the most appearances in the Football League (478); and Ron&#x27;s late brother Graham Atkinson holds the record for the most goals scored (107). In total, nineteen players have made international appearances while playing for the club.

The team&#x27;s traditional kit colours are yellow shirts, along with navy coloured shorts and socks. Their crest showcases an ox, symbolizing both the name and historical background of the city, which was initially established as a market town for cattle located adjacent to a ford on the River Isis. Oxford have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Swindon Town, with whom they contest the A420 derby.

==History==

=== 1893–1960: Headington F.C. to Headington United ===

Oxford United was founded on 27 October 1893 as Headington Football Club at the Britannia Inn, Headington in a meeting called by a local doctor, Robert Hitchings, as a way for the cricketers of Headington Cricket Club to maintain their fitness during the winter break. The fellow founder was the Revd John Scott-Tucker, vicar at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, who was appointed first president of the club. The suffix United was added in 1911 after merging with Headington Quarry. The club&#x27;s first football match played was against Cowley Barracks. Headington had no regular home until 1913, when they were able to purchase Wootten&#x27;s Field on London Road, but this was redeveloped in 1920, forcing the club to move. A permanent home was found in 1925, when they purchased the Manor Ground site on London Road. The facility was used as a cricket pitch in the summer, and a football pitch in the winter. In 1899, six years after their formation, Headington United joined the Oxfordshire District League Second Division, where they competed until the outbreak of the First World War; the Second Division was renamed the Oxfordshire Junior League after the resumption of football in 1919. In 1921, the club was admitted into the Oxon Senior League. The first season included a 9–0 victory, with eight of those goals coming from P. Drewitt. This remains a record for the highest number of goals scored by an Oxford player in a first-team match. At this time a small rivalry existed with Cowley F.C., who were based a few miles south of Headington. During a league game on May Day, the referee gave two penalties to Cowley; supporters broke past security and players, resulting in the referee being &quot;freely baited&quot;. The first FA Cup tie played was in 1931, against Hounslow F.C. in the Preliminary Round, ending in an 8–2 defeat for Headington. United spent two seasons in the Spartan League in 1947 and 1948, finishing fifth and fourth respectively. It was around this time that the cricket team left the Manor and moved to new premises near Cowley Barracks.

=== 1948–1960: Professional football ===
A move into professional football was first considered during the 1948–49 season. Vic Couling, the president at the time, had applied for Headington to become a member of a new Second Division in the Southern League. Other teams that applied included Weymouth, Kettering Town and future league side Cambridge United. Although the plans were postponed, the First Division was going to be expanded by two clubs; Weymouth and Headington were elected. It was later discovered that Llanelli had just one vote fewer than Headington. Oxford&#x27;s first season in the Southern League was in 1949, the same year they turned professional. Former First Division forward Harry Thompson was hired as manager. In 1950, Headington United became the first professional club in Britain to install floodlights, and used them on 18 December against Banbury Spencer. They initially played in orange and blue shirts, but changed to yellow home shirts for the 1957–58 season. The reason for the change is unknown.

=== 1960–1985: Oxford United and Football League rise ===
In 1960, Headington United was renamed Oxford United, to give the club a higher profile. Two years later, in 1962, the club won the Southern League title for the second successive season and was elected to the Football League Fourth Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;61/62&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; occupying the vacant place left by bankrupt Accrington Stanley. Two successive eighteenth-place finishes followed, before promotion to the Third Division was achieved in 1965. A year before the promotion, Oxford became the first Fourth Division club to reach the sixth round of the FA Cup, but have not progressed that far in the competition since. Oxford won the Third Division title in 1967–68, their sixth season as a league club, but after eight years of relative stability the club was relegated from the Second Division in 1975–76.&lt;ref name=&quot;75/76&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, as a Third Division side, Oxford United faced closure because of the club&#x27;s inability to service the debts owed to Barclays Bank, but were rescued when businessman Robert Maxwell took over the club. In April 1983, Maxwell proposed merging United with neighbours Reading, to form a new club called the Thames Valley Royals, to play at Didcot. Jim Smith would have managed the club and been assisted by Reading boss Maurice Evans. The merger was called off as a result of fans of both clubs protesting against the decision. Furthermore, the Reading chairman stepped down and was replaced by an opponent of the merger. Maxwell also threatened to fold the club if the merger did not go through. Oxford won the Third Division title after the 1983–84 season under the management of Jim Smith, who also guided them to the Second Division title the following year. This meant that Oxford United would be playing First Division football in the 1985–86 season, 23 years after joining the Football League. Smith moved to Queens Park Rangers shortly after the promotion success, and made way for chief scout Maurice Evans, who, several seasons earlier, had won the Fourth Division title with Reading.

=== 1985–1994: First Division and cup success ===

Oxford United finished eighteenth in the 1985–86 First Division, avoiding relegation on the last day of the season after defeating Arsenal 3–0. They also won the Football League Cup, known at the time as the Milk Cup under a sponsorship deal. As winners, Oxford would have qualified for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, had it not been for the ban on English teams that had resulted from the previous year&#x27;s Heysel Stadium disaster. After beating fellow First Division side Aston Villa in the semi-final 4–3 on aggregate, Oxford faced Queens Park Rangers in the final, which was held at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1986. The game finished 3–0 with goals from Trevor Hebberd, Ray Houghton and Jeremy Charles. After the match long-serving physiotherapist, 72-year-old Ken Fish, collected one of the winner&#x27;s medals, instead of manager Maurice Evans. Evans felt that Fish deserved the medal for his service to the club, and so gave him his, in what was seen as an &quot;unprecedented gesture&quot;. It was the last time the League Cup was played under the name &quot;Milk Cup&quot;, sponsors Littlewoods taking over the following season. John Aldridge scored 23 goals across the season, while their survival was helped by the arrival of veteran Steve Perryman from Tottenham.

The 1986–87 season saw Oxford United narrowly avoid relegation and stay in the First Division. Perryman left to become player-manager of Brentford, while Aldridge scored 15 times in 25 league games but was sold to Liverpool mid-season for £750,000 while Dean Saunders joined from Brighton for £60,000 and Martin Foyle was signed from Aldershot for £140,000. Robert Maxwell resigned as chairman in May 1987, to take over at Derby County, handing the club to his son Kevin. The cup-winning team continued to break up however, as captain Malcolm Shotton was sold to Portsmouth, Kevin Brock joined former manager Jim Smith at QPR and Welsh international Charles was forced to retire due to injury. Oxford started the season respectably and spent much of the early stages around the fringes of the top 10, though Houghton would follow Aldridge to Liverpool for £825,000. However, after November the team would fail to win another game, and Maurice Evans was sacked in March 1988 with Oxford bottom of the First Division. Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson was named as Oxford&#x27;s new manager, but was unable to prevent relegation to the Second Division. He was sacked three months into the 1988–89 Second Division campaign after a dispute with the chairman over the £1 million sale of striker Dean Saunders to Derby County; Derby were owned by Robert Maxwell, father of the then Oxford United chairman, Kevin Maxwell. Following Robert Maxwell&#x27;s death in 1991, his personal estate, including the club, became insolvent. After a long search for a new owner, during which BioMass Recycling Ltd took over the club, Brian Horton was named as Oxford&#x27;s new manager. He remained in charge until September 1993, when he moved to Manchester City in the recently formed FA Premier League. Horton led United to mid-table finishes during his management spell, apart from a 21st-place finish at the end of the 1991–92 season. A 2–1 win over Tranmere Rovers, and a win for Blackburn Rovers over Plymouth Argyle, meant United survived relegation by two points. Oxford, now in the renamed Football League Division One, briefly restored Maurice Evans as manager, before turning to Bristol City manager Denis Smith. Despite Smith&#x27;s efforts, Oxford were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1993–94 season, with just four wins in the last eleven games.

=== 1994–2001: Financial problems and dropping through the divisions ===
Denis Smith brought in two strikers who were experienced in the top division: Southampton&#x27;s Paul Moody and Nottingham Forest&#x27;s Nigel Jemson. Oxford finished seventh in 1994–95 season, and in the following season gained promotion by finishing runners-up to rivals Swindon Town, despite not winning an away game till the end of January. Robin Herd, co-owner of the March Racing Team, took control of the club in 1995. In June of that year, the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16,000-seat stadium at Minchery Farm, to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998–99 season, but construction was suspended during the preceding season, because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not been paid for the work already undertaken.

The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and included the sale of Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith&#x27;s departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United&#x27;s financial situation with the new stadium, and the threat of administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United&#x27;s Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club&#x27;s plight through a series of meetings and events, including a &#x27;Scarf of Unity&#x27;, which was a collection of scarves from various clubs which was long enough to stretch around the perimeter of the pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd&#x27;s 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club&#x27;s estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.

Oxford&#x27;s poor form continued into the 1999–2000 season and, with the team in the relegation zone, Shotton resigned in late October. After a few months with Mickey Lewis as player-manager, former manager Denis Smith returned to the club, managing a twentieth-place finish, one place clear of relegation. Smith&#x27;s second spell didn&#x27;t last long, and he was replaced by David Kemp a few weeks into the following campaign. At the end of the 2000–01 season, Oxford were relegated back to the Third Division for the first time in 35 years, with 100 goals conceded. They suffered 33 league defeats, the second-highest number of league defeats ever endured by a league club in a single season.

=== 2001–2006: New stadium and Division Three years ===
Oxford began the next season with a new manager and a new stadium, with the relocation to the Kassam Stadium completed after six years of speculation. Former Liverpool and England defender Mark Wright was given the manager&#x27;s job, but resigned in late November, after being accused of making racist remarks to referee Joe Ross. Wright&#x27;s successor, Ian Atkins, was unable to make an immediate impact and Oxford finished in 21st position in the league, at the time their lowest-ever league position. United missed out on the play-off places in the following season by one place and one point. Fifteen wins at the start of the 2003–04 season saw Oxford top of the table at the end of January. However, Ian Atkins was sacked in March 2004 after allegedly agreeing to take charge at rivals Bristol Rovers.

Atkins&#x27;s replacement, Graham Rix, could only manage a ninth-place finish at the end of the season, and was sacked the following November. Oxford replaced him with Argentine Ramón Díaz, who managed the team to a mid-table finish. Diaz and his team of assistants left the club at the beginning of May 2005, after being banned from the ground by the chairman following failed negotiations. During his time at the club, Diaz brought in a number of South American players including his own sons, and Juan Pablo Raponi. Ex-England midfielder and former West Bromwich Albion manager Brian Talbot signed a two-year contract to replace Rix. Talbot found little success and was sacked in March 2006, with the club in 22nd place. He was replaced by youth team coach Darren Patterson.

On 21 March 2006, Firoz Kassam sold the club, including its debts, for approximately £2 million to Florida-based businessman Nick Merry, who had played for United&#x27;s youth team in the mid-1970s. Merry immediately made changes to the club, including the hiring of former manager Jim Smith in his second spell. Despite signing five new players on his first day in charge, Smith was unable to prevent relegation at the end of the 2005–06 season. After 44 years in English league football, Oxford were relegated to the Conference National after finishing in 23rd place, becoming the first former winners of a major trophy to be relegated from the league. Coincidentally, Accrington Stanley, the club whose bankruptcy in 1962 allowed United to be elected into the League, was one of the two clubs promoted to replace them.

=== 2006–2010: Non-League football and Conference play-off winner ===

Jim Smith was retained as manager for the following season, and it started positively for Oxford, with 14 wins and 8 draws from the opening 25 games. A run of eleven league games without a win followed, and saw United drop to second, where they remained until the end of the season. On Boxing Day 2006, a crowd of 11,065 watched United draw 0–0 with Woking at the Kassam Stadium, the largest-ever attendance for a Conference match (excluding play-offs). Oxford qualified for the play-offs by finishing second, but lost on penalties in the semi-final to Exeter City.

On 9 November 2007, Jim Smith resigned as manager and first-team coach Darren Patterson returned as manager. In a lacklustre season which included defeats to Droylsden and Tonbridge Angels, camouflaged by a belated run of eight wins in the last eleven games, Oxford finished ninth in the Conference National in 2007–08, 10 points off the last play-off place.
On 2 October 2008, Nick Merry stepped down as chairman to be replaced by Kelvin Thomas, who had been part of the management team at the time of Merry&#x27;s takeover. Just under two months later, Patterson was sacked after a poor run of form, and was replaced by former Halifax Town manager Chris Wilder. Following Wilder&#x27;s arrival, the team won 15 of the remaining 21 league matches that season. A 5-point deduction for fielding an unregistered player resulted in a seventh-place finish, four points and two places short of the play-offs.

Oxford led the table for most of the first half of the 2009–10 season, but dropped into the play-off places after a poor run, finishing third. They beat Rushden &amp; Diamonds over two legs to advance to the play-off final against York City on 16 May 2010. Oxford won the final 3–1, to return to the Football League for the 2010–11 season. The attendance was 42,669, a new record for the final, with around 33,000 being United fans.

=== 2010–2022: Return to the Football League ===
Oxford&#x27;s first game back in the Football League was away to Burton, which finished in a 0–0 draw; their first League win was on 4 September against Morecambe at the Kassam Stadium, with James Constable scoring a hat-trick in a 4–0 victory. They finished the season in 12th place.

The team spent much of the 2011–12 season in or around the playoff places, and achieved the double over rivals (and eventual champions) Swindon Town for the first time since the 1973–74 season. However, they failed to win any of their last seven matches and finished the season in ninth place, two places and four points outside the play-offs.

Chairman Kelvin Thomas stepped down during the 2012 close season, to be replaced by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder&#x27;s contract, having pressed for his sacking during the second half of the 2012–13 season.

After another bright start, Oxford led the table several times in the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the play-off places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford slipped out of the play-off places in the final few weeks of the season, finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.

In July 2014, Waddock&#x27;s contract was terminated after a change of ownership and he was replaced by Michael Appleton. Waddock&#x27;s surprise sacking ensured he had the worst record of any Oxford manager, winning only once and losing seven times in his eight games in charge of the club. After an indifferent first season under Appleton, Oxford achieved promotion to League One in his second year in charge, finishing the 2015–16 season in second place with 86 points. They also reached the final of the League Trophy at Wembley Stadium, only the club&#x27;s third appearance at the national stadium, but were defeated 3–2 by their League One opponents Barnsley. In 2016–17, having sold Kemar Roofe during the close season for a record £3m and signed Marvin Johnson for an undisclosed fee also thought to be a club record, Oxford finished eighth in League One, four points short of the playoff places, and again lost in the final of the League Trophy at Wembley, this time to relegation-bound Coventry City.

In June 2017, Appleton left the club to become assistant manager at Leicester City of the Premier League, and was replaced by Pep Clotet, formerly assistant manager at Leeds United. On 22 January 2018, Clotet was sacked, with the club in tenth place in League One after a home defeat to bottom club Bury.

In February 2018, the club was bought by Thai businessman Sumrith &quot;Tiger&quot; Thanakarnjanasuth, who replaced Darryl Eales as chairman; Thanakarnjanasuth had previously been part of the consortium that owned Reading F.C.

After a lengthy period under caretaker-manager Derek Fazackerley during which the team slipped to within 4 points of the relegation zone, Karl Robinson, former manager of Milton Keynes Dons and Charlton Athletic, was appointed on 22 March 2018. Robinson had to wait five games for his first win, but his aim of retaining the club&#x27;s League One status was achieved with three wins from the last five games of the season. The club finished in 16th place on 56 points, six points above the relegation zone.

A 12th-place finished was achieved the following year, despite the club spending over half of the season in the relegation zone. An improved fourth-place finished followed in the shortened 2019–20 season, which was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. When the season was suspended, Oxford were third in the table, but following an agreement from clubs to end the season early, the U&#x27;s dropped one place to fourth after the final table was decided under an unweighted points per game system. The play-offs continued as normal, where United faced Portsmouth in the semi-final. Following a 1–1 draw in the first leg, United won 5–4 on penalties when the second game ended 1–1 after extra time. In the final behind closed doors at Wembley, Oxford lost 2–1 to Wycombe Wanderers, Joe Jacobson&#x27;s penalty proving decisive in the tie.

=== 2022–present: Indonesian ownership and Championship return ===
Oxford made the play-offs again the following season, losing 6–3 on aggregate to Blackpool, who went on to win the final. In the 2021–22 season, United were the league&#x27;s joint top scorers and finished in 8th place. During the season, the club&#x27;s ownership changed hands again, with Indonesian businessmen and minority shareholders Erick Thohir and Anindya Bakrie taking control after a series of transactions. Thanakarnjanasuth&#x27;s investment with the club remained, but he was replaced as chairman by Grant Ferguson.

Oxford were promoted to the Championship in the 2023–24 season, after beating Bolton Wanderers 2–0 in the play-off final, marking their return to the division after a 25-year absence.

==Colours and badge==
Oxford United crest depicts an ox to symbolise the location. It reflects the name and history of the city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and during the early years of Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). In 1972, the crest became circular.

In 1979, zoologist Desmond Morris, who at the time was a club director, designed the current ox-head logo which was based on a Minoan-style bull&#x27;s head. The first iteration of this design showed just the ox&#x27;s head on a yellow and black background. The words &#x27;Oxford United Football Club&#x27; were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox&#x27;s head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording &quot;25th Anniversary&quot; was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox&#x27;s head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed a new version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford were contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue. This was used until 2016 when the club reverted to the ox head with no shield and no wording. In 2018 the crest was redesigned again to mark the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary. This saw the return of the shield around the ox head with the name of the club above it. This is the version which remains in use currently.

In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity.

While playing as Headington United, orange and blue striped shirts were worn with navy shorts and socks. The design of the shirt changed regularly, with the stripes being changed every few seasons. After joining the Southern League, the blue stripes were lost for good and a lighter shade of orange was used for the shirt. The yellow kit was first worn during the 1957–58 season, with black shorts and yellow socks. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the black shorts were first replaced with yellow ones, and then with royal blue shorts. Since the early 1990s, the strip has been composed of the yellow shirt and navy coloured shorts and socks. A large variety of away kits has been used over the years, ranging from red and black stripes on the shirts, to a fully white kit. The first sponsor to appear on the shirt was &quot;Sunday Journal&quot;, a local newspaper, in 1982. Between 1983 and 1985, there were three sponsors: BPCC, Pergamon and the Sunday People. Following those were Wang Laboratories (1985 to 1989), Pergamon (1989 to 1991), Unipart (1991 to 2000), Domino (2000 to 2001) and Buildbase (from the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001 to 2010).

Following the return to the Football League, Bridle Insurance became new shirt sponsors. The Bridle deal ended after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season. The home sponsor for the 2013–14 season was announced as Animalates, with the away kit being sponsored by Isinglass Consulting for that same season after winning an innovative prize draw. That one-year deal with Isinglass was extended for the 2014–15 season, again featuring on the away kits only. The home kit that season was sponsored by tyre company Black n Rounds. In July 2015, Oxford United announced a three-season deal with investment management company Liontrust Asset Management covering both home and away shirts. For the 2018–19 and 2019–20 season, the principal shirt sponsor was Thai beer firm Singha. The Tourism Authority of Thailand were announced as the new shirt sponsors, as part of a principle partnership agreement, in August 2020, using the brand name &quot;Amazing Thailand&quot;.

===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
== Stadium ==

Oxford United had no regular home until 1913, switching between the Quarry Recreation Ground, Wootten&#x27;s Field (now Stephen Road), Sandy Lane (now Osler Road) and the Britannia Field (now the top end of Lime Walk), all in Headington. In 1913 they were able to purchase Wootten&#x27;s Field on London Road, however, this was redeveloped in 1920 before a stadium could be built. Having purchased the Sandy Lane site, the club developed and played at the Manor Ground between 1925 and 2001. The ground was originally shared with Headington Cricket Club until 1949, when they moved to Cowley Barracks. The capacity at closure was 9,500, but hosted United&#x27;s record crowd of 22,750 against Preston North End in an FA Cup sixth-round match on 29 February 1964. The four stands were named after the roads they were positioned on: The North, East, South and West stands were called Cuckoo Lane, Osler Road, London Road and Beech Road respectively.

In the 1990s, the Taylor Report was published calling for the improvement of football stadiums. The Manor Ground&#x27;s terracing was becoming redundant and redeveloping the ground was too costly, so the club decided to move to a purpose-built all-seater stadium on the outskirts of the city, costing in the region of £15 million. Construction work began in the early part of 1997, but was suspended later that year due to the club&#x27;s financial problems. Construction of the new stadium resumed in 1999 following a takeover deal and the last league match at the Manor on 1 May 2001 saw a 1–1 draw with Port Vale. The site was sold for £12 million and the stadium was later demolished. The land is now occupied by a private hospital.

Since 2001, Oxford United have played at the Kassam Stadium. The all-seater stadium has a capacity of 12,500 and has only three stands instead of the usual four; when first planned in 1995 it was originally going to have a 16,000-seat capacity, but by the time the stadium opened Oxford were playing in a lower division, so the smaller capacity was deemed adequate. Construction of the fourth stand is not expected to take place, with the club focussing its plans on building a new stadium instead, although it did seem like a possibly at one stage, with foundations having already been put in place. The record attendance is 12,243, which was achieved in the final game of the 2005–06 season, when a defeat against Leyton Orient condemned them to relegation from the Football League. The average attendance in the previous season was 7,415, which was the second highest in League Two and the thirty-fourth highest in the whole Football League. The average attendance was highest in the Conference in two out of the four years the team spent in the division, with the average in the other two years placing second, behind Exeter City and Cambridge United respectively. The stadium has also hosted rugby union matches, a woman&#x27;s international football match (England v Sweden), an Under-17 international football tournament and music concerts.

In 2021, the club approached Oxfordshire County Council (OCC) and requested that it transfer hectares (44.48 acres) of land for the development of a new 18,000-capacity football stadium with ancillary leisure and commercial facilities to include, hotel, retail, conference, and training/community grounds on Green Belt land at Stratfield Brake near Kidlington. On 18 January 2022, OCC recommended an engagement exercise be carried out first to gather feedback from the local community. The survey was heavily publicised by Oxvox with respondents completing the survey from areas such as Orkney Islands. Among local residents, 38 per cent were in favour, while 58 per cent were against.

In January 2023, the County Council Cabinet agreed to enter into negotiations on plans to build the stadium at a different site in Kidlington known as the Triangle, between Frieze Way and Oxford Road south of Kidlington roundabout and east of the original Stratfield Brake site. OCC&#x27;s cabinet consented to lease the proposed site to the club and, in February 2024, Oxford United unveiled plans to build a new &#x27;all-electric&#x27;, 16,000-seat stadium on the site, with proposed pedestrian access from Oxford Parkway railway station, to open in 2026. The club&#x27;s architect, AFL, submitted its full planning application for the scheme on 1 March 2024, with the new ground likely to cost up to £150 million. In June 2024, a decision on the application was postponed to early 2025 to allow further work on the proposals to &quot;provide further clarity&quot; for the planning committee. As a result, the club may need to find a temporary home after their lease at the Kassam expires.

==Support==
Oxford have a number of independent supporters&#x27; clubs and groups such as OxVox (the Oxford United Supporters&#x27; Trust) with a current membership of over 400, and the Oxford United Exiles. OxVox was formed in 2002, to replace the disbanded FOUL group, which broke up after the immediate future of the club was secured. It was the fiftieth supporters trust created under the Supporters&#x27; trust banner. The club itself also runs a Juniors club, aimed at younger fans and offering a number of bonuses to the club&#x27;s members such as birthday cards and a free T-shirt. The official matchday programme for home games costs £4 and was voted best Conference Premier Programme of the Year for the 2007–08 season. A number of songs are sung during home games, such as &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; (with adapted lyrics) and songs relating to the old Manor Ground.

The club have a number of celebrity supporters, including Timmy Mallett, Tim Henman and Jim Rosenthal. The club&#x27;s mascot is Ollie the Ox. United were the best-supported club in the Conference National before Luton Town joined the division, and the home match between Oxford and Luton, which drew a crowd of 10,600, was used to highlight the passion for English football during the 2018 World Cup bid. In 2009, a &quot;12th man fund&quot; was set up by a group of supporters in order to provide additional transfer funds to the club. As a result, the number 12 shirt was retired at the start of the 2009–10 season (though it was reintroduced in 2018–19). The fund raised over £40,000 and resulted in the signings of Mehdi Kerrouche (on loan) and Jamie Cook, amongst others.

=== Rivalries ===
Oxford United&#x27;s fiercest rivalry is with Swindon Town; matches between the two are referred to as the A420 derby, a primary road between both cities, which are only 30 miles (48 km) apart. There also exists a rivalry between Oxford and Reading. In addition, Wycombe Wanderers, Luton Town and Northampton Town are also seen as rivals. The rivalry with Swindon stems from the clubs&#x27; close proximity, as well as the fact they have played each other 55 times since 1962. Oxford and Swindon met a few times in non-competitive fixtures before 1962. The earliest match on record was a friendly in the 1950–51 season at Headington. They also played each other in 1954–55 both home and away, and at Headington during 1958–59. All programmes are fairly scarce, with the single sheet issued at Swindon being very rare. The 1962–63 game was a testimonial, with the first league meetings coming in 1965–66.

During the height of football hooliganism, trouble flared up between the sets of fans. In 1998, during a match at the County Ground, 19 Swindon supporters were arrested, while in 2002 there was an incident between supporters after Oxford fans returned from an away fixture. In 2011, vandals burned the initials STFC into the Kassam Stadium&#x27;s pitch. Oxford fans use nicknames when talking about Swindon such as moonraker, in reference to the myth that they tried to rake the reflection of the moon out of a pond. The rivalry with Reading was heightened during the chairmanship of Robert Maxwell, because of his desire to merge the two clubs. This was met with strong opposition from both sets of fans, with United supporters staging a &quot;sit-in&quot; on the pitch before a game against Wigan in protest. Despite being the second team in the city, there is less rivalry with Oxford City because of their lower position in the pyramid system (there have been no competitive league matches between the two since 1959).

==Managers==

The first manager appointed was Harry Thompson in July 1949, soon after the club turned professional. In a nine-year spell he led the team to the Southern League title in 1953, as well as the Southern League Cup in 1953 and 1954. He was replaced by Arthur Turner in 1958, who would become the longest-serving manager in the club&#x27;s history, serving more than a decade in charge. Turner led United to back-to-back Southern League titles, of which the second, in 1962, resulted in their election to the Football League. Promotion followed from the Fourth Division in 1965, and the club was crowned Third Division champions three years later. Turner left the club nine months after this success. Over the next thirteen years, five managers took charge. Ron Saunders was in charge for only a dozen games, moving to Norwich City at the end of the 1968–69 season. Gerry Summers was manager for six years, before being replaced by Mick Brown. During Brown&#x27;s four-year run, United were relegated back to the Third Division after spending eight years in the Second.

Jim Smith started his first spell as manager in 1981, and led Oxford into the top tier of English football after consecutive promotions as champions in 1984 and 1985. However, he moved to Queens Park Rangers before the 1985–86 season. New manager, former chief scout Maurice Evans, had immediate success winning the 1986 League Cup, beating his predecessor&#x27;s new club in the final. For the next 24 years, the only manager to guide the club to promotion was Denis Smith, who won promotion from the Second Division in 1996. Ramón Díaz, the club&#x27;s first non-British manager, took charge for five months between December 2004 and May 2005. Jim Smith returned as manager in 2006, the year that Oxford United were relegated to the Football Conference after 44 years in the Football League. Having missed out on promotion in the 2006–07 season, Smith resigned and Darren Patterson was promoted to the post on 9 November 2007.

Patterson was dismissed in December 2008 and was replaced by Chris Wilder, who led the club back into the Football League by winning the 2010 Conference playoff Final and remained with the club for five years before resigning in January 2014. Gary Waddock was appointed head coach in March 2014, but was sacked in July following a change of shareholding in the club, to be replaced by Michael Appleton. In his three seasons in charge, Appleton oversaw promotion to League One and two losing finals in the EFL Trophy, before leaving to become assistant manager at Leicester City. Spaniard Pep Clotet was appointed as his replacement but was sacked midway through his first season in charge, to be replaced after a two-month spell under caretaker-manager Derek Fazackerley by former Charlton boss Karl Robinson in March 2018. Robinson was sacked in February 2023 following a poor run of results and, after a short period under caretaker management and a brief period under the management of Liam Manning, Des Buckingham was appointed as manager and he led the club to promotion to the Championship after a 25-year absence. Buckingham was sacked on 15 December 2024 later to be replaced by former Millwall manager Gary Rowett.

Since turning professional, the club has had 26 full-time managers, of whom three (Jim Smith, Denis Smith and Darren Patterson) have had more than one spell in the post, and twelve periods of caretaker-management.

==Statistics and records==

The largest recorded home attendance was during a match against Preston North End in the sixth round of the FA Cup, at the Manor Ground, on 29 February 1964. The attendance was 22,750, which exceeded the stadium&#x27;s capacity, so scaffolding was needed in order to create temporary stands for the additional supporters. The largest attendance at the Kassam Stadium for a football match was 12,243 during the final game of the 2005–06 League Two season against Leyton Orient. Oxford&#x27;s largest-ever scoreline was a 9–1 win in the FA Cup first round versus Dorchester Town on 11 November 1995. In the league, their largest win was 7–0 versus Barrow in Division Four. Their largest defeat is 7–0 away to Sunderland in 1998 and to Wigan Athletic in 2017. Their longest unbeaten run in the league was 20 matches in 1984, with their record longest winning run of nine games in the 2020–21 season.

John Shuker holds the record for the most league appearances with 478 between 1962 and 1977. John Aldridge holds the record for most league goals scored in a season in the 1984–85 season, scoring 30. Graham Atkinson holds the record for the most league goals with 77, as well as most overall goals with 107. The most capped player in internationals is Jim Magilton, with 18 caps for Northern Ireland. The largest amount of money Oxford have received by selling a player was an estimated £3,000,000 for Kemar Roofe&#x27;s transfer to Leeds United in July 2016. The largest transfer fee Oxford have paid was £470,000 for Dean Windass&#x27; transfer from Aberdeen in August 1998, though the undisclosed fee paid for Marvin Johnson at the start of the 2016–17 season is thought to have exceeded this figure. Oxford are the only team in history to have been promoted consecutively from Division Three to the First Division as champions.

<text>Rochdale Association Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. The team currently competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English league system. Nicknamed &#x27;The Dale&#x27;, they have played home matches at Spotland Stadium since 1920 and, until 2019, contested derby matches with Bury and contest current derby matches with Oldham Athletic.

Founded in 1907, Rochdale entered the Lancashire Combination and after securing promotion out of Division Two in 1909–10 they won the Division One title in 1910–11 and 1911–12. They then switched to the Central League, before being invited into the Football League when the Third Division North was created in 1921. The club remained in the division for 37 years and became members of the new nationwide Third Division in 1958, but were relegated the following year. They reached the League Cup final in 1962 and secured promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1968–69. Relegated in 1974, Rochdale remained in the fourth tier for 36 seasons after unsuccessful play-off campaigns in 2002, 2008 and 2009. The club finally secured promotion in 2009–10 and following relegation in 2012 were promoted to the third tier for a third time in 2013–14, but were relegated back to League Two in 2020–21. After 102 years as a Football League club, they were relegated to the National League at the end of the 2022–23 season.

==History==
===1907–1999===

Rochdale A.F.C. was formed in 1907. After World War I the Football League was expanded and the club unsuccessfully applied to join. In 1921 Rochdale were included in the new Third Division North, and played their first League game at home against Accrington Stanley on 27 August 1921, winning 6–3. However, this first season ended with the club at the bottom of the League, having to reapply for membership.

In 1958, the League was restructured with the two regional Third Division sections being combined into new national Third and Fourth Divisions. In the restructuring, Rochdale secured a spot in the Third Division but were relegated in last place at the end of their first season at this level.

The club reached the League Cup final in 1962 led by Tony Collins. This was the first time a club from the bottom league division had reached the final of a major competition – where they lost to Norwich City 4–0 on aggregate. Rochdale had beaten Southampton, Doncaster Rovers, Charlton Athletic, York City, and Blackburn Rovers on their route to the final.

The club&#x27;s first promotion came in 1969, earned by a team largely assembled by manager Bob Stokoe, though it was Stokoe&#x27;s assistant, Len Richley who steered Rochdale to promotion after Stokoe moved to Carlisle United. In the early stages of the 1969–70 season, Rochdale topped the Third Division table, but the team&#x27;s form significantly declined around Christmas 1969, and a failure to halt the team&#x27;s decline led to the dismissal of Richley. He was succeeded by Dick Conner, who stabilised the club&#x27;s form and steered them to a ninth-place finish. The following three seasons saw the club finish in the lower reaches of the Third Division table, narrowly avoiding relegation each time. The board viewed merely surviving in the Third Division as unacceptable and replaced Conner with Walter Joyce for the 1973–74 season. This move failed to pay off, and Rochdale were relegated after a campaign in which they won only two of 46 league games.

The club finished bottom of the league in 1977–78 but were successful in their bid for re-election. Southport, which had finished one place above Rochdale, were demoted instead and replaced by Wigan Athletic. Rochdale finished bottom for a second time in 1979–80, but were again re-elected, by one vote over Altrincham. In 1989–90 the club reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time but lost 1–0 to Crystal Palace.

Steve Parkin was appointed as manager in 1998, a period in which the success of the club improved significantly with the emergence of talented players such as Gary Jones, Clive Platt, Grant Holt and Kevin Townson.

===21st century===
====2000–2010====
Parkin left to take over at Barnsley in November 2001 with Rochdale second in the Third Division. This gained him little popularity with the fans, especially when he took Gary Jones with him. John Hollins was appointed as his successor and the club finished the season in 5th place, entering the promotion play-offs where they lost to Rushden &amp; Diamonds in the semi-final.

The club reached the fifth round of the FA Cup again the following season, but lost 3–1 at Wolves. Hollins was replaced by Paul Simpson in 2002, and Alan Buckley, appointed and sacked as manager in 2003. Parkin then returned to the club as manager, until being sacked in December 2006.

Parkin&#x27;s replacement, Keith Hill, who was initially appointed as caretaker manager, became arguably the club&#x27;s most successful manager to date. Hill and his assistant manager David Flitcroft led Rochdale to a 5th-place finish in 2007–08, securing a play-off place. After beating Darlington 5–4 on penalties in the semi-final, Rochdale reached Wembley for the first time in their history. Despite taking the lead in the match, they lost the final 3–2 to Stockport County.

In the 2008–09 season, Rochdale reached the League Two playoffs for the second consecutive season, finishing 6th in the table on 70 points. Rochdale lost 2–1 on aggregate to Gillingham in the playoff semi-finals. Season 2009–10 ended a 41-year wait for promotion with a win over Northampton Town as Rochdale secured the third automatic promotion spot. Rochdale had played 36 consecutive seasons in the Football League&#x27;s bottom division from 1974 to 2010, the longest any team has been in the bottom division of the League, with some even derisively calling it &quot;the Rochdale Division&quot;.

Rochdale continued their progression under Keith Hill, now with the club for 3 years, with a secured spot in League One in 2010–11. In 2010–11 Rochdale finished 9th in league one with 68 points, equalling their highest league finish since 1969–70.

====2010–2014====

On 1 June 2011 manager Keith Hill joined Championship club Barnsley. Former Manchester City apprentice and youth coach Steve Eyre was confirmed as Hill&#x27;s replacement on 12 June 2011. Eyre&#x27;s spell at Spotland did not last long, as he was sacked after 27 competitive games in charge, the team having recorded just 4 league wins in this time. Eyre&#x27;s last game was a 0–0 draw against Yeovil, in which Yeovil&#x27;s keeper Rene Gilmartin played the second half with a dislocated finger. Director of youth Chris Beech was then appointed as caretaker manager. Under Beech&#x27;s first game in charge, the team drew 1–1 with Preston North End with an equaliser from Daniel Bogdanović who scored on his debut. Beech&#x27;s 5 games in charge ended with a 5–1 defeat by Stevenage and a 3–0 defeat to bottom of league Wycombe Wanderers.

On 24 January 2012, Accrington Stanley&#x27;s John Coleman was confirmed manager as the successor to Steve Eyre and left his club where he had been for more than a decade. John Coleman&#x27;s first match in charge was a 3–0 win at home over Bury in the local derby. However, on 21 April, Rochdale lost 2–1 to Chesterfield resulting in relegation from League One after two years in the league. John Coleman&#x27;s and Jimmy Bell&#x27;s contracts were terminated by Rochdale on 21 January 2013 following a poor run in form. In January 2013, Keith Hill, previously in charge of Rochdale from 2007 to 2011, was appointed as the new manager.

The 2013–14 season was much more successful for Rochdale, they were promoted to League One in third-place on 26 April 2014, after beating Cheltenham Town 2–0. One of the highlights of the season was reaching the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time in eleven years after beating Championship side Leeds United 2–0.

====Return to League One (2014–2021)====
Playing at the club&#x27;s highest level, the 2014–15 season was the club&#x27;s most successful yet. Rochdale missed out on the playoffs by six points, eventually finishing in 8th place, their highest league placing. The club impressed in the FA Cup again, this time reaching the fourth round, losing out 4–1 to Premier League side Stoke City. The 2015–16 season saw Rochdale finish 10th in League One, whilst they finished 9th in 2016–17.

In 2017–18, Rochdale narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 20th in League One. Despite a poor domestic season, Rochdale reached the fifth round of the FA Cup where they met Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur at Spotland. Rochdale held Tottenham to a 2–2 draw, resulting in a replay at Wembley Stadium where Rochdale lost out 6–1. On 4 March 2019, Rochdale sacked manager Keith Hill after six years in charge: with Rochdale in 22nd place. Hill was replaced by Brian Barry-Murphy who led Rochdale to 16th place in the 2018–19 season. In the 2019–20 season, Rochdale reached the third round of the EFL Cup where they lost 5–3 on penalties at Old Trafford against Manchester United after holding the Red Devils to a 1–1 draw in normal time in front of 5,500 travelling supporters. Rochdale also reached the FA Cup third round where they managed a 1–1 home draw with Premier League side Newcastle United, before losing the replay 4–1 at St James&#x27; Park. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the season after 34 matches. Final league positions were decided on a points per game basis, with Rochdale finishing in 18th place.

====League Two (2021–2023)====
After finishing 21st, Rochdale were relegated from League One at the end of the 2020–21 season, and finished 18th in their first League Two campaign. The club started the 2022–23 season with five straight defeats, and sacked manager Robbie Stockdale in mid-August 2022; the side&#x27;s first league win came in their 10th game, away at Colchester United, overseen by Jim Bentley who had been appointed manager on 29 August. Also in August 2022, Rochdale settled a High Court action regarding an attempted hostile takeover of the club by investors Morton House MGT in July 2021; in October 2022, Rochdale were given a six-point penalty, suspended for two years, for failing to comply with EFL regulations over the attempted takeover. On 8 November 2023 Ian Henderson became Rochdale&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, scoring against Salford City in a 1–0 home win to surpass Reg Jenkins&#x27; long standing record of 129 goals. On 27 March 2023, Rochdale sacked manager Bentley; under him, the side had won just six out of 32 league games and were 10 points from safety with eight games remaining. Jimmy McNulty was appointed interim manager, later (12 May) taking on the role permanently. On 22 April 2023, a 1–0 defeat against Stockport County confirmed relegation to the National League after 102 years as a Football League club. At the time of their relegation, the club had played the most seasons in the Football League without ever having reached the top two tiers (95 seasons).

====National League (2023–present)====
Rochdale&#x27;s first National League season was overshadowed by financial difficulties, with chairman Simon Gauge warning the club faced liquidation if no new investment was found. In March 2024, club shareholders agreed to issue nine million new shares, paving the way for American group World Soccer Holdings to mount a takeover. On 9 May 2024, the club announced that the family of local businessman Peter Ogden had completed a £2 million takeover of the club following the expiration of World Soccer Holdings&#x27; exclusivity period. The Dale finished 11th in the National League in their first season in non-League.

==Club badge and colours==

The club crest used by Rochdale AFC is a variant of the arms of the former County Borough of Rochdale. The coat of arms, based on those of the local and reputed Rochdale family with certain additions, was granted to the Borough by Herald&#x27;s College in 1857. At its centre, a shield shows a sack of wool and a cotton plant, representing the local wool and cotton industries. Around the edge of the shield sit eight martlets (birds). These are taken from the Rochdale family coat of arms (mentioned above) and are widely used on heraldic devices. Above the shield and helm (in the position technically known as the &quot;crest&quot; in heraldry) more local industry representations are made by the inclusion of a fleece of wool (suspended by a band) and the iron centre of an old mill-stone (known as a mill-rind).

A motto below the shield reads &quot;Crede Signo&quot;. Roughly translated, this means &quot;Believe in the sign&quot;. The blazon (official heraldic description) for the arms reads as follows: &quot;Argent a woolpack encircled by two branches of the cotton tree flowered and conjoint proper; a bordure sable charged with eight martlets of the field; and for a crest on a wreath of the colours a mill-rind sable and above a fleece argent banded or.&quot;

When Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council was formed in 1974, a new coat of arms was created and awarded for council use. Rochdale A.F.C., however, retained their variant of the old Rochdale County Borough arms.

Rochdale&#x27;s current home colours are black and blue shirts, white shorts and blue and black hooped socks. Previously, Rochdale&#x27;s usual colours were blue and white, introduced in 1949. Prior to this, Rochdale wore black and white stripes, which was influenced by the strong Newcastle United side of 1907 (the year Rochdale was formed), the stripe which they adopted for their centenary season in 2007.

This black and white kit was re-introduced in the 2007–08 season as the one-off centenary kit; the new Internazionale-influenced design which succeeded it was an amalgamation of the striped kit and the blue kit to herald the second century of Rochdale&#x27;s existence. Between 2010 and 2012 Rochdale&#x27;s shirts were predominantly blue with black pinstripes on the body and black sleeves.

Rochdale&#x27;s away kit comprises white shirts with a purple stripe, purple shorts and purple and white hooped socks. Other historical away kits have included yellow, teal, green and red. Other kits have included white shirts with black shorts, white shirts with blue shorts and a blue shirt with white sleeves.

===Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors===
Rochdale has had sponsored shirts since 1983. Former sponsors include Carcraft, MMC Estates, All-in-One Garden Centre, Smith Metals, Keytech, Freebets.co.uk, Cabrini and the Co-operative. On 28 May 2013, Crown Oil was unveiled as the club&#x27;s new principal sponsor.

It was announced in June 2009 that the kit supplier for the next three seasons would be Carbrini.

From 2012 to 2015, Rochdale&#x27;s kit was supplied by Fila.

On 25 April 2015, Rochdale revealed Erreà as their new supplier.

On 8 February 2023, the club announced that their kits would be supplied by O&#x27;Neills.

==Stadium==
Rochdale plays their home matches at Spotland Stadium, known locally as just Spotland, and currently named the Crown Oil Arena as part of a sponsorship deal by the Bury-based fuel company Crown Oil. The stadium was officially opened in 1920, and was used exclusively by Rochdale for the first 68 years of its existence. From 1988 to 2016 the ground was jointly owned by the football club, Rochdale Council and rugby league club Rochdale Hornets. In 2016 Rochdale A.F.C. bought the stadium shares they did not hold to own 100% of Spotland Stadium.

Apart from local football and rugby league, Spotland has also hosted minor nations&#x27; rugby league matches, British Amateur Rugby League Association matches, and also the National League Cup finals of 2003 and 2004. Spotland was a venue for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, hosting a match between Fiji and Ireland - the first time that Rochdale had staged an event in any sporting World Cup. The event was almost sold out with almost 9,000 people attending. This was incorrectly claimed to be a new stadium record, but Rochdale had 24,231 for an FA Cup tie vs Notts County in December 1949 and three higher crowds for FA Cup and play-off games between 1990 and 2008 against Northampton Town, Coventry City and Darlington.

Today Spotland has a capacity of 10,249 in four stands: the Co-Operative Stand (or Main Stand), the Thwaites Beer Stand (the Sandy Lane End), the T.D.S Stand (Pearl Street end) and the Westrose Leisure Stand (the Willbutts Lane Stand). Three are fully seated; the Sandy Lane End is a small standing terrace behind one of the goals.

The Main Stand features a statue of a long-standing Rochdale fan, David Clough, situated where he watched matches as a season-ticket holder. He had helped the club raise funds and left £250,000 to the club in his will when he died in 2020. The statue was unveiled in September 2021.

==Rivalries==
Rochdale have a number of rivalries with both local and non-local clubs. Rochdale&#x27;s traditional main rival is neighbours Oldham Athletic, but from the years 1974-2010, Rochdale spent the years in the fourth division of English football, whilst Oldham were always higher up in the Football League Pyramid. This meant that they could only meet in pre-season friendlies, however since 2010 the clubs have played each other in most seasons up until now. With the lack of matches in between the years of being in different leagues the club formed other rivalries, the main one being with neighbours Bury. Most Rochdale fans in the present day would consider Bury to be their main rivals, due to the tension in the games, which is known as the South Lancashire Derby and considered to be one of the biggest derbies in the lower leagues. Despite Oldham being a regular fixture in more recent years, Rochdale fans still consider Bury to be their biggest rivals even with the two clubs not playing each other since 2018. Dale also have a rivalry with Yorkshire club Halifax Town, this match is intensified by the fact that this is a Lancashire-Yorkshire derby, also known as a Roses rivalry. Feelings of animosity was always more one-sided with Halifax feeling more strongly about Rochdale. The club have always had a strong rivalry with Stockport County, although neither side see each other as primary rivals. In the 1980s and 1990s Rochdale also had significant rivalries with Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Wigan Athletic and Bradford City.

<text>Scunthorpe United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, England. The team competes in the National League North, the sixth level of the English football league system.

The club was formed in 1899 and turned professional after joining the Midland League in 1912. Crowned Midland League champions in the 1926–27 and 1938–39 campaigns, they were elected into the Football League in 1950. They went on to secure promotion as champions of the Third Division North in 1957–58 and spent six seasons in the Second Division, before they were relegated in 1964 and then down to the Fourth Division in 1968. United spent 34 of the next 37 seasons in the basement tier, punctuated by one-season stays in the third tier after they secured promotions in 1971–72, 1982–83 and 1998–99. Brian Laws saw the club promoted out of League Two at the end of the 2004–05 season and his successor, Nigel Adkins, led the club to the League One title in 2006–07. Scunthorpe spent just one season in the Championship, but victory in the 2009 League One play-off final saw the club promoted back into the Championship. They remained in the second tier until two relegations in as many years saw them back into the fourth tier by 2013. Scunthorpe were promoted to League One at the end of the 2013–14 campaign, before being relegated back to League Two in 2019. In 2022, the club was relegated to the National League, ending a 72-year spell in the Football League, and a year later were relegated again, to the National League North.

The team is nicknamed &quot;The Iron&quot;, and has played in a home strip of claret and blue for most of the club&#x27;s history. They play their home games at Glanford Park—currently known as The Attis Arena for sponsorship reasons—having moved from their original stadium, the Old Show Ground, in 1988. They used to contest Humber derby games with local rivals Grimsby Town and Hull City, as well as Lincolnshire derby games with Boston United, Gainsborough Trinity and Lincoln City.

==History==
===1899–1958: Early years===
Scunthorpe United was formed in 1899. In 1910 they merged with local rivals North Lindsey United to become Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United and joined the Midland Football League in 1912. After an unsuccessful application to join the Football League in 1921, Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey won the Midland League in 1926–27 and in 1938–39. When the 1939–40 season came to an abrupt end, due to the outbreak of the Second World War, Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey finished as runners-up in the second emergency competition, losing 3–2 to Peterborough United in an unofficial play-off game.

After the end of the war, in 1945, Scunthorpe &amp; Lindsey United re-applied to join the Football League at every opportunity. The club finished as runners-up in the Midland League in 1947–48, and in 1950 was accepted into the Football League, ahead of Workington and Wigan Athletic when the league structure was expanded. The club&#x27;s first game in Third Division North was against fellow new entrants Shrewsbury Town.

After an unremarkable few years in the Football League, which included the club&#x27;s first-ever third and fourth-round FA Cup ties (against Tottenham Hotspur and Portsmouth respectively), the &quot;&amp; Lindsey&quot; was dropped from the club&#x27;s name in 1958.

===1958–1964: The Second Division years===
In 1958 Scunthorpe United won promotion to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division North under the guidance of manager Ron Suart. The Iron then began a steady rise through the Second Division over the next four years under a variety of managers, improving its league position each season until reaching fourth place at the close of the 1961–62 season, the club&#x27;s highest league position to date. This was despite the sale of its leading marksman Barrie Thomas to Newcastle United for a reported £40,000.

The year 1962 proved to be a turning point in the fortunes of the club, and in 1964 they finished bottom of the Second Division and were relegated to the now national Third Division. At the same time Scunthorpe United stalwart Jack Brownsword retired after 597 Football League appearances for the club, and Freddie Goodwin replaced Dick Duckworth as the club&#x27;s manager.

===1964–1987: Decline and stagnation===
After relegation from Division Two, the Iron spent the next four years bouncing around in the Third Division. Freddie Goodwin left the club during the 1967–68 season, but his replacement Ron Ashman was unable to save the club from relegation to Division Four at the end of the season. A slight resurgence occurred in the early &#x27;70s, with the Iron defeating First Division Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup during January 1970 and gaining promotion back to the Third Division in 1972. During this period, a young Kevin Keegan was discovered and developed by Ashman before being sold to Liverpool in 1971 for £35,000, having made 124 appearances and scored 18 goals for Scunthorpe.

The Iron were unable to cement a place in the Third Division, and relegation back to the Fourth Division followed immediately in 1973. At the same time, Ashman departed to manage local rivals Grimsby Town, only to return in 1976. The period between his two tenures saw several management changes and a disastrous league campaign which saw the Iron finish bottom of the Football League in 1975. In 1980, the club signed the cricketer Ian Botham, who played until 1984, making 14 appearances. He was also a regular in the Central League for Scunthorpe United Reserves, once scoring a hat-trick against Blackpool at the Old Show Ground. The next five years saw United remain in the bottom half of Division Four, finishing second-bottom at the end of the 1981–82 campaign. Promotion to Division Three was achieved under manager John Duncan in 1983, but immediate relegation followed under his successor Allan Clarke, with United then entering a further period of stagnation in the middle of the Fourth Division table.

===1987–1997: New home, new horizons===
In 1988 Scunthorpe United became the first English football club in the modern era to move to a new, purpose-built stadium, Glanford Park. While preparations for the new ground were under way, the club&#x27;s final season at the Old Show Ground very nearly yielded success as United qualified for the Division Four play-offs under the management of Mick Buxton. However, the Iron lose 3–2 on aggregate to Torquay United in the semi-final. The second leg of this semi-final was the last game played at the Old Show Ground, with Steve Lister being the last player to score at the ground.

The club&#x27;s first season at Glanford Park ended in another play-off semi-final defeat, 5–1 on aggregate to Wrexham. Further play-off failure occurred in 1991 as the Iron lost to 3–2 on aggregate to Blackpool in the semi-final under Buxton&#x27;s replacement, Bill Green. Finally, in 1992 the club made it to the Fourth Division play-off final at Wembley, but lost 4–3 to Blackpool in a penalty shootout. This was the club&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley.

The following four seasons saw United sit consistently in the middle of the now Third Division table under a succession of managers, namely Richard Money and David Moore. Mick Buxton made a surprise return to the club as manager following Moore&#x27;s sacking in 1996.

===1997–2010: The Brian Laws and Nigel Adkins era===
In February 1997, Brian Laws was appointed manager. In 1997–98, his first full season in charge, the Iron finished one point outside the play-offs. The following season, the club finished fourth in Division Three. This ensured qualification for the play-offs, which they won after a 3–2 aggregate win in the semi-finals over Swansea City and a 1–0 win over Leyton Orient in the final at Wembley. They were unable to maintain their Division Two status the following season, finishing in 23rd place.

Laws guided the Iron to their second play-off position finish during the 2002–03 season, with the club finishing in 5th place. However, Scunthorpe were ultimately denied by their county rivals Lincoln City, losing the semi-finals 6–3 on aggregate. On 25 March 2004, Laws was sacked from his position as Scunthorpe United manager after a poor run of results saw the Iron sitting just 6 points above the Division Three relegation zone. However, only three weeks later, it was announced that Laws had been reinstated as the manager of the Iron after a boardroom shake-up. Ultimately, the Iron finished four points ahead of the relegation zone, finishing 22nd.

Laws remained with the Iron for the following season, which Scunthorpe started in the newly rebranded Football League Two. The Iron gained promotion to Football League One as runners up. In the FA Cup, Scunthorpe visited Chelsea but lost 3–1 despite briefly going ahead in the match. In the 2005–06 season, the club secured a mid-table League One finish. After a successful start to the 2006–07 season, Laws was offered the job of manager at Sheffield Wednesday, which he accepted, ending almost a decade in charge of the Iron.

Following Laws&#x27; departure, physiotherapist Nigel Adkins was put in temporary charge. After obtaining good results, his role was made permanent. Under Adkins, the club went on to win League One and promotion to the Championship that season, in the process setting a club record 16-match unbeaten run and accumulating 91 points. In the following league campaign, Scunthorpe were unable to cement their place in the second tier, and were relegated in 23rd place.

The 2008–09 season saw Scunthorpe reach Wembley twice. The Iron qualified for the Football League Trophy final, but were beaten 3–2 after extra time by Luton Town. The club then qualified for the League One play-offs before defeating MK Dons on penalties in the semi-finals, before beating Millwall in the Wembley final 3–2 to achieve promotion back to the Championship at the first time of asking. In 2009–10, the Iron managed to retain their second-tier status, a feat no Scunthorpe side had achieved since 1963. Seven games into the 2010–11 season, Nigel Adkins left Scunthorpe to become Southampton&#x27;s manager. After spells from Ian Baraclough and Alan Knill as manager, Scunthorpe were ultimately relegated in bottom position.

===2011–2022: The final Football League years===
They finished the 2011–12 season in 18th place with 52 points. With the Iron struggling in the following season, Brian Laws returned after a six-year absence, but was unable to stop the club&#x27;s slide back into League Two, with relegation confirmed on the last day of the next season. At the end of the 2012–13 season, the then chairman Steve Wharton stepped down from his position with immediate effect. Businessman Peter Swann was appointed as his successor on 24 May 2013.

Laws was sacked in November 2013 and was replaced by Russ Wilcox who oversaw a 28-game unbeaten run, which broke the all-time football league record. The unbeaten run was ended with a defeat at Exeter City, on the same day Scunthorpe achieved instant promotion back to League One. However, Wilcox could not sustain momentum into the following season and was sacked in October 2014. The club eventually finished 16th.

After narrowly missing out on the play-offs on goal difference in the previous 2015–16 campaign, the Iron finished in third, having never been outside the top six during the season. In the play-off semi-final, Scunthorpe lost 3–2 to Millwall. In the 2017–18 season, Scunthorpe finished in 5th place but lost 4–2 on aggregate against Rotherham United in the play-off semi-finals.

Scunthorpe were relegated at the end of the 2018–19 season in 23rd position. Due to the impact of COVID-19, the 2019–20 season was terminated early and decided on a points per game basis, placing Scunthorpe 20th. In 2020–21, the majority of fixtures were played behind closed doors; Scunthorpe finished 22nd, after not winning any of their final ten fixtures, avoiding relegation by three points.

On 31 March 2022, with the Iron bottom of League Two and 10 points from safety, chairman Peter Swann announced his resignation with immediate effect. On 15 April 2022, Scunthorpe lost 3–0 at Leyton Orient and were relegated from League Two, ending a 72-year spell in the Football League. The club&#x27;s final league game was a 7–0 hammering away at Bristol Rovers, leaving the Iron bottom of the table with just 26 points.

===2022–present: non-League football===
On 14 September 2022, the club was reported to be &quot;in genuine danger of entering administration&quot; after a proposed takeover deal collapsed. In January 2023, with a takeover yet to be completed and the club at the bottom of the National League, the club were served with a winding-up petition over an unpaid tax bill. On 25 January 2023, the club announced the immediate takeover of the club by former Ilkeston Town chairman David Hilton.

Hilton settled the club&#x27;s HMRC tax debt, spelling the end of a transfer embargo but ownership of the ground continued to be disputed. To cut costs, the club&#x27;s academy was closed and some staff redundancies went ahead. At the end of the 2022–23 season, the club suffered a second successive relegation to the National League North.

In September 2023, Hilton put the club up for sale. On 28 September 2023, after the emergence of details relating to previous criminal offences committed by Hilton, and a damning expose article in The Athletic online football magazine, plus subsequent disagreements with various fans groups and individuals on social media, he withdrew the club&#x27;s funding. With going out of business seemingly immediately ahead for the club, an online initiative by longstanding fans website Iron Bru raised over £70k which was then used to pay some of the wages of staff, players and management (who had gone unpaid under Hilton for two months). On 4 October 2023, the club was sold to local businesswoman Michelle Harness and a new board of directors was formed. They finished their first season in the sixth tier as runners-up but lost on penalties in the play-off semi-final to Boston United.

==Stadiums==
===The Old Show Ground===

The Old Show Ground was club&#x27;s original home from 1899 to 1988. The site, in the centre of Scunthorpe, hosted events including the annual Scunthorpe show as far back as 1867. The site was also initially known simply as &#x27;the Showground&#x27;, but it is unclear when the prefix &#x27;Old&#x27; was added.

The Old Show Ground needed significant investment to maintain its fabric and ensure compliance with new regulations introduced in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire. In 1987, with the club hampered by financial difficulties, it announced plans to relocate. The ground was sold to the former supermarket chain Safeway (and later to Sainsbury&#x27;s) and the search was started for a new location. In 1988 Scunthorpe United became the first English football club in the modern era to move to a new, purpose-built stadium, Glanford Park.

The site of the former ground is now home to a Sainsbury&#x27;s store, at the junction of Doncaster Road and Henderson Avenue. When the store was opened a plaque (since removed) marked the location of the centre-spot, just in front of the delicatessen counter. A carved stone commemorating the site&#x27;s previous use was incorporated into the exterior wall of a 2011 extension, beside the cashpoints.

===Glanford Park===

Land was secured at an out of town site in what was then the administrative area of Glanford meaning that the new ground was outside the boundaries of Scunthorpe (although this changed with the re-organisation of local government in 1996 as both Scunthorpe Borough Council and Glanford Borough Council merged to become North Lincolnshire Council).

At this time there were no grants available and the development had to be funded with the cash from the sale of the Old Show Ground, sponsorship, directors&#x27; loans and bank loans. This lack of outsider cash means that Glanford Park was built in a rather simplistic, box-like style, with a capacity of 9,088—significantly smaller than the Old Show Ground. The ground was so named because it was sponsored by Glanford Borough Council. The ground has been officially known as the Attis Arena since 6 January 2024, when the naming rights were purchased by Leeds-based company Attis Insurance Brokers.

==== Glanford Park property dispute ====
In May 2021, the then Scunthorpe United owner, Peter Swann revealed to fans that he had transferred Glanford Park, the training ground, car park and surrounding land to his other business Coolsilk Property and Investment Ltd, in exchange for £11 million worth of loans. At the same time, Swann told the fans they could expect stadium improvements and that the club would have a 99-year lease so they couldn&#x27;t be evicted. In January 2023, David Hilton had completed a takeover of Scunthorpe and announced the deal included the stadium and surrounding land. The deal provided a four-month exclusivity period for Hilton to conclude a £3m agreement to buy the property.

However, Hilton&#x27;s legal team raised concerns about the valuation, the stadium&#x27;s status as a community asset and issues of planning permission and access. Hilton did not buy the stadium within the agreed timeframe; instead he found a loophole solution: a lease agreement that let the club stay at Glanford Park for 7p a week rent - something Swann considered to be trespass and squatting. Hilton claimed that Swann was demanding an unreasonable £1.5 million upfront before starting legal paperwork for the sale. Swann, through a fan message board, claimed Hilton was lying about the whole thing and didn&#x27;t want to buy the stadium at all. In late May 2023, the gates at Glanford Park were bolted shut and a sign explained the club were legally allowed to &#x27;squat&#x27; at Glanford Park.

Swann began legal proceedings to sue both Hilton and the club, with an initial court hearing being adjourned until between January 2024 and March 2024. However, in September 2023, the club said that fixtures after 7 October 2023 would be played at Gainsborough Trinity due to the dispute. However, the club continued to play at Glanford Park in late October as negotiations over the ground&#x27;s ownership continued. On 16 November 2023, the club exchanged contracts with Swann to buy back Glanford Park. Tahina Akther, a local born barrister, crafted a deal that enabled The New Show Ground Community Interest Company, a not for profit entity, to purchase the stadium alongside the local council purchasing the surrounding training fields and car parks for development. The purchase was completed on 29 November.

==Club identity==
The club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Iron&quot;, marks the town&#x27;s association with the iron and steel industry. The club was also nicknamed The Nuts in the early 20th century.

The club&#x27;s first choice playing colours are claret and blue.

===Mascots===
Scunthorpe United&#x27;s official team mascots are &#x27;Scunny Bunny&#x27; who has the number 99 and &#x27;Honey Bunny&#x27; who has the number 66. They both wear the same kit as the outfield players do.

==Rivalries==

Scunthorpe are considered to be a part of two main derbies: the Humber derby and the Lincolnshire derby. The Humber derby is a contested between Scunthorpe, Hull City and Grimsby Town. The three clubs are all situated on the banks of the River Humber, hence the name given to the derby. The Lincolnshire derby is contested between a number of clubs throughout the county of Lincolnshire, including Scunthorpe, Lincoln City, Boston United, Gainsborough Trinity and Grimsby. Scunthorpe have not played Gainsborough competitively since an FA Cup game in 1930, though the two often play pre-season friendlies.

Doncaster Rovers are also considered a rival, as they are the nearest club, geographically, to Glanford Park. Despite this, Grimsby are traditionally viewed as Scunthorpe&#x27;s fiercest rivals. Fans also consider York City a rivalry, though the two teams rarely play each, only six times in the last 20 years. During Scunthorpe&#x27;s rise to the second and third tiers of English football, rivalries with Barnsley, Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday emerged, although none of these clubs saw Scunthorpe as a rival.

<doc id="451168" wikidata="Q48951" url="?curid=451168" title="Southend United F.C.">
<text>Southend United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England, which competes in the National League, the fifth level of English football. The team are known as &quot;The Shrimpers&quot;, a reference to the area&#x27;s maritime industry that is included as one of the quarters on the club badge. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Colchester United, with which it contests the Essex derby. Southend United is based at Roots Hall Stadium in Prittlewell, Southend-on-Sea.

Founded on 19 May 1906 in the Blue Boar pub, Southend won the Southern League Second Division in both of its two initial seasons and was admitted into the Football League in 1920. It spent the next 44 years in the third tier of English football, before dropping into the Fourth Division in 1966. They spent the next 24 years moving between the third and fourth tiers, winning promotions in 1971–72, 1977–78, 1980–81 (as champions), 1986–87 and 1989–90. They were promoted into the Second Division for the first time at the end of the 1990–91 season. After six seasons in the second tier they suffered a double relegation in 1997 and 1998. Under manager Steve Tilson, Southend again secured a double promotion in 2004–05 and 2005–06 to win a place in the Championship as League One champions. However, they only lasted one season in the second tier and then, after two top half League One finishes, were relegated back to League Two in 2010. They secured promotion as play-off winners in 2015, but suffered another double relegation in 2020 and 2021, amid deep financial problems that several times pushed the club to the brink of liquidation, to drop—after 101 years in the Football League—into the National League, where they remain.

==History==


===1906–1920: Foundation and early years===
Southend United F.C. was founded on 19 May 1906 in the Blue Boar Hotel after landlord Oliver Trigg invited a group of footballers and businessmen to discuss setting up a new professional club. The new Southend United would displace the more prominent Southend Athletic in the town, who later disbanded. A prospectus for shares in the club issued in August 1906 noted the club had been elected to complete in the Second Division of the Southern League and in the South Eastern League, and a seven-year lease had been agreed to play at Roots Hall Field in Prittlewell.

Robert Jack (&quot;late of Plymouth Argyle Football Club&quot;) was appointed as manager, secretary and player, and 12 professional players were recruited, including two - outside left Alfred Ernest Watkins (formerly at Millwall) and back George Molyneux (formerly at Portsmouth) - listed as internationals (Watkins had played for Wales, Molyneux for England). Other signings included goalkeeper Charles Cotton from West Ham, outside right Arthur Holden from Portsmouth, and centre-forward Harold Halse from Wanstead, plus players from Southend Athletic, Grays United, South Weald and Leigh Ramblers. In the Southern League Second Division, Southend would primarily compete against reserve teams.

In their first season under Jack&#x27;s management, Southend won the Southern League Second Division title for 1906–07, then repeated the feat the following season, gaining election to the Southern League First Division in 1908. The club first entered the FA Cup in 1907–08, where they met East Ham. When Jack left Southend in 1910, he was succeeded as player-manager by Molyneux. Southend were relegated back to the Second Division after the 1910–11 season, but returned to the First Division two seasons later as runners-up. However, World War I disrupted the club&#x27;s progress. To aid the country&#x27;s war effort, parts of the club&#x27;s ground Roots Hall were dismantled and requisitioned to a nearby timber yard where buildings had been destroyed by bombs. After the war, Roots Hall was unusable so Southend moved to &#x27;The Kursaal&#x27;.

===1920s–1980s: Establishment in the Football League===

The club remained in the Southern League until the first post-World War I season of 1919–20. The club then joined the Football League&#x27;s new Third Division and finished 17th in their first season. In 1921, the Third Division was regionalised with Southend United joining the Third Division South. In their second Football League season, Southend had to apply for re-election. However, from 1922, under new manager Ted Birnie, the club began to stabilise and began to challenge for promotion to the Second Division, finishing third in 1932. After a successful twelve years, Birnie left to be replaced in May 1934 by David Jack, son of the club&#x27;s first manager, and the Shrimpers moved from the Kursaal to the Southend Stadium. A highlight of Jack&#x27;s six-year tenure saw Southend draw 4–4 in the FA Cup third round at White Hart Lane against Tottenham Hotspur in January 1936 before losing the replay. Following the start of World War II, the 1939–40 season was abandoned. In the 1948–49 season, the Shrimpers narrowly avoided a re-election vote. Southend came close to promotion when they finished third in 1950 (the club&#x27;s joint highest league position until 1991). Southend remained in the Third Division South until the re-structuring of the Football League in 1958.

Southend United joined the new national Third Division in 1958, where they remained until 1966 when they suffered their first relegation, into the Fourth Division. The club had to wait six seasons until 1972 to experience the club&#x27;s first promotion, as runners-up behind Grimsby Town. In 1976 Southend suffered relegation again before taking another runners-up spot behind Watford in 1978. Another relegation in 1980 was directly followed by one of the most successful seasons in the club&#x27;s history as they won the Fourth Division Championship in 1981, breaking a series of club records in the process. Despite success on the pitch and low admission prices, the club&#x27;s gates were low and condemned as &quot;a bad reflection on the town&quot;.

===1984–2000===
In 1984, the club was relegated to the Fourth Division with Bobby Moore as manager, and the following season finished 20th, narrowly avoiding having to seek re-election to the Football League. However, Southend gained promotion in 1987. Although relegated again in 1989 (albeit with the highest point total of any relegated team in League history), successive promotions in 1990 and the 1991–92 season saw Southend United reach the second tier of the Football League; in 1992, under manager David Webb, the club finished 12th in the old Second Division, having briefly topped the division on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1992.

Southend United were then managed by Colin Murphy and Barry Fry. Fry moved to Southend United in 1993 with the club bottom of Division One. Fry kept Southend up, but later in the year moved to Birmingham City. He was succeeded by former Shrimpers player Peter Taylor in his first managerial role in the Football League. He spent two years between 1993 and 1995 as manager, but quit at the end of the 1994–95 season after failing to get them beyond the middle of the Division One table. In 1995, former Liverpool player Ronnie Whelan became player-manager. Southend finished 14th in Division One in his first season as a manager, but were relegated a year later and Whelan left the club, later winning a case for wrongful dismissal. He was replaced by Alvin Martin but Martin was unable to avoid a second consecutive relegation.

Martin Dawn PLC (run by Ron Martin) and Delancey Estates, together forming South Eastern Leisure (SEL), took control of Southend United in November 1998, buying the club and its centrally located Roots Hall ground for £4 million from then chairman Vic Jobson, who at the time owned 55% of the issued share capital of the club. (The transfer of Roots Hall&#x27;s ownership to Roots Hall Limited - 50% owned by Martin Dawn - were to have ramifications almost 25 years later.) Jobson had previously sold part of the ground&#x27;s South Bank for housing, and SEL&#x27;s plan was to continue the redevelopment and move the club to a proposed 16,000-seat ground, Fossetts Farm Stadium, in a leisure redevelopment in the northern part of Southend.

Alvin Martin left in April 1999, with Southend fifth from bottom in the Football League. 

===Early 21st century===
Alan Little was manager for a brief spell, helping them to avoid the drop into the Football Conference and also helped them survive a serious financial crisis by slashing the wage bill and rebuilding a much cheaper side. The club&#x27;s first flirtation with the High Court came in July 2000, when a debt to the Inland Revenue was paid off shortly before a scheduled winding-up petition hearing. Little&#x27;s dismissal in September 2000 came as a surprise as, despite a poor start to the season, it followed a five-game unbeaten run that saw &#x27;the Shrimpers&#x27; rise to 10th in the Third Division. He was replaced by David Webb on 2 October 2000, soon after Ron Martin had taken over as chairman. The club then turned to Rob Newman, Steve Wignall and, in late 2003, former Southend United midfielder Steve Tilson.

Under Tilson, Southend reached their first national cup final, meeting Blackpool in the 2004 final of the Football League Trophy at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Over 20,000 Southend fans travelled, but the team did not rise to the occasion and Blackpool won 2–0. Tilson then led Southend to promotion to League One in 2005, while making a second successive appearance in the Football League Trophy final, which the Shrimpers lost 2–0 to Wrexham, but the third appearance at the Millennium Stadium in the League Two play-off final against Lincoln City brought success giving the club its first promotion via the play-off system and their first major silverware since 1981.

In May 2006 Southend became League One champions after beating Bristol City 1–0 at Roots Hall in front of over 11,000 fans - the club&#x27;s first title in 25 years. Southend started the 2006–07 season well but then did not win a league game for 18 games until December 2006. In the meantime, however, Southend did beat trophy holders and Premier League Champions Manchester United 1–0 in a League Cup fourth round tie, with Freddy Eastwood scoring the winner. Southend briefly escaped the relegation zone in March 2007 but only 10 league wins in the season meant the Shrimpers were relegated back to League One. Southend finished sixth in League One at the end of 2007–08, qualifying for a play-off place. Against Doncaster Rovers, Southend drew the home leg 0–0, but lost the second leg 5–1. The following season, Southend finished 8th, missing out on a play-off place, but the 2009–10 season was tougher: a run of just one win in 2010 left Southend deep in trouble, and relegation to League Two was confirmed on 24 April 2010. On 4 July 2010 manager Steve Tilson was put on gardening leave, ending his seven-year stint as manager.

=== 2010s ===
During the 2009–10 season, Southend faced two winding-up orders from HM Revenue and Customs over unpaid tax bills. In February 2010 Southend players were not paid, the Professional Footballers Association had to pay the players, and the club were placed under a transfer embargo until they paid the money back. In March 2010 Southend were given a 35-day extension to pay the unpaid bill or face administration, and further seven day extension in April 2010. On 20 April 2010 the bill was paid, and in August 2010 all actions against Southend United were dropped and an agreement was reached with HMRC.

On 5 July 2010 former Sheffield Wednesday and Plymouth Argyle manager, Paul Sturrock was announced as the new manager. Sturrock led Southend to a 13th place in his first season, but the club mounted a more serious challenge the following season, spending 11 weeks at the top of League Two before a decline in form meant the team had to enter the play-offs. Southend lost the play off semi-final against Crewe Alexandra 3–2 on aggregate.
A transfer embargo at the start of the 2012–13 season saw the club start its campaign with a depleted squad. However, a successful loan signing - Britt Assombalonga from Watford - helped Southend to a run of 14 games unbeaten which saw them reach 4th in the table. League form dipped in early 2013, but the club reached its first Wembley cup final in the Football League Trophy. Paul Sturrock was sacked two weeks before the cup final. Nevertheless, the Blues took 33,000 fans to the match, but lost 2–0 to Crewe Alexandra.

Phil Brown was brought in as Sturrock&#x27;s successor. In 2015 Brown led the team, via a play-off final against Wycombe Wanderers (decided 7–6 on penalties), into League One. At the end of the 2016–17 season, the club missed the play-offs in League One by one point. The following season, Southend finished 10th, but slipped to 19th at the end of the 2018–19 season, avoiding relegation on goal difference.

On 22 October 2019, Sol Campbell was appointed manager of Southend.

===2020–present===
====Financial difficulties and double relegation====
Financial difficulties resulted in non-payment of players&#x27; and other employees&#x27; wages in December 2019, after which players consulted with the PFA. Club chairman Ron Martin paid £140,000 to pay wages, and a winding-up petition was dismissed after debts were cleared. However, financial constraints and an EFL transfer embargo prevented the club signing any new players. February 2020 wages were not paid on time, and Southend was charged with misconduct and later received a suspended three-point penalty and £7,500 fine. On 11 March, a further HMRC winding-up petition was adjourned - first to 29 April then three more times, eventually to 28 October 2020.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Southend put &quot;several staff and some players&quot; on furlough under the UK Government&#x27;s emergency job retention scheme - a move criticised by the PFA who said the club had &quot;consistently&quot; let players down over wages. On 9 June, EFL League One and Two clubs agreed to end the 2019–20 season; Southend were relegated to League Two. The following day, the club put the whole playing squad on furlough, but players refused to accept the move. On 30 June 2020, manager Campbell left the club.

On 13 August 2020, Southend United appointed Mark Molesley as manager on a three-year contract. In October 2020, after the club settled tax debts of £493,931 with HMRC, a winding-up petition was dismissed by the High Court. On 9 April 2021, Molesley was sacked having only won eight games out of 45. Phil Brown returned as manager but could not rescue the situation; Southend suffered a second successive relegation, dropping out of the Football League after 101 years. Brown subsequently agreed a two-year contract to manage the club.

In August 2021, Southend revealed their overall debt in July 2019 was £17.4M, having grown by £2.4M; Martin said the majority of the debt was owed to his companies, and that £6.8M of debt had already been written off. On 5 and 9 October 2021, Southend fans staged protests demanding the departure of chairman Ron Martin. Brown was sacked in October, and was replaced by Kevin Maher. Southend finished their first National League season in 13th position.

====Further financial difficulties====
On 30 September 2022, the club was placed under a transfer embargo after a missed HMRC payment. In October 2022, HMRC issued a winding-up petition. A High Court hearing on 9 November was adjourned to 18 January 2023; the transfer embargo remained in place. After members of staff were late receiving their October 2022 salaries, the Shrimpers Trust and shirt sponsor PG Site Services each loaned the club £40,000. November and some December 2022 wages for players and non-playing staff were also paid late.

On 18 January 2023, the HMRC winding-up hearing was adjourned again, to 1 March 2023. Martin was seeking a £5M loan to pay debts including £1.4M in unpaid tax owed to HMRC. With players and other staff unpaid for January, anxious fans started planning a &#x27;phoenix club&#x27; and there were unsuccessful attempts to engage with Martin over a possible sale of the club.

Players&#x27; January wages remained unpaid ahead of Southend&#x27;s 25 February game at Torquay United, and were eventually paid 28 days late; other staff had not been paid since November. Less than 24 hours before the winding-up hearing, the club said it had paid the £1.4M tax bill, adding that &quot;funds as working capital&quot; had also been injected into the club. The winding-up petition was dismissed, but the transfer embargo remained in place. The club finished their second National League season in 8th position; non-playing staff at the club had not been paid for the past two months.

====Club put up for sale====
Meanwhile, on 17 March 2023, the club was put up for sale. Despite the February funds injection, its financial difficulties continued, and on 4 May 2023 the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition—their 18th—due to be heard in the High Court on 17 May. Three companies, including shirt sponsor PG Site Services and Engie Power, were also involved in the petition regarding a £275,000 debt, but the hearing was adjourned to 12 July 2023, giving Martin more time to sell the club.

In July 2023, after repeated late payment of club staff wages, players refused to resume pre-season training until they were paid. Backing the players&#x27; decision to suspend training, the Shrimpers Trust offered to support unpaid club staff. While players were eventually paid, manager Maher and other backroom staff remained unpaid three days before the winding-up hearing, while club sale discussions were reportedly being held up by the stadium side of the transaction.

On 12 July 2023, the winding-up hearing was adjourned for a second time, to 23 August 2023, to allow further time for a sale to be concluded, amid doubts about the club&#x27;s ability to meet National League requirements. On 17 July 2023, Martin said he would sell his stake in the club for £1, but wanted £4.5M for Roots Hall. The club also needed £1M &quot;in the short term&quot; to settle its latest HMRC winding-up petition and lift a transfer embargo.

On 21 July 2023, the club paid £300,000 in football-related debts to remain in the National League. Club staff were paid wages dating back up to three months on 26 July. The National League licensed the club to participate in the 2023–24 season, but required it to pay its HMRC debt in full by 23 August 2023 and to ensure all future football creditors or HMRC debts were cleared on time during the 2023–24 season. A breach of these conditions would result in an immediate and automatic 10 points deduction.

Southend started the season with a matchday squad of just 15 players due to the club&#x27;s transfer embargo. The future of the club&#x27;s academy was also in doubt as it was no longer eligible for EFL funding.

==== Points deduction ====
On 23 August 2023, the winding-up hearing was adjourned for a third and final time, to 4 October 2023, with Judge Sebastian Prentis telling Martin if he was in charge of any other business it would have been wound up. Martin told the court he was &quot;confident&quot; a sale to an Australian buyer—later named as Justin Rees—should be finalised by the end of September. The judge said the club would be wound up if the deadline was missed. As part of the HMRC debt remained outstanding, the club were deducted 10 points by the National League.

Due to injuries and suspensions, the club were left with just 10 available players ahead of a match against Maidenhead United on 19 September, with manager Kevin Maher appealing against the red cards and talking to the National League about bolstering his squad. The club signed former West Ham goalkeeper David Martin to make his immediate debut, with Portuguese midfielder Mauro Vilhete one of just two substitutes, as Southend won 2–0.

On 20 September 2023, the Justin Rees consortium said that two bids to Ron Martin had been rejected. Few details of the latest bid were released, but—due to &quot;the non-viability of a new stadium at Fossetts Farm&quot;—it involved retaining and upgrading Roots Hall as the club&#x27;s stadium, taking ownership of the stadium and the club&#x27;s training ground, and Martin contributing funds towards Roots Hall&#x27;s redevelopment. Meanwhile, fans staged an anti-Martin protest march to Roots Hall ahead of the club&#x27;s league tie against AFC Fylde on 23 September 2023.

====Sale to Justin Rees consortium====

On 3 October 2023, the sale of the club to the Justin Rees consortium was agreed, but formal completion was repeatedly delayed. The club was to remain at Roots Hall, with the 500 homes once planned for the site now transferred to Fossetts Farm. The deal was announced the day before the High Court hearing of HMRC&#x27;s winding-up petition, amid reports that the HMRC debt had now been paid, and the winding-up petition was duly dismissed. On 5 December, the consortium said due diligence had raised issues which would take time to resolve. On 23 December 2023, Martin and the Rees consortium exchanged contracts for the sale of the club; the deal remained conditional upon Southend Council&#x27;s approval of property transactions. On 8 March 2024, Southend CEO Tom Lawrence said final completion of the takeover was a couple of months away, being dependent upon a council review of the Fossets Farm plans. As a result, one impatient creditor, Stewarts Law, petitioned for the club to be wound up (the club&#x27;s 19th such petition); the High Court hearing was subsequently adjourned. On 6 April, Ron Martin said he expected to have sold the club by mid-May 2024. This proved to be optimistic.

After 15 months, Southend&#x27;s transfer embargo was lifted on 28 December 2023. Southend finished the 2023–24 National League season in 9th place. Without the 10-point deduction they would have finished sixth.

At the club&#x27;s winding-up petition hearing on 15 May, the consortium and Martin sought a six-week adjournment, supported by Stewarts Law and two other creditors. The club was given six weeks to settle with creditors or face liquidation. As a consequence of the unresolved winding-up order, Southend was placed under a fresh transfer embargo on 17 May 2024.

On 7 June 2024, the consortium (&quot;Custodians of Southend United&quot;, COSU) said the club could go out of business as a property element of the contract might not be signed before the 26 June winding-up hearing. Southend Council&#x27;s new leader Daniel Cowan blamed the previous administration for assurances that &quot;fell outside of normal practice and were simply not achievable&quot;. On 14 June 2024, Cowan confirmed the proposed Fossetts Farm development had failed the council&#x27;s due diligence process. The developer (Citizen Housing) and the Martins were given until 21 June 2024 to respond to new council proposals, with future council involvement dependent on COSU acquiring the club. Adding to the pressure, on 24 June 2024, the National League ordered Southend United to provide a £1m bond due to ongoing financial uncertainty. The bond would remain in place until the COSU takeover was successfully concluded. COSU criticised the move, saying the National League was &quot;only making the situation more difficult to resolve&quot;. Southend successfully appealed to an FA-appointed arbitration panel, and the bond requirement was later withdrawn.

The day before the winding-up hearing, Stewarts Law reached a settlement with Southend United. On 26 June 2024, a payment plan was agreed with a second creditor (PG Site Services, owed £350,000) and the winding-up petition was dismissed in the High Court. On 2 July 2024, COSU was reported to have agreed terms with Ron Martin. On 19 July 2024, the COSU consortium completed its takeover of Southend United. Justin Rees became the new chairman, with day-to-day affairs managed by CEO Tom Lawrence. Despite the takeover, the club still expected to report a £2 million loss as money was reinvested in the club&#x27;s squad and facilities.

==Grounds==

The club has played its home games at five grounds: the original Roots Hall, the Kursaal, the Southend Stadium, the rented New Writtle Street Stadium (home of Chelmsford City) and again at Roots Hall.

Roots Hall was the first stadium that the club owned and was built on the site of their original home, albeit at a lower level. The site previous to Southend purchasing it in 1952 had been used as a sand quarry, by the council as a landfill site and by the local gas board (which was convinced to move to Progress Road). The stadium was built by Sid Broomfield and a small band of individuals at a cost of £73,997, supported by a small grant from the FA and funds raised by the Supporters Club. Following construction, the ground was donated to the club by the fans.

It took 10 years to fully complete the building of Roots Hall. The first game was played on 20 August 1955, a 3–1 Division Three (South) victory over Norwich City (attendance 12,190), but the ground was far from complete. The main East Stand had barely been fitted and ran along only 50 yards of the touchline, and only a few steps of terracing encircled the ground, with the North, West and the huge South Bank still largely unconcreted. The North Stand had a single-barrelled roof which ran only the breadth of the penalty area, and the West Bank was covered at its rear only by a similar structure.

Although the ground was unfinished, during the inaugural season this was the least of the club&#x27;s worries, for the pitch at Roots Hall showed the consequences of having been laid on top of thousands of tonnes of compacted rubbish. Drainage was a problem, and the wet winter turned the ground into a quagmire. The pitch was completely re-laid in the summer of 1956 and a proper drainage system, which is still in place, was constructed, and the West Bank roof was extended to reach the touchline, creating a unique double-barrelled structure.

The terracing was completed soon after, but the task of completely terracing all 72 steps of the South Bank was not completed until 1964. The North Bank roof was extended in the early 1960s, and the East Stand was extended to run the full length of the pitch in 1966. Floodlights were also installed during this period. Roots Hall was designed to hold 35,000 spectators, with over 15,000 on the South Bank alone, but the highest recorded attendance at the ground is 31,090 for an FA Cup third round tie with Liverpool in January 1979.

Until 1988 Roots Hall was still the newest ground in the Football League, but then the ground saw a significant change. United had hit bad times in the mid-1980s and new chairman Vic Jobson sold virtually all of the South Bank for development, leaving just a tiny block of 15 steps. In 1994, seats were installed onto the original terracing, and a second tier was added. The West Bank had already become seated in 1992 upon United&#x27;s elevation to Division Two while the East Stand paddock also received a new seating deck, bolted and elevated from the terracing below. In 1995 the Gilbert &amp; Rose West Stand roof was extended to meet up with the North and South Stands, with seating installed in each corner, thus giving the Roots Hall its current form, with a capacity of just under 12,500.

On 24 January 2007, Southend Borough Council unanimously agreed to give planning permission for a new 22,000-seater stadium at the proposed Fossetts Farm site, with Rochford District Council following suit 24 hours later. The application was subsequently submitted to Ruth Kelly, then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for government approval. However, the application was &quot;called in&quot; at the beginning of April 2007. The inquiry began in September 2007, followed in October 2007 by a &quot;final&quot; inquiry, when chairman Ron Martin called for supporters to show in numbers at Southend&#x27;s local government headquarters. On 6 March 2008, permission to develop Fossetts Farm was given by the government. However, it took a further 12 years before firm plans emerged for the development; in April 2020, a deal was agreed between Southend United, the borough council and social housing provider Citizen Housing. Plans were approved in October 2021, subject to Government approval anticipated in early 2022; the 22,000-capacity stadium would incorporate a 107-bed hotel and high-rise residential blocks of 182 homes on two corners.

In September 2022, after the club had been unable to get a hotel operator on board, plans to build a hotel at the proposed new stadium were dropped in favour of 42 additional homes, taking the total to 224 homes. A revised planning application also outlined plans to lower the stadium capacity to 16,226 seats. In February 2023, applications for the additional homes and smaller stadium were both still to be decided by Southend Council as information had not been provided by the club. Scaled-back plans for the ground were eventually submitted to the council in late March 2023.

In September 2023, the Justin Rees consortium buying the club highlighted &quot;the non-viability of a new stadium at Fossetts Farm&quot; and proposed Martin should develop Fossetts Farm without a new stadium requirement. Following agreement on the club&#x27;s sale to the consortium on 3 October 2023, the club was set to remain at Roots Hall, with the 500 homes once planned for the site now transferred to Fossetts Farm.

==Rivalries==
===Colchester United===
The club has an intense local rivalry with fellow Essex side Colchester United, which extends back many years.

However, at the end of the 1989–90 season, Southend&#x27;s promotion from the Football League Fourth Division coincided with Colchester&#x27;s fall from the Football League, so the clubs had to wait almost 15 years before meeting again in competition in 2004, when they contested the Southern Final of the Football League Trophy; the Shrimpers won 4–3 on aggregate, securing their first ever appearance in a national cup final. In the following season, the two clubs met again in an Essex derby match in the same competition, with Southend emerging as the victors once again after a penalty shootout.

The two clubs were promoted from League One at the end of the 2005–06 season, after a long battle for top spot was eventually won by Southend. The overall competitive head-to-head record for the rivalry stands at 34 wins for Southend, 30 wins for Colchester, and 17 draws. The most recent match, and the largest Essex derby victory, was on 10 November 2020, when Colchester beat Southend 6–1 at the Community Stadium in an EFL Trophy group stage match.

===Leyton Orient===
There is also a fierce rivalry between Southend and Leyton Orient, which arises from the time between 1998 and 2005, when the Essex club were Orient&#x27;s geographically closest league rivals. Although the games between the two teams are eagerly anticipated, and Southend are considered to be Orient&#x27;s main rivals, the Shrimpers see the London club as secondary rivals to Colchester United, for geographical and historical reasons.

The Shrimpers beat the O&#x27;s in the 2012–13 Football League Trophy Southern Area final. Southend won 1–0 at Brisbane Road in the first leg of the area final and drew 2–2 at Roots Hall in the second leg, winning 3–2 on aggregate, despite being in a lower division than Orient at the time, to book a place at Wembley in the final against Crewe Alexandra.

<text>Swansea City Association Football Club ( ; ) is a Welsh professional football club based in Swansea, Wales. Though based in Wales, they play in the English football league system and compete in the Championship, the second tier of English football. Swansea have played their home matches at the Swansea.com Stadium (formerly known as the Liberty Stadium) since 2005, having previously played at the Vetch Field since the club was founded.

The club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and entered into the Southern League, winning the Welsh Cup in their debut season. They were admitted into the Football League in 1920 and won the Third Division South title in 1924–25. They again won the Third Division South title in 1948–49, having been relegated two years previously. They fell into the Fourth Division after relegations in 1965 and 1967. The club changed their name to Swansea City in 1969 to reflect Swansea&#x27;s new status as a city. They were promoted at the end of the 1969–70 season.

Swansea won three promotions in four seasons to reach the First Division in 1981. They finished sixth the following season, a club record. The club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Fourth Division by 1986 and then narrowly avoiding relegation to the Conference in 2003. In 2011, they were promoted to the Premier League and won the League Cup two years later, beating Bradford City 5–0 in the final. It was the competition&#x27;s highest ever winning margin for the final, with Swansea winning the first major trophy in the club&#x27;s history and qualifying for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. The club was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2017–18 season.

The club&#x27;s climb from the fourth division of English football to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, &quot;Jack to a King – The Swansea Story&quot;. The Swansea City Supporters Trust continues to own shares in the club; their involvement was hailed by Supporters Direct in 2012 as &quot;the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters&#x27; trust in the direct running of a club&quot;..

==History==
:

===Early years (1912–1945)===
The area around Swansea traditionally had been a rugby area, and despite previous attempts by a football club named Swansea Villa, there were no notable football clubs until the establishment of &#x27;Swansea Town AFC&#x27; in the summer of 1912. Following the lead of many other South Wales sides, the club joined the Second Division of the Southern League for the following season. J. W. Thorpe was the club&#x27;s first chairman. A site owned by Swansea Gaslight Co., called Vetch Field due to the vegetables that grew there, was rented to be the club&#x27;s ground.

The club&#x27;s first professional match was a 1–1 draw at the Vetch Field against Cardiff City on 7 September 1912. During that first season the Welsh Cup was won for the first time. The Swans beat reigning English champions Blackburn Rovers 1–0 in the first round of the 1914–15 FA Cup, Swansea&#x27;s goal coming from Ben Beynon.

Following the First World War the Southern League dropped its Second Division, and with many clubs dropping out due to financial difficulties, the Swans were placed in the First Division. After four seasons in the Southern League, Swansea Town became founder members of the new Third Division of The Football League in 1920 and then Division Three (South) the following season.

After five seasons in Division Three (South) and a few failed bids for promotion, the Swans reached the Second Division for the first time in 1925, beating Exeter City 2–1 at home on the final day of the season to win the division. The side had remained unbeaten at home in the league all season – something the next promotion team would emulate over twenty years later. The following season the Swans reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time, beating Exeter City, Watford, Blackpool, Stoke City, Millwall and Arsenal, before losing 3–0 to eventual cup winners Bolton Wanderers at White Hart Lane. Swans record their highest average attendance during the season of 16,118 for pre-war league games. During the 1926–27 season they beat Real Madrid 3–0 on tour. During the 1931–32 season they finished 1st in the league and won the Welsh Cup after beating Wrexham 2–0 away after a replay.

===Post-war (1945–1965)===

After just one season back from wartime football, the Swans finished 21st in the Second Division, and thus returned to Division Three (South) for the first time since 1925. The following season was one of consolidation, however in 1948–1949 the Swans stormed their way to winning the division for the second time. Only one point was dropped at home all season as the feat of the 1925 promotion side was emulated, with the side finishing a whole seven points ahead of second placed Reading. Billy McCandless was the manager who led the side to promotion, and in doing so he completed a rare hat-trick of winning the Third Division (South) title with all three South Wales clubs – and without losing a home game with Swansea or Cardiff.

Following promotion, the Swans had another 15 years of Second Division football to look forward to, however despite what successive managers and chairmen were to say, Swansea Town only once during that time looked like they could genuinely challenge for promotion. That came in the 1955–56 season, when a side containing the likes of Ivor Allchurch, Terry Medwin, Harry Griffiths and Tom Kiley led the table early in the season, before an injury to Kiley, referred to as the linchpin of the side, in mid-November led to a decline in form. He was never adequately replaced, but despite this and the sale of some of the club&#x27;s best players, the side remained in contention for promotion until the beginning of April. Following a 6–1 win over second placed Leicester City at the Vetch Field at the end of March the side was just two points behind second placed Liverpool with a game in hand – however subsequent results were not as encouraging, and they eventually slipped away to finish tenth.

The Swans finished tenth for the third consecutive season in 1956–57. This season saw the club finish with its highest ever rate of goals per game (90 in total). This figure included big victories against Blackburn Rovers (5–1) and Bristol City (5–0) but 90 goals were conceded at the other end, including a 7-3 drubbing at Fulham.

The 1957-58 season was one of struggle for the Swans and they spent much of the season in the relegation zone. Despite a 5-1 derby victory over Cardiff before Christmas, the Swans struggled to maintain any form. The departure of Cliff Jones to Tottenham in February compounded matters and it was only a dramatic revival towards the end of the season, including a famous 7-0 win over Derby County (a side they had lost 1-0 to only a day before) during Easter that kept the Swans in the division. That season, Swans conceded a record 99 goals in the league.

In 1964, the Swans reached a second FA Cup semi-final, beating Barrow, Sheffield United and Stoke City en route to a famous sixth round victory at Anfield. Few gave the Swans, struggling for their lives at the bottom of Division Two, any chance of causing an upset against the league leaders. But the Swans were 0–2 up at half-time thanks to Jimmy McLaughlin and Eddie Thomas. Liverpool turned up the pressure in the second half, pulling a goal back before being awarded a penalty nine minutes from time. Ronnie Moran had established an excellent record as a penalty taker, but tic reviv to beat the excellent Noel Dwyer on this occasion. Fellow second division side Preston North End awaited in the semi-final at Villa Park, but despite taking the lead through McLaughlin again, the Swans were to be denied by a second half penalty and a wonder goal from nearly 40 yards.

After flirting with relegation on a few occasions during the previous seasons, the Swans&#x27; luck finally ran out a season later in 1965, and they were back in the Third Division.

===A downward spiral (1965–1977)===
Following relegation, Trevor Morris, who had been manager since 1958, was sacked and Glyn Davies, a former Swansea player, was appointed in his place. Davies re-signed the 36-year-old Ivor Allchurch from Cardiff City, but despite winning the Welsh Cup, the season saw some of the club&#x27;s heaviest defeats, and the manager only lasted the season. Relegation to Division Four followed in 1967 and Ivor Allchurch retired. The 1967–68 season saw the record attendance of 32,796 at the Vetch Field for an FA Cup Fourth Round match against Arsenal.

A tragedy struck the club on 20 January 1969 when players Roy Evans and Brian Purcell were killed in a car crash on the way to a game.

In 1969, the club name was changed to Swansea City, and Roy Bentley&#x27;s side celebrated by securing promotion back to the Third Division. A record run of 19 matches unbeaten provided the foundations for a promotion challenge in 1971–72, but an awful run towards the end of the season resulted in a mid-table finish. A poor start the following season, combined with falling attendances, saw Bentley resign, and he was replaced by Harry Gregg. Gregg failed to stop the rot and the club was back in the Fourth Division for 1973–74 season.

A record low crowd of just 1,358 watched the Swans against Northampton Town, and the following season the Swans were forced to apply for re-election to the Football League after a last day defeat at Rochdale condemned them to a 21st-place finish. The application was a success, although by now former player Harry Griffiths had replaced Gregg as manager. Malcolm Struel also took over as chairman, having previously been on the board, and promised a return to former glories, stating that he would not sell the club&#x27;s best young talent as previous boards had done.

===Meteoric rise and equally rapid fall (1977–1986)===

Despite promising performances during the first half of the 1977–78 season, Harry Griffiths resigned as Swansea City&#x27;s manager in February 1978, doubting his own ability to take the club any further. The new manager was former Liverpool, Cardiff City and Wales striker John Toshack. On 1 March 1978, at 28 years old, Toshack became the youngest manager in the Football League, with Griffiths as his assistant. Thus began a remarkable climb from the Fourth Division to the top of the entire league. Despite relinquishing his role as manager before the end of the season, this was Griffiths&#x27; team, and the promotion from the Fourth Division was largely his doing. During this season, the Swans&#x27; record league win was achieved (8–0 against Hartlepool United). Before promotion was secured, however, Harry Griffiths died of a heart attack on 25 April 1978 before the home game against Scunthorpe United.

A further promotion was achieved next season and the club returned to the Second Division after an absence of 14 years, with Toshack himself coming off the bench to score the winning goal against Chesterfield and thus secure promotion.

After a season of consolidation, Swansea City again challenged for promotion and travelled to Preston North End on 2 May 1981 in the knowledge that victory would assure them a place in the First Division for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. A 3–1 win guaranteed a third promotion in four seasons and Swansea City joined the footballing elite. The goalscorers on that day at Deepdale were Tommy Craig, Leighton James and Jeremy Charles. The four-year rise from basement to top division is a record in English football, held jointly with Wimbledon F.C. Swansea also won the Welsh Cup that season, qualifying for Europe for the first time since the 1965–66 season.

The 1981–82 season began with the fixture computer handing Swansea a first-day home game against Leeds United, which the club promptly won 5–1 with a hat-trick by debutant Bob Latchford. Swansea had swept from the basement division to the top of the entire Football League in three years. Victories over Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur followed as the club topped the league on several further occasions. However, injuries to key players took their toll, and the lack of depth in the squad meant that the season ended in sixth-place finish.

Two consecutive relegations followed, and Toshack was sacked. By 1985, the club was battling for its very survival on two fronts. Whilst its creditors lined up a High Court hearing with the aim of liquidating the club, Swansea City had come to rely on a combination of old players and young professionals.

Wound up by court order in December 1985, Swansea City was saved by local businessman Doug Sharpe who took over the running of the club, although the change of ownership was not enough to prevent relegation to the Fourth Division in 1986. Eight years on from the first promotion under Toshack, the club was back where it had started.

===In place of strife (1986–1995)===
Swansea won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1988 – beating Rotherham United and Torquay United over two legs in the inaugural playoffs. They remained in the league&#x27;s third tier for the next eight seasons – the longest period of stability the club had seen since the 1940s. Under Terry Yorath and then Frank Burrows, the club managed to stay in the Second Division, reach the playoff semi-finals in 1993 and make their first Wembley Stadium appearance a year later.

Burrows guided the Swans to within 180 minutes of Wembley in 1993 – a run of five wins in the last six league matches (all at home) secured a playoff place, and with five minutes remaining of the first leg of the semi-final against West Bromwich Albion, the Swans were 2–0 up. Andy McFarlane scored an own goal when the ball rebounded off the crossbar then into the net off his knee, and two early goals in the second leg gave the Baggies the advantage, until midfielder Micky Mellon was sent off. Burrows brought on Colin West, but he was sent off minutes later, ending any hopes of a Wembley final.

Although the league campaign the following season did not live up the previous one, mainly due to the sale of key players, Burrows guided the Swans to Wembley for the first time in their history for the final of the Autoglass Trophy. Wins over Plymouth Argyle &amp; Exeter City in the group stage followed by triumphs over Exeter again, Port Vale, Leyton Orient and Wycombe Wanderers over two legs saw the Swans play Huddersfield Town in a final that finished 1–1. The Swans went on to win 3–1 on penalties.

In the following season, the club again reached the semi-finals of the Auto Windscreens Shield, eventually going out to Birmingham City, and an eventful FA Cup run saw them win at Middlesbrough in a third round replay, before going out to Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park.

The 1995–96 season ended with relegation back to the third division after eight years. The Swans were doing fine around Christmas time, but a complete collapse in the second half of the season, including a 7–0 FA Cup defeat at third division Fulham, 4–0 and 5–1 defeats at Blackpool and Oxford United respectively, led to relegation, despite the arrival of Jan Mølby.

===The difficult years return (1995–2001)===
Relegation in 1996 was accompanied by a club record of being managed by four men in the same season. Kevin Cullis was appointed as manager by a consortium wishing to buy the club. Cullis’ previous experience was with non-league club Cradley Town youth team. Alarmed at developments at the club, Sharpe invoked a contractual clause to cancel the deal and resumed control himself: Cullis was promptly sacked after just six days.

Cullis&#x27; successor was the Dane, Jan Mølby, a former Liverpool player taking his first steps in management. His appointment inevitably prompted comparison with the Toshack era which began nearly 20 years earlier. Despite relegation in 1996, the club reached the final of the 1997 Third Division promotion play-offs but lost to Northampton Town, whose goal came from a re-taken free kick by John Frain in the final minute. Mølby was sacked just weeks into the following season, with Swansea struggling near the foot of the league. After the initial optimism, the Liverpool connection had not caused history to repeat itself.

Alan Cork was appointed as manager, but was dismissed after leading the club to its lowest league finish for 23 years. John Hollins was appointed, and things soon started to improve. In 1999, the club reached the promotion playoffs, only to lose in extra time at Scunthorpe United. The season included a third round FA Cup victory over Premiership opponents West Ham United, whose team included Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Rio Ferdinand and John Hartson. Swansea thus became the first bottom division team to defeat a Premiership club in the FA Cup since the re-organisation of the league structure in 1992.

The club was promoted in 2000 as Division Three champions, following a championship decider on the final day of the season against second-placed Rotherham United. The side conceded just 32 goals during the 1999–2000 season, largely due to the form of excellent centre-back pairing Jason Smith and Matthew Bound, as well as keeper Roger Freestone. During the season the side set a record of nine consecutive league victories, and, during the same period, seven consecutive clean sheets. Striker Walter Boyd also set an unwanted record of being the fastest substitute ever sent off, when he was red-carded for striking a Darlington player seconds after being brought on and before play had resumed, therefore being officially recorded as zero seconds.

Promotion was secured courtesy of a 3–0 win over Exeter City at a packed Vetch Field. However, the following week&#x27;s 1–1 draw at Rotherham United, which confirmed Swansea as Division Three Champions, was overshadowed by the death of supporter Terry Coles, who was trampled to death by a police horse in narrow Millmoor Lane before the game.

The team were relegated in May 2001, just 12 months after promotion. Hollins had failed to strengthen the side at all during the summer, and despite a decent start, a 5–1 defeat at big-spending Reading in September led to a slide down the table, and the side won just eight games all season, and only Oxford United finished below them. Relegation seemed certain following a 5–3 defeat at fellow strugglers Luton Town, where Giovanni Savarese scored a hat-trick, however Hollins maintained that the side could stay up, even when 18 points were needed from the final six matches, and for two other teams to pick up no more points.

===Last years at Vetch Field and return to League One (2001–2005)===

In July 2001, following relegation back to Third Division, the club was sold to managing director Mike Lewis for £1. Lewis subsequently sold on his stake to a consortium of Australian businessmen behind the Brisbane Lions (An Australian Rules Football team that is based in Brisbane) football team, fronted by Tony Petty. Seven players were sacked and eight others saw their contracts terminated. During this period Hollins was sacked after a poor start to the season, and Colin Addison took over as manager. The turmoil led to the creation of the Swansea City supporters&#x27; trust, which sought to save the club and ultimately guarantee supporter representation on the club&#x27;s board.

The Petty group sold its stake in January 2002 after a bitter stand-off with the Mel Nurse consortium, which was supported by the majority of the club&#x27;s fans. Jim Moore and Mel Griffin, previously rescuers of Hull City, stepped into the breach and persuaded Petty to sell to them (as he had promised to bankrupt the club &amp; make it extinct rather than sell to Nurse). From there Moore became chairman for three weeks giving the &quot;Mel Nurse Consortium&quot; time to organize its finances. Having successfully reorganized the finances of Hull City, both Moore and Griffin were believers in clubs belonging in the hands of local people, and so believing Nurse&#x27;s group were best for The Swans, subsequently passed the club onto Nurses consortium for the fee of £1. Despite problems off the pitch, Addison&#x27;s side had managed a mid-table position, but he was dismissed in early March, and under Nick Cusack the club slumped to a 20th placed-finish. Cusack lasted just eight games into the following season, and was sacked after a 1–0 defeat at league debutants Boston United had put the Swans on the bottom of the Football League for the first time in their 91-year history. He was replaced by Brian Flynn. Swansea City avoided relegation to the Football Conference on the last day of the season, at the expense of Exeter City, a club then vice-chaired by Mike Lewis.

Brian Flynn&#x27;s side finished 2003–04 10th and reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 24 years, eventually losing 2–1 at Tranmere Rovers. Flynn was dismissed and replaced by Kenny Jackett. Jackett lost his first six matches in charge, ending any hope of a play-off place. The following season Jackett recruited a number of new defensive players and set a record of seven consecutive home clean sheets, all victories. The Swans&#x27; last season at the Vetch Field saw the club win promotion on the last day of the season, clinching a 3rd-placed finish with a 1–0 win away to Bury. Their last league game at their old ground was a 1–0 win over Shrewsbury Town, with the last game of any sort being a 2–1 win against Wrexham in the final of the 2005 FAW Premier Cup.

===Move to Liberty Stadium and return to top flight (2005–2011)===

The club moved to the new Liberty Stadium during the summer of 2005. The first competitive game was a 1–0 victory against Tranmere Rovers in August 2005. In their first season back in League One, Swansea, after beating Brentford in the semi-finals, lost on penalties to Barnsley in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. That same season, Swansea won the Football League Trophy for the first time since 1994, and the FAW Premier Cup for a second successive year.

In the following season Jackett resigned as manager in mid-season to be replaced by Roberto Martínez. Martínez&#x27;s arrival saw an improvement in form, but Swansea missed out on the play-offs again. The following season, an 18-game unbeaten run helped them to the League One title. The club amassed a total of 92 points over the course of the season, the highest ever by a Welsh club in the Football League. Five Swansea players were in the PFA Team of the Year, including the division&#x27;s 29-goal top scorer Jason Scotland. That same season Swansea lost on penalties to Milton Keynes Dons in the area final of the Football League Trophy.

Upon returning to the second tier of English football after 24 years Swansea City finished the 2008–09 season in eighth place, and missed out on the play-offs the following season by a single point. After 63 wins in 126 games for Swansea City, Martínez left for Wigan Athletic on 15 June 2009 with his tenure returning just 26 losses in that time. He was replaced by Portuguese Paulo Sousa. Sousa subsequently left Swansea to take charge at Leicester City on 5 July 2010, lasting just one year and 13 days in South Wales. However, just before the departure of Sousa, on 15 May 2010, Swansea player Besian Idrizaj suffered a heart attack in his native Austria while on international duty. The club retired the number 40 shirt in his memory, and the players wore shirts dedicated to Idrizaj after their victory in the play-off final.

Northern Irishman Brendan Rodgers took charge for the 2010–11 season. He guided the club to a third-placed finish and qualification for the Championship play-offs. After beating Nottingham Forest 3–1 on aggregate in the semi-final they defeated Reading 4–2 in the final at Wembley Stadium, with Scott Sinclair scoring a hat-trick.

===Premier League and Europe (2011–2018)===
By being promoted to the Premier League for the 2011–12 season, Swansea became the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992. Swansea signed Danny Graham from Watford for a then-record fee of £3.5 million. They defeated Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, the eventual champions, at home during the season. Swansea finished their debut Premier League season in 11th, but at the end of the season Brendan Rodgers left to manage Liverpool. He was replaced by Michael Laudrup for the 2012–13 Premier League season, which was the club&#x27;s centenary season. Laudrup&#x27;s first league game ended in a 0–5 victory over Queens Park Rangers away at Loftus Road. Swansea then beat West Ham United 3–0 at the Liberty Stadium, with Michu scoring his third goal in two games. This saw Swansea top of the Premier League; it was the first time since October 1981 the team had been at the summit of the top tier.

On 15 October 2012, the club announced a profit of £14.2 million after their first season in the Premier League. On 1 December, Swansea picked up a 0–2 away win against Arsenal, with Michu scoring twice during the last minutes of the game, in Swansea&#x27;s first win at Arsenal in three decades. Michu ended the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer in all competitions, with 22 goals.

On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat Bradford City 0–5 in the League Cup final en route to the biggest win in the final of the competition. This triumph, in a record victory, was Swansea&#x27;s first major piece of silverware and qualified them for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. Swansea finished the season in ninth place in the Premier League, improving upon the league standing achieved in the previous season. On 11 July, Swansea paid a club record transfer fee of £12 million to secure the signing of striker Wilfried Bony from Vitesse Arnhem; Bony was the leading goalscorer in the 2012–13 Eredivisie with 31 goals and was named Dutch Player of the Year.

Swansea enjoyed initial success in Europe, beating Spanish side Valencia 3–0 at the Mestalla Stadium in September 2013. On 3 November 2013, Swansea lost the first Welsh derby in the Premier League to Cardiff City following a 1–0 defeat. In February 2014, Laudrup was dismissed from the club, initially thought because of a poor run of form; however later investigation revealed financial impropriety involving Laudrup&#x27;s agent Bayram Tutumlu. Defender Garry Monk, a Swansea player since 2004, was named as his replacement. In Monk&#x27;s first game in charge, Swansea beat Cardiff 3–0 at the Liberty Stadium on 8 February 2014. Despite holding Rafael Benítez&#x27;s Napoli to a 0–0 draw in the first leg of the Europa League Round of 32, Swansea exited the competition after losing 3–1 in the second leg at the Stadio San Paolo on 27 February 2014.

In January 2015, Wilfried Bony was sold to Manchester City for a record sale of £25 million, with add-ons reportedly leading to £28 million. This deal eclipsed the record fee received from Liverpool for Joe Allen at £15 million. At the time of the sale, Bony was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 34 goals in all competitions, and the Premier League&#x27;s top scorer for the 2014 calendar year, with 20 goals. Swansea City finished eighth in the Premier League at the end of the 2014–15 season with 56 points, their highest position and points haul for a Premier League season, and second highest finish in the top flight of all time. During the season, they produced league doubles over Arsenal and Manchester United, becoming only the third team in Premier League history to achieve that feat.

On 9 December 2015, manager Garry Monk was sacked after one win in eleven matches. The club, after a period with Alan Curtis as caretaker manager for the third time, chose the Italian former Udinese Calcio coach Francesco Guidolin. During the 2016–17 preseason, Swansea City came under new ownership by an American consortium led by Jason Levien and Steven Kaplan, who bought a controlling interest in the club in July 2016. Chairman Huw Jenkins remained at the club. On 3 October 2016, Guidolin was sacked and replaced by American coach Bob Bradley. The selection of Bradley marked the first time a Premier League club had ever hired an American manager. Bradley himself was sacked after just 85 days in charge; he won only two of his 11 games, conceded 29 goals, and left with a win percentage of just 18.1%.

On 3 January 2017, Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement agreed to take charge of the team, replacing Bradley. During the remainder of the 2016–17 season, Clement led Swansea to win 26 points from 18 games, securing their survival on 14 May. Only three prior teams had climbed from bottom of the table at Christmas to escape relegation, and only one prior team was able to escape relegation while having three managers during a season.

A poor first half of the 2017–18 season saw Swansea sitting bottom of the table after 18 league games, which led to Clement being sacked on 20 December 2017, leaving the club four points adrift of safety. Towards the end of his tenure, Clement was criticised by a section of Swansea supporters for playing &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; football, questioning his tactical decisions with the Swans being the lowest scorers in the Premier League at the time of his sacking. He was replaced by Portuguese manager Carlos Carvalhal. Despite consecutive league home wins against Liverpool (1–0), Arsenal (3–1), Burnley (1–0), and West Ham (4–1), Swansea were winless in their last nine league games (losing five) under Carvalhal, leaving them in 18th place on the final day of the season. Swansea City were relegated on 13 May 2018, following a 2–1 defeat to already-relegated Stoke City.

During the season, chairman Huw Jenkins and the club&#x27;s American owners were criticised by Swansea fans and pundits for poor transfer windows and the firing of managers; Alan Shearer blamed the Swansea board for moving away from the style of play found under previous managers Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martínez.

===Return to the Championship (2018–present)===
On 11 June 2018, Graham Potter was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager, replacing Carvalhal. On 2 February 2019, Huw Jenkins resigned as chairman amid increasing criticism over the club&#x27;s sale to the American consortium in 2016 and the club&#x27;s subsequent relegation from the Premier League. He was replaced with Trevor Birch. The first season back in the Championship produced a 10th-place finish, including a quarter-final appearance in the FA Cup. However, Potter left at the end of the season to manage Premier League club Brighton. He was succeeded by former England U17 manager Steve Cooper. In September 2019, Cooper was named EFL Championship Manager of the Month, with Swansea City sitting top of the table after an unbeaten first month; this was Swansea&#x27;s best start to a season in 41 years. On the final day of the season, Swansea beat Reading 4–1 to finish sixth, moving into the play-offs ahead of Nottingham Forest on goal difference, but were later defeated by Brentford in the semi-final second leg.

At the end of the 2020–21 season, Swansea finished 4th in the league and secured a play-off place for a second consecutive season. Swansea progressed to the 2021 EFL Championship play-off final after defeating Barnsley 2–1 on aggregate, but lost to Brentford at Wembley Stadium. After Steve Cooper left the club, Russell Martin became head coach in 2021, leading the club to mid-table finishes before moving to Southampton in 2023. The 2023–24 season saw new manager Michael Duff dismissed after five months due to poor results and criticism of his tactics; his replacement Luke Williams guided the team to 14th place. Luke Williams was sacked in February 2025 and Alan Sheehan was named caretaker manager.

==Stadium==
Before Swansea Town was established, children would play football on waste ground in which a plant, called &quot;vetch&quot; (a type of legume) was grown. The site was owned by Swansea Gaslight Company in 1912, but was deemed surplus to requirements at the Gas Company. So Swansea Town moved in when they were established in 1912. The ground originally held 12,000, but hit its peak attendance of 32,786 in a 1967 FA cup Fifth Round against Arsenal. The last league goal ever scored at the Vetch was scored by Adrian Forbes, on 30 April 2005, as Swansea beat Shrewsbury Town 1–0.

With a rapidly deteriorating Vetch Field, Swansea looked to relocate. As Swansea and the Ospreys did not have the capital to invest in a new stadium, the Swansea City Council and a developer-led consortia submitted a proposal for a sustainable &quot;bowl&quot; venue for 20,520 seats on a site to the west of the river on the site of the Morfa Stadium, which the Council owned. It was funded by a 355,000 ft retail park on land to the east of the river. The final value of the development being in excess of £50 million. On 23 July 2005, The Liberty Stadium was officially opened as Swansea faced Fulham in a friendly game.
The Liberty Stadium capacity was 20,532 though has been increased to 21,088. The highest attendance recorded at the stadium came against Arsenal on 31 October 2015 with 20,937 spectators, beating the previous record of 20,845. The stadium has also hosted three Welsh international football matches; the first being a 0–0 draw with Bulgaria in 2006, the second a 2–1 defeat to Georgia in 2008 and a 2–0 win over Switzerland on 7 October 2011. The first international goal to be scored at the Liberty Stadium was a 25-yard effort from Welsh international Jason Koumas.

On 1 July 2012, it was widely reported in national media that Swansea City were beginning the planning phase for expanding the Liberty Stadium by approximately 12,000 seats. This plan would be conditional on a successful second season in the Premier League and could cost up to £15 million; the increase would result in a capacity of approximately 32,000 seats. Later that same year, the board of directors announced that planning applications were to be put forward to the council authority, making the Liberty Stadium the largest sportsclub-owned stadium in Wales.

The Liberty Stadium was renamed the Swansea.com Stadium on 9 August 2021, following a 10-year naming rights agreement.

==Rivalries==
Swansea City&#x27;s main rivals are Cardiff City, with the rivalry described as among the most hostile in British football. Matches between these two clubs are known as the South Wales derbies and are usually one of the highlights of the season for both sets of supporters. It was only from the late 1960s that the rivalry became marked. Before then fans of the two clubs often had a degree of affection for their Welsh neighbouring team.

Swansea City&#x27;s other rivals are Newport County and to a lesser extent Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. However, Swansea very rarely meet Newport as they are currently separated by two divisions, while the two clubs share a mutual rivalry with Cardiff City.

Swansea have won 42 of the 115 competitive meetings, compared to Cardiff&#x27;s 45, who also have the biggest result between the two sides with Swansea losing 5–0 in 1965, with a further 28 drawn; neither team had done the double, until the 2021–22 season where Swansea had completed the first ever double in the 110 year rivalry, beating Cardiff 3-0 and 0–4 home and away. Following Swansea City&#x27;s promotion to the Championship, the clubs were drawn in the League Cup which would be the first meeting between both sides for nine years. Swansea City won the tie with a solitary goal from a deflected free-kick taken by Jordi Gómez. The match saw sets of supporters from both clubs clash with police after the match. The next two league games both finished in 2–2 draws. However, the derby game at Ninian Park was marred with controversy as referee Mike Dean was struck by a coin from a Cardiff City supporter.

In the 2009–10 season, Swansea beat Cardiff 3–2 at the Liberty Stadium in November, before losing 2–1 in Cardiff in April after a late Michael Chopra strike. With Swansea and Cardiff both pushing for promotion to the Premier League, the first derby at the new Cardiff City Stadium, and the first Cardiff win in nine meetings between the sides, was billed as being the biggest South Wales derby of all time, in respect to the league positions of the teams and how close it came to the end of the season. Despite their promising league positions leading up to the derby, neither side gained promotion at the end of that campaign, and so the South Wales derby was once again played out at Championship level during the 2010–11 season – Swansea beating Cardiff 1–0 away with a late winner from then on-loan Marvin Emnes before losing their home game due to a late strike from Craig Bellamy.

Following Swansea&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season, the South Wales derby was again put on hiatus. It would be two seasons before the sides met once more, this time on the worldwide stage of the Premier League. On 3 November 2013, Cardiff took the bragging rights in the first ever Premier League South Wales derby, enjoying a 1–0 win courtesy of ex-Swan Steven Caulker at the Cardiff City Stadium. The return fixture for that season took place on 8 February 2014 at Swansea&#x27;s Liberty Stadium, a match in which interim player-manager Garry Monk would make his managerial debut following the sacking of Michael Laudrup. The Swans took revenge for the defeat earlier in the season with a convincing 3–0 win.

The sides met again during the 2019–20 season in the EFL Championship; Swansea won 1–0 in the first fixture at the Liberty Stadium. In the 2020–21 season, Jamal Lowe scored a brace in a 2-0 Swansea win. In October 2021, Swansea won 3–0 against Cardiff. Later in the season, Swansea beat Cardiff 4–0 in the reverse fixture; Swansea became the first side to complete the league double in the derby&#x27;s 110-year history.

==Identity==
===Nicknames===
People from Swansea are nicknamed Jacks, a nickname also associated with the football club. According to Swansea University history professor Martin Johnes, Jack was a nickname for sailors, who would be described in other cities by their hometown, hence &quot;Swansea Jack&quot;. A famed local canine lifeguard in the 1930s was coincidentally named Swansea Jack, helping popularise the name further. Johnes said that the association of the Jack nickname with Swansea&#x27;s people and football club is evident from after World War II.

===Kits and crests===

Upon foundation in 1912, Swansea Town adopted white shirts and shorts due to Swansea RFC, a rugby union team. Secondary colours on the home kit have predominantly been black, with orange in the 1960s and red in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2012–13, the club celebrated their centenary with a gold-trimmed kit and a commemorative crest.

When new owners Silver Shield took over in 1998, they changed the club crest as the bird on it was not universally recognisable as a swan, and the background was blue, the colour of rivals Cardiff City. In 2021, to mark the 40th anniversary of the club&#x27;s first promotion to the top flight in 1981, Swansea City reintroduced the badge that had preceded the 1998 design. Though it was not used on kits until the 1990s, it was used on stationery and merchandise in the 1980s. The 1998 crest was reintroduced to kits in 2023.

===Managers===

There have been forty-four permanent managers (of whom six have been player-managers), and four caretaker managers of Swansea City since the appointment of the club&#x27;s first professional manager, Walter Whittaker in 1912. In the club&#x27;s first season, Whittaker led Swansea to their first Welsh Cup win. The club&#x27;s longest-serving manager, in terms of tenure, was Haydn Green, who held the position for eight years, four months and 14 days, spanning the entirety of World War II. Trevor Morris, who oversaw the most games at Swansea, was also the first manager to lead a Welsh club in Europe, qualifying for the 1961–62 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

John Toshack, Swansea City&#x27;s most successful manager with three league promotions and three Welsh Cup wins, led the club to their highest league finish, sixth place in the 1981–82 First Division. Appointed in February 1996, the Dane Jan Mølby became Swansea City&#x27;s first foreign manager and took Swansea to the 1996–97 Division Three play-off final, only to lose to a last-minute goal. In 2011, Swansea City achieved promotion to the Premier League under Brendan Rodgers, becoming the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992. During Swansea City&#x27;s centenary year (2012–13), the club won the League Cup for the first time under Michael Laudrup, the first major trophy in Swansea&#x27;s 100-year history.

==Records and statistics==

Wilfred Milne holds the record for Swansea appearances, having played 586 matches between 1920 and 1937, closely followed by Roger Freestone with 563 between 1991 and 2004. The player who has won the most international caps while at the club is Ashley Williams with 50 for Wales.

The goalscoring record is held by Ivor Allchurch, with 166 goals, scored between 1947 and 1958 and between 1965 and 1968. Cyril Pearce holds the records for the most goals scored in a season, in 1931–32, with 35 league goals in the Second Division and 40 goals in total.

The club&#x27;s widest victory margin was 12–0, a scoreline which they achieved once in the European Cup Winners Cup, against Sliema in 1982. They have lost by an eight-goal margin on two occasions, once in the FA Cup, beaten 0–8 by Liverpool in 1990 and once in the European Cup Winners Cup, beaten 0–8 by AS Monaco in 1991. Swansea&#x27;s 8–1 win against Notts County in the FA Cup in 2018 is their largest winning margin of the competition, and the largest winning margin at their home ground, the Liberty Stadium.

Swansea&#x27;s home attendance record was set at the fourth-round FA Cup tie against Arsenal on 17 February 1968, with 32,796 fans attending the Vetch Field. The club broke their transfer record to re-sign André Ayew from West Ham United in January 2018 for a fee of £18 million. The most expensive sale is Gylfi Sigurðsson who joined Everton in August 2017 for a fee believed to be £45 million.

==Honours==

Swansea City&#x27;s first trophy was the Welsh Cup, which they won as Swansea Town in 1913. Their first league honour came in 1925, when they won the 1924–25 Football League Third Division South title. Since then Swansea have gone on to win the League Cup once, the Football League Trophy twice and the Welsh Cup a further nine times. They have also qualified for UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup seven times and the UEFA Europa League once.

<text>York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system, as of the 2024–25 season.

Founded in 1922, the club played seven seasons in non-League football before joining the Football League. York played in the Third Division North and Fourth Division until 1959, when they were promoted for the first time. York achieved their best run in the FA Cup in 1954–55, when they met Newcastle United in the semi-final. They fluctuated between the Third and Fourth Divisions, before spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s. York first played at Wembley Stadium in 1993, when they won the Third Division play-off final. At the end of 2003–04, they lost their Football League status after being relegated from the Third Division. The 2011–12 FA Trophy was the first national knockout competition won by York, and they returned to the Football League that season before being relegated back into non-League football in 2016.

York are nicknamed the Minstermen, after York Minster, and the team traditionally play in red kits. They played at Fulfordgate from 1922 to 1932, when they moved to Bootham Crescent, their home for 88 years. This ground had been subject to numerous improvements over the years, but the club lost ownership of it when it was transferred to a holding company in 1999. York bought it back five years later, but the terms of the loan used to do so necessitated a move to a new ground. They moved into their current ground, the York Community Stadium, in 2021. York have had rivalries with numerous clubs, but their traditional rivals are Hull City and Scarborough. The club&#x27;s record appearance holder is Barry Jackson, who made 539 appearances, while their leading scorer is Norman Wilkinson, with 143 goals.

==History==
===1922–1946: Foundation and establishment in Football League===
The club was founded with the formation of the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited in May 1922 and subsequently gained admission to the Midland League. York ranked in 19th place in 1922–23 and 1923–24, and entered the FA Cup for the first time in the latter. York played in the Midland League for seven seasons, achieving a highest finish of sixth, in 1924–25 and 1926–27. They surpassed the qualifying rounds of the FA Cup for the first time in 1926–27, when they were beaten 2–1 by Second Division club Grimsby Town in the second round. The club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League in May 1927, but this was unsuccessful as Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected. However, the club was successful two years later, being elected to the Football League in June 1929 to replace Ashington in the Third Division North.

York won 2–0 against Wigan Borough in their first match in the Football League, and finished 1929–30 sixth in the Third Division North. Three years later, York only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of 1932–33. In the 1937–38 FA Cup, they eliminated First Division teams West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough, and drew 0–0 at home to Huddersfield Town in the sixth round, before losing the replay 2–1 at Leeds Road. York had been challenging for promotion in 1937–38 before faltering in the closing weeks, and in the following season only avoided having to apply for re-election with victory in the penultimate match. They participated in the regional competitions organised by the Football League upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. York played in wartime competitions for seven seasons, and in 1942 won the Combined Counties Cup.

===1946–1981: FA Cup run, promotion and relegations===
Peacetime football resumed in 1946–47 and York finished the next three seasons in midtable. However, they were forced to apply for re-election for the first time after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50. York pursued promotion in 1952–53, before finishing fourth with 53 points, which were new club records in the Football League. The club&#x27;s longest cup run came when they reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, a campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. In the semi-final, York drew 1–1 with Newcastle United at Hillsborough, before being beaten 2–0 at Roker Park in the replay. This meant York had become the first third-tier club to play in an FA Cup semi-final replay. With a 13th-place finish in 1957–58, York became founder members of the Fourth Division, while the clubs finishing in the top half of the North and South sections formed the new Third Division.

York only missed out on the runners-up spot in 1958–59 on goal average, and were promoted for the first time in third place. However, they were relegated from the Third Division after just one season in 1959–60. York&#x27;s best run in the League Cup came in 1961–62, the competition&#x27;s second season, after reaching the fifth round. They were beaten 2–1 by divisional rivals Rochdale. York had to apply for re-election for the second time after finishing 22nd in 1963–64, but achieved a second promotion the next season, again in third place in the Fourth Division. York were again relegated after one season, finishing bottom of the Third Division in 1965–66. The club was forced to apply for re-election in three successive seasons, from 1966–67 to 1968–69, after finishing in the bottom four of the Fourth Division in each of those season. York&#x27;s record of earning promotion every six years was maintained in 1970–71, with a fourth-place finish in the Fourth Division.

York avoided relegation from the Third Division in 1971–72 and 1972–73, albeit only on goal average in both seasons. After these two seasons they hit form in 1973–74, when &quot;three up, three down&quot; was introduced to the top three divisions. After being among the leaders most of the season, York were promoted to the Second Division for the first time in third place. The club&#x27;s highest-ever league placing was achieved in mid October 1974 when York were fifth in the Second Division, and they finished 1974–75 in 15th place. York finished in 21st place the following season, and were relegated back to the Third Division. York dropped further still, being relegated in 1976–77 after finishing bottom of the Third Division. The 1977–78 season culminated in the club being forced to apply for re-election for the sixth time, after ranking third from bottom in the Fourth Division. Two midtable finishes followed before York made their seventh application for re-election, after they finished bottom of the Fourth Division in 1980–81.

===1981–2004: Further promotions and relegation from Football League===
In 1981–82, York endured a club-record run of 12 home matches without victory, but only missed out on promotion in 1982–83 due to their poor away form in the second half of the season. York won the Fourth Division championship with 101 points in 1983–84, becoming the first Football League team to achieve a three-figure points total in a season. In January 1985, York recorded a 1–0 home victory over First Division Arsenal in the fourth round of the 1984–85 FA Cup, courtesy of an 89th-minute penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They proceeded to draw 1–1 at home with European Cup holders Liverpool in February 1985, but lost 7–0 in the replay at Anfield; York&#x27;s record cup defeat. The teams met again in the following season&#x27;s FA Cup, and after another 1–1 home draw, Liverpool won 3–1 in the replay after extra time at Anfield. Their finish of seventh in the Third Division in 1985–86 marked the fifth consecutive season York had improved their end-of-season league ranking.

York only avoided relegation with a draw in the last match of 1986–87, but did go down the following season after finishing second from bottom in the Third Division. In 1992–93, York ended a five-year spell in the Third Division by gaining promotion to the Second Division via the play-offs. Crewe Alexandra were beaten in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, with a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory following a 1–1 extra time draw. York reached the Second Division play-offs at the first attempt, but lost 1–0 on aggregate to Stockport County in the semi-final. York recorded a 4–3 aggregate victory in the 1995–96 League Cup second round over the eventual Premier League and FA Cup double winners Manchester United. This included a 3–0 win in the first leg at Old Trafford against a strong United team that included some younger players, and a more experienced United team was unable to overcome the deficit in the second leg, York losing 3–1. They then beat Everton in the second round of the following season&#x27;s League Cup; they drew the first leg 1–1 at Goodison Park, but won the second leg 3–2 at home.

York were relegated from the Second Division in 1998–99, after dropping into 21st place on the last day of the season. In December 2001, long-serving chairman Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5 million, before announcing that the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration. The Supporters&#x27; Trust (ST) bought the club in March 2003 after an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax was accepted by the Inland Revenue. Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the £400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with Persimmon to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board. York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in 2003–04 and finished bottom of the Third Division. This meant the club was relegated to the Football Conference, ending 75 years of Football League membership.

===2004–present: Return to and relegation from Football League===
York only avoided relegation late into their first Conference National season in 2004–05, before reaching the play-off semi-final in 2006–07, when they were beaten 2–1 on aggregate by Morecambe. Having only escaped relegation towards the end of 2008–09, York participated in the 2009 FA Trophy final, and were defeated 2–0 by Stevenage Borough at Wembley Stadium. They reached the 2010 Conference Premier play-off final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten 3–1 by Oxford United. York won their first national knockout competition two years later, after they beat Newport County 2–0 in the 2012 FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium. A week later they earned promotion to League Two after they beat Luton Town 2–1 at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off final, marking the club&#x27;s return to the Football League after an eight-year absence.

York only secured survival from relegation late into 2012–13, their first season back in the Football League. They made the League Two play-offs the following season, and were beaten 1–0 on aggregate by Fleetwood Town in the semi-final. However, York were relegated to the National League four years after returning to the Football League, with a bottom-place finish in League Two in 2015–16. York were further relegated to the National League North for the first time in 2016–17; however, they ended the season with a 3–2 win over Macclesfield Town at Wembley Stadium in the 2017 FA Trophy final. The club was promoted back to the National League at the end of the 2021–22 season via the play-offs, with a 2–0 victory over Boston United in the final. The ST purchased JM Packaging&#x27;s 75% share of the club in July 2022 to regain its 100% shareholding, before transferring 51% of those shares to businessman Glen Henderson, who took over as chairman of the club.

==Club identity==
York are nicknamed &quot;the Minstermen&quot;, in reference to York Minster. It is believed to have been coined by a journalist who came to watch the team during a successful cup run, and was only first used officially in literature in 1972. Before this, York were known as &quot;the Robins&quot;, because of the team&#x27;s red shirts. They were billed &quot;the Happy Wanderers&quot;, after a popular song, at the time of their run in the 1954–55 FA Cup.

For most of the club&#x27;s history, York have worn red shirts. However, in the club&#x27;s first season, 1922–23, the kit comprised maroon shirts, white shorts and black socks were worn. Maroon and white striped shirts were worn for three years in the mid 1920s, before the maroon shirts returned. In 1933, York changed their maroon jerseys to chocolate and cream stripes, a reference to the city&#x27;s association with the confectionery industry. After four years they changed their colours to what were described as &quot;distinctive red shirts&quot;, with the official explanation that the striped jerseys clashed with opponents too often. York continued to don red shirts before a two-year spell of wearing all-white kits from 1967 to 1969.

York resumed wearing maroon shirts with white shorts in 1969. To mark their promotion to the Second Division in 1974, a bold white &quot;Y&quot; was added to the shirts, which became known as the &quot;Y-fronts&quot;. Red shirts returned in 1978, along with the introduction of navy blue shorts. In 2004, the club dropped navy from the kits and instead used plain red and white, until 2008 when a kit mostly of navy was introduced. For 2007–08, the club brought in a third kit, which comprised light blue shirts and socks, with maroon shorts. A kit with purple shirts was introduced for a one-off appearance in the 2009 FA Trophy final. Red shirts returned in 2010, and have been worn with red, navy blue, light blue and white shorts.

York adopted the city&#x27;s coat of arms as their crest upon the club&#x27;s formation, although it only featured on the shirts from 1950 to 1951. In 1959, a second crest was introduced, in the form of a shield that contained York Minster, the White Rose of York and a robin. This crest never appeared on the shirts, but from 1969 to 1973 they bore the letters &quot;YCFC&quot; running upwards from left to right, and from 1974 to 1978 the &quot;Y-fronts&quot; shirts included a stylised badge in which the &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;C&quot; were combined. The shirts bore a new crest in 1978, which depicted Bootham Bar, two heraldic lions and the club name in all-white, and in 1983 this was updated into a coloured version.

When Batchelor took over the club in 2002, the crest was replaced by one signifying the club&#x27;s new name of &quot;York City Soccer Club&quot; and held a chequered flag motif. After Batchelor&#x27;s one-year period at the club, the name reverted to &quot;York City Football Club&quot; and a new logo was introduced. It was selected following a supporters&#x27; vote held by the club, and the successful design was made by Michael Elgie. The badge features five lions, four of which are navy blue and are placed on a white Y-shaped background. The rest of the background is red with the fifth lion in white, placed between the top part of the &quot;Y&quot;.

==Grounds==
===Fulfordgate===


York&#x27;s first ground was Fulfordgate, which was located on Heslington Lane, Fulford in the south-east of York. With the ground not ready, York played their first two home matches at Mille Crux, Haxby Road, before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4–1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922. Fulfordgate was gradually improved; terracing replaced banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1,000 supporters, and a small seated stand was erected. By the time of York&#x27;s election to the Football League in 1929, the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17,000. However, attendances declined in York&#x27;s second and third Football League seasons, and the directors blamed this on the ground&#x27;s location. In April 1932, York&#x27;s shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club, on a 21-year lease. This site was located near the city centre, and had a significantly higher population living nearby than Fulfordgate.

===Bootham Crescent===


Bootham Crescent was renovated over the summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and terraces were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York&#x27;s 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York&#x27;s Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent&#x27;s early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over the quality of the pitch. In March 1938 the ground&#x27;s record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.

With the club&#x27;s finances in a strong position, York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End. The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955, and a year later a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. The ground was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United. The floodlights were updated and improved in 1980, and were officially switched on for a friendly with Grimsby Town. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981, and two years later new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents&#x27; lounge.

During the early 1980s, the rear of the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had appeared in the rear wall, and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees&#x27; changing room and physiotherapist&#x27;s treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new floodlights were installed, which were twice as powerful as the original floodlights.

In July 1999, York ceased ownership of Bootham Crescent when their real property assets were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings. Craig announced the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and under Batchelor York&#x27;s lease was replaced with one expiring in June 2003. In March 2003, York extended the lease to May 2004, and proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium under the ownership of the Supporters&#x27; Trust. The club instead bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, using a £2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF).

The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent in January 2005, as part of a sponsorship deal in which Nestlé made a donation to the club, although the ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. There had not been any major investment in the ground since the 1990s, and it faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions.

===York Community Stadium===


Per the terms of the FSIF loan, the club was required to have identified a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. York failed to formally identify a site by the end of 2007, and by March 2008 plans had ground to a halt. In May 2008, City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium, for use by York and the city&#x27;s rugby league club, York City Knights. In July 2010, the option of building an all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, on the site of Huntington Stadium, was chosen by the council. In August 2014, the council named GLL as the preferred bidder to deliver an 8,000 all-seater stadium, a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction started in December 2017, and after a number of delays, was completed in December 2020. The club officially moved into the stadium in January 2021, with the first match being a 3–1 defeat to AFC Fylde on 16 February, which was played behind closed doors because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. The stadium holds an all-seated capacity of 8,500.

==Supporters and rivalries==
The club has a number of domestic supporters&#x27; groups, including the East Riding Minstermen, Harrogate Minstermen, York Minstermen, York City South and the Supporters&#x27; Trust. The now-disbanded group Jorvik Reds, who were primarily inspired by the continental ultras movement, were known for staging pre-match displays. The York Nomad Society is the hooligan firm associated with the club.

For home matches, the club produces a 60-page official match programme, entitled &quot;The Citizen&quot;. York have been the subject of a number of independent supporters&#x27; fanzines, including &quot;Terrace Talk&quot;, &quot;In The City&quot;, &quot;New Frontiers&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ward&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, &quot;Ginner&#x27;s Left Foot&quot;, &quot;RaBTaT&quot; and &quot;Y Front&quot;. The club mascot is a lion named &quot;Yorkie the Lion&quot; and he is known for performing comic antics before matches. John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York, became the club patron for 2007–08, having become a regular spectator at home matches as a season ticket holder.

The 2003 Football Fans Census revealed that no other team&#x27;s supporters considered York to be among their club&#x27;s main rivals. Traditionally, York&#x27;s two main rivalries have been with Hull City and Scarborough. While York fans saw Hull as their main rival, this was not reciprocated by the East Yorkshire club, who saw Leeds United as their main rival. York also had a rivalry with Halifax Town and they were the team most local to York when the two played in the Conference. A rivalry with Luton Town developed during the club&#x27;s final years in the Conference as both clubs met regularly in crucial matches, accompanied by a series of incidents involving crowd trouble, contentious transfers, and complaints about the behaviour of directors.

==Records and statistics==


The record for the most appearances for York is held by Barry Jackson, who played 539 matches in all competitions. Jackson also holds the record for the most league appearances for the club, with 428. Norman Wilkinson is the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 143 goals in all competitions, which includes 127 in the league and 16 in the FA Cup. Six players, Keith Walwyn, Billy Fenton, Alf Patrick, Paul Aimson, Arthur Bottom and Tom Fenoughty, have also scored more than 100 goals for the club.

The first player to be capped at international level while playing for York was Eamon Dunphy, when he made his debut for the Republic of Ireland against Spain on 10 November 1965. The most capped player is Peter Scott, who earned seven caps for Northern Ireland while at the club. The first York player to score in an international match was Anthony Straker, who scored for Grenada against Haiti on 4 September 2015.

<text>Burton Albion Football Club is a professional association football club in the town of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England. The team competes in League One, the third level of the English football league system. The club moved its home ground in 2005 to the Pirelli Stadium from Eton Park. The club&#x27;s nickname, The Brewers, evokes the brewing heritage of Burton upon Trent.

Burton Albion were formed in 1950 and initially joined the Birmingham &amp; District League before switching to the Southern League eight years later. They were promoted from the Southern League Division One in 1965–66, 1971–72 and 1973–74 and were relegated from the Southern League Premier Division in 1970, 1973 and 1977. Burton spent 1979 to 1987 in the Northern Premier League, before reverting to the Southern League Premier Division. The club rejoined the Northern Premier League in 2001 and were promoted to the Conference as Northern Premier League champions in 2001–02. 

Nigel Clough spent seven seasons as the club&#x27;s player-manager in the Conference and then led them into the Football League as champions of the Conference in 2008–09. They lost the 2014 League Two play-off final, but went on to win the League Two title in 2014–15 and were promoted from League One in 2015–16. Burton spent two seasons in the Championship until relegation in 2018.

==History==

===1950–1998: early years===

Burton Albion were formed in 1950, and joined the Birmingham &amp; District League. They finished the 1953–54 season as runners-up, and in 1958–59 joined the Southern League North Western zone. In 1965–66, Burton missed out on the runners-up place on goal difference, but were still promoted to the Southern League Premier Division. They avoided relegation in 1968, due to Stevenage Town folding, but were relegated to Division One after an unsuccessful 1969–70 season. 

Burton missed out on promotion on goal average in 1970–71, but finished as runners-up the following season and were promoted back to the Premier Division. The next two seasons saw them relegated, and then promoted back to the Premier Division again. They stayed in the same division until being relegated once more at the end of 1976–77. League rearrangements saw Burton moved to the Northern Premier League, because of their location in the central Midlands, and then back to the Southern League in 1987–88, the season after losing in a replayed FA Trophy Final to Kidderminster Harriers.

===Into the new millennium===

In October 1998, Nigel Clough was appointed as player-manager and he led the club to two successive runners-up spots, in 1999–2000 and 2000–01. Burton were again moved to the Northern Premier League Premier Division in 2001–02, which they won by a margin of 15 points, scoring 106 goals in the process. The club were promoted to the Football Conference for the first time.
The club was brought to national attention when they were drawn at home against eleven-times winners Manchester United in the third round of the 2005–06 FA Cup. The Brewers held the Premier League team to a 0–0 draw at home, but lost the replay 5–0 in front of over 11,000 Burton fans, setting a record for number of away fans at Old Trafford.

===2009–present: Football League===

In January 2009, with Burton 13 points clear at the top of the table, Clough left the club to become the manager of Derby County, with Roy McFarland installed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Despite this managerial change, Burton went on to set a league record for the most consecutive wins, and in February 2009, when the team was 19 points clear at the top of the table, Conference sponsors Blue Square declared Burton the winners of the 2008–09 title in a public relations stunt, in which they paid out all bets. Following that announcement, the club saw their lead reduced week by week, but secured promotion to the Football League in the final game of the season, despite losing 2–1 away to Torquay United, when Cambridge United could only manage a goalless draw to Altrincham. At the end of the season Roy McFarland left the club and was replaced by Paul Peschisolido, with Gary Rowett acting as his assistant. 

Burton&#x27;s first win in the Football League was 5–2 against Morecambe at the Pirelli Stadium, and they finished 13th in their first campaign in the Football League. In their second season, Burton claimed a notable scalp in the FA Cup third round when they knocked out championship team Middlesbrough 2–1 at the Pirelli Stadium. In the league, Burton experienced a 17-game winless run and fell from fifth place on Boxing Day to 17th place at the end of the 2011–12 season, which led to the sacking of Peschisolido.

Gary Rowett was appointed as the new manager of Burton in May 2012. In his first full season in charge, he led Burton to a fourth-place finish and the play-offs, missing out on automatic promotion by two points. Burton lost their play-off semi-final 4–5 on aggregate to Bradford City despite winning the first leg 3–2 at Valley Parade. In the 2013–14 season, Burton finished sixth, reaching the play-off final in which they lost 1–0 against Fleetwood Town.

During the 2014–15 season, Rowett left to join Birmingham City, and was replaced by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Under Hasselbaink, the Brewers won League Two and were promoted to League One for the first time in their history. Hasselbaink left by mutual consent in December 2015 to join Queens Park Rangers as manager. Clough returned to Burton to replace him for his second spell as manager and led the club to a second-place finish in the league, earning promotion to the Football League Championship, another first for Burton.

The Brewers opened their first season in the championship with a 4–3 loss to local rivals Nottingham Forest. Burton went on a six-match streak without losing between 18 February and 18 March, beginning with a 2–1 win at home to ex-Premier League opponents Norwich City and culminating in a 3–5 defeat to Brentford and including a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest in the reverse fixture. Burton secured their championship status on 29 April 2017 after a 1–1 draw with Barnsley. Burton spent much of their second season in the championship in the relegation zone. three wins in the late stage of the season boosted their chances of survival, including a 2–1 win over relegation rivals Sunderland. However, following a 2–1 defeat to Preston North End on the final day of the season, Burton were relegated back to League One.

In 2018–19, in spite of being in mid-table in League One, they made the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, after wins over Shrewsbury Town, Aston Villa, Burnley, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough. Facing Manchester City, Burton lost the first leg 9–0 at the Etihad Stadium, eventually losing 10–0 on aggregate.

2019–20 saw Burton reach the fourth round of the EFL Cup, defeating Premier League club AFC Bournemouth before losing 3–1 at home to Leicester City. The final nine games of the season would be permanently suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Burton finishing the season in 12th place. The summer of 2020 saw significant change with Nigel Clough stepping down as manager, bringing to an end a 228-game long second spell at the club and surpassing 900 games in total with the Brewers. His successor, Jake Buxton, struggled to fill the void and was sacked on 29 December 2020 after winning just two of his 21 league matches, and with Burton sat six points from safety at the bottom of the League One table. The club would soon respond by announcing the return of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as manager. Tasked with securing survival, the new management team completed a remarkable turnaround, climbing out of the relegation zone by the start of March and finishing 16th, 10 points above the bottom four. The turnaround included a club-record run of six consecutive EFL victories.

After a disastrous start to 2022–23, Hasselbaink resigned as Burton Albion manager. Dino Maamria took over the reigns of a club that had just one point after seven matches, successfully guiding the club to survival in 15th place.

Dino Maamria&#x27;s tenure as manager would end in December 2023, and was succeeded by Martin Paterson. The Brewers ultimately avoided relegation on the final day of the season, however, Paterson would depart the club at the end of the season. with first team coaches Gary Mills and John Dreyer also departing the same day.

In June 2024, Chairman Ben Robinson sold the entire majority stake in the football club to the Nordic Football Group (NFG). NFG&#x27;s acquisition of Burton Albion includes a large group of investors from the Nordic countries. The following day, NFG made their first appointment, announcing the arrival of Chelsea U21 head coach Mark Robinson. After a poor start of 11 league games without a win, Robinson was sacked and replaced with interim boss Tom Hounsell, who picked up the clubs first league win of the season at the 14th attempt and after 3 months of trying 

==Stadium==
Albion began life at the Lloyds Foundry ground on Wellington Street, but high attendances meant that the club quickly searched for a more suitable home. Eton Park was built off Derby Road and officially opened on 20 September 1958, coinciding with the club&#x27;s promotion to the Southern League. Until its demolition in 2005, the Brewers played all their home games at Eton Park.

The Pirelli Stadium on Princess Way was built in 2005 and is the current home of the Brewers, replacing Eton Park, also on the same road, which was demolished and developed into housing. The ground cost £7.2 million to build, and was built on the former site of the Pirelli UK Tyres Ltd Sports &amp; Social Club. The land was donated to the club by Pirelli in return for naming rights.

The ground was designed by architect Jon Hawkeye, and has served as the inspiration for numerous newer grounds, including Morecambe&#x27;s Globe Arena and the proposed Hayes &amp; Yeading stadium. It gained its most recent safety certificate from Staffordshire County Council on 12 July 2010, having been subject to crowd trouble on 8 May 2010 at the hands of Grimsby Town fans following their relegation from Football League Two.

The Pirelli Stadium has seen minor capacity changes since its construction, and the current capacity is 6,912, with 2,034 being seated in the South (Main) Stand. The current record attendance for the stadium stands at 6,746 for an EFL Championship match against Derby County on 26 August 2016. Previous records include 6,192 for a Conference National 1–0 defeat against Oxford United, during the club&#x27;s title-winning season, and 6,191 for an FA Cup third-round match on 8 January 2006 against Manchester United.

The stadium also hosts the National ISFA Under-13 tournament final.

==Rivalries==

In their non-League days the Brewers&#x27; local rivals were Gresley Rovers, Nuneaton Borough, Stafford Rangers and Tamworth. However, since the club&#x27;s rise to the Football League these rivalries have become less intense.

Following promotion to the Football League, local rivalries with Port Vale, Notts County, Chesterfield and Walsall have arisen. Except for Notts County, all these clubs had been rivals to Albion&#x27;s predecessor club, Burton United, in the early 1900s. There is also a largely friendly rivalry with near neighbours Derby County, partly because of the shared fanbase, but particularly following the transfer of manager Nigel Clough to the championship club in 2009 and the arrival of several ex-Derby players during the Paul Peschisolido era.

Their 2016 promotion into the championship resulted in matches with local big clubs Aston Villa, Birmingham City, Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

<text>Barnet Football Club () is a professional association football club based in London Borough of Harrow, North West London. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system. The club was founded in Chipping Barnet in 1888. From 1907 until 2013 they played their home matches at Underhill Stadium, then moved to the new Hive Stadium, which is named based on the club&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Bees&quot;. 

Barnet became founder members of the North London League in 1892 and had success at a local level before ceasing to exist in 1902. Two other clubs, Barnet Avenue and Alston Works, merged and entered the Athenian League as Barnet and Alston in 1912, becoming simply Barnet F.C. seven years later. Barnet spent 53 years in the Athenian League, winning seven league titles and one FA Amateur Cup title, before turning semi-professional as they entered the Southern League in 1965. Crowned Division One champions in 1965–66, they went on to win the Southern League Cup in 1972 and the Division One South title in 1976–77. Barnet became founder members of the Alliance Premier League in 1979 and initially struggled, though finished as runners-up after the league was renamed the Conference in 1986–87.

Barnet were first promoted to the Football League in 1991 after manager Barry Fry led them to the Conference title in 1990–91. Promoted out of the Third Division in 1992–93, they spent just one season in the third tier before being relegated. They were relegated back to the Conference in 2001, but returned to the Football League four years later after winning the 2004–05 Conference National title. They then spent the next eight seasons in League Two before being relegated to the Conference once again in 2013. In 2015, they returned to the Football League for a third time, after winning the 2014–15 Conference Premier title. However, they survived for just three seasons in League Two before suffering another relegation in 2018.

==History==
&quot;For a complete list of seasons, see List of Barnet F.C. seasons&quot;

===Early years (1888–1901)===
Barnet FC were formed in 1888, having formerly been known as New Barnet FC (1885–88) and Woodville FC (1882–85). The club&#x27;s origins are from ex-scholars of Cowley College and Lyonsdown Collegiate School. They were known as &quot;The Hillmen&quot; and played in New Barnet before moving to Ravenscroft Park in Queens Road in 1889. Initially they played friendly games before becoming inaugural members of the North London League in 1892–93. They went on to have success in the North Middlesex League Division II (1894–95 runners-up), Division I (1895–96 runners-up) and the Premier Division (1896–97 champions). Promoted to the London League Division II, Barnet became champions in 1897–98 and spent the following seasons in London League Division I before ceasing to exist in the 1901–02 season.

===Barnet Avenue and Barnet Alston (1901–1919)===
Two local clubs, Barnet Avenue FC (formed 1890) and Alston Works AFC (formed 1901) continued to attract support. Barnet Avenue renamed themselves Barnet FC in 1904 and as staunch believers in the amateur game they shunned the London Football Association in favour of the Amateur Football Association, which they joined in 1907 after winning the Chiswick League. Avenue played their home games initially at Hadley Green before moving to Queens Road.

Alston Works AFC, later Barnet Alston FC, were formed in 1901, and became champions of the London League in 1906–07. Formed from workers at Alston Works, a dental manufacturers, they were known as &quot;The Dentals&quot;. Their club strip of amber and black is the basis of the current Barnet team strip. In 1907 they moved to the club&#x27;s current ground at Underhill, Barnet Lane. Their first match was a 1–0 win over Crystal Palace on 14 September 1907. After merging with the Avenue team in 1912 they spearheaded the new Athenian League as Barnet and Alston FC. After the First World War in 1919 they became the third instance of Barnet FC. This team continues today.

===Athenian League years (1912–1965)===
For over 50 years Barnet FC competed in the Athenian League. They were inaugural members in 1912–13 they were league champions no fewer than seven times between 1919 and 1965 before turning fully professional in 1965.

During the 1920s Barnet consolidated their amateur status in the Athenian League under team secretary Tom Goss. He arranged for junior players from Tottenham Hotspur to play for the club including Taffy O&#x27;Callaghan, Willie Evans and Bill Whatley, all of whom eventually became internationals, between them gaining 17 Welsh caps.

The 1930–31 season saw Barnet gain their first Athenian League Championship to be repeated again the following season. Included in the team at that time were George Hughes and Fred Garrett, full backs; Reg Wright (England), centre-half; and Arthur Morris, Jack Richardson and a Barnet and England legend Lester Finch in the forward line.

In the two seasons after World War II, Barnet won the FA Amateur Cup (beating Bishop Auckland 3–2), the Athenian League Championship twice, and the London Senior Cup. The side included five internationals in Ted Bunker, George Wheeler, Dennis Kelleher, Ron Phipps and Lester Finch. In the 1958–59 season, their young team coached by George Wheeler, reached the FA Amateur Cup final for the third time, but were beaten 3–2 by Crook Town.

In October 1946, the first live televised football match was broadcast by the BBC from Underhill. Twenty minutes of the game against Wealdstone were televised in the first half and thirty five minutes of the second half before it became too dark. In 1947, Barnet FC played Sing Tao Sports Club, winners of the Hong Kong Football League at Underhill. They were the first Chinese club to ever play in the United Kingdom. Barnet won 5–3.

===Non-League years (1965–1991)===
Barnet reached the third round proper of the FA Cup for the first time on 9 January 1965, meeting the previous season&#x27;s runner-up Preston North End at Underhill. 2–0 down inside the first 10 minutes, the second half saw Barnet, urged on by 10,500 spectators, level the score at 2–2, before a last minute own goal sent them out.

In 1965–66 Barnet turned semi-professional. Before the season commenced, manager Dexter Adams made two astute signings. He persuaded Les Eason, then 20 years of age, to join from Finchley and then acquired amateur international Barry King from Hitchin, who became the first player to sign professional forms for the club. The first game finished in Barnet&#x27;s favour, a 10–1 win over Hinckley Athletic. Les Eason went on to score 31 goals in his first season as the club became champions of the Southern League Division I.

Promoted to the Southern League Premier for 1966–67 the club ended up 5th but had reached the Southern League Cup final only to lose to Guildford City over two legs. In 1969–70 the FA Trophy was introduced and Barnet reached the semi-final before losing to Macclesfield Town 0–1 at Stoke City&#x27;s Victoria Ground. The club reached the third round of the FA Cup the following season, but lost 1–0 to Colchester United, who went on to knock out Leeds United in the fifth round. That year&#x27;s cup run included a 6–1 first round win over then Fourth Division Newport County, equalling the competition&#x27;s all-time record for a win by a non-league side over league opponents.

The 1971–72 season proved one of the most successful. Using just 15 players for 80 competitive matches Barnet reached Wembley in the FA Trophy, losing 3–0 to Stafford Rangers, and reached the final of the Southern League Cup, drawing 2–2 with Hereford on aggregate. The replay, played the next season, was a 2–2 draw but Barnet went on to win 7–6 on penalties. In 1972–73, Barnet put up a tremendous fight against Queens Park Rangers in the third round of the FA Cup. The match at Loftus Road ended 0–0 and the replay at Underhill drew in excess of 11,000 spectators. Rangers eventually won 3–0.

In 1975, Barnet were relegated back to the Southern League Division One North, after one season they switched to the Southern League Division One South which they won at the first attempt and returned to the Southern League Premier. It was during this period that many famous names played for the club including Jimmy Greaves, Marvin Hinton, Bob McNab, Terry Mancini and John Fairbrother. Jimmy Greaves, although playing in midfield, still ended the season as leading goal scorer with 27 goals.

By virtue of their Premier Division positions in seasons 1977–78 and 1978–79, Barnet were given a place in the newly formed Alliance Premier League. In the first three Alliance seasons, Barnet just avoided relegation, but in 1982–3 they finished 15th and a year later 9th. Then in 1984–85, when it looked like Barnet would face relegation, manager Barry Fry left to take charge at Maidstone United. The season was resurrected under the guidance of ex-player Roger Thompson, with the team losing only one of their remaining thirteen league games. They also managed to beat Wealdstone – fierce rivals at the time and about to win the non-league double – by seven goals to nil, thanks to a haul from Nicky Evans and a hat trick by Steve Mahoney.

In season 1985–86 they finished 14th but reached the final of the Bob Lord Challenge Trophy only to lose to old friends Stafford Rangers. Dom MacAllister replaced Roger Thompson and then in July 1986, Barry Fry returned, much to the delight of the supporters. He led Barnet to their best league position for many years finishing runners-up in the renamed Football Conference scoring 86 goals.

Despite turbulent times off the field, during season 1986–87 (the first season of automatic promotion to the Football League for Conference champions) the club maintained their scoring, again finishing runners-up, Scarborough taking the automatic position into the Fourth Division. Lincoln City came down but in 1987–88 they returned ahead of Barnet in the championship. 1988–89 was another indifferent season; at one time looking like relegation prospects, the team secured 8th place, in the process using no fewer than 47 players. They did however win the Clubcall Cup (League Cup), the final being played at Telford United&#x27;s Bucks Head Ground, by beating Hyde United on penalties after a 3–3 draw. 1989–90 saw Barnet yet again finish runners-up in the Conference. This time it was Darlington that took the top spot.

A good run in the 1990–91 FA Cup culminated in a home defeat by Portsmouth in the third round. A win in the last game of the season against Fisher Athletic finally saw Barnet promoted to the Fourth Division of the Football League.

===Football League (1991–2001)===
Barnet joined the Fourth Division of the Football League on winning the Football Conference championship in 1991. Their early reputation was of playing fast, attacking football, a reputation only enhanced by their first ever league match (which they lost 7–4 to Crewe Alexandra), and a 5–5 draw to Brentford in the League Cup in their next match. In their first season of league football, the club reached the promotion play-offs but lost to Blackpool in the semi-finals.

The 1992–93 season saw controversy at Underhill as Barnet chairman Stan Flashman regarding club accounts and players&#x27; wages, resulting in some nationwide back page headlines. Flashman also brought his son, Mark, to the club as a reserve goalkeeper. In spite of the financial problems, Barnet finished third in the new Division Three and secured the final automatic promotion spot. Manager Barry Fry, however, left Barnet with a handful of games remaining and was replaced by his assistant Edwin Stein, who himself then left to join Fry in the summer at Southend United. Goalkeeper Gary Phillips took over as manager during a difficult summer in which Barnet marginally survived a vote of expulsion by a Football League EGM, and lost the vast majority of their promotion winning side in a tribunal which nullified the players&#x27; contracts. Phillips cobbled together a squad from the few remaining players and free transfers. In January 1994 Phillips was assisted by former England goalkeeper Ray Clemence, but were still relegated from Division Two. In August 1994 Ray Clemence became sole manager for two seasons, finishing 11th and then ninth in Division Three. Then at the start of the 1996–97 season Ray Clemence left to become England goalkeeping coach, leaving Terry Bullivant in charge.

The following season saw Barnet slump to 15th place, their lowest Football League finish until that point, though Bullivant was still approached to take over as manager of Reading that summer; he accepted the job, and John Still replaced him as manager. The following four seasons saw the club yo-yo in form, as they finished 7th and reached the play-offs in 1997–98, hit a new low of 16th place in 1998–99, and then finished sixth and qualified for the play-offs once more in 1999–2000. 2000–01 initially looked to be another solid campaign, with Barnet among the leading pack from early on; in early November however, Still was &quot;kicked upstairs&quot; to become the club&#x27;s director of football and was succeeded by Tony Cottee, an ambitious high-profile appointment which aimed to take the club forward. Despite a 7–0 victory in his first match in charge vs Blackpool, the club ultimately won only five more games for the remainder of the season and finished in bottom place after failing to beat second-bottom Torquay United, returning to the Conference after exactly a decade. Still was reinstated as manager in the final stages of the season, but was ultimately unable to rescue the club.

===Life in the Conference (2001–2005)===
Still remained in charge for the club&#x27;s return to the Conference, and with a good first half of the season it looked as if their stay would be a short one. However, a terrible run of form after Christmas 2001 saw the side crash to mid-table and led to Still&#x27;s final departure from the club. He was replaced by Peter Shreeves, who only months before had been in charge of Division One side Sheffield Wednesday, and quickly turned Barnet&#x27;s form around. With only the Conference champions going up in this season the prospect of promotion was already long-gone by the time Shreeves was appointed, but the fifth-place finish that they ultimately managed would be good enough for the play-offs introduced for the following season. Unfortunately Barnet did not maintain their momentum into 2002–03, and Shreeves was sacked late in that season, with Barnet in very much the same mid-table position he had found them in. Martin Allen took over as manager and brought a turn-around in results, though it was again too late to mount a promotion challenge and they finished a distinctly underwhelming 11th. 2003–04 proved to be a much better campaign, and the club were challenging near the top of the table throughout the season, but Allen left to take over at fellow London club Brentford with only a couple of months of the campaign left.

Former Stevenage Borough manager Paul Fairclough replaced Allen for the remainder of the 2003–04 season. The club&#x27;s form stuttered, falling out of contention for automatic promotion and very nearly even the play-offs as well, but this time the club were able to rebound and secure a fourth-place finish, setting up a play-off semi final with the side directly above them, Shrewsbury Town. This was taken to penalties after a 2–2 aggregate score (Barnet won 2–1 at Underhill, Shrewsbury won 1–0 at Gay Meadow), with Shrewsbury winning 5–3 on penalties. The following season, 2004–05, with Fairclough at the helm, the Bees went one better than the previous season and were crowned Champions of the Conference Premier and regained their football league status, after amassing an impressive 86 points in the season, and scoring 90 goals with it. Barnet also finished 12 points ahead of their nearest rival, Hereford United. Giuliano Grazioli finished with 29 goals, and was also top scorer in the League.

===Return to the Football League (2005–2013)===

The 2005–06 season started with Barnet leading League Two after four games, but this form did not continue and the club finished the season five places and 5 points above the relegation zone, yet only 12 points out of the playoffs, with only 1 win in the first 12 games of 2006. In the League Cup the Bees drew a lucrative away tie against Manchester United in October 2005. 5,000 fans made the trip to Old Trafford to see Barnet lose 4–1, goalkeeper Ross Flitney being sent-off in the second minute. The 2006–07 season started poorly for Barnet, but a mid-season rally saw them finish the season in 14th place. A good run in the FA Cup also saw them reach the fourth round of that competition for the first time in their history, beating Championship side Colchester United 2–1 in the third round and Northampton Town 4–1 in the second round before losing 2–0 to Plymouth Argyle at home. 2007–08 saw another mid-table finish for Barnet; 12th with 60 points, and a second run to the Fourth round of the FA Cup, where they lost 1–0 to Bristol Rovers, with Jason Puncheon missing a penalty for the Bees.

The 2008–09 season started poorly, and by late September only the three teams that had been docked points prior to the start of the season had lower league positions. After a run of thirteen games without a win in any competition Paul Fairclough announced his resignation to take up a role as director and leaving the first team duties to his assistant Ian Hendon. Fairclough would take over one last game which resulted in a 2–0 win against another relegation threatened side AFC Bournemouth. Results improved, and before the end of the season Hendon was made permanent boss with a two-year contract. The Bees stayed in Football League Two for the following 2009–10 season, which started with four wins from their first six games. A poor run of form would follow, including a 13-game winless streak, and after five consecutive defeats left the Bees close to the relegation zone, Ian Hendon was sacked in April with two games of the season remaining. Paul Fairclough returned as caretaker manager for the last two games and guided the Bees to safety with a 1–0 win at home to Rochdale on the last day of the season.

On 1 June 2010, Mark Stimson was appointed as the new manager and after a poor start to the season was sacked on 1 January 2011. He was succeeded by the ever-present Paul Fairclough; however, he stepped down after only being able to secure three wins in 17 games. He was then succeeded by Martin Allen, who was asked to manage Barnet on a non-contract basis until the end of the season; however, after just 3 matches, he was offered a contract from Notts County and subsequently left for them. With just 5 games left of the season, assistant manager Giuliano Grazioli took over, having been appointed as Assistant manager by Martin Allen earlier. Grazioli was also able to bring in Lawrie Sanchez as an adviser. Grazioli took Barnet to the last day of the season 2 points behind Lincoln City in the relegation zone. Barnet were up against Port Vale in their final match on 7 May 2011 at Underhill and were able to win 1–0 following a penalty scored by Izale McLeod. Aldershot Town&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Lincoln City meant Barnet finished a point above Lincoln City and the relegation zone. Pitch invasions followed as the club survived on the last day of the season again, as the day was regarded as the &quot;great escape&quot;. Following the end of the season, Lawrie Sanchez was appointed as manager.

In the 2011–12 season, Lawrie Sanchez steered the side to 3rd from bottom with 3 games to go. He was replaced on 16 April by Martin Allen, who managed to keep Barnet up on the last day of the season following a 2–1 win over Burton Albion leaving Barnet two points above Hereford United and the relegation zone. This was the third consecutive year that Barnet had managed to secure their Football League survival on the last day.

Barnet&#x27;s 2012–13 season started disappointingly, without a single win in August or September. On 11 October 2012, Barnet confirmed a huge coup in signing the former Barcelona and Ajax midfielder Edgar Davids as player and joint head coach alongside Mark Robson. In October Barnet recorded their first win of the season with a 4–0 result against Northampton Town. Near the end of December, Barnet announced that Robson&#x27;s contract had been terminated, saying: &quot;It was felt that clarification was required regarding the coaching responsibilities at the club and to this end it was agreed that Mark should leave with immediate effect.&quot; This left Davids with sole responsibility for the club. The team were then relegated back to the Conference on 27 April 2013, after finishing on 51 points (the highest ever obtained by a team relegated from League 2) and going down due to an inferior goal difference to that of Dagenham and Redbridge, after a 2–0 loss to Northampton.

===Return to the Conference (2013–2015)===
Barnet started the 2013–14 season in the Conference Premier. On 18 January 2014, head coach Edgar Davids resigned from his role by mutual consent. On 19 March 2014, Martin Allen was appointed head coach on a contract running until the end of the 2014–15 season, marking the start of his fourth spell as manager. At the end of the season, Barnet finished top of the Conference Premier and were promoted to League Two.

===Second return to the Football League (2015–2018)===
In their first season back in the Football League, Martin Allen led the team to a 15th-place finish with a final end of season win away at Crawley Town with a finishing result of 3–0. On 1 December 2016 Allen resigned from his post at Barnet to take up the job at Eastleigh. Rossi Eames and Henry Newman were appointed joint interim head coach with Newman leaving three months later on 14 February 2017. This was followed by the appointment of Kevin Nugent who only lasted two months with one win in 11 games before being parting company with Barnet. This left Eames in the caretaker position of coach until the end of the season with Barnet finishing in 15th place two consecutive seasons. On 19 May 2017 he was then appointed permanent head coach setting a new record making Eames the youngest manager at the age of 32.

In November of the 2017–18 season saw Mark McGhee appointed as their new manager with Rossi Eames appointed head of player development. In January 2018 Barnet were sitting bottom of League Two and decided to move Mark McGhee to the Technical Director position and appoint Graham Westley first team coach. Into March and still sitting at the bottom of the table, Barnet decided to sack Graham Westley and reappoint Martin Allen for his fifth spell. It was also reported that Mark McGhee had left the club. Allen turned Barnet fortunes around with five wins out of the next eight matches leaving it to the last day of the season to determine their fate. Barnet won their final match against Chesterfield but with Morecambe drawing leaving both teams on the same number of points, but Barnet were subsequently relegated out of the league due to goal difference. It was confirmed on 10 May that Allen had, once again, left the club.

===National League (2018–present)===

Following the departure of Allen, Barnet re-appointed John Still as their manager for the 2018–19 National League season. On 28 December 2018, Still announced his retirement from management, two days after a 1–0 defeat to Boreham Wood, with the club 15th in the league. Assistant Manager Darren Currie took temporary charge before eventually taking the job on a permanent basis, leading the club to a 13th-placed finish. In the 2018–19 FA Cup, Barnet, despite their status as a fifth-tier team, managed to progress into the fourth round of the competition, winning against Bristol Rovers, Stockport County, and Sheffield United.

The 2020–21 season saw Barnet record their lowest league position for many years. They finished within the relegation zone of the National League, but were saved from dropping into the National League South due to the abandonment of the 2020–21 National League North and South mid-season (owing to the COVID-19 pandemic). The team&#x27;s 2020–21 performance was greatly hampered by the club being badly affected by the pandemic during the first half of the season, and the closure of the club&#x27;s EFL-funded football academy at the end of the previous season. In the 2022–23 season, they lost to Boreham Wood in the play-off quarter-finals after finishing 5th. The following season Barnet finished in second place to qualify for the play-offs again. In the semi-finals, they were defeated 4–0 by Solihull Moors at home.

==Stadiums==

===Underhill===
Barnet&#x27;s first stadium named Underhill was established in 1907 when the football club were named Barnet &amp; Alston. This was arranged on 100-year lease with Barnet Council. The first ever game at the ground was against another London club, namely Crystal Palace, which ended 1–0 to Barnet. Over the years notable matches at Underhill included a game in 1952 against Wycombe Wanderers which had the highest recorded attendance of 11,026 spectators.

The stadium&#x27;s capacity fluctuated over the years from all-standing to the addition of an all-seater mainstand in 1964 to a final capacity of 6,023.

With the lease ending in 2007 the Barnet chairman Tony Kleanthous extended the lease with the council for a further 5 years. But by December 2011 Kleanthous became increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress from the council to extend the original lease by another 125 years. With plans to build a new stadium on the site continually rejected Kleanthous started to look elsewhere to relocate Barnet, meaning the end of their stay at Underhill.

Barnet&#x27;s final game at Underhill came on 20 April 2013 against Wycombe Wanderers, which they won 1–0 in front of 6,000 spectators.

In July 2012 Harrow Council agreed the development of a new stadium called The Hive Stadium at the Prince Edward Playing Fields which the club can use for a period of up to 10 years. In February 2013, Barnet&#x27;s move to the new ground was ratified by The Football League.

===Hive Stadium===
On 1 August 2007, Barnet chairman Tony Kleanthous announced that he had acquired a site in Harrow. The deal would see Barnet contribute £6 million towards an £11 million development, which would include training facilities for Barnet&#x27;s first, reserve and ladies teams, as well as a 5,000 stadium for nearby Wealdstone. The plan also provides for a second, smaller &#x27;green&#x27; 1,000 capacity stadium, for ladies and youth football, as well as a centre of excellence and community use facilities.

After a quiet 10 months, an announcement was made on 23 May 2008, which confirmed the plans for the first phase of the development. Costing £3 million, the works included two full size FIFA approved 3rd Generation artificial pitches, senior and youth pitches, car and coach parking, changing facilities for 14 teams, as well as a reception and cafe area. The work would &#x27;provide some of the best training and community use facilities in the country&#x27; ending Barnet&#x27;s nomadic existence in search of areas in which to train. Work began in the Autumn of 2008, once the Football Foundation provided £1 million of funding. Harrow Borough Council also provided £750,000 towards the cost of the project.

Worryingly for Wealdstone supporters, the first phases of plans did not include any mention of providing the stadium initially proposed. Wealdstone made a statement after the first phase plans were announced, insisting that the intention still remains to play at PEPF, and that talks were ongoing, although any deal would have to be right for Wealdstone.

In April 2009, a delegation from the Barnet Football Club Supporters Association (BFCSA) visited the site and interviewed the man overseeing the construction and continued development, Paul Fairclough. A video made during the tour shows the work being carried out, throwing up some new, previously unknown information about the site, such as the construction of a swimming pool and Jacuzzi, and the fact that Highbury&#x27;s floodlights were currently being stored there! The interview was particularly revealing, indicating that the development is in the first of four planned stages (suggesting a stadium for Wealdstone is still a possibility), that there were hopes to have the England senior team hold training camps there, and that the proposed centre of excellence would cost £250,000 per year to run. There was also some indication of how Barnet could financially exploit the site, and attain a degree of self-sufficiency, as they were in the process of doing a deal with an organisation to rent out the astro turf pitches for £30,000 for one year. In addition, up to £180,000 per year is available to Football League clubs to run their youth systems. In May 2009, it was reported that Harrow Borough and Wealdstone are in negotiation with Barnet to use the training facilities. The training ground is known as &quot;The Hive&quot; and was opened by Fabio Capello and Trevor Brooking on 15 December 2009. Since then, major teams visiting London, such as then-Premier League club Hull City, Italian side Parma, French side AS Monaco and the Egyptian, Brazilian, Chilean and German National Squads, have made use of the training facilities.
===South Underhill===

In February 2024 Tony Kleanthous announced plans to move the club to a new ground built close to the old Underhill site. As of March 2024 Barnet Council have not granted planning permission.

==Club crest and nickname==

The club&#x27;s current crest was designed in the 1950s and contains the green hill of High Barnet and the red rose, white rose and crossed swords representing the 1471 Battle of Barnet, a pivotal battle in the Wars of the Roses. The badge was designed by Sidney Robert Price who was the chairman of the club at the time.

The club&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Bees&quot;, reflected in their amber and black shirts, is likely to have come from the location of apiaries close to the Underhill ground in the early years of the 20th century. Coincidentally, this nickname is similar to those of two of Barnet&#x27;s neighbours, Watford (&quot;The Hornets&quot;) and Brentford (also &quot;The Bees&quot;).

==Rivalries==
Traditionally, the club&#x27;s main local rivals were Enfield. The two clubs were amongst the biggest in Non-League during the 1980s and matches between them were fiercely contested. Enfield suffered numerous off-field problems and the original club has since ceased to exist and reformed as Enfield 1893 F.C. in 2007, suffering a split in the past in 2001 after the formation of the breakaway club Enfield Town. As such, the last clash with the original club was in 1991, in the FA Cup, a match which Barnet won 4–1.

Other local rivals include Stevenage, Wealdstone, Brentford and Boreham Wood. Barnet have also had a long-lasting friendly rivalry with their &quot;big neighbours&quot; Arsenal, with whom they regularly had pre-season friendlies for several seasons.

==American Academy of Microbiology==
The American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) is the honorific leadership group within the American Society of Microbiology, a professional organization for microbiologists. The academy is currently composed of over 2,600 Fellows.

The mission of the academy is to &quot;recognize outstanding contributions provided by microbiologists and to provide microbiological expertise to both the wider scientific community and the public.&quot; Activities of the academy include electing new members, convening colloquia, and managing the ASM Awards and Prize program. Academy leadership is divided into four groups: the Academy Governors, the Academy Leadership Nominating Subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Awards, and the Subcommittee on Elections.

=== Origins ===
The AAM was first proposed in 1956. The original organization was dissolved in 1970, when new bylaws were accepted.

=== Members ===
The AAM elects a new class each year. As of 2020, each year 65 new members are elected. That number has fluctuated historically to as many as 110. Membership is not exclusive to American residents, and indeed 19% of members currently live outside the U.S. The 2021 class of Fellows included representatives of 11 countries, including France.

In 2021, there were 150 nominations, and 130 nominations the following year. The call for nominations begins in August. Only current AAM fellows can nominate a new fellow, and that nomination must be supported by at least two other AAM fellows. Candidates cannot apply for fellowship directly, but can reach out to current fellows to seek nomination. The nomination deadline is in October. The Sub-committee of Elections and the Academy Governors, which are composed of AAM members elected by the entire AAM membership, then vote to approve of the nominations.

Members of the AAM are elected through an annual peer-reviewed process based on their records of scientific achievements that have advanced microbiology. The academy administers ASM scientific achievement awards that honor important contributions to basic and applied research, microbiology education, and scientific and professional leadership. There is no limit to the number of times a person can be nominated, nor an age limit for nomination. Notable academy members include Anthony Fauci (former director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Disease) and Rita Colwell (former director of the National Science Foundation).

=== Activities ===
The AAM holds colloquia, sometimes in conjunction with other scientific societies, on topics pertinent to public interests and the expertises of its members. Topics include climate change, One Health, and clinical diagnostics. Reports from the colloquia are made publicly available.

In addition to communicating via colloquium reports, mBio, a journal launched by ASM in 2009, offers an ‘AAM track’ where AAM members are allowed to submit one manuscript per year. Fellows are required to submit two reviews per submission, make modifications that address the reviewers’ comments, then submit the revised version to the mBio editors. However, submission does not guarantee acceptance.

The AAM also selects an Honorary Diversity Lecturer. This award, aimed to attract more under-represented minorities to the field, is given to a mid-to-senior level scientist who is both highly accomplished and an &quot;outstanding&quot; speaker.

===American College of Microbiology===
The American College of Microbiology (ACM) certified microbiologists and immunologists and provided accreditation of postdoctoral training programs.

* The American Board of Medical Microbiology (ABMM) certified doctoral-level microbiologists.
* The American Board of Medical Laboratory Immunology (ABMLI) certified doctoral-level immunologists.
* The National Registry of Certified Microbiologists (NRCM) certified microbiologists at the prebaccalaureate/baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels in biological safety; food; and pharmaceutical and medical device. Four certifications were offered with a Registered Microbiologist (RM) and Specialist Microbiologist(SM). The exams were last offered in April 2018 with applicants being directed to ASCP (M) an SM for the medical microbiology certification ABSA International RBP and CBSP for biosafety .
** SM: Biological Safety
** SM: Pharmaceutical and Medical Device
** RM: Pharmaceutical and Medical Device
** RM: Food Safety and Quality

==Public outreach==

ASM promotes a public understanding of microbiology through science festivals, public outreach campaigns and museum exhibits. ASM engages the science-interested public and microbiologists through articles reaching nearly 25,000 readers per month, 9 podcasts with 1.5 million downloads and close to half a million social media followers. ASM also runs an annual agar art contest.

ASM produces eight podcasts, including &quot;This Week in Microbiology&quot;, &quot;This Week in Virology&quot;, and &quot;This Week in Parasitism&quot;, hosted by Vincent Racaniello. &quot;Mundo de los Microbios&quot; hosted by Gary Toranzos, is ASM&#x27;s weekly Spanish-language podcast. &quot;Meet the Microbiologist&quot; is a podcast hosted by Julie Wolf, Ph.D., that showcases the people behind the scientific discoveries in various cutting-edge areas of the microbial sciences.

== Advocacy ==
ASM empowers members to advocate for the highest standards in scientific practice and provides members opportunities to advocate for evidence-based scientific policy.

In 2011, ASM made a concerted effort to address the lack of visibility of its policy arm, specifically in promoting the interests of clinical microbiologists. The Public and Scientific Affairs Board Professional Affairs Committee and Committee on Laboratory Practices was active in influencing policy decisions through Congress, the Clinical Laboratory Coalition, the FDA, and the CDC.

ASM restructured its advocacy program to enhance its effectiveness in Washington, D.C., and its expansion to the Branches and various local communities. In 2018, ASM engaged members of Congress and issued statements in conjunction with Congressional hearings focusing on recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like the measles. In 2017 and 2018, ASM played a leading role, working with coalition partners, to raise the federal budget caps and advance funding for science and public health agencies like the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, National Institute for Food and Agriculture at the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ASM members sent nearly 2,000 messages to Members of Congress in support of increased science funding. Noteworthy is the appreciation of ASM by CDC, since raising the caps made specifically possible the construction of the new biocontainment lab.

In 2018, ASM advocated successfully for establishing PACCARB (President&#x27;s Advisory Council for Combatting Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria) into the law (from an Obama administration Executive Order), by including language in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act. ASM convened a meeting with more than 20 stakeholder groups to discuss a collective path forward for federally-focused advocacy in support of microbiome research.

<text>Avida is an artificial life software platform to study the evolutionary biology of self-replicating and evolving computer programs (digital organisms). Avida is under active development by Charles Ofria&#x27;s Digital Evolution Lab at Michigan State University; the first version of Avida was designed in 1993 by Ofria, Chris Adami and C. Titus Brown at Caltech, and has been fully reengineered by Ofria on multiple occasions since then. The software was originally inspired by the Tierra system.

== Design principles ==

Tierra simulated an evolutionary system by introducing computer programs that competed for computer resources, specifically processor (CPU) time and access to main memory. In this respect it was similar to Core Wars, but differed in that the programs being run in the simulation were able to modify themselves, and thereby evolve. Tierra&#x27;s programs were artificial life organisms.

Unlike Tierra, Avida assigns every digital organism its own protected region of memory, and executes it with a separate virtual CPU. By default, other digital organisms cannot access this memory space, neither for reading nor for writing, and cannot execute code that is not in their own memory space.

A second major difference is that the virtual CPUs of different organisms can run at different speeds, such that one organism executes, for example, twice as many instructions in the same time interval as another organism. The speed at which a virtual CPU runs is determined by a number of factors, but most importantly, by the &quot;tasks&quot; that the organism performs: logical computations that the organisms can carry out to reap extra CPU speed as bonus.

== Use in research ==

Adami and Ofria, in collaboration with others, have used Avida to conduct research in digital evolution, and the scientific journals &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; have published four of their papers.

The 2003 paper &quot;The Evolutionary Origin of Complex Features&quot; describes the evolution of a mathematical equals operation from simpler bitwise operations.

==Use in education==

The Avida-ED project (Avida-ED) uses the Avida software platform within a simplified graphical user interface suitable for use in evolution education instruction at the high school and undergraduate college level, and provides freely available software, documentation, tutorials, lesson plans, and other course materials. The Avida-ED software runs as a web application in the browser, with the user interface implemented in JavaScript and Avida compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten, making the software broadly compatible with devices commonly used in classrooms. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving students&#x27; understanding of evolution.
The Avida-ED project was the winner of the 2017 International Society for Artificial Life Education and Outreach Award.

<doc id="451180" wikidata="Q281329" url="?curid=451180" title="Krol Ko">
<text>Krol Ko () at Angkor, Cambodia, is a Buddhist temple built at the end of the 12th century under the rule of Jayavarman VII, in his Bayon architectural style. It is north of Neak Pean. The name &#x27;Krol Ko&#x27; is a modern term meaning &#x27;The Park of the Oxen&#x27; and likely has no connection to its historical use.

While speculative, it may have served as a chapel at a hospital site, as its layout is identical to the four hospital chapels found outside Angkor Thom (the &#x27;Chapel of the Hospital&#x27; to the east, Ta Prohm Kel to the south, Tonle Sgnout to the north, and another site now in ruins to the west). Placement of a hospital close to Neak Pean would have made sense as Neak Pean was constructed as a representation of the waters of the mythical lake Anavatapta, which were thought to help the attainment of salvation amongst those deceased. Seven of the temple pediments at Krol Ko feature Lokeshvara, a boddhisattva who, in Khmer Buddhist belief, was entrusted with healing powers. Lokeshvara is commonly associated with hospitals.An interesting feature of Krol Ko is that while it was built as a Buddhist temple, it contains reliefs depicting a scene from the Hindu Puranas, which are medieval Hindu scriptures more contemporary than the classical Rigvedas. The left of the building shows Krishna raising the hill Govardhana to shelter shepherds and their flocks from a thunderstorm raised by Indra. This relatively contemporary Purana-Govardhana story displays Indra&#x27;s submission to Krishna, despite Indra being viewed as the supreme deity in the Rigvedas. In Buddhism, Indra remained as the superior deity and was even venerated as a protector of the Buddhist faith whilst worship amongst the Hindu population shifted towards Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Krishna since the medieval period. It is therefore striking that the Govardhana tale, a tale that tells of Indra&#x27;s inferiority to Krishna, is depicted in an otherwise Buddhist temple. This indicates a lack of rivalry between the Buddhist and Hindu populations residing within Angkor, contrary to India, where Buddhism was deemed as heretical amongst many Hindus due to its renunciation of the caste system. The caste system was never entirely adopted by the Khmer civilization and other South-East Asian civilizations. 

The approximate location of the site is 13.468189&#x27; N, 103.895401&#x27; E (WGS 84 map datum).

<text>Dunfermline Athletic Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in the city of Dunfermline, Fife. Founded in 1885, the club currently compete in the Scottish Championship after winning the 2022–23 Scottish League One title. Dunfermline play at East End Park, are nicknamed &quot;The Pars&quot; and are managed by Michael Tidser.

&quot;The Pars&quot;&#x27; most successful period was in the 1960s, when the side won the Scottish Cup twice, in 1961 and 1968 under the management of Jock Stein and George Farm respectively. The club regularly played European football in this period, reaching the semi-finals of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup under Farm.

The club have played at East End Park since their formation in 1885; however, the pitch they initially played at – also known as East End Park – was slightly west of the present stadium.

After a period of relative success in the 2000s marked by appearances in three major finals (the 2004 Scottish Cup Final, the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final and the 2007 Scottish Cup Final), all of which were lost against Celtic, Dunfermline were relegated to the First Division in 2007. The club then encountered financial problems and, in April 2013, applied for and was granted full administration at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and in October 2013, the fan group Pars United assumed control of the club.

==History==
===Beginning (1885–1959)===
Dunfermline Football Club was formed in 1874, when members of Dunfermline Cricket Club decided to establish a football section, with the intention of maintaining fitness during the winter. A dispute over club membership caused some members to split away from Dunfermline Cricket Club, which resulted in the creation of Dunfermline Athletic Football Club on 2 June 1885. The club became the principal football club in Dunfermline and their first twenty-five years saw them compete primarily as an amateur team, until they turned professional in 1899. The club first entered into the Scottish Football League in 1912 where they took part in the Scottish Division Two. The fifty years following the club&#x27;s admittance to the SFL saw little success, with the side most frequently playing in the second tier, with occasional appearances in the top flight.

===Stein and Farm (1960–1970)===

Dunfermline&#x27;s finest period came during the sixties. After being appointed manager on 14 March 1960 and saving the club from relegation to Scottish Division Two, Jock Stein – in his first managerial appointment – guided the Pars to their first major piece of silverware, winning the Scottish Cup in 1961 after just thirteen months in charge.

The years which followed saw Dunfermline consistently competing in European competitions, reaching the semi-finals of the 1968–69 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup under George Farm. Although they lost by one goal on aggregate to eventual winners Slovan Bratislava, it remains the greatest achievement in Dunfermline&#x27;s history. This followed Farm managing Dunfermline to their second Scottish Cup victory, winning the competition in 1968.

===Norrie and &quot;The Masterton Era&quot; (1971–2012)===

After a period of decline during the 1970s and much of the 1980s, the club returned to the top tier in 1987 under club legend Jim Leishman, although they were subsequently relegated after just one season. The following years saw a similar pattern, with a handful of promotions and relegations throughout the 1990s. It was during this period that the club were rocked by the loss of club captain Norrie McCathie, who died on 8 January 1996 by carbon monoxide poisoning.

The appointment of John Yorkston as chairman and the involvement of Gavin Masterton in 1999 saw the club enter a period of resurgence, with two Scottish Cup final appearances in 2004 and 2007, a Scottish League Cup final in 2006, as well as two short-lived excursions in the UEFA Cup in 2004 and 2007. In 2012 it emerged that the club had a number of outstanding tax bills with HMRC following the financial mismanagement of the football club by Yorkston and Masterton. The club were put into administration on 11 April 2013 and after a points deduction, were relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1986.

===Fan ownership and German Investment (2013–2024)===

Following relegation to Scottish League One and with a depleted squad, Jim Jefferies remained as manager and achieved a comfortable second place finish behind a Rangers team climbing the divisions following their own administration and multiple relegations two years prior. 

The club were officially taken over by fans owned group Pars United in October 2013, including the full ownership of the club’s East End Park. Pars United&#x27;s Bob Garmory was appointed the club&#x27;s interim chairman and was joined on the board by Jim Leishman, Ian Hunter, Kip McBay, Craig McWhirter and Margaret Ross. Eventually Ross McArthur would become the clubs new long standing Chairman.

Jefferies’ side eventually failed to win promotion through the playoffs and he resigned in December of the following season. The club stumbled to a 7th place finish under John Potter but the squad was in a much stronger position and Allan Johnston lead the Pars to the League One title by an 18-point margin in 2015. This period in the club’s history saw the arrival of fan favourites such as Faissal El Bakhtaoui, Andy Geggan and a returning Joe Cardle.

Club legend and former striker Stevie Crawford was appointed head coach in January 2019 following a restructure that introduced other former players Jackie McNamara as technical consultant and Greg Shields as assistant head coach. Crawford resigned after two and a half seasons and was replaced by Peter Grant, who would become the manager with the lowest win percentage in the club’s long history. John “Yogi” Hughes replaced Grant after five months and with the club bottom of the Scottish Championship he failed to turn around the team’s fortunes, with the Pars once again relegated to League One.

In September 2020 and at the height of the COVID 19 pandemic, Dunfermline announced that a group of four German investors had agreed to purchase a minority share in the club with the intention to eventually be the majority owners. The investors, led by former St. Pauli manager Thomas Meggle joined the club’s board with Meggle also naming himself Director of Football. Ross McArthur retired as Chairman and the German outfit brought in former Manchester City and Nottingham Forest executive David Cook to serve as CEO and eventual Chairman.

Work started on re-establishing the club’s own in-house youth academy and the purchase of the former Rosyth Civil Service Club was made to develop state-of-the-art training facilities. Work stalled due to pandemic related construction cost increases and a fading interest from the German investors who had still not taken up the commitment to purchase the majority shares they had previously agreed to buy. Relations between the club and the fans began to sour due to a perceived lack of investment in the squad and the manager and in August 2024 the Germans announced their intention to sell their shares in the club after four years in charge.

Dunfermline appointed former Dundee boss James McPake as manager on a two-year deal following relegation to League One, with Dave Mackay joining as assistant. McPake brought instant success with the Pars winning the league by 14 points and losing only one league game all season. After struggling to compete in the Championship amid the ongoing sale of the club, McPake was dismissed at Christmas 2024.

===American takeover and a &quot;New Era&quot; (2025–Present)===

January 2025 saw a deal finalised for American based outfit Park Bench SFC LLC to buy the club, with former poker star James Bord &amp; business partner Evan Sofer named co-owners. The Las Vegas based duo cited their desire to utilise their backgrounds in data analytics and artificial intelligence to realise the club&#x27;s &quot;immense potential&quot;. Already owning a minority stake in Spanish Segunda División side Córdoba CF and Bulgarian outfit PFC Septemvri Sofia, Park Bench LLC aquired 99.84% of Dunfermline. The club&#x27;s social media profiles quickly replaced the &quot;Living True Sportsmanship&quot; motto of the previous German owners with tag lines of &quot;A new era&quot;.

The new owners first act was to fill the head coach vacancy by appointing Fife neighbours Kelty Hearts manager Michael Tidser on a two and a half year deal.

==Colours and badge==
For much of Dunfermline&#x27;s history their home colours have been black and white striped shirts, with black shorts and black socks, though recently they have worn white shorts and white socks. From the club&#x27;s formation in 1885 until 1901, the club&#x27;s home colours were a plain maroon shirt with either navy or white shorts and either maroon, white or grey socks. The club then went through a period between 1901 and 1909 when their kits were blue. The club first wore their now well-known black-and-white-striped shirts in 1909 and have worn these colours every year apart from the 1971–72 season, when they wore all white, the 2004–05 season, when they wore a white shirt with a single black stripe running down the left side of the shirt and during the 2007–08 season, in which they wore an all-white shirt with black shorts and white socks. For the 2008–09 season, the Pars reverted to their well-known black-and-white stripes resembling the kit they wore for the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons.

Conversely, there has been no consistent colour or design of the club&#x27;s away strips. Since the start of the new millennium, the club have most regularly had red kits of varying design; for example, the 2004–2005 away strip consisted of vertical red and black lines, whereas the 2016–17 kit was mostly red, with four horizontal lines of red, white and black across the chest. However, away kit designs have not been exclusively red, with the club having also had kits of purple, blue and yellow, as well as black, as was the case during the 2005–06 season.

The current Dunfermline Athletic club badge design was created in 1957 by Colin Dymock, an art teacher at Dunfermline High School. It was allegedly inspired by one of Dymock&#x27;s mysterious nightmares. The &quot;DAFC&quot; represents the initials of the club, Dunfermline Athletic Football Club, whilst the tower is a representation of Malcolm Canmore&#x27;s Tower. The tower was adopted by the town of Dunfermline to be used for the Burgh Arms and old seals. Malcolm Canmore was King of Scotland from 1057 to 1093, and made his residence in Dunfermline within what is now Pittencrieff Park. The park is represented by the stormy, ghostly blue and black night scene behind the tower, including the park&#x27;s infamous hanging tree. The green area at the bottom of the crest is meant to represent the club&#x27;s stadium, East End Park. Whilst the badge has been in use since the 1950s, it has undergone a number of alterations since its original incarnation, with the most recent adjustments in 2011 altering the outlines, font and colours of the logo.

==Nickname==

According to &quot;Black and White Magic&quot;, a 1984 book about the club by Jim Paterson and Douglas Scott, there are numerous theories as to the origin of the club&#x27;s nickname, the Pars. The authors wrote:

&quot;&quot;Most tend to confirm the more common belief that the name arose from the team&#x27;s parallel striped shirts, their drinking habits or their style of play. The latter were both described as &quot;paralytic&quot;. The earliest theory claims that in the early days when the Football Club was closely connected with the Cricket Club, the footballers were renowned for their performances at the bar and so were called the &quot;Paralytics&quot;.&quot;

&quot;However, in the early 1900s it is known that Athletic&#x27;s nickname was the &quot;Dumps&quot; – shortened from Dunfermline – and this is said to have been coined by English sailors visiting East End Park when their ship docked at Rosyth. After World War I they were known as the Pars and some believe the parallel black and white stripes to be the reason.&quot;
&quot;Another school of thought involves English workers who came to work at the armaments depot at Crombie and at Rosyth Dockyard; they kept their association with their local team by forming the Plymouth Argyle (Rosyth) Supporters Club and it is said that the Dunfermline nickname comes from the banners in evidence around the ground.&quot;&quot;

Another view, which holds water with the older supporters is that the name derives from the word &#x27;Parr&#x27; which is a juvenile salmon with dark vertical markings.

==Club culture==

===Songs===
Like other football clubs, Dunfermline has a number of songs and anthems. A popular song, and the anthem to which the team runs out is &quot;Into The Valley&quot; by local band the Skids.
Since the 1950s the crowd have left the ground after the game to the tune of &quot;The Bluebell Polka&quot; by Jimmy Shand and his band. After Dunfermline score a goal at East End Park, the chorus of the Dave Clark Five&#x27;s Glad All Over is played.

===Rivalries===

Dunfermline Athletic have traditional rivalries with local sides Cowdenbeath and Raith Rovers as well as contesting the Kincardine Derby with near neighbours, Falkirk. They have also participated regularly in the Fife Cup since their formation in 1885, winning the competition more than thirty times, most recently during the 2018–19 season.

===In popular culture===
In the STV television detective drama Taggart, the writer and Dunfermline fan, Stuart Hepburn used the names of the 1968 Scottish cup winning side for the characters in a 2003 episode.

===Hall of Fame===
The club launched its Hall of Fame in 2004, initially with nine inductees. 50 individuals (ranging from players and managers to kit managers and the club historian) and two team groups (the 1960s cup winners) were members as of 2019.

<text>Livingston Football Club is a Scottish professional football club based in Livingston, West Lothian.

Livingston currently play in the Scottish Championship and were founded in 1943 as Ferranti Thistle, a works team. The club was admitted to the Scottish Football League and renamed as Meadowbank Thistle in 1974, and played its matches at Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh. In 1995, the club was relocated to Livingston, West Lothian and renamed after the town. Since then Livingston have played their home games at Almondvale Stadium. In the ten years following the move to Livingston the club enjoyed notable success, winning promotion to the Scottish Premier League in 2001, qualifying for the UEFA Cup in its maiden season in the top flight (finishing third behind Celtic and Rangers) and winning the 2004 Scottish League Cup. However, the club hit financial problems in 2004, and was relegated to the Scottish First Division in 2006. In July 2009 the club faced further financial problems and were on the verge of suffering a liquidation event before a deal was struck. Livingston were subsequently demoted to the Scottish Third Division, but the club achieved consecutive promotions and went on to regain its place in the top tier after winning the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership play-offs.

==History==

===Ferranti Thistle (1943–1974)===
The club began life as Ferranti Amateurs in 1943. A works team of the Ferranti engineering company, they initially played in the Edinburgh FA&#x27;s Amateur Second Division. In 1948 the club became known as Ferranti Thistle and began competing in the Edinburgh and District Welfare Association where they competed for five seasons, before moving to senior football in 1953 joining the East of Scotland League. During this period the club won the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in 1963. In 1969 the club moved to the City Park ground in Edinburgh.

In 1972 the club became members of SFA which allowed them to enter the Scottish Qualifying Cup which they won in 1973 which previously had not been open to them. The club&#x27;s first match in the Scottish Cup was on 16 December 1972 against Duns.

In 1974, as a result of the demise of Third Lanark seven years earlier, and the new three-tier format of the Scottish Football League, a place opened up in the second division of the competition. After beating off competition from four Highland League sides, Hawick Royal Albert and Gateshead United, Ferranti Thistle were accepted into the league by a vote of 21–16 over Inverness Thistle. The club faced a number of obstacles before they could join the Division as their name did not meet stringent SFL rules on overt sponsorship of teams at the time and the City Ground was not up to standard. The local council offered use of Meadowbank Stadium, a modern stadium built in 1970. After an &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; campaign to find a name for the club, the name Meadowbank Thistle was chosen. This was approved by the SFL in time for the new season.

===Meadowbank Thistle (1974–1995)===
 Having had little time to form a squad from the existing Ferranti squad, the first Meadowbank Thistle manager John Bain faced an uphill task to produce a competitive squad in time for the new season. Meadowbank played their first competitive match in the League Cup, eventually losing 1–0 to Albion Rovers. In 1983 the club achieved promotion to the First Division but ultimately were relegated back to the Second Division at the end of the 1984–85 season.

In the 1986–87 season, Meadowbank won the Second Division championship and won promotion to the First Division. They finished runners-up in the First Division in the following season, but were denied promotion to the Premier Division due to league reconstruction.

The part-time club began to struggle, and it became a limited company in 1993 but was relegated a short time after at the end of the 1992–93 season to the Second Division. Meadowbank suffered a second relegation in 1994–95, finishing second from bottom in the Second Division and due to the creation of a Third Division were relegated. After this, Chairman Bill Hunter claimed Meadowbank had run into severe financial difficulties and were facing closure as a result. In the face of significant opposition from many Meadowbank fans who objected to the dropping of the club name and the team moving from Edinburgh, in 1995 Meadowbank Thistle relocated to a new stadium in the new town of Livingston and changed name again, to Livingston Football Club.

===Livingston (1995–)===
====Rise to prominence====
In their first season as Livingston they were crowned champions of the Third Division for the 1995–96 season. Three years later, in 1998–99, they won promotion again as Second Division champions. Another promotion followed in 2000–01 when the club finished champions of First Division and gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL), just six seasons after the relocation to Livingston. Livingston&#x27;s first SPL campaign, 2001–02, brought more success as they finished third in the league (behind the Old Firm) and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time. Jim Leishman&#x27;s side gave a competent showing in the UEFA Cup. After disposing of FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein on the away goal rule after a 1–1 draw, they came up against SK Sturm Graz of Austria, and after a 14-goal, two-leg affair they missed out on the second round, going out on the wrong side of an 8–6 aggregate scoreline. The club avoided relegation the following season finishing 9th. After this season, manager Jim Leishman became the club&#x27;s director of football and was replaced by Brazilian manager Márcio Máximo, who resigned only a few months into the following campaign and was in turn replaced by Leishman&#x27;s former assistant, Davie Hay. Under Hay&#x27;s management, Livingston won their first national trophy in 2004 by winning the 2003–04 League Cup after a 2–0 win over Hibernian at Hampden Park. The goals in the final were scored by Derek Lilley and Jamie McAllister.

====Administration and SPL relegation====
The club&#x27;s rise was short-lived as they were plunged into administration on 3 February 2004. It was 13 May 2005 before Livingston emerged from administration, following a period of financial turmoil in which the previous boardroom occupants were ousted to make way for Pearse Flynn&#x27;s Lionheart Consortium. Flynn&#x27;s first decision was to sack Davie Hay, stating that he wanted a younger man in charge, and to that end appointed Allan Preston as the club&#x27;s new manager. While Preston&#x27;s term as Livingston manager started brightly with a 3–0 win over newly promoted Inverness Caledonian Thistle, the club failed to win another league game under his management, resulting in his dismissal in November with the club rooted to the bottom of the SPL. Richard Gough succeeded Preston and steered the club to survival on the last day of the season with a 1–1 draw with Dundee that relegated Dundee in their place, but Gough refused to stay as manager past the end of that season due to family problems and returned to the US, and former Celtic player Paul Lambert succeeded him. On 11 February 2006, Lambert resigned as Livingston manager after seven straight defeats leaving Livingston bottom of the Scottish Premier League. He was replaced by former player and coach John Robertson. Despite his best efforts, Livingston were relegated for the first time in May 2006 after only picking up 18 points that season. It was the worst record since the SPL began and was only beaten during the 2007–08 season by Gretna, after they were deducted 10 points for going into administration.

====First Division and second administration ====
A poor showing in the 2006–07 First Division saw John Robertson removed as Livingston manager on 15 April 2007. His successor was announced on 22 May 2007 as former Hibernian assistant coach Mark Proctor. Proctor appointed Curtis Fleming as his assistant on 26 June 2007, but both were sacked in June 2008 after a disappointing season in which they finished seventh. Livingston were taken over that summer by Italian majority shareholders Angelo Massone, Tommaso Bruno, Alessandro Di Mattia, and Tommaso Angelini after Pearse Flynn sold his shares in June 2008. The Italians were thought to be close to appointing fellow Italian Roberto Landi as head coach in June and he was made manager of the First Division side on 11 June 2008. He and assistant Valter Berlini were then fired on 1 December 2008 after just five months in charge. Paul Hegarty was linked with the job on 3 December 2008, and formally appointed two days later. Hegarty was subsequently suspended as manager on 26 April 2009 and his contract allowed to expire.

John Murphy was appointed head coach on 30 June 2009, the same day the club faced a deadline to pay debt to West Lothian Council who owned Almondvale Stadium. After that was not met, legal proceedings were carried out against the club to come to an arrangement over the debt within fourteen days or potentially face again going into administration. Livingston were placed into administration on 24 July 2009 by the Court of Session in Edinburgh, and faced relegation to the Third Division, a points deduction or being removed from the Scottish Football League entirely.
On 27 July 2009, it was revealed that the club were likely to go into liquidation after owner Angelo Massone said he would refuse a £25,000 offer for the club from their administrator. On 28 July 2009, Massone yet again refused the offer and the administrator subsequently started the liquidation process. While Livingston seemed doomed, a meeting with the Scottish Football League on 30 July 2009 secured their future, as they agreed to allow prospective new owners Gordon McDougall and Neil Rankine (part of the Livingston 5 Consortium) to run the club for the following season. The next day, Massone sold his shares to the new owners and left the club, and it was also announced that John Murphy had been appointed back to his previous role as goalkeeping coach, with ex-player Gary Bollan becoming the club&#x27;s new manager. In the first game after the new owners took over, Livingston were on the wrong end of a cup shock in the Scottish League Cup first round, losing 3–0 to Albion Rovers, a team two divisions below them.

====Demotion to the Third Division====
Despite the prospective new owners ensuring that Livingston&#x27;s future as a professional football club would be secure for the next year at least by paying a £720,000 bond to the SFL, on 5 August 2009 the Scottish Football League took the unprecedented move to demote Livingston to the Third Division. A breach of rules on insolvency was the main reason behind the decision. The administrator of the club, Donald McGruther, admitted his concern after the decision, saying that &quot;In my view, this represents the death knell of Livingston Football Club&quot;. Gordon McDougall, a member of the Livingston 5 Consortium stated that &quot;We&#x27;ve got to consider all the options that are open to us – it makes it very, very difficult&quot;. It was feared that the club could not survive in the Third Division due to a significant loss of revenue. However, despite the decision and the likely financial impacts, the consortium continued with their bid to take over the club. An appeal was lodged and as a result the club refused to play their opening Division Three fixture against East Stirlingshire on 8 August 2009. Because of this, the club were threatened with a points deduction, but in the event they were given a £3,000 fine for their actions. This was later overturned on appeal, meaning that the club ultimately escaped any punishment for their boycott of the match. On 7 September 2009 a further appeal to the SFA was dismissed, and the club finally accepted their Third Division fate.

====Title wins and First Division return====
On 15 August 2009, Livingston opened their Third Division campaign against Montrose at home and ran out comfortable 2–0 winners. On 17 April 2010, Livingston won the Scottish Third Division title after drawing 0–0 at home to Berwick Rangers. Goalkeeper Roddy McKenzie saved a last minute penalty to ensure the title was on its way to Almondvale. The Lions ended the season on 78 points, 15 points ahead of second placed Forfar Athletic. The following season on 9 April 2011, Livingston secured the Second Division title with a second consecutive title win to earn promotion back to the Scottish First Division with a 3–0 victory over Stenhousemuir at Ochilview Park. On 9 February 2012, Bollan was sacked as manager after two and a half years in charge. Nine days later on 14 February 2012, John Hughes and John Collins were appointed as manager and director of football respectively. However, on 13 November 2012, it was announced that Hughes had left the club to take charge of Hartlepool United. Gareth Evans became manager after being promoted from his position as assistant manager but he was sacked on 28 February 2013 due to ‘concerns over his stewardship’. Collins subsequently resigned from his position as director of football. On 25 March 2013, Richie Burke was appointed as manager along with Mark Burchill as assistant manager. Livingston ended season 2012–13 with a 4th-place finish in the First Division, their highest league finish since they were relegated from the SPL in 2006. On 12 September 2013, Burke resigned from his post as manager and was subsequently replaced by John McGlynn. When McGlynn took over Livingston were bottom of the Scottish Championship with only 1 point. Improved performances under his leadership took the club into contention for the promotion play-offs. As a result, he was awarded an extended contract in January 2014. Livingston eventually finished in 6th place in 2013–14.

However Livingston struggled the following season and were in severe danger of relegation. McGlynn left Livingston by mutual consent in December 2014, following a 1–0 home defeat by Falkirk, which left the club bottom of the league, four points behind second bottom Cowdenbeath. Mark Burchill replaced McGlynn as the club&#x27;s manager. Off the field problems also once again plagued the club during this season. The club were deducted 5 points by the SPFL for failing to pay tax on bonuses paid during the 2010–11 season. Former club director Ged Nixon tried to get the courts to freeze the clubs bank accounts as he claimed the club owed him £300,000. This sparked fears that the club would go into administration for a third time. Nixon lost his court case in April 2015, saving the club from this fate. Livingston won the 2014–15 Scottish Challenge Cup, defeating Alloa 4–0 in the final at McDiarmid Park. With two games of the season remaining Livingston were still adrift at the bottom of the league, three points behind relegation rivals Alloa and four behind Cowdenbeath. A 4–0 win away at Raith Rovers moved the club into 9th place on goal difference going into the final game of the season. Livingston won their final game of the season 1–0 at home to Queen of the South to pull off the great escape and finish in 8th place, avoiding both automatic relegation and the relegation play-off.

Livingston were struggling against relegation again in season 2015–16. Burchill was sacked in December 2015 following a 1–1 draw with Dumbarton as Livingston sat second bottom of the league. David Hopkin replaced him as manager. However, there was to be no great escape this season. Livingston finished in 9th place in the Championship, which meant they had to contest the Championship Play-Off to avoid relegation to Scottish League One. They faced Stranraer in the play-off semi-final. Livingston lost the first leg 5–2 away at Stranraer, giving themselves a very difficult task for the second leg. In the second leg Livingston won 4–1 in 90 minutes to take the tie to extra time. However two extra time Stranraer goals took the score to 4–3 on the day and 6–8 on aggregate, confirming Livingston&#x27;s relegation to League One, ending a five-year stint in the second tier.

====League One and consecutive promotions====

Despite relegation, Livingston decided to stay as a full-time football club, and David Hopkin was retained as manager for the 2016–17 season, as Livingston aimed to bounce back to the Championship. Livingston went on to win the league comfortably and secured the title in April 2017 following a 2–1 win at home to Alloa Athletic. Livingston finished 19 points clear at the top of the league.

Livingston continued this impressive form into the Championship in 2017–18 and sat in the play-off places in joint 3rd in the league after 20 games. The club also reached the quarter-finals of the Scottish League Cup, where they were unlucky to go down 3–2 at Hibernian. It was the first time they reached this stage of the league cup since 2005–06.

On 21 April 2018 Livingston secured second place in the Championship after a 3–0 win over already relegated Brechin City.

Qualifying for the Premiership play-off final, they faced Partick Thistle, who escaped automatic relegation in their final game. Despite this, Livingston won 3–1 on aggregate, 2–1 at home and 1–0 away, earning the final place in the Scottish Premiership and their first season of top-flight football since 2006, relegating Partick Thistle to the Championship in the process, ending Thistle&#x27;s five-year stint in the Premiership.

====Return to the Top Flight====

Livingston retained their status as a top flight club in season 2018–19 with a 9th-place finish. This was bettered the following season with the club sitting in 5th before the season was curtailed as a result of COVID-19. The points per game ruling confirmed this placing as Livi&#x27;s first top 6 finish since 2001–02. In 2020–21, the feat was repeated with a sixth-place finish. The season was also notable for the club reaching the Scottish League Cup final for the first time since 2004.

==Colours and badge==
The predominant club colours are amber and black, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1943. The strip typically has an amber top, with the shorts normally black and the socks amber, usually with some black detail. The original strip for the club during the first couple of season in the Ferranti Thistle era was amber and black hoops. After this, solid amber shirts, black shorts and amber socks (occasionally black) became established as the club&#x27;s home kit. During the recent Livingston era the club have also used all black home strips, and a white and orange kit was used during 2002–03 season. The colours of white, black, purple, blue and red have been mainly used in the away strips.

The badge used to identify the club has changed four times in the club&#x27;s history. The Ferranti Thistle badge featured a black circular base. Three symbols were incorporated into the badge; a football, a thistle and a lion rampant in the centre holding aloft a Scottish flag. A new badge was then formed as the club changed their name to Meadowbank Thistle. The badge was based on a traditional shield shape with a black being the predominant colour and amber on the outer-trim. The badge features a thistle as the centre piece, with the flower part of the plant being replaced with a football. As the club moved to Livingston, the badge was changed again. The design of the thistle and the football is altered slightly; with the one major change being the addition of a Latin club motto &quot;Fortitier omnia vincit&quot; with the English translation meaning &quot;Bravely conquers all&quot;. The current badge is modernised from the original Livingston badge but most of the features remain. The present badge also reintroduced the lion rampant in the centre of the laurel.

==Sponsorship==


In the Meadowbank Thistle era between 1973 and 1995, the club sourced various shirt sponsorship deals largely from small business such as Ferranti, Sports Conscious, Park &amp; Milton, Raj Restaurant, ACA and PAR Scaffolding. Mitsubishi became the first major shirt sponsor of the club for the first three seasons of the Livingston era. Motorola then sponsored the club for the next four years. However, Motorola withdrew their shirt sponsorship at the end of the 2001–02 season, after the company&#x27;s decline in the area. In 2002, Intelligent Finance, one of the largest employers in the West Lothian area, agreed an initial two-year sponsorship deal with the club worth an undisclosed six-figure sum. The company extended their shirt sponsorship for three more years, making their total sponsorship span over a five-year period.

Smarter Loans became the club&#x27;s main sponsor during the 2007–08 season, before the IT company, RDF, signed a two-year deal to become main sponsors for seasons 2008–09 and 2009–10. However they withdrew their sponsorship after only one year, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis at the club that summer. Local company Fasteq became the new main sponsor for season 2009–10 after the arrival of the new club owners. After four successful years as sponsors, Fasteq withdrew their sponsorship and Livingston announced that they were looking for new shirt sponsors for season 2013–14. Local business Energy Assets were confirmed as new main sponsors on a three-year deal in June 2013.

==Stadiums==

The club have had three main grounds in their history; as Ferranti Thistle, the club initially played in local parks before finding a home at City Park in Edinburgh in 1969, then moving to Meadowbank Stadium in 1974 which was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.

Livingston currently play their home games at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. It is currently known as The Home of the Set Fare Arena due to a sponsorship deal. The 9,512 capacity stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Meadowbank Thistle and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council and the council have since rented the stadium to the club. The ground has hosted Scotland under-21, under-19, under-17s and Ladies matches, as well as one home game for Gretna due to problems with their ground share at Fir Park. In April 2011 it was revealed that it was possible Livingston would relocate to a new stadium around one mile from the current site due to West Lothian Council looking to sell the current site to a supermarket chain.

<doc id="451184" wikidata="Q1874127" url="?curid=451184" title="Yeh, Yeh">
<text>&quot;Yeh, Yeh&quot; is a Latin soul song originally written as an instrumental by Rodgers Grant and Pat Patrick, and first recorded by Mongo Santamaría on his album &quot;Watermelon Man!&quot; in 1963. Lyrics were written for it shortly thereafter by Jon Hendricks of the vocalese group, Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Bavan and this version appeared on their 1963 album &quot;At Newport &#x27;63.&quot;

The vocal version of the song was recorded by Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames (b/w &quot;Preach and Teach&quot;, Columbia DB 7428) and released on December 4, 1964. UK demonstration records were titled &quot;Yeah, Yeh, Yeh&quot; and this eventually led to some countries: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and South Africa releasing the single using &quot;Yeah, Yeh, Yeh&quot; and Greece using the title,&quot;Yeah, Yeh&quot;. Furthermore, some UK initial issues were also incorrectly titled as &quot;Yeah, Yeah&quot;.

It was this version which rose to the top of the UK Singles Chart in January 1965, breaking the Beatles&#x27; five week hold on the number one spot with &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, and a month later appeared on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart to peak at #21. The saxophone solo was by Peter Coe, but was edited out for the US single release. Interviewed after the 2003 Jools Holland &quot;Spring Hootennany&quot;, where he had played a &quot;dynamite version&quot; of the song, Fame explained that the arrangement had been written by Tubby Hayes.

==Matt Bianco version==

British band Matt Bianco covered the song in 1985. It was their first release after the departure of Danny White and Basia Trzetrzelewska. Their rendition reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart, and the top 10 in Germany and Switzerland. The single version was then included in their second eponymous album in 1986, while the CD edition of the album only contained its 12&quot; dance mix. Both versions featured on the MC edition of the album, depending upon the various countries.

The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Pete Cornish.

<text>Dživo Franov Gundulić (; 8 January 1589 – 8 December 1638), better known today as Ivan Gundulić, was the most prominent Baroque poet from the Republic of Ragusa (now in Croatia). He is regarded as the Croatian national poet. His work embodies central characteristics of Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation: religious fervor, insistence on &quot;vanity of this world&quot; and zeal in opposition to &quot;infidels&quot;. Gundulić&#x27;s major works—the epic poem &quot;Osman&quot;, the pastoral play &quot;Dubravka&quot;, and the religious poem &quot;Tears of the Prodigal Son&quot; (based on the Parable of the Prodigal Son)—are examples of Baroque stylistic richness and, frequently, rhetorical excess.

==Life and works==
Gundulić was born in Dubrovnik into a wealthy Ragusan noble family (&quot;see&quot; House of Gundulić) on 8 January 1589. Son of Francesco di Francesco Gundulić (Frano Franov Gundulić, senator and diplomat, once the Ragusan envoy to Constantinople and councilor of the Republic to the Pope Gregory VIII) and Dživa Gradić (de Gradi). He received an excellent education. He probably studied the humanities with the Jesuit Silvestro Muzio and philosophy with Ridolfo Ricasoli and Camillo Camilli, who in late 1590 had been appointed &quot;rettore delle scuole e professore di umane lettere&quot; in Ragusa. After that he studied Roman law and jurisprudence in general, where he held numerous offices for the Great Council of the Republic. In 1608, when he was nineteen, he became a member of the Veliko vieće (Great Council). Twice, in 1615 and 1619, he held the temporary function of knez (commissary or governor) of Konavle, an area southeast of the city.

At the age of thirty he married Nicoleta Sorkočević (Sorgo) (died 1644) who bore him three sons, Frano (Francesco), Mato (Matheo), Šišmundo &quot;Šiško&quot; (Segismondo) and two daughters, Marija &quot;Mare&quot; (Maria) Gondola and Dživa (Giovanna). Fran Dživa Gundulić and Mato Gundulić (1636–1684) fought in the thirty-years war under Wallenstein; the youngest died on January 16, 1682, being by then the Rector of the Republic. From 1621 until his death Ivan held various offices in the city government. In 1636 he became a senator, in 1637 a judge, and in 1638 a member of the Small Council (&quot;Malo vieće&quot;). Had he lived a little longer – he died of an intense fever, product of an inflammation in his ribs ( &quot;Folio 15 Libr. Mort. N°274, Adi le Xbre 1638 Ragusa&quot;) – he would probably have been elected &quot;knez&quot; (rector) of the Dubrovnik Republic, the highest function that was held for one month only by meritorious gentlemen at least fifty years old. His father, who died in 1624, had been &quot;knez&quot; five times, and Ivan&#x27;s son Šišmundo Gundulić later four times. Ivan Gundulić was buried in the Franciscan church of Dubrovnik.

He began his literary career by writing poems and staging melodramas that became popular in Dubrovnik. But Ivan published only his larger works. His earlier work, which he referred to as a &quot;brood of darkness&quot;, is now lost. His first publications were in 1621, when he rewrote several of David&#x27;s Psalms and wrote several religious poems. He then wrote his famous &quot;Suze sina razmetnoga&quot; (Tears of the Prodigal Son) in 1622, composed of three &quot;Cries&quot;: &quot;Sagriešenje&quot; (Sin), &quot;Spoznanje&quot; (Insight) and &quot;Skrušenje&quot; (Humility). In this poem Ivan presented the three basic categories of Christian faith: sin, repentance and redemption through contrasts such as between life and death, purity and sin, and Heaven and Hell. In 1637 when Ferdinand II of Tuscany married, Gundulić wrote a poem to honor the event, he noted that &quot;all of Slavic people (Slovinski narod) honor you on this occasion&quot;.

===&quot;Dubravka&quot;===
Gundulić&#x27;s most famous play is &quot;Dubravka&quot;, a pastoral written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and contains some of the most famous verses in Croatian literature:

Croatian

&lt;poem&gt;
 O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,
dar u kom sva blaga višnji nam Bog je dô,
 uzroče istini od naše sve slave,
uresu jedini od ove Dubrave,
 sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki životi
ne mogu bit plata tvôj čistoj lipoti.

&lt;/poem&gt;

English

&lt;poem&gt;
 Fair liberty, beloved liberty, liberty sweetly avowed,
thou are the treasured gift that God to us endowed,
 all our glory is thy true creation,
to our Home thou are all the decoration,
 no silver nor gold, not life itself could replace
the reward of thy pure and sublime grace.
&lt;/poem&gt;
===&quot;Osman&quot;===

In his greatest work, &quot;Osman&quot;, Gundulić presents the contrasts between Christianity and Islam, Europe and the Turks, West and East, and what he viewed as freedom and slavery. &quot;Osman&quot; had 20 cantos, but the 14th and the 15th were never found. Judging from the modern perspective, two approaches seem to dominate the contemporary appraisal of Gundulić&#x27;s poetry: on one hand, his poetic influence has dimmed due to a change in aesthetic sensibility (Gundulić&#x27;s chief literary predecessor and influence, Torquato Tasso, has undergone similar reassessment, but his artistic integrity and individuality have withstood the test of time better); while Gundulić&#x27;s impact in the final standardisation of Croatian was overwhelming.
&quot;Osman&quot; is firmly rooted within the rich literary tradition of the Croatian Baroque in Dubrovnik and Dalmatia and is considered as one of its apogees. By presenting the contrast of struggle between Christianity and Islam, Gundulić continued Marko Marulić&#x27;s glorification of the fights against the invading Ottoman Turks. Besides magnifying Slavdom and the battles against the conquerors, Gundulić described the life of the Ottoman sultan Osman II. Gundulić constantly reminds the reader of the &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; and how the world is transient.

&quot;Osman&quot; begins with the Sultan&#x27;s grasping of the situation caused by the 1621 Ottoman defeat at Chocim and descriptions of how the era of pre-Ottoman glory of the Bulgarians, Serbs, Hungarians, Albanians and especially the Poles could be easily restored. According to the storyline, Sultan Osman dispatched Ali-pasha to the Kingdom of Poland in order to negotiate peace and Kazlar-aga to choose which Polish noblewoman would suit him best for marriage. Gundulić describes the travels of both Ali-pasha and Kazlar-aga while paying much attention to the battle of Chocim and the enslaved Slavs that suffer under Ottoman rule. After numerous failed attempts to restore order in the empire, the army captures Osman and executes him, bringing the imprisoned Mustafa as the new sultan.

==Legacy==
Osman was printed for the first time in Dubrovnik in 1826, with the two missing cantos being replaced by poems written by the poet Petar Ignjat Sorkočević-Crijević (1749–1826), a direct descendant of Ivan Gundulić (his maternal grandmother Nikoleta Gundulić was Šišmundo Gundulić&#x27;s daughter). Another descendant, Baron Vlaho Getaldić (grandson of Katarina Gundulić) introduced a hexameter treaty into &quot;Osman&quot; in 1865. &quot;Osman&quot; was not published in the integral edition until 1844, when the Illyrian movement chose Gundulić&#x27;s oeuvre as a role model of Croatian. One of the leading Illyrists&#x27; men of letters, politician, linguist and poet Ivan Mažuranić, successfully completed Gundulić&#x27;s &quot;Osman&quot; by composing the last two chapters, which were left unfinished upon the poet&#x27;s death.

The monument to Gundulić by the sculptor Ivan Rendić was unveiled on 25 July 1893 in Dubrovnik&#x27;s largest square, Poljana.

At a charity concert held for the children of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina in September 1995, Bono recited at the end of the song Miss Sarajevo the famous Ivan Gundulić verses: &quot;O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo&quot; (&quot;Oh beautiful, oh precious, oh sweet Liberty&quot;).

The Sunčanica is a historical opera composed by Boris Papandopulo, with a libretto by Marko Soljačić based on Ivan Gundulić&#x27;s Osman and his son Šišmundo Gundulić, who continued Osman with the Sunčanica history. It was first performed at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb (then the &quot;Croatian State Theatre in Zagreb&quot;) on June 13, 1942. The opera was produced by Branko Gavella, choreographed by Ana Roje and Oskar Harmoš, and its main role was played by Srebrenka Jurinac. In 2008, the opera was fully performed for the first time in 62 years when it opened the &quot;16th Zajc&#x27;s Days&quot; festival at the Croatian National Theatre Ivan pl. Zajc in Rijeka.

Gundulić&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.

==Ethnicity==
According to John Van Antwerp Fine Jr., &quot;Gundulić spoke of his people as &quot;Slavs&quot; and regarded all Slavs as being one great whole, a single people&quot;. Different researchers have described him as a Croatian poet. According to Marie-Janine Calic, professor of History at Ludwig Maximilian University, following the Counter-Reformation, a new symbiosis arose between the reformed Catholicism and the (re-)emerging Croatian identity, that undoubtedly influenced the local Baroque art. Thus, this reformed Catholicism was one of the most important factors for developing a separate Croatian ethnic consciousness and Gundulić&#x27;s poem Osman was expression of distinct Croatian (pre-)national feelings. According to Slobodan Drakulić, professor of sociology at Toronto Metropolitan University, the modern Croatian nationalism has as its antecedent a pre-modern Croatian nationalism, which was a 16-17th century indigenous social phenomenon, and one of its representatives was Gundulić.

On the other hand, Gundulić&#x27;s ethnicity is part of the Serb-Croat distinctions in self-identification of the Western South Slavic enlighteners, that was one of the major problems in 20th century Yugoslavia.

Gundulić like other writers from Dubrovnik who wrote in Shtokavian dialect since the 1990s are claimed by Serbian scholars as either solely Serbian or a part of joint Serbian and Croatian cultural heritage. He has been included in &quot;The 100 most prominent Serbs&quot; list compiled by the SANU, and his works are included as a part of the Serbian literature by the Matica srpska, together with other Ragusian writers, in the fifth volume of &quot;Deset vekova srpske književnosti&quot; (Ten centuries of Serbian literature) released in 2010. In December 2021 was passed a cultural property law by the Serbian government in which Gundulić and other Dubrovnik writers are part of Serbian cultural heritage. Croatian scholars with HAZU, Matica hrvatska and representatives of the Croatian government condemn both claims about solely Serbian or joint cultural heritage as an example of Greater Serbian pretension of Croatian history and heritage.

<text>Bangsar is a residential suburb on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, lying about south-west of the city centre. It is part of the Lembah Pantai parliamentary constituency. Bangsar is administered by Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL), unlike other townships in the Klang Valley such as Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya which have their municipal councils. Neighbourhood residents&#x27; associations and business councils play a part in communicating with the local authority, but they exercise no legal or administrative power. Malays make up most of the population at 61%, followed by the Chinese at 24%, Indians at 15%.

== History ==
In the year 1906, Malaya was still under British administration. The London-based Kuala Lumpur Rubber Co. Ltd. (KLR) was incorporated on 19 May 1906. It set out to plant rubber trees around Kuala Lumpur to capitalise on the booming rubber price brought about by the introduction of the modern motor-car which require pneumatic rubber tyres as a replacement for horse-drawn carriages in the United States. Among KLR&#x27;s first board members were a Mr Edouard Bunge and Alfred Grisar, a Belgian. The two men&#x27;s names were contracted to create the name Bunge-Grisar rubber estate or Bangsar Estate.

The Bangsar Estate was owned by its plantation firm Société Financière des Caoutchoucs (Socfin), before it was developed into a residential area. Bangsar Park was the first area to be developed for housing in Kuala Lumpur in 1969. From there Socfin began selling its land to private buyers and from then on, Bangsar began experiencing rapid development.

During the 1950s, several companies housed their staff and families in Bangsar due to its convenient location. The Malayan Railway (now Keretapi Tanah Melayu) used the Off Jalan Bangsar area because the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and depot is less than three kilometres away in Brickfields. The National Electricity Board (now Tenaga Nasional Berhad) housed their staff in Bukit Bangsar since its headquarters is in Pantai Hills. Staff quarters are still found and used in Bangsar today.

Among the earliest government building here is Bangsar Hospital (European Hospital), built in the early 1900s. Towards the end of 1965, an eight-floor building for the Public Health College costing a million ringgit was built in Bukit Bangsar. In 1966, the Health Inspectors Training School and the Nurses Training School was shifted to the new premise in Bangsar. In 1967, the Institute for Public Health was officially inaugurated and eventually expanded to its present form.

During the 13 May Riots in 1969 many shops owned by local Chinese in Bangsar were burnt. Unsuspecting road users passing Bangsar on their way to Petaling Jaya were ambushed leaving Jalan Bangsar littered with burnt-out cars and motorcycles.

Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd developed the Bangsar Baru neighbourhood, comprising 1,125 houses and a thriving business community in 1974. The 1970s saw Bangsar recover into a housing suburb catering to the baby boomers settling in Kuala Lumpur. As their children grew up and formed a large part of the city&#x27;s youth, Bangsar became a sought-after place for the trendy during the 1980s. Among companies that contributed to the demographic development of Bangsar include Sistem Televisyen Malaysia Berhad and Lever Brothers.

== Geography ==

Bangsar lies respectively to the north and south of the neighbouring areas of Pantai Dalam and Damansara, and south-west of Kuala Lumpur city centre.

Bangsar is bounded by Jalan Bangsar and Jalan Pantai Baharu to the south, Universiti Malaya to the west, Jalan Damansara (Sprint Expressway and Bukit Damansara) to the north and Bukit Persekutuan to the east. It has the following neighbourhoods or housing estates: Bangsar Utama, Bukit Bangsar, Bangsar Park, Bukit Bandaraya, Taman SA, Bangsar Baru, Lucky Garden, Pantai Hills, and the areas off Jalan Bangsar. Jalan Maarof is Bangsar&#x27;s main thoroughfare, dividing Bangsar into two main areas: east and west. On the east side lies Taman SA, Bangsar Park, Bukit Bangsar, Bangsar Utama and one-half of Bukit Bandaraya. The remainder of the other neighbourhoods lie on the west.

Bangsar is rather flat in the southern neighbourhoods of Bangsar Utama, Bangsar Park and the Off Jalan Bangsar area. This makes Jalan Bangsar in the south prone to flooding during heavy downpours. The terrain progressively rises towards the north up Bangsar Baru before making a steep drop in elevation after Bukit Bandaraya.
== Demographics ==
Its earliest settlers were railway workers living next to the KL-Klang railway track and rubber estate workers. Starting with a community of mostly Indian civil servants, comprising teachers, firemen, telecommunications officers and the police, Bangsar grew to include young professionals of various races including Malays, Chinese, Indian and expatriates, bringing its population to some 40,000 people by 2005.

==Culture==

===Food===


Typically Malaysian, Bangsar has a wide array of cuisine. Indian Muslim Mamak stalls, south Indian banana leaf restaurants and Malay warungs are easily found. Roadside hawkers usually open in the evenings and close late at night. There are many 24-hour Mamak and banana leaf restaurants. Meanwhile, Chinese kopitiam and seafood restaurants are a little harder to find.

There is also a hawker centre in Bangsar Baru, sometimes referred to as Bangsar Mamak, at the former Jolly Green Giant. Roadside stalls serving drinks, local cakes, burgers, hot dogs and cut fruit are found on many street corners. Ice cream, pastry, satay, rojak and milk is also sold on motorcycles and vans.

Mutiara Bangsar Tower located at Jalan Liku is another one of the most popular place in Bangsar, at 2nd floor food court, there are several Malay foodstalls. 

The Telawi area in Bangsar Baru is sometimes known as &quot;the strip&quot;. It has often been compared to Singapore&#x27;s Holland Village. &quot;The strip&quot; can be skirted on foot in about 15 minutes. A large &quot;pasar malam&quot;, or night market, each Sunday lends the Bangsar Baru a colourful flavour. There is also a daily wet market in Lucky Garden. Another lesser-known &quot;pasar malam&quot; is held in Bukit Bangsar on Wednesdays.

===Art and theatre===
The Actors Studio was located at Bangsar Shopping Centre but has moved to Lot 10. There are several art galleries scattered around Bangsar, especially in Bangsar Baru. Roving buskers, usually performing covers, may be found in Bangsar Baru.

Silverfish, a high brow independent bookshop at Jalan Telawi 3, focuses on literature, philosophy, religion and Malaysiana.

==Infrastructure==

===Medical===
Bangsar&#x27;s first hospital, Bangsar Hospital or European Hospital, was built in the early 1900s. After numerous upgrades and expansion exercises over the years, it is now known as the Institute for Public Health (&quot;Institut Kesihatan Umum&quot;). The privately-owned Pantai Medical Centre was built in 1974 on Jalan Bukit Pantai. The medical centre houses the Pantai Institute of Health Sciences and Nursing. University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), a public hospital, is situated within a five-minute drive through Petaling Jaya. There are also many private clinics spread throughout Bangsar to meet the health needs of the residents.

===Education===
Kindergartens and nurseries are usually operated out of houses. Many tuition centres for school-aged students run out of shop lots and homes. Drama, ballet, and music schools also operate similarly.

Bangsar has three primary schools, which are Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya, Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Pantai, and Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan (T) Jalan Bangsar (a Tamil school). Secondary schools here are Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bangsar and Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya. University Malaya (UM) is five minutes from Bangsar. Also in the vicinity is the &quot;Maktab Perguruan Raja Muda&quot; (Raja Muda Teachers&#x27; College) and the &quot;Maktab Perguruan Bahasa&quot; (Language Teaching College).

===Sports and recreation===
The Bangsar Sports Complex has a swimming pool, a multipurpose hall with badminton courts as well as squash, tennis and basketball. Prospin Tennis management is based here. Several parks and playgrounds are scattered around, namely those at Jalan Bangkung, Jalan Rumpai, Jalan Terasek 7, Jalan Tempinis 5 and Jalan Kurau.

The Kilat Stadium is on Tenaga Nasional&#x27;s grounds. The Kuala Lumpur Hockey Stadium is near Jalan Pantai Baharu, next to Universiti Malaya. It was the venue for the hockey events during the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games in 1998.

== Religion ==
Bangsar is a diverse community with a Muslim mosque and &#x27;suraus&#x27;, Buddhist centres, Christian churches, Hindu temples and other places of worship. Saidina Abu Bakar As Siddiq Mosque was built in 1980 and is located next to Bangsar Village Shopping Centre. It serves the local Muslim community.

Ti-Ratana Buddhist Society, Kuala Lumpur &amp; Selangor (HQ) is located at 17, Lorong Maarof. The centre is mainly focused on community and religious services to the neighbourhood and welfare projects to the poor and needy.

Sri Ramalingaeswarar temple, located near the junction of Lorong Maarof and Jalan Bangsar, serves Hindu devotees. There is also a Jain temple and Indian Muslim surau located in Bangsar Park.

Bangsar Gospel Centre (originally an offshoot of Jalan Imbi Chapel, in the Christian Brethren tradition) operates from a shophouse along Jalan Telawi Tiga. Bangsar Lutheran Church was restarted in 2000 and convened in a house along with Jalan Abdullah. The St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Church is situated at Jalan Tempinis Kiri 1 near Lorong Riong, and there another church is located in Bukit Bandaraya near a primary school.

== Development ==

Bangsar&#x27;s population has increased in recent years and led to an increase in traffic congestions and parking shortages. Developments in neighbouring Bukit Damansara and Mid Valley Megamall have caused increased traffic to pass through Bangsar, especially along Jalan Maarof.

New shops and attractions are sprouting up in Bangsar, but many do not survive for long, particularly food and entertainment outlets. Other long-standing outlets have been successful, and some have opened branches within Bangsar itself. Some examples of successful long-standing businesses are Alexis, La Bodega, The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, and McDonald&#x27;s, on Jalan Telawi and Bangsar Shopping Centre.

The most luxurious condominiums are primarily situated in the vicinity of Bangsar Hill on Jalan Kapas and include Araville, Bangsar Peak, Inara, D&#x27;9 Condominium, Contessa, and KEN Bangsar.

Araville was one of the earliest luxury condominiums on the hill. It is a low-density residential housing of only 60 units with 30 units per block. From the unit, residents can view the Bangsar Hills and Damansara Heights, or Kuala Lumpur city. Genting Highlands is also visible during clear weather. Araville, D9 Condominium, and Casa Vista are most well sought after by local investors and expatriates. These are the only three condominiums that offer an unobstructed view of the city.

The New Pantai Expressway begins at Jalan Bangsar and passes through Jalan Pantai Baharu, Pantai Dalam, Jalan Kuchai Lama, Jalan Klang Lama, Bandar Sunway and terminates at Subang Jaya. The Sprint Expressway, at the northern end of Jalan Maarof connects to Bukit Damansara, Jalan Duta, Sri Hartamas, the New Klang Valley Expressway, the Damansara–Puchong Expressway and several suburbs in Petaling Jaya.

<doc id="451189" wikidata="Q7585835" url="?curid=451189" title="Sri Hartamas">
<text>Sri Hartamas (Golden Estates in English) is an affluent residential township in the Segambut constituency of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The zip and postal code is 50480 or 51200.

==Location, area description and demographic==

Sri Hartamas is located right next to Mont Kiara, another affluent township consisting of mainly high-rise apartment buildings and contains a significant expatriate community, as well as Bukit Damansara to the southeast.

Sri Hartamas has a geographical advantage – this township is located very close to the intersection of four major expressways – the NKVE , PLUS , SPRINT and DUKE that link the area with downtown Kuala Lumpur, surrounding suburbs as well as other major towns of Malaysia. The travel time to anywhere in the Klang Valley area, as a result is relatively short, even during rush hour. 

Residents of the neighbourhood participate in the resident&#x27;s association. In years past, the association has hired a private security firm to patrol the area. The relative isolation of Sri Hartamas and the surrounding area made it prey to crime for a while, though this is not so prevalent today. It is next to the new Immigration Department on one side and the old tax offices on the other, so there can be delays during rush hour. A large mosque is also nearby and this does give rise to a large volumes of traffic, particularly on Friday lunchtimes.

The homes in Sri Hartamas consists of low rise condominium, retail and shopping blocks, townhouses, adjoining semi detached homes and small town bungalows. Built by a Malaysian developer in the 80s, the streets are wide, compared to other areas. The wide streets turned out to a boon for multi car households that live in the area with limited garage space when the neighbourhood went through a renaissance period.

==History==

=== 1990s Renaissance ===
Sri Hartamas gained considerable popularity as a desired neighbourhood during the Asian boom of the mid 1990s. Prior to that, the belief by Malaysians was that the neighbourhood was too isolated (it was located halfway between Kepong and downtown KL), with little to no infrastructure in the area. With no grocer in the neighbourhood at the time, a pint of milk was a 15-minute drive away. As the demand for quality housing in Kuala Lumpur increased, this soon became irrelevant.

Indeed, easy transportation access by virtue of being close to the expressways, proved to be Sri Hartamas&#x27;s saviour. Other developments in the area followed. Down the street, a huge condominium project, &quot;Mont Kiara&quot;, soon took off.

Mont Kiara as well as Sri Hartamas quickly became very popular, not only with the Malaysian young professionals, but also with expatriate families, who hail mostly from Australia, Japan, China, Britain and mainland Europe.

The extra security and the two international private schools in Sri Hartamas that opened at this time made the area a boon for expatriate families. Sri Hartamas, circa 1996–1999 became an international neighbourhood, with residents originating from different countries.

Americans as well as single expatriates on the contrary tended to prefer living in nearby Bangsar, another neighbourhood closer to restaurants, clubs, bars and shopping malls.

=== Changes post-1990s boom ===
The area has made significant progress when it was first planned by Sri Hartamas Development Sdn Bhd to develop the 260-acre township on a rubber plantation. From there, the firm was established under a joint venture with real estate tycoon Tan Sri Chong Kok Lim, Datuk Syed Kechik from Kumpulan Syed Kechik Sdn Bhd and Datuk Wong Kee Tat from Kuala Lumpur Industries Holdings Berhad. The township development ranges from landed properties, terrace houses and semi-detached houses to shoplots.

Another development followed, this time bringing some of the infrastructure that Sri Hartamas initially lacked: restaurants, shops, bars and as well as an outdoor Malaysian style food bazaar. Much of the shops and pricing cater to the relatively affluent and expatriate demographic of the area.

=== Sri Hartamas in the 21st century ===
The isolation and greenery of Sri Hartamas, with easy access to anywhere; the trademark of the area, gave away some of its lustre when access to a third expressway opened up in 2004 that links the area with the rest of Kuala Lumpur. The expressway is known as Sprint Expressway whereby it is one of the busiest expressway during rush hour traffic.

Little of the greenery remains and hence Sri Hartamas is not as quiet as it used to be. The traffic influx as well as other new developments nearby has brought an increasing number of people to the area. Through some of its isolation is gone, the young Malaysian professionals that initially moved into the area stayed on.

However, the expatriate community that once lived here in large numbers dwindled after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1999, when people moved back to their home countries. The area continues to be popular with expatriate families, particularly those with children.

Though no reliable census exists, there is a healthy balance in the number of residents from the different Malaysian ethnic groups in Sri Hartamas, with no obvious majority group, unlike other parts of Malaysia.

In terms of night life Sri Hartamas is now a small, vibrant community. Of particular interest is the wide range of restaurants and bars that have developed around the shopping area in Desa Sri Hartamas. Whilst there are some western style expat bars, there is also a good food court and a multitude of Asian-fusion, Japanese, Thai and Malaysian restaurants.

== Amenities ==
Amenities nearby include: 2 golf courses (KLGCC), a country club, health club and spa. The Hartamas Shopping Centre (housed inside Plaza Damas) is the area&#x27;s biggest shopping mall.
==Infrastructure and facilities==

=== Basic infrastructure===
Infrastructure here is excellent, with developed country utility services and operating standards (i.e. Wired telephone, electricity &amp; broadband internet) and services (i.e. trash collection). Prior to 1995, due to the terrain of the area, mobile phone coverage here on certain operators in Sri Hartamas was spotty at best. Today, all mobile phone carriers have base stations throughout the neighbourhood, with excellent coverage.

=== Education===
Sri Hartamas is home to many government and private schools.

Kindergartens:
*Taska Seri Hartamas (government)
*Smart Reader Kids Desa Seri Hartamas (private)
*Garden International School Early Years Centre (private)

Primary School:
*Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Hartamas (Seri Hartamas National School)

Secondary School:
*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Hartamas (Seri Hartamas National Secondary School)

Colleges:
* Taylor&#x27;s College Sri Hartamas Campus (private) (closed since 2018)
*SRI College (private)

==Politics==
Sri Hartamas is part of the Segambut constituency, currently represented in the Malaysian Parliament by Hannah Yeoh of the DAP since 2018.

==In popular culture==
Sri Hartamas was featured on the American reality TV series, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; Series 11 &quot;All-Stars&quot; in April 2007. As a challenge, the contestants&#x27; who flew in from Poland in Leg 9 of the series, were asked to roam the neighbourhood soliciting (Malay), or &quot;old newspapers&quot; (English) from Sri Hartamas residents for recycling.

== Access ==

=== Public transportation ===
Sri Hartamas is indirectly served by the Segambut KTM Komuter station on the line. rapidKL bus route 190 connects Sri Hartamas and Mont Kiara to the KTM station. 

rapidKL buses T818 and T852 connect Sri Hartamas to Semantan MRT station on the line (SBK Line).

The area is planned to be served by the Sri Hartamas MRT station in the future which is part of the proposed MRT Circle Line.

<text>Hellmuth Hirth (; 24 April 1886 – 1 July 1938) was a German engineer who founded the Mahle GmbH and Hirth companies, manufacturing engine components and complete aircraft engines respectively.

==Biography==
Hirth was born in Heilbronn, the son of engineer and tool-maker Albert Hirth. He was the elder brother of Wolf Hirth who would go on to become a famous sailplane designer and manufacturer.

As a young man, Hirth was sent to the United States to train with the Edison General Electric Company as a mechanic. While abroad, he developed an interest in aircraft, and on his return to Germany in 1909 became involved with the emerging industry. He built his own aircraft in 1910 and soon went to work for the Zeppelin Company building airships. He also became a prominent pilot.

Since 1914 he was a Leutnant of the Fliegertruppe, winning the Iron Cross II and being severely wounded.

In 1920, he founded his own company to manufacture engine components out of light alloys, and by 1927 split the company in order to focus more closely on the aero engine side of the business.

==Death==
On 1 July 1938 Hirth was killed in a plane crash in Karlsbad.

<doc id="451195" wikidata="Q1070732" url="?curid=451195" title="Chester City F.C.">
<text>Chester City Football Club was an association football team from Chester, England, that played in a variety of leagues between 1885 and 2010. The club played its home games at Sealand Road from 1906 to 1991 and moved to the Deva Stadium in 1992 after playing two seasons of home games at Macclesfield Town&#x27;s Moss Rose. Chester held cross-border derby matches with Welsh club Wrexham.

The club was founded in August 1885 and entered The Combination five years later. They won the Combination title in 1908–09 and were admitted into the Lancashire Combination in 1910, gaining promotion out of Division Two in 1910–11. They entered the Cheshire County League in 1919 and were crowned champions three times: 1921–22, 1925–26 and 1926–27. Chester were elected into the Football League in 1931 and remained in the Third Division North until they were placed in the Fourth Division in 1958. Promoted in 1974–75, they were relegated in 1982 and were renamed Chester City the following year. City were promoted out of the Fourth Division in 1985–86 and regained their third tier status in 1993–94 after being relegated the previous season.

Chester City were relegated out of the Football League in 2000, but managed to regain their Football League status after winning the Conference title in 2003–04. Relegated back into non-League football in 2009, Chester City was placed into administration. HM Revenue &amp; Customs served a demand a £ 29,000 Winding-up order on the club in January 2010. The Conference National subsequently suspended Chester – which had been put up for sale – for breaching its financial rules and for cancelling matches. A month after the winding-up order was served the club was expelled from the league, with all its results for that season expunged and future fixtures cancelled. In March 2010, Chester was formally wound up after unsuccessfully trying to join the Welsh Premier League. With the official winding-up of Chester City, supporters immediately began organising the formation of a new phoenix club. The resulting new club, Chester F.C., was officially established in May 2010.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
Chester F.C. was founded in 1885 as an amalgamation of Chester Rovers and Old King&#x27;s Scholars F.C. and initially played their home games at Faulkner Street.

After a few years of playing only friendly and occasional cup matches, Chester joined The Combination League in 1890. In 1898 the club moved to The Old Showground, but were forced to leave a year later when the ground was demolished to make way for housing, leaving the club temporarily disbanded. In 1901, however, they moved to Whipcord Lane; again, their stay was only brief, as they moved out in 1906. Their new stadium on Sealand Road, called simply The Stadium, became their first long-term home and provided them with their first league success, as they won the Combination League in 1909. In 1910, Chester moved to the Lancashire Combination League and stayed there until after World War I, when they became founder members of the Cheshire County League. Charlie Hewitt was appointed manager in 1930, and in 1931 Chester were elected into the Football League, replacing Nelson

===1930s to 1970s===

Throughout the 1930s Chester never finished outside of the top ten in Division Three North. During this period Chester recorded their biggest win in the FA Cup, beating Fulham 5–0 in 1933, and in 1936, they recorded their highest league victory; beating York City 12–0.

The period also saw Chester win the Welsh Cup for the second time after beating growing rivals Wrexham at Sealand Road in May 1933 and successive Third Division North Cup wins. Unfortunately, the side was to be split up by the outbreak of the Second World War. Although the 1946–47 brought a third-place finish and another Welsh Cup triumph, grim times lay ahead. No top half placings would be achieved until the lower divisions were merged in 1958, when Chester were placed in the Fourth Division. They would still have to wait another six years until they finished in the top half of the league.

Chester&#x27;s fortunes began to take a turn for the better after the surprise appointment of South African Peter Hauser as manager in 1963, who put Chester in contention for promotion from the Fourth Division. In 1964–65 all five forwards managed 20 goals – a unique achievement – as Chester scored 119 in the league, though they missed out on promotion.

Apart from missing out on promotion by just a point in 1970–71 the next few years were largely uneventful. Chester kicked off the 1974–75 season as the only Football League team to have never won promotion – they finally broke their duck by finishing fourth in Division Four and pipping Lincoln City to promotion by the narrowest of goal averages. Ken Roberts had the honour of being the first Chester manager to win promotion in the Football League, although much credit went to inspirational coach Brian Green, who for his efforts was presented the &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; award by the &quot;League Trainers’ and Coaches’ Association&quot; and went on to head the Australian national team. 
That season also saw Chester reach the Football League Cup semi-finals. After beating Walsall, Blackpool and Preston North End, Chester hosted Football League champions Leeds United in round four. Two goals from John James and one from Trevor Storton gave Chester a 3–0 win that is regarded as one of the greatest shocks in the competition&#x27;s history. In the next round a goal from James meant Newcastle United were defeated in a home replay to set up a semi–final tie with Aston Villa. Brian Little&#x27;s late goal in the second leg at Villa Park sealed a 5–4 win for eventual cup winners Villa.

Chester began to consolidate their position in the Third Division and enjoyed runs to the FA Cup fifth round in both 1976–77 and 1979–80 under former Manchester City midfielder Alan Oakes. They achieved their best position since the lower divisions were re-organised in the late 1950s by finishing fifth in 1978, missing out on promotion (in the pre-play-off era) by just two points. Chester were also one of just two sides to win the short-lived Debenhams Cup, a competition competed for by the two sides from outside the top two divisions to go farthest in the FA Cup. They beat Port Vale 4–3 on aggregate in 1977 to win their first English national trophy. Chester also continued their giant killing exploits by knocking First Division Coventry City out of the League Cup in 1978–79 and Second Division leaders Newcastle United from the FA Cup a year later. One of the goalscorers was homegrown teenager Ian Rush, who would move for £300,000 to Liverpool at the end of the season and go on to be one of the most famous Welsh strikers in history.

===Chester City===

After Rush departed the goals dried up for Chester and they were back in the basement by 1982. Two years later they finished bottom of the entire Football League but were comfortably re-elected. By this point the club was known as Chester City, having added the suffix in 1983. A future star playing for Chester during this period was full back Lee Dixon, who went on to win several major honours with Arsenal and was capped 22 times by England.

Thanks to the signing of players including Milton Graham, John Kelly and Stuart Rimmer, and astute management of Harry McNally, Chester returned to the Third Division in 1986. Three years later they narrowly missed out on a play-off spot as McNally worked miracles on a limited budget, but further bad times lay ahead. In 1990, Chester moved out of their Sealand Road home and temporarily shared Macclesfield&#x27;s Moss Rose ground. Despite regularly attracting tiny crowds, Chester defied the odds to avoid relegation from Division Three in both 1990–91 and 1991–92. They returned to the city, moving to the new Deva Stadium in 1992 in the renamed Division Two after a Football League restructure. The first competitive match at the Deva Stadium took place on 25 August 1992 against Stockport County, with the visitors running out 2–1 victors. The following Saturday saw the first League game at the new home of Chester City, which saw the Blues overcome Burnley 3–0. The Deva Stadium is notable for being right on the England–Wales border: the pitch is in Wales, but the entrance and part of the club offices are in England.

Chester suffered a landslide relegation in their first season back in Chester, before winning promotion straight back as Division Three runners-up. The unexpected resignation of manager Graham Barrow and the departure of several key players in the close season of 1994 left Chester with a threadbare squad, and they were comfortably relegated back to Division Three in 1995. They would stay there for five years, suffering a play-off semi-final defeat to Swansea City in 1997.

===Financial problems and demise===

Under owner Mark Guterman, Chester entered administration in October 1998. The club consolidated their position in Third Division under Kevin Ratcliffe in 1998–99 and were bought by the American Terry Smith in July 1999. Ratcliffe resigned the following month and Smith took over as manager, overseeing just four league wins in as many months in charge. Ian Atkins was brought in as manager, but Chester lost their 69-year Football League status on 6 May 2000 on goal difference after losing to Peterborough United.

The first season in the Football Conference saw Chester finish 8th, but the campaign was overshadowed by continuing off-field problems. By the summer of 2001, Chester were in grave danger of going out of business and the appointment of the owner&#x27;s friend Gordon Hill as manager was deeply unpopular with fans. The arrival of new chairman Stephen Vaughan in September 2001 saw Mark Wright appointed as manager and Chester avoided relegation in 2002. A year later they qualified for the Conference play-offs, but missed out on promotion by losing a penalty shoot-out to Doncaster Rovers.

Starting the 2003–04 season as favourites to win the Football Conference, Chester suffered just four defeats during the campaign, winning the title and promotion back to the Football League with a 1–0 victory over Scarborough in the penultimate match of the season. It was the club&#x27;s first national league title.
The day before the start of the 2004–05 season Mark Wright resigned. Ray Mathias was left as the caretaker charge and by the end of August, Chester were bottom of the League. New manager Ian Rush helped the club avoid relegation, but was criticised by opposing managers for using &quot;long ball&quot; tactics. Rush resigned in April 2005 after chairman Stephen Vaughan dismissed assistant manager Mark Aizlewood without Rush&#x27;s knowledge.

In April 2005, Keith Curle took over. A series of poor results saw Chester fall from fourth to bottom in Football League Two. Mark Wright surprisingly returned to the club and a run of five successive wins late in the season secured another campaign in the Football League. The 2006–07 season was most notable for the club&#x27;s reinstatement in the FA Cup after Bury, who had beaten Chester 3–1 in a second round replay, were thrown out for fielding an ineligible player, Stephen Turnbull. Wright was sacked in April 2007, being replaced by Scotsman Bobby Williamson. Williamson was sacked as manager in March 2008, after Chester had won only one of their last fourteen games. Club coach Simon Davies replaced him after a spell as caretaker manager. Survival was clinched in the penultimate game of the season after a 0–0 draw with Stockport County. They ended their season at 22nd, their lowest position at the time since returning to the Football League in 2004–05.

A poor start to 2008–09 saw Davies sacked in November 2008 with the club out of all cup competitions and struggling in the league table. Mark Wright returned for his third spell as manager on a non-contract basis. Beset by an ongoing transfer embargo, Chester continued to struggle throughout the remainder of the campaign, and a 2–1 home defeat by Darlington on the final day of the season sealed Chester&#x27;s demise and a return to non-league football after five years back in The Football League. Two weeks after the final match the club entered administration.

The following month, creditors voted in favour of a rescue package by Stephen Vaughan&#x27;s family, ahead of the Football Conference board&#x27;s AGM where the club was accepted into the Conference National with a 10-point deduction. He was replaced as manager by Mick Wadsworth.

In the summer of 2009 Chester City was placed into the hands of administrators with debts of £7 million, inclusive of Stephen Vaughan&#x27;s £5.5 million investments, which incurred a 10-point penalty. This in turn was increased to a 25-point penalty once the HMRC overturned a cva. A potential buyer emerged over the summer, when local fan Mike David Green sought to create a consortium with northern businessman Andy Jinks. However, any potential deal fell through due to Jinks&#x27;s commitment issues. A new buyer was found for the club on 26 May 2009 in the shape of &quot;Chester City FC (2004) Ltd&quot;, a company set up by former chairman Stephen Vaughan and his family. The Football Association withheld the transfer of the affiliation membership from Chester City Football Club to Chester City Football Club 2004 Ltd, and on the eve of the new season stopped Chester City FC playing the first game of the 2009/2010 season away at Grays Athletic. This came less than 24 hours after the Football Conference released an &quot;interim&quot; press release stating Chester could take their place in the fifth tier of English football. The club reluctantly cut back on the Centre of Excellence youth training scheme by retaining only their youth team. Fans waited at the Deva Stadium for a meeting with Stephen Vaughan and other board representatives to find out the truth regarding the future and showed their support for the club by meeting in the city at the time that they should be kicking off the new season.

Chester City FC issued a press release on 10 August 2009 describing the meetings that took place between the club, FA and Football Conference regarding the transfer of the FA membership at the beginning of the 2009–2010 season. They confirmed that the home match versus Gateshead FC had also been called off by the Football Conference, and that the FA had asked the other clubs to vote on whether Chester City should be allowed to continue in the division. The press release ended: &quot;We have now been informed that we must again await an FA decision which will be taken at some time on Thursday [13 August 2009] and can do no more than publicly express our ever increasing frustration with the entire process&quot;. The FA granted the transfer of membership to Chester City Football Club 2004 Ltd at 16:00 on 13 August 2009.

On the pitch, Mick Wadsworth was sacked after a bad start to the season, during which he branded the club&#x27;s atmosphere even worse than that of the original Gretna F.C., which he had managed during the club&#x27;s final months of existence in 2008. Jim Harvey replaced Wadsworth and managed an immediate upturn in form, which gave fans some slim hope that the club might still survive in the Conference National. However, dwindling attendances, a pitch protest and continued financial problems meant that the playing squad was gradually released to cut the wage bill though, and Chester&#x27;s improved form did not last. Harvey was himself sacked in January 2010 by Morrell Maison, the club&#x27;s new director of football, who then installed himself as the new manager. He oversaw what was arguably the club&#x27;s lowest moment when just 518 people turned up to see the team beaten 1–0 by lower-league Fleetwood Town in the FA Trophy. By this point Chester were well adrift at the bottom of the table, and results did not improve. What proved to be the club&#x27;s final match was a 2–1 home defeat against Ebbsfleet United.

On 9 February 2010, Chester City failed to fulfil a fixture at Forest Green Rovers. It was reported by the BBC that the players refused to get on the team bus and that the players had also threatened twice to strike following non-payment of wages. Three days later, the Football Conference suspended Chester for seven days, during which their fixtures were suspended.

The suspension was to allow them to put their finances in order and respond to the charge of breaking five separate Conference rules. The breaches include the abandoned game against Forest Green and the cancelling of a game due to an unpaid police bill. At a meeting of the Football Conference board on 18 February, it was recommended that Chester be expelled from the league because the members of the board &quot;failed to be convinced&quot; that the club would fulfil its fixtures. The decision ultimately rested with the other member clubs. An independent valuation at the time valued the club at just £1.

At this point Chester remained anchored to the bottom of the Conference National on −3 points. The club was expelled following a vote at a general meeting between the member clubs of the league on 26 February at Nene Park. The results for the season so far were expunged from the record. On 9 March the club submitted an application to join the Welsh Premier League, but the club was formally wound up in the High Court the following day. The club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; group, City Fans United (CFU), announced that they were looking to reform in the lower divisions of the English football hierarchy, with a CFU spokesman claiming the club would play football once again in the pre-season.

Falling attendances had done the club no favours during its final few years. The club&#x27;s average attendance had stood at nearly 3,000 in the 2005–06 season, but in the relegation season of three years later it fell below the 2,000 mark. In the club&#x27;s final season, attendances average less than 1,300; the lowest attendance on 19 January was a mere 425 (the lowest league attendance in the club&#x27;s history in any division) and the attendance at the club&#x27;s final home game on 6 February was 460.

On 25 March 2010 it was announced that CFU&#x27;s new club would be called Chester F.C., and would play at the old club&#x27;s Deva Stadium. The club began playing in July 2010 in time for the 2010–11 season, and was placed in Northern Premier League Division One North, three tiers below where Chester City had been prior to their collapse. Three successive promotions took Chester F.C. into the Conference Premier in 2013.

==Colours and badge==

Chester&#x27;s original colours were red and white, and these colours were used until the club temporarily disbanded in 1899. The colours were changed to green and white, in 1901 when the club moved to Whipcord Lane. Various combinations were used until the outbreak of the First World War; these included green shirts and white shorts, green and white stripes and green and white halves. In 1919 the colours changed again, with their new dark green shirts earning Chester the nickname the &quot;Ivies&quot;. 1920 saw another change of colours, this time to black and white, which earned Chester the nickname &quot;Magpies&quot;. Black and White remained the colours until 1930, when they were changed to blue and white stripes. For the next thirty years the colours remained unchanged, with the exception of the 1952–53 season, when Chester adopted white shirts and black shorts.

The colours were changed yet again in the 1959–60 season, when it became green shirts and socks with gold trim and white shorts. 1962 saw Chester revert to blue and white stripes, albeit with a much thinner blue stripe, and blue shorts instead of the previous black ones. The 1968–69 season saw Chester change to an all-sky blue kit, which remained for four years. In the 1972–73 season the club again reverted to blue and white stripes, and in 1974 the seals badge appeared on the kit for the first time. A shirt sponsorship first appeared on Chester&#x27;s kit in the 1982–83 season. The blue and white and seals badge disappeared in the 1983–84 season, as the re -named Chester City F.C. changed to blue shirts and white shorts. The shirt became predominately blue in the 1988–89 season for the final season at Sealand Road. The first season at the Deva Stadium saw the colours change to a blue shirt with white speckles. The colours returned to blue and white stripes the following season. From 1995, the club appeared in blue and white stripes of varying thickness and shades.

In the 1958–59 season the city&#x27;s coat of arms was augmented onto the shirt. During the early to mid-1960s, the supporters association badge was used. From 1974–75 to 1982–83, the club used the seals badge. The design was picked from a competition held by a local newspaper, with the winner coming from the school of art in Handbridge. The club&#x27;s final crest was an adaptation of the City of Chester crest.

===Shirt sponsors and manufacturers===
==Reserve and youth teams==
Chester&#x27;s reserve team played in the Central League Division One West until 2007–08 but after that point only staged friendly matches.

The club&#x27;s youth set-up was enjoying its most fruitful spell since the late 1990s, with several products having graduated to the senior ranks. The youth team competed in the Youth Alliance North West Conference, while they were hoping to emulate their achievements in 2006–07 of reaching the FA Youth Cup fourth round, when they surprisingly knocked out Tottenham Hotspur.

Chester&#x27;s Centre of Excellence was officially closed down at the start of the 2009–2010 season, due to the club&#x27;s relegation to the Conference National, although most players remained at the club, with several, such as James Owen, Jack Rea and Lloyd Ellams playing in the senior side in the club&#x27;s final season.

==Rivals==

Chester had a long-running rivalry with Wrexham. The clubs were just 12 miles apart but separated by the border between England and Wales. Wrexham edged the English–Welsh derby with 30 victories to Chester&#x27;s 26 in Football League meetings. Between 1986 and 2005, the sides were in the same division in just one season (1994–95) but they were then Football League Two opponents in the three campaigns from 2005–06 to 2007–08. In 2009–10 the sides clashed again in the Conference National after Chester followed Wrexham out of the Football League, resulting in a 0–0 draw before the club was recently dissolved.

Tranmere Rovers and Crewe Alexandra were traditionally strong rivals but Chester had not met either in a league game since the early 1990s. In recent times, a growing rivalry developed between Chester and Shrewsbury Town, following a series of controversial meetings. In November 2006, a large brawl broke out between players of both sides at the end of Chester&#x27;s 2–1 defeat at Gay Meadow.

Following an alleged biting incident on Stockport County striker Liam Dickinson, by Sean Hessey, commenced a short-lived rivalry with their Cheshire rivals.

Macclesfield Town were county rivals with Chester.

<text>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge Football Club () is a professional association football club based in Dagenham, Greater London, England. They play in the . Often known simply as Dagred or Dagenham and abbreviated when written to Dag &amp; Red, they are nicknamed the Daggers. They play their home games at Victoria Road.

The club was formed in 1992 through a merger of Dagenham and Redbridge Forest, the latter merged from Ilford, Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue. The club&#x27;s traditional colours are red and blue, to represent the merged teams. The club replaced Redbridge Forest in the Football Conference but were relegated in 1996. They won the Isthmian League title in 1999–2000 and qualified for the next three Conference play-offs, missing out on the 2001–02 title on goal difference and losing the 2003 Conference play-off final. They secured promotion into the Football League after winning the Conference title in the 2006–07 season. They then moved up from League Two after winning the 2010 play-off final, though were relegated the next season after finishing 21st in League One. Dagenham were relegated back into non-League football, and have remained there since 2016.

==History==

===Formation===
Dagenham &amp; Redbridge F.C. was formed in 1992 following a merger between two clubs – Dagenham and Redbridge Forest. Both clubs had fallen on hard times due to dwindling attendances. The club can trace back its ancestry to 1881 as Redbridge Forest was an amalgamation of three of the amateur game&#x27;s most famous clubs, Ilford, Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue. Between the clubs they won the FA Trophy once, FA Amateur Cup seven times, Isthmian League 20 times, Athenian League six times, Essex Senior Cup 26 times and London Senior Cup 23 times.

===Non-League===
Dagenham &amp; Redbridge spent its inaugural season in the Football Conference taking the place of Redbridge Forest. The club&#x27;s first fixture in its new guise was on 25 July 1992, an 8–0 thrashing of Great Wakering Rovers in a friendly. The first competitive result was a 2–0 win over Merthyr Tydfil in the Conference.

Dagenham &amp; Redbridge spent several seasons in the Football Conference but was relegated to the Isthmian League Premier Division in 1996. The club remained in that division until winning promotion in 1999–2000, going on to establish itself as one of the strongest clubs in the Conference, finishing third, second and fifth in its first three seasons back following promotion.

The club was narrowly beaten to the Conference title by Boston United in 2002 on goal difference. Boston United was subsequently found guilty of inappropriately making illegal payments to its players in its title-winning season. Dagenham &amp; Redbridge attempted unsuccessfully to have itself declared Conference Champions, and therefore take Boston&#x27;s contentious place in The Football League. A four-point deduction was put in place against Boston United for the following season but not for the season in which the irregularities had been committed.

The Daggers then declined somewhat, finishing the 2003–04, 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons in mid-table. On 27 February 2004 the club were hammered 9–0 at home by Hereford United, equalling the record highest winning margin in the Conference.

The 2006–07 season saw Dagenham &amp; Redbridge battle it out with Oxford United for the top of the league spot. Despite Oxford quickly racing to the top, a collapse in Oxford&#x27;s form combined with an excellent run for the Daggers saw them overtake Oxford in the league. On 7 April, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge beat Aldershot Town 2–1 to build an unbeatable lead in the league, becoming Conference champions, meaning the club would play in the Football League for the first time in its history.

===2007–2015: Football League===
Dagenham &amp; Redbridge played its first match in the Football League on 11 August 2007, a 1–0 defeat to Stockport County. The club won its first Football League game at home to Lincoln City on 1 September 2007. The Daggers finished the season in 20th place, ensuring a second season of Football League competition. The following season, the Daggers reached their highest ever position of eighth. They narrowly missed out on the League Two play-offs after losing to Shrewsbury Town at home on the final day of the season.

The 2009–10 season saw the Daggers promoted from League Two to League One via the play-offs. They defeated Rotherham United in a dramatic 3–2 play-off final at Wembley on 30 May 2010. Twice the Daggers took the lead, only to concede moments later. Jon Nurse regained the advantage for Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, scoring a scrappy 70th-minute winner. The Daggers first game in League One was a 2–0 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. It was an unsuccessful season in League One as they finished 21st and were relegated on the last day of the 2010–11 season back to League Two.

They eventually finished the 2011–12 season in 19th place back in League Two. John Still left the club during the 2012–13 season to join Luton Town after nine years at the helm. The Daggers would finish in 22nd. Following the club&#x27;s safety from relegation, Wayne Burnett was appointed as manager on a permanent basis after a spell as caretaker manager. Despite an inconsistent start to the 2013–14 season, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge finished in a respectable ninth place. In the 2014–15 League Cup, the Daggers played out an entertaining 6–6 match with Brentford before losing the subsequent penalty shootout. The League Cup paid tribute to the historic match by removing the goal nets at Victoria Road, putting them on display at the National Football Museum. In the 2015–16 season, the Daggers started the season poorly. Burnett was sacked in December 2015, to be replaced by John Still. In the 2015–16 FA Cup, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge visited Premier League club Everton in the third round, losing 2–0. Still was unable to save Dagenham &amp; Redbridge from relegation in his third spell. After a 3–2 defeat away to Leyton Orient, relegation from League Two was confirmed.

====Failed match-fixing plot====

Following newspaper reports, an investigation launched by the National Crime Agency jailed two players and businessman, Krishna Ganeshan, Chann Sankaran and Michael Boateng, a Whitehawk player, for match-fixing. Moses Swaibu was similarly charged in January 2014.
They were convicted of conspiracy to commit bribery for a failed plot to fix a game between AFC Wimbledon and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on 26 November. It is believed that the case may have been part of a wider Singaporean match-fixing syndicate which Europol and other investigations uncovered.

===2016–present: return to non-League===
In their first season back in the National League, they ended the season in fourth place; they lost their play-off semi-final to Forest Green Rovers. The 2017–18 season started positively, but after the club was hit by a financial crisis midway through the season, the Daggers finished the campaign in 11th place. The financial crisis was resolved early in the 2018–19 season.

In May 2024, Club Underdog, a subsidiary of North Sixth group, reached an agreement in principle to purchase the club. They became the fifth club owned by the group, joining Italian clubs Campobasso and Ascoli, Swiss club FC Locarno and American club Brooklyn FC.

Manager since March 2023, Ben Strevens was sacked in December 2024, after a run of just seven wins from 23 league fixtures left the Daggers five points above the relegation zone.

<text>Farnborough Football Club is a semi-professional football club based in Farnborough, Hampshire, England. Founded in 1967 as Farnborough Town, they are currently members of the , the sixth tier of English football and play at Cherrywood Road.

==History==
The club was established as Farnborough Town in 1967 and joined the Surrey Senior League in 1968. Their first league match saw them beat Surbiton Byron 7–6. In 1971 they reached the top division of the Surrey Senior League, and after finishing as runners-up in 1971–72, they moved up to the Spartan League. They went on to win three consecutive league titles, losing only one league match during each of the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons. When the league merged with the Metropolitan–London League to form the London Spartan League in 1975, the club were placed in Division One, and were its first champions.

Following their move to Cherrywood Road, Farnborough moved up to Division Two of the Athenian League in 1976. They won the division at the first attempt, and were subsequently accepted into Division Two of the Isthmian League. During their domination of the Spartan and Athenian league divisions, the club went 87 matches unbeaten at home between 1973 and 1977. In 1978–79 they won Division Two of the Isthmian League, earning promotion to Division One. The 1980–81 season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 2–1 at Yeovil Town. Another first round appearance in 1983–84 ended with a 2–1 defeat at Barking. They reached the first round again the following season and faced Football League opposition for the first time, losing 3–0 at Hereford United. The season also saw them win the Division One title, resulting in promotion to the Premier Division. They were Premier Division runners-up behind Leytonstone/Ilford in 1988–89 and were promoted to the Football Conference as Leytonstone/Ilford were unable to be promoted due to their ground failing to meet the necessary criteria.

Farnborough were relegated at the end of their first season in the Conference and were placed in the Premier Division of the Southern League. They won the division at the first attempt to earn promotion back to the Conference. After reaching the first round of the FA Cup in all but one of the seasons between 1983–84 and 1990–91, the club progressed beyond the first round for the first time in 1991–92; after a first round replay win over Halesowen Town, they defeated Third Division Torquay United 4–3 in a second round replay. They were drawn at home to top division West Ham. With the game switched to the Boleyn Ground, they held West Ham to a 1–1 draw before losing the replay 1–0. The season also saw them finish fifth in the Conference, but they were relegated back to the Southern League at the end of the following season.

Farnborough were Southern League champions again in 1993–94, making an immediate return to the Conference. The club spent five seasons in the Conference until being relegated at the end of the 1998–99 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the table. They were placed in the Premier Division of the Isthmian League, which they went on to win in 2000–01, resulting in promotion back to the Conference. In 2002–03 the club progressed beyond the first round of the FA Cup for a second time; after a 5–1 win against Harrogate Town in the first round, they defeated Southport 3–0 in the second round and Third Division Darlington 3–2 in the third round. They were then drawn at home to Arsenal in the fourth round, although the game was switched to Highbury. Following a 5–1 defeat, manager Graham Westley left the club, also taking seven players with him as he moved to Stevenage Borough. Farnborough remained in the Conference (and its new top division the Conference National) until the end of the 2004–05 season, when they were relegated to the Conference South. A third-place finish in 2005–06 saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, but they lost 3–0 to Histon in the semi-finals.

In 2006–07 Farnborough went into administration and were deducted ten points. In May 2007 the club was expelled from the Football Conference and were reformed as Farnborough Football Club. They were admitted to Division One South &amp; West of the Southern League, which they went on to win at the first attempt, earning promotion to the Premier Division. In 2008–09 they were Premier Division runners-up, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Hemel Hempstead Town 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in the semi-finals, they lost 1–0 to Gloucester City in the final. The following season saw them win the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Conference South. They were runners-up in their first season in the division and entered the promotion play-offs. After a 2–1 aggregate win over local rivals Woking in the semi-finals (winning 1–0 away and drawing 1–1 at home), they lost the final 4–2 to Ebbsfleet United.

Farnborough then began to suffer financial problems. In 2011–12 they were deducted five points after submitting misleading financial information to the Football Conference, and had ten points deducted the following season after going into administration again. They were relegated to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League at the end of the 2014–15 season and were subsequently demoted to Division One Central of the Southern League at the end of the 2015–16 season despite not finishing in the relegation zone due to their financial situation. They were Division One Central runners-up the following season; in the subsequent play-offs they defeated Egham Town 4–0 in the semi-finals before beating Barton Rovers 2–0 in the final to earn promotion back to the Premier Division of the Southern League. League reorganisation saw the club placed in the Southern League Premier South Division in 2018. After finishing third in 2021–22, they defeated Metropolitan Police in the play-off semi-final, before beating Hayes &amp; Yeading United 2–1 in the final to secure promotion to the National League South. In 2022–23 the club defeated League Two side Sutton United 2–0 in the first round of the FA Cup, before losing 4–1 to Wrexham in the second.

==Ground==
The club initially played on a council pitch at the Queen&#x27;s Road recreation ground. However, to progress in the non-League pyramid the club had to find a ground that could be enclosed. A site on Cherrywood Road was obtained and developed with support from a local company.

<text>Forest Green Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system.

Formed in October 1889, the club became founder members of the Mid Gloucestershire League five years later. Competing in various local league competitions for much of the 20th century, they won a multitude of league titles: the Dursley &amp; District League (1902–03), the Stroud and District Football League (1911–12 and 1920–21), the Stroud Premier League (1934–35, 1935–36 and 1936–37), the North Gloucestershire League (1920–21 and 1921–22), and the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League (1937–38, 1949–50 and 1950–51). They became founder members of the Gloucestershire County League in 1968, before they were moved up to the Premier Division of the Hellenic League seven years later.

Forest Green won the Hellenic League in the 1981–82 season and lifted the FA Vase after beating Rainworth Miners Welfare in the final at Wembley. They spent the next 13 years in the Midland Division of the Southern League, and briefly competed under the name Stroud F.C. Reverting to the name Forest Green Rovers, the club won successive Southern League Southern Division and Premier Division titles in 1996–97 and 1997–98, winning promotion into the Conference. Reaching the 1999 FA Trophy final, which they lost, they became the first club to reach the finals of both the FA Vase and FA Trophy. They also reached the 2001 FA Trophy final, which again they lost. Twice reprieved from relegation from the Conference National due to the demotion of other clubs, the club was transformed following investment from green energy industrialist Dale Vince in 2010.

Under Vince&#x27;s chairmanship Forest Green became the world&#x27;s first vegan football club in 2015, and the New Lawn was installed with numerous eco-friendly innovations. Investment in the playing squad saw the club compete for promotion into the English Football League, which they achieved with victory in the 2017 National League play-offs, having been beaten in the semi-finals in 2015 and in the 2016 final. Forest Green were then promoted to League One in 2022 for the first time in their history, following an EFL League Two title win. They were relegated after one season, and suffered a successive relegation back to non-League in the following year, ending their seven-year spell in the Football League. They have played their home games at The New Lawn since 2006, when they moved from their original home at The Lawn Ground.

==History==
===Local and county leagues===
The club was established in 1889 by Rev. E. J. H. Peach, representing the Forest Green area of Nailsworth. The name Rovers was adopted in 1893, and the following year the club were founder member of the Mid-Gloucestershire League. Their first home league match on 6 October was a 1–1 draw with Brimscombe, and the club went on to finish the 1894–95 season in third place. Nailsworth had become an urban district in 1894 and there was an effort to ensure the town was represented by a football team. As a result, the club was renamed Nailsworth Association Football Club and many members of the original team were replaced by players from Nailsworth, although they continued to play at the original Lawn Ground in Forest Green. However, the club withdrew from the league during the 1896–97 season.

The club was re-established in 1898 under the Forest Green Rovers name, and absorbed Nailsworth Thursday shortly afterwards. They joined both Division One of the Mid-Gloucestershire League and also the Dursley &amp; District League for the 1899–1900 season. The Mid-Gloucestershire League folded in 1901, with Forest Green left playing in the Dursley &amp; District League. In 1902–03 they joined the new Stroud &amp; District League, also continuing in the Dursley &amp; District League. In the Stroud &amp; District League they finished as runners-up to Brimscombe, whilst in the Dursley &amp; District League they finished joint top of the table with Stonehouse after being awarded the points from an unplayed match against Chalford. As a result, a play-off match was held to decide the championship, with over 1,000 spectators watching Forest Green win 2–1 in extra time. In 1906–07 they finished bottom of the Stroud &amp; District League with zero points (although they had won one game, they had two points deducted for fielding an ineligible player). They withdrew from the Dursley &amp; District League in 1908.

In 1911 Forest Green merged with Nailsworth to form Nailsworth &amp; Forest Green United, continuing to play at the Lawn Ground and in the Stroud &amp; District League; the new club won the league, losing only one match all season. They entered a team into the Dursley &amp; District League in 1912–13, but withdrew from the Stroud &amp; District League after only four matches. After World War I the club rejoined the league and the 1919–20 season saw them finish joint top of the table with Chalford and Stonehouse. The league subsequently held a draw to decide the championship, with Forest Green drawn against Stonehouse in a semi-final, with the winner to play Chalford for the title. However, Stonehouse beat Forest Green 3–2 in the semi-final match. In 1920 the club also entered a team into the North Gloucestershire League and went on to win both leagues, as well as the Northern Junior Cup. They repeated the double league championship the following season. They were founder members of the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League in 1922, but left the league at the end of the 1922–23 season to return to the Stroud &amp; District League.

Forest Green finished as runners-up in 1924–25 and 1925–26, before rejoining the Gloucestershire Northern Senior League in 1926. They went on to finish as runners-up in 1926–27 before leaving the league again to play in the new Stroud Premier League. After finishing fourth in the league, the club returned to the Northern Senior League at the end of the season, although they also kept a team in the Stroud Premier League. The club withdrew from the Stroud Premier League in 1930, the league for a third time in 1934, rejoining the Stroud Premier League. They were Stroud Premier League champions for three successive seasons in 1934–35, 1935–36 and 1936–37, before re-entering the Northern Senior League in 1937. They went on to win the league title in 1937–38. After finishing as runners-up in 1948–49, they won successive league titles in 1949–50 and 1950–51. Although the club finished as runners-up in 1952–53, they were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1954–55 season. However, they were Division Two champions the following season, and were promoted back to Division One. Forest Green were amongst the founders of the Gloucestershire County League in 1968, where they played until moving up to the Premier Division of the Hellenic League in 1975 under the management of Peter Goring.

===Regional leagues===
Forest Green&#x27;s first season in the Hellenic League Premier Division saw them finish fourth. Although they then spent two seasons in lower mid-table, a third-place finish in 1978–79 was the start of a successful four years, culminating in the 1981–82 season, in which they won the Hellenic League and reached the final of the FA Vase. At Wembley they defeated Rainworth Miners Welfare 3–0 to win the trophy. At the end of the season the club were promoted to the Midland Division of the Southern League. Although they finished third in their first season in the new league, the next six seasons were spent in mid-table.

In 1989, the club was renamed Stroud Football Club. Another season in mid-table was followed by two in which they finished in the bottom five. They also participated in the Welsh Cup for four seasons, reaching the quarter finals in 1990–91 where they were defeated by the eventual runners-up Wrexham. After reverting to their original name, the club continued to struggle in the league until they were transferred to the Southern Division in 1995. After finishing eighth under Frank Gregan in 1995–96, they won the division the following season, earning promotion to the Premier Division of the Southern League. The 1997–98 season saw them win the Southern League Premier Division, securing a second successive promotion and entry to the Football Conference.

===Conference League===
In Forest Green&#x27;s first season in the Conference they finished twelfth, as well as reaching the final of the FA Trophy, becoming the first team to play in the final of both the FA Vase and the FA Trophy. However, they lost 1–0 to Kingstonian. The following season saw another first as the club reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time; after beating Guiseley 6–0 in the first round, they lost 3–0 at home to Torquay United in the second. In November 2000 Gregan was replaced as manager by former England international Nigel Spink; the club reached the FA Trophy final again at the end of the season, losing 1–0 to Canvey Island.

In 2004–05 Forest Green finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Northwich Victoria were demoted due to issues with their stadium. In 2007–08 the club defeated Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time, beating Rotherham United 3–0 in a first round replay, before losing 3–2 at Swindon Town. The following season saw them reach the third round of the Cup for the first time, beating Team Bath and then Rochdale to set a third round tie at home to Derby County which they lost 4–3 in front of a record crowd of 4,836. Another third round appearance in 2009–10 ended with a 2–1 defeat at Notts County.

The 2009–10 season saw Forest Green finish in the relegation zone, but another reprieve from relegation was won when Salisbury City were expelled for breaking financial rules. The club was then taken over by Ecotricity founder Dale Vince; Vince set out plans to make the club more eco-friendly, including removing red meat from players&#x27; diets, stopping selling meat products in the ground and treating the pitch with organic fertiliser.

Forest Green finished fifth in the Conference in 2014–15, qualifying for the promotion play-offs; they went on to lose 3–0 on aggregate to Bristol Rovers in the semi-finals. The following season saw them finish as runners-up in the renamed National League, their highest-ever league position; in the subsequent play-offs they defeated Dover Athletic 2–1 in the semi-finals, before losing 3–1 to Grimsby Town in the final at Wembley. A third consecutive play-off campaign was secured with a third-place finish in 2016–17. After beating Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 3–1 in the semi-finals, the club defeated Tranmere Rovers by the same scoreline in the final at Wembley, earning promotion to League Two. This made Nailsworth the smallest town ever to host a Football League club and ended a 19 season long run in the National League without promotion, the longest consecutive period since promotion to the English Football League began.

===Football League===
The 2018–19 season saw them finish fifth in League Two. They went on to lose 2–1 to Tranmere Rovers in the play-off semi-finals. Another play-off campaign in 2020–21 saw them lose 5–4 on aggregate to Newport County.

In 2021–22 they secured an automatic promotion spot to League One after a draw against Bristol Rovers, and clinched the title following a 2–2 draw away at Mansfield Town. They won their first League One game, defeating Bristol Rovers 2–1 away thanks to a late goal. At the end of the 2022–23 season, Rovers were relegated back to League Two in 24th position.

In 2023–24, following relegation from League One, Rovers finished in the relegation zone again in League Two after finishing 24th, thus suffering the indignity of back-to-back relegations into the National League, ending their seven-year spell in the Football League.

==Green credentials==
In 2018 Forest Green Rovers became the first football club in the world to be certified carbon neutral under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) initiative Climate Neutral Now.

The United Nations has recognised Forest Green Rovers as the world&#x27;s first carbon-neutral football club and it was described by FIFA as the &quot;greenest team in the world&quot;.

In September 2020, Spain and Arsenal fullback Héctor Bellerín became the second-largest shareholder in the club.

On 2 August 2021, Forest Green Rovers announced a new partnership with clean energy and electric vehicle YouTube channel, Fully Charged and named their pitch accordingly to The Fully Charged New Lawn.

==Colours and crest==
The previous club badge was very similar to the FC Barcelona badge. The flag of St. George appeared on both badges, showing his links to England as well as Catalonia. Rovers&#x27; home kit for many years was a black and white striped shirt with black shorts.

In May 2011, the club released a consultation for supporters inviting opinions on the club&#x27;s decision to change its badge. The new badge was used from the beginning of the 2011–12 season.

On 2 July 2012, it was announced that the club would change its home strip from its traditional black and white stripes to a lime green shirt with black shorts and socks. The decision to move away from the traditional black and white stripes proved controversial with many supporters. The away strip was also changed to an all-white kit with the dates &#x27;1899–2012&#x27; near the neckline of the kit to indicate the years when the club first played in an all-white kit and the decision to bring it back in 2012.

In the summer of 2014 the home strip was changed to lime green and black stripes on the front, with a plain green back, green shorts and black and green striped socks in order to align with sponsor Ecotricity&#x27;s marketing colours. On 19 August 2014, the new away strip was announced, which would be a modern version of the traditional home strip of black and white striped shirt, black shorts and red socks.

In 2021, the team became the first in the world to play in a football kit made from a composite material consisting of recycled plastic and coffee grounds.

==Rivalries==
Gloucestershire rivals Cheltenham Town are seen as the club&#x27;s main rivals. Fixtures between the two sides are humorously named &quot;El Glosico&quot;, a play-on-words of the famous &quot;El Clásico&quot; fixture.

During the club&#x27;s years in the non-League pyramid, the club maintained local rivalries with Gloucester City, and Bath City. Smaller rivalries have also since developed with Bristol Rovers, Newport County and Swindon Town during Forest Green&#x27;s Football League years.

==Stadium==

The club initially played at a ground &#x27;at the top of the hill&#x27; in Forest Green known as the Lawn Ground. They moved to a ground in Nailsworth in 1924, but returned to the Lawn in 1927 after it was upgraded with a boundary wall and entrance gates. At the start of the 2006–07 season the club moved to the New Lawn.

The Sustainability in Sport terrace is at the north end of the ground. This terrace was the location for away fans and had previously housed home supporters which it has reverted to. A decision by the club at the end of the 2012–13 season saw the areas in which home and away fans were housed at the ground switched with home fans reverting to the EESI Stand at the opposite end of the ground which was converted from seating to a standing terrace. Subsequently, away fans have been accommodated in the West side of the ground. The East Stand is the largest-capacity stand at the ground and is a seated stand that contains seven boxes, the &#x27;Green Man&#x27; public house, gym, dance studio and conference and leisure facilities. The western side of the ground is an open terrace now the area for away fans with a small covered seating area. Although the stadium can hold 5,147 fans, the highest league attendance recorded at the venue so far was 3,781 in a Conference Premier fixture against Bristol Rovers. However, the highest all-time attendance was 4,836 for an FA Cup third round tie at home to Championship side Derby County. The usual attendance was between 1,000 and 1,800 for National League fixtures.
In June 2011, the club began work on making the stadium environmentally friendly following the arrival of new owner and green energy entrepreneur Dale Vince. This included developing an entirely organic pitch. In December 2011, 180 solar panels were installed on the roof of the EESI stand, helping the club generate 10% of the electricity needed to run the stadium. In April 2012, Forest Green introduced the first robot lawn mower to be used by a British football club on to its playing surface. This followed a previous robot mower that had been in service at the club&#x27;s former ground. The Etesia robot mower – known as a &#x27;mow bot&#x27; – uses GPS technology to guide it round the pitch without the need for human intervention and gathers power from the solar panels at the stadium. In December 2012, the club beat 200 other nominees to first prize in the Institute of Groundsmanship awards in the sustainability and environmental category for its organic pitch and the environmental aspects at The New Lawn.

===Eco Park===

On 3 November 2016, the club announced the winning design for a proposed 5,000 seat new stadium to be built within the Eco Park complex beside Junction 13 of the M5 in Gloucestershire, 1.5 miles west of the town of Stonehouse (and 8.5 miles northwest of their spiritual home of Nailsworth). The design is for a stadium made almost entirely of wood, including the roof cantilevers. It will be able to be increased in size to 10,000 capacity depending on the club&#x27;s success. The plans were initially rejected by the planning authorities in June 2019 but revised plans were approved later that year. The English Football League gave their consent to the stadium in February 2021. It is intended that the new stadium will have the lowest carbon footprint of any stadium in the world. Vince hoped that the club would be able to play games at the stadium within &quot;three or four years&quot;.

<text>Ebbsfleet United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Northfleet, Kent, England. The club compete in the National League, the fifth level of English football league system.

Founded in 1946 from the merger between Gravesend United and Northfleet United, they were known as Gravesend &amp; Northfleet until changing to their current name in 2007.

Between 2008 and 2013, the club was 75% owned by the web-based venture MyFootballClub whose members, by majority vote, decided on things that at many other clubs were decisions made by the club&#x27;s management and staff. In May 2013 KEH Sports Ltd, a group of Kuwaiti investors took over full ownership of the club.

==History==
===1946–2007: Gravesend &amp; Northfleet===
Gravesend &amp; Northfleet F.C. was formed in 1946 by a merger between Gravesend United (originally formed in 1893) and Northfleet United (originally formed in 1890). The new club retained the red and white home colours and the Stonebridge Road stadium of Northfleet United.

The club were elected to the Southern League for the 1946–47 season and in this inaugural season reached the first round proper of the FA Cup, losing to fellow Southern League club Gillingham; the club reached the first round of the FA cup again in 1949–50, before being defeated by Torquay United of the Football League Third Division South. For eight seasons the club recorded mid-table finishes in the single division Southern League (a highest of fifth in 1947 and a lowest of twenty-first in 1952) until finishing bottom of the division over the 1954–55 season. During this period &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; twice won the Kent Senior Cup: in 1949 they defeated Gillingham 2–0 in a twice replayed final; and in 1953 were victors 2–1 over Dartford.

Following the dismal record over the previous season in the summer of 1955 the club appointed ex-Arsenal and England player Lionel Smith as manager, their seventh manager in ten seasons – he remained in charge for five seasons until resigning in 1960. Three seasons into Smith&#x27;s tenure Gravesend &amp; Northfleet were the 1957–58 Southern League Champions; the following season the league operated two parallel regional divisions and by achieving a second-placed finish in the South-East Division the club earned a position in the league&#x27;s newly formed Premier Division for the 1959–60 season. For three seasons the club recorded lowly finishing positions in the division before, after the fourth season of 1962–63, being relegated to the Southern League Division One. Whilst still members of the Premier Division, in 1961 and 1962, the club applied for election to the Football League Fourth Division but failed on each occasion to receive a single vote In the relegation season &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; had achieved their furthest ever FA Cup run in the 1962–63 season competition: after beating League Division Four strugglers Exeter City and then mid-table Isthmian League club Wycombe Wanderers at Stonebridge Road in the first two rounds, in the third round the club won away at Carlisle United of the Football League Third Division before they were knocked-out in a fourth round replay at leading Football League Second Division club Sunderland – that was the first of a sequence of four seasons of appearing in the proper rounds of the FA cup, the subsequent three were: in 1963–64 losing in the second round to Brentford of the Third Division; the following season losing in the first round to another Third Division club Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic; and beaten in the first round by Wimbledon of the Southern League.

Shortly after the relegation the club was rocked by a financial crisis which saw an exodus of key players in October 1963; in April 1964 the supporters club made key donations to avert the threat of the club folding. &#x27;The Fleet&#x27; slumped to twentieth position (from twenty-two clubs) of the Southern League Division One in the 1963–64 season and recorded similar lowly finishes over the following six seasons. During this spell, in November 1968, the club appointed Alf Ackerman as manager. In the final season of the six season run, in 1970, the club won the Kent Floodlit Cup defeating Margate 2–1 in a final replay having sharing six goals over the initial two legged final tie. In 1971 the club achieved a third-placed finish in Division One and were promoted back to the Southern League Premier Division. During this period between 1969 and 1971, Roy Hodgson, who later became manager of the national teams of Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Finland and England, was a player at the club, making 59 appearances.

The club&#x27;s return to the Premier Division for the 1971–72 season was unsatisfactory: the club recorded all-time lows of five matches won and thirty goals scored; they finished at the foot of the table and were duly relegated into the now regional Southern League Division One South. In February 1974 Ackerman quit as manager (citing lack of funds) and was replaced as manager by former player Tony Sitford. Fifteen months later, under Sitford, Gravesend &amp; Northfleet were the 1974–75 Division One South champions and again promoted to the Premier Division. Three seasons later in 1978 &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; won the Southern League Cup defeating Weymouth 2–0 over a two legged final. For each of the three seasons between 1978 and 1980 the club appeared in the first round of the FA Cup, being defeated in the first two occasions by members of the Football League Fourth Division and previous cup conquerors: Wimbledon in an away replay in 1978 and in the following 1979–80 competition by Torquay United; and in 1980 defeated at home by non-league Isthmian League Division One St Albans City.

There was a reorganisation of Non-league football in 1979 and Gravesend &amp; Northfleet were one of thirteen clubs from the Southern League Premier Division who together with seven clubs from the Northern Premier League were founder members of the countrywide Alliance Premier League. After a disappointing first half of the 1980–81 season, with the club in lower mid-table, manager Sitford was sacked in December 1980 and replaced by former Gillingham and Wimbledon defender Dave Galvin. &#x27;The Fleet&#x27; not only maintained their league status that season but also won the 1981 Kent Senior Cup defeating Ashford Town 2–0 in the final. However, after the following 1981–82 campaign, in which Galvin resigned mid-season they were relegated back into the Southern League Premier Division

In the autumn of 1982 the club again reported financial losses and made cutbacks, the club manager of nine months Stan Harland and the chairman of the board both resigned. In 1988 there was a further crisis: the club was £58,000 in debt and close to financial collapse; the situation was alleviated when club landlords and local employer Blue Circle Industries intervened with a five-year deal worth £90,000. During the fifteen seasons between 1982 and 1997 Gravesend &amp; Northfleet bounced between the Premier and South Divisions of the Southern League: there were relegations in both 1986 and 1992 (the club should have been relegated in 1991 however they were spared as Rushden Town were demoted owing to ground problems); these were followed by two promotions, firstly in 1989 under manager Denis Moore and then in 1994 led by manager Garry Aldous. There were two notable FA Cup runs during the period: in the 1993–94 season the club were defeated 2–1 at Football League Second Division club Leyton Orient; two seasons later in the 1995–96 competition after triumphing at home over newly restored Division Three club Colchester United and then Southern League South Division members Cinderford Town in a replay, &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; played their highest ever ranked FA Cup opponent when they were beaten in the third round 3–0 by Premier League members Aston Villa, a tie in which the club ceded home advantage to maximise its revenue.

For the 1997–98 season, Gravesend &amp; Northfleet left the Southern League and switched to what they believed to be the more geographically suitable Isthmian League Premier Division. After a poor start to the season, in September 1997 the club appointed their third manager in just over a year when they replaced player-manager Steve Lovell with their former youth team and assistant manager and ex-Gillingham forward Andy Ford. Under him &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; played in the Isthmian League until 2001–02, the season in which they won the league championship and earned promotion into the Football Conference (formerly named the Alliance Premier League). That promotion season was the third of consecutive season wins in the Kent Senior Cup (the club&#x27;s forerunner Northfleet United had achieved this and more, recording five consecutive wins in the 1920s): in the 1999–2000 final Folkestone Invicta were defeated 3–0; Dover Athletic were defeated 4–0 in the 2000–01 final; and beating Margate 5–0 in the 2001–02 final completed the trio of wins. There were too three consecutive seasons of appearing in the proper rounds of the FA Cup facing Football League Second Division clubs: on two occasions the club were defeated by Notts County, in round one in the 2000–01 season and in round two in the 2002–03 competition; in the intervening 2001–02 season they were defeated by Huddersfield Town in a round one tie.

In 2005, there was a change of manager: Andy Ford resigned in January 2005 and was replaced the following month by former Cambridge United, Birmingham City and Coventry City defender Liam Daish. A club player milestone occurred on 28 September 2005 when veteran Jimmy Jackson, who first played for &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; in 1994, recorded his 500th game for the club

For the remaining seasons that the club was known as Gravesend &amp; Northfleet it maintained its position in the Football Conference, the leading non-league competition. In May 2007 the club renamed itself Ebbsfleet United (cited as being for strategic reasons associated with the growth of the region and the establishment of Ebbsfleet Station as an international gateway).

===2007–present: Ebbsfleet United===
====2007–2013: MyFootballClub ownership====

Shortly after the change of name to Ebbsfleet United, on 13 November 2007 it was announced that the website-community MyFootballClub (MyFC) had agreed a deal in principle to take control of Ebbsfleet United. MyFC had 28,250 members (each paying a subscription of £35) and the organisation paid £625,000 to purchase a 75% stake in the club with each member owning an equal share in the club on which no profit nor dividend was earned. Between 16 and 23 January 2008 there was an overwhelmingly majority of the MyFC members who voted to both proceed with the takeover (95.89% voting &quot;Yes&quot;) and to allow Liam Daish to continue with his plans for the January transfer window (95.86% voting &quot;Yes&quot;). The deal was ratified at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the club&#x27;s board on 19 February 2008. Members had a vote on all major club decisions which included inter alia transfers and player selection. Because of the nature of MyFC, Liam Daish who had been titled manager since 2005 became instead the first team head coach – his backroom staff remained at the club.
Success quickly followed when on 10 May 2008 Ebbsfleet United won the FA Trophy, defeating now non-league Torquay United 1–0 in the final, a match watched by 40,000 spectators on the club&#x27;s first trip to Wembley – becoming the first Kentish team to win this trophy. A couple of months later &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; added further silverware when, in a delayed final played on 26 July 2008, they won the 2007–08 Kent Senior Cup with a 4–0 victory over Cray Wanderers. During the following 2008–09 FA Cup competition the club featured once again in the first round, losing 1–0 away at EFL League One club Crewe Alexandra

After the first year of the MyFC ownership of the club a majority of its members failed to renew their annual subscription and membership dropped from a peak of 32,000 at the time of the takeover to just over 9,000 on deadline day 2009; the club had previously stated that 15,000 members was the minimum needed. As a result of budget cuts, in June 2009, the club parted company after four years with assistant manager Alan Kimble. Owing to the effect of the reduced budget on playing strength the club finished the 2009–10 Football Conference in penultimate position in the table and were relegated into the Conference South.

The membership of MyFC continued to decline and in September 2010, two and a half years after the takeover, there were around 3,500 members. In an October 2010 vote among MyFC members the previous decision to allow the team manager autonomy in transfer dealings was rescinded, by a majority of 35 on a total vote of 132 in favour of the membership having a 48-hour period to ratify any proposed player signing or sale; both the manager and the club secretary opposed the change. Manager Daish rebuilt the squad following the previous season&#x27;s relegation and on 15 May 2011, after what was only one season in the Conference South, Ebbsfleet United won the 2010–11 season play-off final beating Farnborough 4–2 and were thus promoted back to the Conference Premier. During the season, in the first round of the FA Cup, the club had been defeated 3–2 in a home replay by Conference Premier promotion contenders AFC Wimbledon (the spiritual heirs of the club that had beaten them twice previously in the proper rounds of the competition).

Ebbsfleet United&#x27;s financial difficulties, owing to shortage of funding by MyFC, were quantified in December 2011 when it was announced that in order to survive the club needed to generate £50,000 by the end of the 2011–12 season and it appealed for investment; the club managed to complete the season, finishing in mid-table. Prior to the 2012–13 season the MyFC membership had reduced further to around 1,300; during the early part of that season, in November 2012, the independent Fleet Supporters Trust, who had continued over the years to make financial donations to the club, stated they were concerned about the viability and sustainability of the football club under its present ownership and called on the MyFC members to consider their continued ownership of the football club. Later that season on 23 April 2013 it was announced that MyFC&#x27;s members had voted to relinquish their 75% ownership of the club and to pass two-thirds of their shares to the club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; trust, the Fleet Trust, and the remaining third to one of the club&#x27;s major shareholders (believed to be former club chairman Phil Sonsara). It was further disclosed that the club needed to additionally raise £100,000 by the end of the month in order to avoid entering administration. This deal was not completed: the MyFC and other shareholders subsequently accepted an offer for all the shares of the club from KEH Sports Ltd, a group of Kuwaiti investors. On-field there was a first round FA Cup defeat at Carlisle United of League One, but the greater setback was the relegation suffered by &#x27;the Fleet&#x27; at the end of the 2012–13 season, back to the Conference South.

====2013–present: Kuwaiti ownership====
KEH Sports Ltd, a group of Kuwaiti investors completed a take-over of Ebbsfleet United in May 2013 with 96.24% of voting MyFC members in favour of the transaction. The new investors reportedly paid MyFC £7,500 for their 75% of the shares with a further £2,500 paid for the remainder to other shareholders. Further, £558,000 of loans (£139,000 to MyFC, the balance to directors, shareholders and other parties) were settled at 10% of their value and £100,000 made available for other creditors. The new owners appointed KEH Director Dr. Abdulla Al-Humaidi as the new chairman and it was announced that the club would have a transfer budget of £100,000 for the coming season and a minimum playing squad budget of £8,000 per week. Liam Daish subsequently departed as head coach after eight seasons in charge – the longest tenure of any manager of &#x27;the Fleet&#x27;. The new ownership appointed the Dover Athletic coach and former Charlton Athletic defender Steve Brown as manager.

A club record was broken just before Christmas as Brown&#x27;s team achieved nine wins in succession. A 2–0 win over Sutton United, with both goals coming from Billy Bricknell, broke the long-standing record which subsequently put them amongst the title contenders but poor runs of form were to follow. Ebbsfleet eventually reached the play-offs, helped by goalkeeper Preston Edwards keeping eleven clean sheets at Stonebridge Road over the course of the season. The play-off semi-final first leg against Bromley at Stonebridge Road ended in a 4–0 win for the Fleet. Despite Bromley winning the second leg, Brown&#x27;s side won 4–1 on aggregate. The play-off final was against Dover Athletic whom the club had just defeated 4–0 to win the Kent Senior Cup. In the play-off encounter at Stonebridge Road, in front of a 4,200 crowd, Dover dominated and defeated Ebbsfleet United 1–0 with a goal early in the second half from former Ebbsfleet striker Nathan Elder. 

The 2014–15 season started with much promise, with wins against Concord Rangers &amp; Havant &amp; Waterlooville. However, the season failed to live up to expectations and Steve Brown was relieved of his duties the day after a 3–0 home defeat to Gosport Borough in November 2014. Jamie Day replaced Brown and, despite taking the club to the FA Trophy quarter-finals, where they lost to eventual winners North Ferriby United, he was relieved of his duties in April 2015. In the summer of 2015, former club captain Daryl McMahon was named as permanent manager. The 2015–16 season was far more fruitful for the Fleet, as they led the league for almost the whole season. However, title rivals Sutton United went on a 26-game unbeaten run and clinched the league title by beating the Fleet 2–0 at Gander Green Lane. In the play-off semi-finals the Fleet edged past Whitehawk via a penalty shootout after a 3–3 draw on aggregate but lost on penalties in the final to rivals Maidstone United. In the 2016–17 season Ebbsfleet again missed out on first place, this time to National League South champions Maidenhead United. Yet gained promotion to the National League with a 2–1 win at Stonebridge Road in the play-off final over Chelmsford City. The following season the team achieved their highest ever league finish of 6th, beating Aldershot Town in the play-off qualifying round 5–4 on penalties. A heavy 4–2 defeat in the next round to Tranmere Rovers consigned Ebbsfleet to another season in the National League.

The 2018–19 campaign did not reach the heights of the previous campaign with Daryl McMahon leaving the club in November following a 1–0 win over Barrow. Former Woking manager Garry Hill was appointed manager of the club. Despite an initial renaissance, the Fleet missed out on the play-offs following a winless April. In the spring of 2019, it was reported that there was an ongoing pay dispute between Ebbsfleet United and its players. On 1 February, the Ebbsfleet players released a joint statement claiming they had only been paid on time once in the preceding 12 months, that they had unknowingly played matches earlier in the season without the right medical insurance in place, and that pension payments had not been met. In response, the players refused to warm-up before a match against Wrexham. In an April 2019 statement, Ebbsfleet United claimed that the late payments were due to compliance procedures relating to transactions from Kuwait. In May 2019, Ebbsfleet United players and fans protested against unpaid wages at Stonebridge Road. At the end of the 2018-19 campaign, Ebbsfleet allowed many contracted players to leave on a free transfer following the pay dispute.

The 2019–20 season started with the Fleet losing all of their first five matches. In October 2019, Garry Hill left the club after just two wins in the opening 16 games of the season. Assistant Kevin Watson was appointed to the role on an interim basis before signing a seven-month contract to the end of the season. In February 2020 the ownership, KEH sports, appointed Damian Irvine to lead the club and oversee the day-to-day operations and all football matters. It was announced on 18 May 2020 that Kevin Watson&#x27;s short-term contract as Manager would not be renewed and he would leave the club. The 2019–20 season was cancelled in March due to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic with Ebbsfleet in the relegation places; on 17 June 2020 using the criterion of points per game, the club were confirmed among the list of those relegated from the National League (by a difference of 0.002 points).

On 2 June 2020, Tennis Borussia Berlin manager Dennis Kutrieb was appointed as the new manager. They achieved promotion back to the fifth tier in the 2022–23 season, clinching the title with four matches remaining, winning the league by a margin of twenty points. In January 2024 with the club struggling in the league, Dennis Kutrieb was sacked and later replaced by Danny Searle: under the new manager the club maintained the club&#x27;s position by two points in the 2023–24 National League.

Off the field that season, on 23 December 2023, on the same day that it was reported he was declared bankrupt Dr Al-Humaidi resigned as chairman and as a Director of Ebbsfleet United. He was replaced as chairman by his cousin Abdulla Al-Humaidi. On 9 September 2024 after seven straight National League match defeats manager Danny Searle was relieved of his duties and replaced by Harry Watling.

== Club Colours==
Ebbsfleet&#x27;s traditional home colours (adopted from forerunner club Northfleet United) are red shirt with white detailing, white shorts and red socks. Away colours have varied, with blue and white stripes favoured in the late eighties before colour combinations such as white/black and yellow/navy or black were used. MyFC members chose white with red detailing as the away colour in 2008–09, but a clash with the home colours of Woking and other clubs was not spotted until after the kit had been supplied, so a third shirt with green body and white sleeves was used with the white shorts and socks; for the 2010–11 season the members made the unusual choice of purple for the away kit.

The club used specially designed 75th anniversary kits for the 2021–22 season: the home shirt was red and the away shirt green both with the Gravesend &amp; Northfleet badge and lettering included on the shirts which additionally featured subtle design cues that paid homage to forerunner clubs Northfleet United and Gravesend United respectively 

==Stadium==
The club has played its home matches at Stonebridge Road since the club&#x27;s inception. It was formerly the home stadium, since 1905, of forerunner club Northfleet United. In 1953 it was the first football stadium in Kent to have floodlights installed.

In July 2012 the Stonebridge Road terrace was named the Liam Daish Stand in recognition of the then manager. The stand was demolished in 2016 and replaced with a new main stand in 2017.

In October 2017, Stonebridge Road became known as Kuflink Stadium as part of a five-year sponsorship deal.

In April 2024 plans were approved for a new 8,000 seater stadium in Northfleet as part of a wider regeneration of the area. Work was scheduled to begin in September 2024 with completion aimed for August 2026. The relocation will see the demolition of Stonebridge Road.

<text>Halifax Town Association Football Club was an English football club based in Halifax, West Yorkshire. They played in the English Football League from 1921 to 1993 and from 1998 to 2002.

The club was dissolved in 2008, but reformed that July under the name of FC Halifax Town.

The club&#x27;s stadium was The Shay.

==History==

===Early years===
The club was formed on 24 May 1911 at the Saddle Hotel. It initially played in the Yorkshire Combination and the Midland League. It was one of the founder members of Football League Third Division North in 1921, and remained in that division until restructuring in 1958, when it became a member of the Football League Third Division. Its highest league position prior to World War II was second in 1934–35.

===1960s–1990s===
They finished third, one place off promotion in the Football League Third Division in the 1970-71 season.

The next season, they just avoided relegation on goal difference after Rotherham United lost on the last matchday to Tranmere Rovers for Halifax to move up. In 1976, they were relegated to Division 4.

In 1993 they were relegated to the Football Conference.

===Conference===
The club found the Conference no easier than the fourth division. After several poor seasons with severe financial constraints, the club was demoralised as there seemed to be no way out. However, previous manager George Mulhall returned towards the end of the 1996–97 and avoided relegation from the Conference. The next season Mulhall and Kieran O&#x27;Regan made a number of additions to the squad including Jamie Paterson, Mark Bradshaw and Lee Martin to put together a title-winning team. The Shaymen were crowned champions of the Conference and thus regained Football League status. Free scoring Geoff Horsfield was also the top scorer in the Conference that season, scoring 30 goals.

===Back In the Football League===

At the start of the 1998–99 season, manager George Mulhall chose to retire and O&#x27;Regan was promoted to manager. Striker and top scorer Geoff Horsfield only played ten games before he was sold to Fulham for £300,000 in October 1998. Halifax made a strong start to their league campaign and were amongst the leaders until December, after which their results started to drop off and they slipped into mid-table. Although only three points off playoff positions, O&#x27;Regan was sacked as manager by Chairman Jim Bown after a 0 – 0 draw with Rochdale in April 1999.

===Return to Conference===
Chris Wilder was appointed Halifax manager in July 2002. In their first season back in the Conference the Shaymen finished in eighth position.

In 2005–06 they finished 4th, and reached the Conference play-off final, losing to Hereford United.

===Financial failure and dissolution===
In 2007, the club was placed into administration by a local consortium trying to buy the club. In spite of being docked 10 points for entering administration, the club again survived relegation on the last day of the season. However, the club failed to get a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to bring the club out of administration,

Though the club appealed against the decision to remove it from the Football Conference, the appeal was unsuccessful and the club was wound up.

In May 2008 it had been revealed that following a major error, the club owed over £800,000 to Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs, making the club more than £2 million in the red.

The Supporters&#x27; Trust prepared a back-up plan to form a new club should it be required. However, the club was re-formed by the same directors of the previous legal entity under the name FC Halifax Town and was accepted to play in the Northern Premier League Division One North in the 2008/09 season.

==Stadiums==
The club moved to The Shay in 1921 (hence the team&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Shaymen&quot;) and remained there until it folded.

From the mid-1990s on the Shay underwent substantial development, and Halifax RLFC moved in and shared the venue. The Football Trust assisted in providing funds for the redevelopment.

<text>Hereford United Football Club was an association football club based in Hereford, England. They played at Edgar Street for their entire history. They were nicknamed &#x27;The Whites&#x27; or &#x27;The Lilywhites&#x27;, after their predominantly white kit, or &#x27;The Bulls&#x27; after the Hereford cattle breed. They contested A49 derby games with Shrewsbury Town.

Founded in 1924, the club entered the Birmingham Combination and switched to the Birmingham &amp; District League four years later. They entered the Southern League after World War II, winning the North-West Division in 1958–59 and Division One in 1964–65. Hereford achieved national prominence in 1972 when they knocked top-flight Newcastle United out of the FA Cup and were elected into the Football League later that year. Promoted out of the Fourth Division in 1972–73, they won the Third Division title in 1975–76, though lasted just one season in the Second Division and were relegated again the following year.

Hereford spent 19 seasons in the fourth tier before losing their Football League status with a last-place finish in 1997. They remained in the Conference for nine seasons under the stewardship of Graham Turner, finishing second three consecutive times before winning promotion after winning the 2006 play-off final. Promoted out of League Two in 2007–08, they were relegated the following season and were again relegated into non-League football in 2012. On 19 December 2014, the club was wound up in the High Court with debts around £1.3 million.
Following the demise of United, a new &#x27;phoenix club&#x27; was set up, Hereford. The new club incorporates the words &#x27;Forever United&#x27; into its crest design, as well as the iconic Hereford Bull, and gained promotion to the National League North in 2018.

==History==

Hereford United Football Club was founded in 1924 with the merger of two local clubs St Martins and RAOC (Rotherwas), with the intention of sustaining a higher class of football in the city of Hereford. Hereford joined the Birmingham Combination and lost its first match 3-2 to Atherstone United. The club&#x27;s second ever match was an FA Cup preliminary round tie against future rivals Kidderminster Harriers which they lost 7–2.

Hereford progressed to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1928 where the club spent 11 seasons, with a best position of 4th. By the late 1930s the number of clubs in the league had decreased and Hereford successfully applied to join the Southern League – but played only a few games in this league before the outbreak of the Second World War. At the same time the club became a limited company.

When football resumed after the war, Hereford finished 1st in their first full season in the league only to be demoted to 2nd behind Chelmsford City, which was awarded points for unplayed matches. In 27 seasons in the Southern League, Hereford finished as runners-up three times, and also lifted the Southern League Cup three times. When the league was regionalised for one season in 1958–59, Hereford also won their regional division to add to their third League Cup win.

In 1966, Hereford signed John Charles, the former Leeds United, Juventus and Welsh international, boosting the support of the club. He became manager a year later and set about building a team to challenge at the top of the Southern League and gain election to the Football League. With the club becoming one of the best-supported non-league clubs in the country Charles used his standing within the game to canvass votes from member clubs for election to the Football League.

The 1971–72 season saw the club finish second in the Southern League and gain national prominence due to its exploits in the FA Cup. Charles had departed the club in October 1971 and his successor Colin Addison inherited a side that defeated top-flight Newcastle United in the FA Cup. The star player was Dudley Tyler; Ronnie Radford and Ricky George&#x27;s goals earned the club a Fourth Round tie against West Ham United where they were defeated in a replay at Upton Park. The Cup run played a part in the club&#x27;s successful election to the Fourth Division, replacing Barrow.

The club rose rapidly to the Second Division after finishing runners-up in their first season in the Fourth Division and winning the Third Division title in 1976. Dixie McNeil was the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions of English football in the same season, but Hereford would only spend one season in the second tier before dropping back into the Fourth Division. The club&#x27;s peak was in October 1976 when they were in sixth position before playing Brian Clough&#x27;s Nottingham Forest, losing 4–3 at the City Ground.

After this period of success the club spent 19 years in the bottom division, suffering financial problems in the early 1980s which resurfaced in the mid-1990s. The club enjoyed brief glimpses of their past success in the Cup competitions, holding Arsenal to a 1–1 draw in the FA Cup of 1985 and narrowly losing 1–0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup of 1990. The club&#x27;s first trophy for 14 years was the Welsh Cup won in the same season. In the league the club usually finished in the bottom half as it went through a succession of managers, finishing 17th in 4 consecutive seasons.

Graham Turner was appointed manager for the beginning of the 1995–96 season and managed to lead the team to sixth place and the play-offs, despite the club being in 17th position two months previously. This resurgence was in part thanks to the goals of Steve White who emulated Dixie McNeil by being the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions. Hereford lost to Darlington in the play-offs and, with financial problems worsening, the club lost key players for the following 1996–1997 season. After a terrible run of form Hereford were ultimately relegated after a relegation-decider at Edgar Street with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

In 1998, Turner purchased a majority shareholding from Peter Hill and Robin Fry. The club was in serious financial difficulties, with debts of £1 million owed to a property development company which also controlled the leases on the stadium. Turner purchased only two players between 1997 and 2008 for a combined total of £40,000.

The club&#x27;s first five seasons in the Conference saw little success on the pitch, with the club being forced to sell many of its key players and the future of Edgar Street in serious doubt. The 2001–02 FA Cup saw the club receive a financial bonus when the BBC televised the First Round match against Wrexham live. Turner stated that the money was critical to the club&#x27;s survival and therefore Gavin Williams&#x27;s goal against Dover Athletic in the previous round is seen as the goal that saved the club.

Having reached a 40-year low of 17th in the Conference, the summer of 2002 proved a turning point as almost the entire squad was changed, the majority of new signings having been released from Football League clubs as a result of the ITV Digital collapse. The new squad transformed the club into title contenders which, after a record-breaking season in the 2003–04 season, finished as runners up in the Conference but failed in the play-offs. 2004–05 saw an identical outcome but in 2005–06 Hereford were promoted after defeating Halifax Town in the play-off final.

The club returned to the Football League with a vastly improved financial situation. Under Turner the club was now strictly living within its financial means, having turned a sizeable profit in the latter Conference seasons whilst spending just £20,000 on transfers. In addition the team was playing attractive football which had earned them the mantle of &quot;the best footballing side in the Conference&quot;.

In 2006–07, Hereford achieved victories over five of the top eight finishing clubs, but a poor run of form in the last part of the season dropped the club into 16th position. In the 2007–08 season the club were never out of the top five from November onwards and consistently placed in the automatic promotion places. Despite strong competition from Stockport County, Hereford secured third place and promotion with a match to spare by defeating Brentford 3–0 at Griffin Park, though they were tipped to struggle in League One.,

2008–09 saw the club play in the third tier of English football for the first time since 1978. They rarely placed outside the relegation zone throughout the season, and achieved only 17 points at the halfway point. A 5–0 home win over Oldham Athletic was a rare good result, with top scorer Steve Guinan scoring a hat-trick. Hereford&#x27;s relegation was confirmed on 18 April 2009, after they recorded 1 win and 11 defeats in a 12 match spell. Turner subsequently stepped down as manager, paving the way for John Trewick to become manager. However, Trewick did not last a full season after a disappointing campaign and was dismissed on 8 March 2010; and Turner once again took over first team duties on a temporary basis.

David Keyte was announced as the new club chairman on 4 June 2010 with Tim Russon as the new vice-chairman. They appointed Simon Davey as manager on 22 June 2010. Davey was sacked on 4 October 2010 after poor league form. He was succeeded by physio Jamie Pitman who acted as caretaker manager until he was made manager on a full-time basis until the end of the 2010–11 season.

Hereford were further relegated to the Conference from League Two at the end of the 2011–12 season.

Hereford were expelled from the Conference on 10 June 2014 due to financial irregularities. It was revealed a week later that the club&#x27;s debts could total as much as £1.3 million. The club was accepted into the Southern League Premier Division for the 2014–15 season on 19 June 2014. However, financial worries continued, including a winding-up petition started by Martin Foyle, who resigned as manager in March 2014. Hearings of the winding-up petition were adjourned a number of times, including on 7 July 2014. A number of other creditors attached themselves to the Foyle petition, including Andy Porter, former assistant manager, and HMRC. A CVA was proposed by the board of directors of the company, but was rejected by creditors. Many Hereford fans chose to boycott the club due to clashes between fans and the board.

On 10 December 2014, after failing to fully and properly comply with obligations to respond to questions coming from an Independent Regulatory Commission, the FA suspended Hereford United from all forms of football activity with immediate effect, until the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission was complied with to the full satisfaction of the commission. Hereford United&#x27;s suspension from all football activity was lifted by the Football Association the following day, after chairman and new majority shareholder Andy Lonsdale confirmed the FA received the necessary documentation – including the transfer of shares in the club to Lonsdale. The club was wound-up in the High Court in December 2014.

==Colours and badge==

Hereford originally played in an all-white strip, but their traditional colours are white shirts and black shorts. This dates back to the end of the Second World War when they used material from blackout curtains to make shorts when they ran out of white material. However, they occasionally reverted to an all-white strip, latterly in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. Their away colours varied over the years, with predominantly yellow colours being used in later years.

Prior to 1971 the club played in plain shirts with no crest. A depiction of a Herefordshire bull was introduced for the 1971–72 season with &quot;H.U.F.C.&quot; lettering underneath. A supporters&#x27; club crest was also used during the 1970s. The shirt crest design changed several times over the years, with the full club name being added above and below the bull, which remained largely untouched. The current crest was introduced in the early 1990s but was not featured on the shirts until 2003.

Hereford&#x27;s shirt sponsors were Sun Valley Poultry between 1991 and 2009, the biggest employer in Hereford. A new three-year sponsorship deal was agreed in May 2007 which extended the sponsorship to 19 years, one of the longest in British football history. The logo of Cargill, Sun Valley&#x27;s parent company, appeared on the shirts from the 2009–10 season onwards. Hereford&#x27;s shirt and kit suppliers were M and M Direct, another large employer in Herefordshire, which supported the club for many years. For the 2009–10 season, the kit was manufactured by Admiral. In the 2014–15 season Cargill ended sponsorship because of concerns over the financial running of the club. From August 2014 the club had no sponsors with many pulling out in the summer of 2014 due to the club&#x27;s financial running and future viability.

==Stadium==

Hereford United played their home matches at Edgar Street from their formation in 1924; the ground was previously used by the amateur club Hereford City as well as for athletics. In later years the ground was central to Hereford&#x27;s financial troubles, with the previous owners of the club handing the leases over to a development company from which they had borrowed £1 million. During the club&#x27;s early years in the Conference the future of the ground was in doubt, and relocation was considered to the point that plans for a new 7,500 seater stadium were drawn up. A joint venture agreement was made between the club and the developers to redevelop both ends of the ground to include leisure facilities that would enable the debt to be settled. The area around the ground is subject to a substantial redevelopment plan, known as the Edgar Street Grid (ESG). The club and the developers were originally looking to submit redevelopment plans to the council by the end of 2007. Although the ground redevelopment is independent of the ESG, plans for the building of a cinema at the Blackfriars End drawn up by the club and developers were not supported by ESG and Herefordshire Council. Several months later, plans for the ESG itself were published which included a cinema.

The ground itself changed little since the mid-1970s and was largely outdated and in need of urgent redevelopment, with the Blackfriars End failing a safety inspection in July 2009. The terraced end had fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years which steadily reduced the stadium capacity from nearly 9,000 to reportedly 7,100, although the capacity was officially confirmed as 7,700 in November 2007. Improvements were made in later years to ensure the ground met Football League standards; including new floodlights, dressing rooms and barriers on the terraces. The pitch itself was also completely relaid for the 2007–08 season, with a new sprinkler system installed for the 2008–09 season.
In 2013, the club said the capacity of Edgar Street was 5,966, but in 2014, the club only had a safety certificate to allow 1,000 spectators.

==Support==
Hereford United was historically one of the best-supported clubs in non-league football, particularly in the last two seasons before their election to the Football League. Indeed, in their campaign for election they produced a newsletter which highlighted the fact that their average attendance (5,224) was higher than those of eight Third Division clubs and 15 Fourth Division clubs. Approximately 10,000 Hereford supporters attended the Conference play-off final.

The club&#x27;s official programme was &quot;Bullseye&quot; and there was also a fanzine called &quot;Talking Bull&quot; until the 2008–09 season, when it was changed to an online format.

===Home attendances===

Between 1972 and 1977, during the club&#x27;s rise to the Second Division, home attendances averaged almost 8,000 per game. The support fell during the 1980s with the average home attendance under 3,000, the exception being the 1984–85 season when the club finished fifth.

It was not until the latter Conference years that attendances improved, with the 2003–04 season seeing the average home attendance rise to 3,704. The following season saw the figure drop to just over 3,000 while in the 2005–06 season, despite the club successfully gaining promotion, the figure was 2,791. For the 2006–07 season the club had an average home league attendance of 3,327. With the exception of 2003–04, this is the highest average attendance since the 1984–85 season (3,881).

The club rarely enjoyed capacity crowds at Edgar Street in its later years, last seeing a five-figure home attendance in 1990. After the reduction of the Edgar Street capacity in line with the Taylor Report the highest home attendance was 8,953 in 1994 – a Coca-Cola Cup second-round match against Nottingham Forest. The highest league home attendance was 8,532, which was the relegation decider against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in 1997.

Following the takeover by Tommy Agombar, following the conclusion of the 2013–2014 season, Hereford&#x27;s supporters trust voted to boycott United&#x27;s fixtures and subsequently attendances dropped from around 2000 in the 2013–2014 season, to around 200–400 during the opening exchanges of the 2014–2015 Southern League.

===Club anthem===
The club&#x27;s official anthem was &quot;Hereford United (We All Love You)&quot; which was written and performed by Danny Lee, a notable supporter of the club. Originally recorded and released in 1972, the same year as the famous FA Cup run, a rendition was usually sung at every Hereford match both home and away. The song was remixed three times: in 1979, 2002 and 2006. It was covered and released as a fundraising single, by local band King Mantis in 2013.

===Rivals===
Hereford had a number of rivalries with other clubs throughout their history. In the club&#x27;s Southern League era Worcester City were considered their fiercest rivals. Both Cardiff City and Newport County were considered rivals in the 1970s and 1980s.

The derby against Shrewsbury Town, known as the A49 derby, after the road separating the two towns, was listed nineteenth in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s twenty fiercest rivalries in English football. However, since Hereford&#x27;s resurrection the two sides have never met.

In the recent Football League era since promotion from the Conference, the club&#x27;s rivals included Kidderminster Harriers, Cheltenham Town, and Forest Green Rovers.

==Managers==
Graham Turner was the longest serving Hereford United manager and was also second to Sir Alex Ferguson as the longest serving manager in the English football league, having completed almost 14 seasons at the club.

The statistics of Hereford United&#x27;s four most successful managers from the 1972–73 season onwards are shown below. Statistics include league matches only and are correct as of 7 May 2011.

==Notable players==
A number of full internationals played for Hereford in its 90-year history, although Brian Evans was the only player to be capped whilst at the club. Gavin McCallum came on for Canada on 29 May 2010 against Venezuela in a friendly and scored a late equaliser becoming the second Hereford United player to be capped and the first to score whilst at the club.

==Records==
After their solitary season in the old Second Division in 1976–77, the club became the first old Third Division champions to finish bottom the following season. Hereford were also the last English club (not counting The New Saints, who play in the Welsh football league system despite being based in England) to have won the Welsh Cup, which they did so in 1989–90.

John Layton Sr. holds the record for competitive appearances for the club, making 549 appearances between 1946 and 1964. In recent times the only player to come close to breaking this record was Mel Pejic who had made 523 appearances before his departure in 1992. Pejic made a record 412 Football League appearances for the club. 

Charlie Thompson holds the record for goals scored for the club, scoring 184 in all competitions between 1945 and 1958. 
Roy Williams is the second highest goalscorer in the club&#x27;s history, scoring 154 goals in 357 appearances over two spells between 1947 and 1963.
In recent times Stewart Phillips is the only player to even approach this total with 124. His total of 95 goals in the Football League is a club record.

The sale of Lionel Ainsworth is set to break the club&#x27;s transfer record of £440,000, dependent on the fortunes of Watford.

<text>Leigh Genesis Football Club, formerly known as Horwich Railway Mechanics Institute F.C. (Horwich RMI) and Leigh Railway Mechanics Institute F.C. (Leigh RMI), is an English amateur association football club that currently plays in the South Lancashire Counties Football League. The semi-professional senior side folded in 2011, following relegation from the Northern Premier League; however, the club continued, fielding youth teams in the North West Youth Alliance, and a women&#x27;s team in the North West Women&#x27;s Regional League. The senior team was reintroduced for the 2012–13 season in the South Lancashire League.

The club has been based in Leigh, Greater Manchester, and played at Grundy Hill, Hilton Park, Leigh Sports Village, and finally Crilly Park. The highest level at which the club has this far competed is the Conference National, between 2000 and 2005; it reached the FA Cup first round proper on five separate occasions between 1928 and 2004.

==History==
The club was founded in 1896 and was initially known as Horwich RMI F.C., the club&#x27;s name until 1995 when it relocated to Leigh and was renamed Leigh RMI. Its name was changed again in June 2008 when the club became Leigh Genesis FC.

===Founding and early years===

RMI was one of two football clubs founded at the workshops of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway; it was started at the locomotive works in Horwich. The other club was started at the Newton Heath carriage and wagon works and later became known, and famous, as Manchester United. RMI played in various non-professional leagues over its first 90 years of existence, primarily in the Lancashire Combination, before moving into the newly formed North West Counties League in 1982, and then onto the Northern Premier League the next year.

Manager Les Rigby led RMI to the final of the GMAC Cup in 1988 against Weymouth, which was played on the sloping pitch of Grundy Hill. The home advantage was credited by many, including Rigby, for spurring RMI&#x27;s victory in the match.

===Move to Leigh===
During the 1994–95 season, the club realised their ground Grundy Hill would not be able to help the clubs&#x27; prospects of achieving success up the football pyramid, made the decision to move from Horwich seven miles south to Hilton Park in Leigh, home of the rugby league club Leigh Centurions. As part of this deal, a new company, &quot;Grundy Hill Estates&quot;, was formed to take over the ownership of the shared ground. Once the move had been finalised and agreements had been made to share the 10,000 capacity stadium, the club officially changed their name to Leigh RMI to reflect their new surroundings. RMI lost its first match at Hilton Park in March 1995 to Boston United 4–0, and were relegated at the end of the 1995 season.

In 2000, five years after this move, Leigh RMI reached the top tier of the Conference, the highest level of non-league football in England. Upon entering the Conference, RMI had a very successful first season, finishing a very respectable fifth place. Steve Jones spearheaded the club&#x27;s attack that season, scoring 19 league goals. After a few seasons at this level, and despite the fact that things seemed to be going well for the club on the pitch, Leigh RMI faced a placement in the new Conference North division for 2004–05 due to their second from the bottom finish in the 2003–04 season. The club was spared relegation that season due to two factors: the lack of a promotable Northern Premier League club kept the team that finished above them in the table from relegation and Margate were demoted from the Conference for failing to meet ground standards. Leigh RMI&#x27;s reprieve only lasted one season, however, as they were relegated after finishing bottom of the Conference table in 2004–05 with only 18 points from 42 games.

The season after this relegation, Leigh RMI hosted F.C. United of Manchester, the football club started in reaction to the purchase of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer, for FCUM&#x27;s first ever match in July 2005, a friendly that ended in 0–0 draw. Leigh RMI&#x27;s ownership had previously offered to merge with FCUM prior to this friendly in 2005, but the clubs decided against such a merger. &quot;It would seem hypocritical to some degree, in light of the Glazer events, if a team came into being by taking over another club,&quot; said Chairman of RMI Supporters&#x27; Club Peter Lowe at the time.

The 2005–06 season saw the club finish second from bottom in the Conference North, and the club thereby faced relegation to the Northern Premier League, but RMI gained yet another reprieve from relegation after Canvey Island resigned from the Conference National. In the 2006–07 campaign, RMI avoided relegation more easily, despite finishing 17th and in the bottom half of Conference North. As of 6 October 2007, Leigh RMI were again facing a relegation fight as they stood on the threshold of the relegation zone in 19th place. RMI removed manager Stuart Humphreys and his assistant Andy Roscoe on 15 October 2007 and hired Steve Bleasdale to manage due to &quot;the fact of the current low league position and falling gates something had to be done rapidly to improve our prospects,&quot; according to a club spokesman.

===Genesis===
In May 2008 Leigh RMI lost their fight for survival and were relegated to the Northern Premier League. In June 2008 the club was renamed Leigh Genesis to signify a &quot;new beginning&quot; for the club ahead of its move to the Leigh Sports Village. The rebranding was also used to signify chairman Dominic Speakman&#x27;s restructuring of the ailing club with the view of taking the club forward.

In October 2008, chairman Dominic Speakman announced his departure from the club. Genesis had been due to move into the new Leigh Sports Village Stadium (LSV). Continuing delays and unrealistic pricing, in the end cost the club. With the rising losses, and lack of home ground Speakman withdrew his financial backing from the club.

A large number of the playing staff agreed to play voluntarily. The board and backroom staff also offered to stay unpaid for the immediate future. However, manager Steve Bleasdale resigned the following week, and shortly afterwards returned to former club Chester City as assistant manager. Reserve team coach Lee Merricks was appointed the club&#x27;s new manager.

The LGSA (Leigh Genesis Supporters Association), began fundraising and hoped to keep the club alive.

On 23 March 2009 the club appointed former Blackburn player Garry Flitcroft as its new manager, as well as announcing that the team would be playing at the Leigh Sports Village with immediate effect.

After finishing in sixth position, one place outside of the promotion play-offs, in the Northern Premier League Division One North during 2009–10, manager Garry Flitcroft and several players departed the club to join local rivals Chorley.

The club left the Leigh Sports Village Stadium and entered into a groundshare agreement at Crilly Park with North West Counties Premier Division neighbours Atherton Laburnum Rovers for the 2010–11 season. At the same time, they appointed former player Mark Maddox, previously manager with Formby, as their new manager, bringing eight players from the Formby squad with him. In June 2010, veteran midfielder Andy Heald was installed as player-coach, while July 2010 saw Gary Scott, another ex-Leigh player and former Altrincham teammate of Maddox&#x27;s, appointed as assistant manager and Richard Ward as a coaching assistant.

Maddox and Leigh parted company by mutual consent on 3 December 2010, with Maddox replaced as manager by Alan Kershaw, who stepped up from managing the successful Leigh Genesis Youth side in the Lancashire Floodlit League.

On 2 June 2011, Leigh Genesis FC officially announced that it would not be joining the North West Counties League (Level 9) despite being relegated from the Northern Premier League Division One North (Level 8). Leigh Genesis secretary Mary Croasdale stated:
&quot;... we do not have a home ground and have been ground sharing for the last year at Crilly Park, home of Atherton LR. It is with much sadness and regret that we confirm that due to our lack of permanent facility we will not be applying for membership with the North West Counties League and taking an option further down the football ladder as appropriate for the playing facility we will have available.&quot;

===Return of senior team===

In May 2012, the club officially announced the re-launch of the senior team for the 2012–13 season. was playing in the South Lancashire Counties Football League, a men&#x27;s Sunday League affiliated with the Lancashire FA.

==Colours and badge==
The club introduced new colours to their kit for the 2008–09 season. The home kit consisted of white shirts with black trim, black shorts and black socks, while the away kit was all blue with white trim. Both kits were manufactured by Nike and neither had a sponsor, instead bearing the new Genesis name. The kit colours were changed as part of the &quot;Genesis&quot; branding and to stand out from the many clubs in Lancashire with red kits. Prior to the rebranding Leigh RMI playing kits consisted of red and white striped shirts, black shorts and red socks. The emblem for the club was the Leigh coat of arms.

It was said that the club had desired the colour of their home kit to be primarily black. However FA rules prevented non-league clubs to do so due to comparisons with the colours worn during a match by the match officials.

==Supporters==

After moving from Grundy Hill in Horwich, this club&#x27;s support has always been considered light. 

&quot;Horwich&#x27;s traumatic move to Leigh involved a far greater leap than a mere six-mile journey south west. Unsigned boundaries were crossed. Horwich is football and Bolton Wanderers; Leigh is rugby league.&quot;
With Leigh being known as a rugby league town, and the numerous well known football sides on the club&#x27;s doorstep, not only Wigan Athletic, but Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, and Manchester United, Leigh RMI averaged attendances of approximately 250 people per game in 2007.

==FA Cup record==
As Horwich RMI, the club only made the FA Cup First Round proper twice. In the 1928–29 season, RMI lost to Scarborough at home 1–2, and 54 years later, in 1982, they lost at Blackpool 3–0.

After relocating to Leigh, the club reached the FA Cup First Round on three occasions. The first came in the 1998–99 season when RMI defeated Winsford, Worksop, and Droylsden, the last two by the same scoreline, 2–1, to meet Fulham, then in Division Two, at Craven Cottage. Leigh achieved a 1–1 draw against Fulham in the club&#x27;s first FA Cup first round appearance in 16 years, and received attention of the British media. Leigh goalkeeper David Felgate, who was then 38 years old, received widespread plaudits for his sparkling performance in the Fulham match, which prompted then-Fulham boss Kevin Keegan to declare that Felgate&#x27;s goalkeeping was &quot;the best I&#x27;ve ever seen at any level.&quot;

The RMI-Fulham replay at Hilton Park, which was televised and shown live on Sky Sports, ended with Leigh losing 0–2. RMI&#x27;s Cup defeat witnessed by a club record crowd of 7,125 spectators.

Leigh&#x27;s second FA Cup first round appearance in the 2000–01 season also ended in defeat. They lost 3–0 to Millwall who at that time were in Division Two. On police advice, the venue for this match was switched from Hilton Park to The New Den in Bermondsey, Millwall&#x27;s home ground.

A third appearance in the FA Cup first round proper also ended in defeat for Leigh with a 2–1 defeat away to Conference South side Cambridge City in the 2004–05 season. This followed RMI&#x27;s 2–0 victory at Accrington Stanley in the Fourth Qualifying Round that year.

<text>Margate Football Club, originally called Margate Town, is an English football club based in the seaside resort of Margate, Kent. The club&#x27;s first team play in the . The club was known during the 1980s as Thanet United.

The club was founded in 1896 and joined the Southern Football League in 1933. After a spell in the Kent League after World War II the team returned to the Southern League in 1959 and remained there until 2001 when they gained promotion to the Football Conference, the highest level of English non-League football. Their stay at this level saw the team forced to groundshare with other clubs due to drawn-out and problematic redevelopment work at their Hartsdown Park stadium. The stadium has been the home of Margate FC since 1929, the same year the park itself opened to the public, and during the three years spent away from their own ground, they were expelled from the Conference National and subsequently relegated to the Isthmian League.

The team, nicknamed &quot;The Gate&quot;, have to date reached the third round proper of England&#x27;s premier cup competition, the FA Cup, on two occasions. On the second of these occasions they played Tottenham Hotspur, a First Division team and the reigning UEFA Cup holders.

==History==
===Early years===

Margate Football Club was founded in 1896 as an amateur club and was originally called Margate Town, playing friendly matches on local school grounds. In the years before the First World War the club played in several different amateur leagues, with little success, and played at various grounds in the Margate area, before settling on a pitch at what would later become the Dreamland amusement park in 1912. This ground became known as the Hall-by-the-Sea Ground, taking its name from a local dance hall.

===Inter-war years===
After the First World War, Margate joined the Kent League, but in 1923 the league suspended the team due to financial irregularities and the club promptly folded. A year later the club reformed, initially under the name Margate Town, and returned to the Kent League, still playing at Dreamland, but folded again due to heavy debts. In 1929 the club reformed again and moved to its present home at Hartsdown Park, leasing part of the park from the local council for conversion into a football stadium. Around this time Margate signed a Dutch player, a highly unusual move in an era when it was almost unknown for Continental players to move to English clubs. Goalkeeper Gerrit &quot;Gerard&quot; Keizer, who joined the Kent club from Ajax Amsterdam, later went on to play for Arsenal.

From 1934 until 1938 Margate, by now playing in the Southern League, served as the official nursery side for Arsenal; under this arrangement the London club regularly loaned promising young players to Margate in order for them to gain match experience. In the second season of this arrangement, 1935–36, Margate reached the third round proper of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 3–1 to Blackpool after defeating Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace in the earlier rounds, but shortly after this the club had to step back down to the Kent League for financial reasons.

===Post-war years===
After the Second World War, the Gate continued to play in the Kent League under new manager Charlie Walker, who led the team to two Kent League championships but was then controversially sacked. The team slumped during a succession of rapid managerial changes which only ended in 1950 when Almer Hall was appointed manager, a post he was to hold for the next twenty years. Under Hall, the team won a host of local cup honours and reached the rounds proper of the FA Cup on a number of occasions, but never managed to match this success in league competition.

In 1959–60 Margate returned to the Southern League after the Kent League folded, and in 1962–63 won the Division One championship and with it promotion to the Premier Division. Two years later the club turned full-time professional, but this policy proved financially untenable when the team were relegated back to Division One in 1965–66. Nonetheless, they won promotion at the first attempt and returned to the Premier Division in 1967.

During the 1970s, Margate endured severe financial problems and a series of mediocre league seasons, but took part in two famous FA Cup ties. In 1971 the Gate lost 11–0 to Bournemouth, with Ted MacDougall scoring a cup record nine goals. One year later, Margate beat Swansea City and Walton &amp; Hersham to set up a third-round tie against First Division Tottenham Hotspur, then UEFA Cup holders. A record crowd of around 14,500 packed into Hartsdown Park for a match which Margate lost 6–0.
In 1981 the club changed its name to Thanet United, a name which was retained until 1989 when the name reverted to Margate. In the final season under the Thanet name, the team achieved its lowest league placing for many years, escaping relegation from the Southern League by just one place.

===Conference era===
In 1996, the club&#x27;s centenary year, the club appointed Chris Kinnear as manager. In 1997–98 he took the team to the first round proper of the FA Cup where they played Fulham in a home tie that drew a crowd of 5,100. Although the Gate took the lead, the Cottagers eventually won 2–1. The following season saw the club finally win promotion to the Southern League Premier Division, albeit only after an appeal was lodged against the league&#x27;s initial refusal to allow the team promotion due to the club failing to carry out necessary ground improvements in time. The Premier Division championship followed in the 2000–01 season, and with it promotion to the Football Conference.

The 2001–02 season was Gate&#x27;s first-ever season of Conference football and they finished the season in eighth place. In the 2002–03 season the team began groundsharing at Dover Athletic&#x27;s Crabble Athletic Ground while redevelopment work took place at Hartsdown Park, but various problems stalled the planned redevelopment. On the pitch, Margate enjoyed more success in the FA Cup when, after defeating Leyton Orient in the first round, they were drawn at home to Cardiff City in the second round, but lost 3–0 at Crabble. The following season, despite finishing sixteenth, the Gate were forcibly relegated one division due to the ongoing delays and problems with the redevelopment plans for Hartsdown Park.

Margate spent the 2004–05 season in the Conference South, now groundsharing at Ashford Town. Amid ongoing issues with the redevelopment work, which at one point made it seem very likely the club would fold completely, Margate were again relegated to the Isthmian League Premier Division.

===Return to Hartsdown Park===

In August 2005, Margate returned to Hartsdown Park after three years away. During an indifferent season manager Kinnear was controversially suspended. Robin Trott was placed in temporary charge as player-manager in April 2006 and, after an unbeaten five-game run, was given a one-year contract at the end of the season. After Margate narrowly missed out on the play-offs in 2006–07 the club announced that Trott was to be given a new contract for the 2007–08 season. Shortly before the end of the season, however, Trott was sacked. His replacement, Barry Ashby, was himself sacked two months into the 2008–09 season. Shortly afterwards, the club narrowly avoided being subject to High Court action over unpaid debts to HM Revenue and Customs. The club finished the season in 19th position in the table and was expected to be relegated to Division One South, but was reprieved due to other clubs folding. The following season, Margate again finished in the bottom four but the club again received a reprieve from relegation.

Chris Kinnear returned for a second spell to manage the team at the start of the 2011–12 season. The following season Margate were sitting at the top of the table in January, however, after much speculation, Kinnear accepted the vacant manager&#x27;s position at Dover Athletic. Goalkeeper Craig Holloway was placed in temporary charge of the side, and brought in Simon Osborn as joint manager. The club dropped from the top of the table and finished outside the play-offs. After a poor start to the 2013–14 season, Holloway resigned his role as joint manager, leaving Osborn in sole charge. Results failed to improve and Osborn was sacked at the beginning of December 2013.

In the 2014–15 season, the first full season under manager Terry Brown, Margate finished in 3rd place in the Isthmian League Premier Division, ensuring the team&#x27;s qualification for the play-offs for promotion to the National League South (formerly Conference South). The play-offs were delayed by a lengthy appeal against a points deduction applied to fifth-placed Enfield Town, but when they eventually began, Margate defeated Dulwich Hamlet in the semi-finals. In the final Margate played Hendon, who had finished one place above them in the league, but a single goal from Ryan Moss gave them victory and promotion to the National League South. Following a poor start to the 2015–16 season, Terry Brown was sacked. and replaced by Margate goalkeeper Nikki Bull and defender Jamie Stuart until the end of that season. In April 2016 Bull was appointed first team manager, but was unable to prevent the team being relegated. As of 2021 the team continue to play in the Isthmian League Premier Division.

==Colours and crest==

Margate&#x27;s modern colours are blue and white, first adopted in 1949, but the team have worn a number of other colour combinations. The club&#x27;s earliest known colours were black and white, and in the 1930s the team wore amber and black. The club&#x27;s current crest is a simplified version of the coat of arms of the town of Margate, incorporating a lion conjoined to a ship&#x27;s hull (a reference to the arms of the Cinque Ports) and the white horse emblem of Kent.

Margate&#x27;s shirts have borne various sponsors&#x27; logos including the pop group Bad Manners, whose name appeared on the team&#x27;s kit as part of a sponsorship deal with their record label in the late 1990s. Lead singer Buster Bloodvessel was running a hotel in Margate at the time and actually joined the football club&#x27;s board of directors. Another band, The Libertines, sponsored the club for the 2018–19 season after starting work on a recording studio and hotel in the town.

==Stadium==

The stadium in Hartsdown Park has been Margate&#x27;s home since 1929, the club having used at least six grounds before moving to Hartsdown Park, the same year the park itself opened to the public. Little development of the stadium took place until 2002, when the club launched an ambitious scheme to completely redevelop the site. The club moved out and the old stadium, which was constructed mainly from timber and corrugated iron, was demolished in early 2003, but the local council disputed the plans submitted. Although planned to be completed by August 2003, the redevelopment dragged on for three years, mired in issues regarding planning permission for the commercial facilities the club wanted to build in addition to the stadium itself. The team spent three years ground-sharing with other Kent clubs, but club officials&#x27; failure to confirm a return date to Hartsdown led to Margate&#x27;s expulsion from the Conference National in 2004. In 2005 the club was finally able to return to the ground, albeit with pre-fabricated stands and temporary buildings in place. In 2014, the club applied to the local council for permission to erect six new temporary stands.

The club&#x27;s ultimate plan involved a stadium with a capacity of 5,000 forming part of a complex incorporating a hotel, fitness centre, conference centre, all-weather pitch and ten 5-a-side pitches. Although it was announced that work on the 5-a-side pitch complex was to begin in May 2007, ground was not in fact broken for a further four months.
Finally, after a series of false starts over a nearly 20-year period, the club was able to purchase the freehold of the ground from Thanet District Council in January 2019, leading to the club announcing plans in December 2023 for a complete redevelopment of the stadium, in conjunction with IHG Hotels, scheduled to commence in February 2024.

==Supporters==

In the 1920s crowds of up to 3,000 were common at Hartsdown Park, but in the modern era attendances are more modest. At the midpoint of the 2017–18 season, the team&#x27;s average attendance was 507. This was third highest in the Isthmian League Premier Division behind Dulwich Hamlet and Billericay Town. During their three seasons in the Conference National, from 2001–02 to 2003–04, the club&#x27;s average home attendances were 1,233, 684, and 562.

The club has an active independent supporters&#x27; association. The fans took an active part in getting the stadium ready for the club&#x27;s return in 2005. 

==Statistics and records==

Margate&#x27;s best ever league finish since the establishment of the Alliance Premier League in 1979 was the 8th-place finish in the Conference National (level5 of the overall English football league system) in 2001–02. The team have twice progressed as far as the third round proper of the FA Cup, in 1935–36 and 1972–73, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy in 2001–02. The club&#x27;s biggest victory is 12–1, achieved against Deal Cinque Ports in the FA Cup first qualifying round in 1919 and against Erith &amp; Belvedere in the Kent League in the 1927–28 season. The Gate&#x27;s heaviest defeat was 11–0 against AFC Bournemouth in the FA Cup first round on 20 November 1971.

The highest recorded attendance at Hartsdown Park was 14,169 for the visit of Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup in 1972–73. Margate&#x27;s all-time appearance record holder is Bob Harrop, who played 564 times. Martin Buglione holds the record for most career goals with 158. Jack Palethorpe holds the record for the most goals scored in a single season, having scored 66 in the 1929–30 season.

==Managers==

Margate&#x27;s first known manager was Arthur Graves, who was installed as manager when Margate Town was reformed in 1929. By far the club&#x27;s longest-serving manager was Almer Hall, who was manager for twenty years from 1950 until 1970. Several former professional players have managed the club, the most high-profile being the former Welsh international Terry Yorath.

==Rivalries==
Margate&#x27;s main traditional rivalry is with Thanet neighbours Ramsgate, with whom Margate contest the Thanet derby. Matches between the two teams drew large crowds in the 1960s, but the rivalry has waned in subsequent decades, largely due to the two teams rarely playing in the same league. Another of Margate&#x27;s rivals is Dover Athletic. Despite similarly meeting rarely in competitive games over recent years, both teams were in the Conference in the 2001–02 season, when the two games between Margate and Dover were watched by a combined total of over 6,000 spectators. The game played at Margate&#x27;s Hartsdown Park stadium drew a crowd of 3,676, and 2,325 were in attendance for the game at Dover&#x27;s Crabble stadium.
