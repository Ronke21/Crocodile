<text>Out in L.A. is a compilation of rare tracks by the Red Hot Chili Peppers released November 1, 1994, on EMI. Interpreted by music critics as an attempt by EMI to capitalize on the group&#x27;s newfound success with Warner Bros., it collects remixes, demo recordings, live covers and outtakes. On release, &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; received negative reviews from music critics.

==Background==
The tracks contained are varied with the inclusion of four remixes, live cover songs of Jimi Hendrix and Thelonious Monk (&quot;F.U.&quot; is a joke lyric over the melody of &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot;), the band&#x27;s first demos and joke songs. The 1988 outtake, &quot;Blues for Meister&quot;, which was the first song sung by Flea that the band released, was the only song released or recorded with then guitarist DeWayne McKnight who would soon be replaced by John Frusciante that same year. The song uses a backing track recorded by Flea and Irons, before Slovak&#x27;s death.

The songs &quot;Stranded&quot; and &quot;Flea Fly&quot; are two of the band&#x27;s earliest recordings from 1983 when they went under the name Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem. The other demo recordings included come from the band&#x27;s first demo tape are the first the band made and are described in Anthony Kiedis&#x27; autobiography &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; as being the most prolific sessions the band ever had. The demo recording was produced by Spit Stix, Flea&#x27;s then bandmate in the legendary punk band, Fear. Four of these songs were recorded with Jack Sherman and Cliff Martinez on the band&#x27;s first album however, these early versions are said to be the preferred ones as they capture the original vibe intended. Hillel Slovak&#x27;s and Jack Irons&#x27;s playing are instrumental to this. Many of these tracks were included in the remastered versions of the band&#x27;s first two albums and it was these demos that eventually got the band their first shows and eventually a recording contract with EMI. The band&#x27;s joke cover of &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; was released as a very rare 7-inch promotional jukebox single in 1994. &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; was featured as the track&#x27;s b-side.

==Critical reception==

In a zero out of five review, &quot;Select&quot; critic Matt Hall referred to it as EMI&#x27;s &quot;predictable&quot; collection of outtakes, demos, remixes and &quot;ropey&quot; live cuts, released to capitalize on the band&#x27;s success with Warner Bros., but complained that &quot;everything passable that the Chilis recorded for EMI has already been released.&quot; He criticized the inclusion of short tracks and felt that the 12&quot; mix of &quot;Higher Ground&quot; was the album&#x27;s only consolation, hoping that the album&#x27;s compiler &quot;will get septic fingers from the splinters gained while indulging in such a blatant display of barrel-scraping.&quot; Bob Bahr of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; also called it an attempt by EMI to cash-in on the group&#x27;s Warner Bros. success and believed that hardcore Chili Peppers fans would not need the album. He praised the first three remixes, particularly the dance remix of &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot;, and drew attention to the live tracks, but believed the demos and unreleased song snippets are radio unfriendly, concluding that &quot;the only thing that the rough-hewn &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; proves is that the Red Hot Chili Peppers needed no studio tricks or mirrors to be funky. And we knew that anyway.&quot;

More favorably, &quot;NME&quot;″s Dele Fadele wrote that while &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; was not a definitive examination of the group&#x27;s &quot;motherfunky beatnik mishmash&quot; period, as their first two albums to be more revealing in that respect, &quot;its selection of remixes, OK live tracks, dodgy demos and self-indulgent unreleased songs induces a wry smile.&quot; Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that the outtakes &quot;aren&#x27;t bad&quot; by the standards of &quot;overrated&quot; bands, believing that the &quot;more recent freaked-out dance remixes wear out their welcome sooner than the decade-old demo tape pogos, partly because their rubber-lipped rapping was less awkward when they were trying to be old-school.&quot; Larry Nager of &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; notes that while the album displays the group&#x27;s &quot;patented funk-heavy sound&quot;, their a cappella rendition of &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; &quot;won&#x27;t be keeping Boyz II Men up nights.&quot; In the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot;, Gary Graff felt that the contents were &quot;a bit too obscure and inconsistent for all but true devotees&quot;, with tracks combined in &quot;a manner too scattershot to shed any real light on the Chili Peppers&#x27; modern funk attack.&quot; While criticising the demo tracks for being inferior to their completed versions, he praised Ben Grosse&#x27;s &quot;taut and spicy&quot; remix of &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, and the &quot;fun&quot; concert recordings.

Retrospectively, AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described it as a &quot;tepid collection of remixes and obscurities&quot; which would only appeal to devoted fans of the band, although &quot;even they might have their patience tested by this overly long compilation.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; is described as a collection of &quot;early-Eighties demos that are essentially an homage to Flea&#x27;s bass playing and little else.&quot; Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; opines that the compilation provides an &quot;otherwise unavailable&quot; taste of the group, with its diverse array of remixes, &quot;demos of lesser tracks&quot; from early albums, &quot;fragmentary outtakes that deserved to remain that way&quot;, &quot;crummy&quot; live covers and &quot;a brief, rude jazz incident&quot; (&quot;F.U.&quot;). &quot;Of possible value to scholars of the band,&quot; he wrote, &quot;&quot;Out in L.A.&quot; is way too uneven to be of serious concern to anyone else.&quot; Bob Mack, in the &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot;, called &quot;Out in L.A.&quot; a &quot;hodge and podge&quot; compilation &quot;mostly larded with Cure-like remixes and thin live tracks.&quot;

==Track listing==
Notes
*A majority of the track lengths given on the back cover are incorrect, most notably for &quot;Flea Fly&quot;, which is listed as 1:37. Another key mistake was the listing of the incorrect recording dates for the demos. The booklet states they were recorded in 1982 however the band did not form until 1983. Neither of these mistakes were ever corrected. The album also fails to even list recording dates for a few songs most notably &quot;Blues for Meister&quot; and &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;.

<text>TruTV (stylized as truTV) is an American basic cable channel owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. The channel primarily broadcasts reruns of comedy, docusoaps and reality shows, with a recent strong primetime focus on live sports. The channel was originally launched on December 14, 1990 as Court TV, a network that focused on crime-themed programs such as true crime documentary series, legal dramas, and coverage of prominent criminal cases. The channel was initially a joint venture between Time Warner, Cablevision, American Lawyer Media, Liberty Media, and GE, with Liberty joining the venture a year after its launch in 1991.

By 2005, Liberty Media and Time Warner had purchased ALM, Cablevision and GE&#x27;s stakes in Court TV. Time Warner subsequently bought out Liberty&#x27;s share in 2006 for $735 million, and brought the channel under the Turner Broadcasting System. In 2008, the channel relaunched as TruTV, changing its focus to action-oriented docusoaps and &quot;caught on camera&quot; programs, which it marketed as &quot;actuality&quot; television. The channel continued to carry legal coverage during the daytime hours under the title &quot;In Session&quot;, but this was phased out by September 2013. The Court TV name was later bought by Katz Broadcasting (now Scripps Networks), which since 2017 has been part of the E. W. Scripps Company.

In 2011, the channel began to add occasional sports broadcasts from Turner Sports (renamed TNT Sports in 2023), primarily the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In October 2014, TruTV pivoted its format to focus more on comedy-based reality series, such as &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;. In March 2024, TruTV began to increase its focus on sports programming, introducing a weeknight block that will feature sports-related programming, as well as being incorporated into new and upcoming TNT Sports rights such as MotoGP and NASCAR. TruTV was available to approximately 91 million households (78.1%) in the United States. By June 2023, this number has dropped to 68.3 million households.

==History==

===Court TV===
The Courtroom Television Network, or Court TV for short, was launched on July 1, 1991, at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and was available to three million subscribers. Its original anchors were Jack Ford, Fred Graham, Cynthia McFadden, and Gregg Jarrett. The network was born out of two competing projects to launch cable channels with live courtroom proceedings, the American Trial Network from Time Warner and American Lawyer Media (ALM), and In Court from Cablevision and NBC. Both projects were present at the National Cable Television Association in June 1990. Rather than trying to establish two competing networks, the projects were combined on December 14, 1990. Liberty Media would join the venture in 1991.

The channel originally consisted of live courtroom trials that are interspersed with anchors and reporters. It was led by law writer Steven Brill, who later left the network in 1997. The network came into its own during the Menéndez brothers&#x27; first trial in 1994, and the O.J. Simpson murder trial in 1995.

In 1997, Time Warner acquired ALM to gain ownership of its stake in Court TV; it subsequently sold its publications to a private equity fund in 1998. In 1998, NBC sold its share of the network to Time Warner. That same year, Court TV began running several original and acquired programs in prime time, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cops&quot;, and &quot;Forensic Files&quot;.

In 2001, Court TV purchased The Smoking Gun, a website that focuses on legal items such as mug shots and other public documents pertaining to famous individuals and cases. The site remained a property of the company through the rebranding to TruTV, but was sold back to its founder in 2014. In the same year, Court TV also purchased the website Crime Library, which provided detailed information about infamous crimes and how they were solved. The website remained an actively updated TruTV property until 2014 and was taken offline in 2015.

On February 3, 2003, &quot;Court TV Plus&quot; debuted on Sirius Satellite Radio, featuring audio from Court TV programs. Launched on Channel 134, it was moved in September 2005 and aired on Channel 110 until the channel ceased operations on January 1, 2008.

Recognizing the growth of its primetime programming, Court TV announced in 2005 that it would split its programming into two brands. Daytime trial coverage was branded as &quot;Court TV News&quot;, while other dayparts—promoted under the tagline &quot;Seriously Entertaining&quot;—focused on reality shows dealing with crime-related topics. In January 2006, the network launched a male-targeted programming block known as &quot;RED&quot; (&quot;Real. Exciting. Dramatic.&quot;).

In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media&#x27;s stake in Court TV for $735 million, valuing the channel at $1.5 billion. The channel was integrated into Time Warner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting unit; executives indicated that Court TV planned to maintain its existing format, and did not rule out creating synergies with CNN for their legal coverage. In 2007, the channel premiered its first original scripted series, &quot;&#x27;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;—an anthology of crime re-enactments hosted by filmmaker John Waters.

===TruTV===

On July 11, 2007, Time Warner announced that Court TV would be relaunched as TruTV on January 1, 2008. The new brand was intended to accompany a larger shift towards action-oriented reality series which did not necessarily involve crime or law enforcement, such as &quot;Black Gold&quot;, &quot;Hardcore Pawn&quot;, &quot;Lizard Lick Towing&quot;, &quot;Ocean Force&quot;, and the caught-on-camera series &quot;World&#x27;s Dumbest&quot;. TruTV promoted its new positioning under the slogan &quot;Not Reality. Actuality.&quot;; network staff argued that the term &quot;reality&quot; had become associated with &quot;unrealistic&quot; programming, and that it wanted to emphasize that its new programs would feature &quot;real&quot; people.

As part of the re-branding as TruTV, daytime trial coverage was cut back to 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. ET and branded as &quot;In Session.&quot; In 2009, production of the program was shifted to the facilities of HLN in Atlanta. On March 4, 2013, &quot;In Session&quot; was cut to a two-hour, taped format. On September 30, 2013, &quot;In Session&quot; was cancelled, and replaced by a block of library programming under the title &quot;In Session Presents&quot;.

In 2011, as part of a new partnership between CBS Sports and Turner Sports, TruTV began to broadcast coverage of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

Reruns of Court TV series have since aired on HLN (primarily &quot;Forensic Files&quot;), and have also been syndicated to the over-the-air digital network Justice Network (now True Crime Network). With changes to HLN&#x27;s programming strategy and the growing popularity of the genre, the network began to produce and premiere more original true crime programs in 2017. In December 2018, Turner sold the rights to the Court TV brand and programming library to Scripps Media subsidiary Katz Broadcasting, which relaunched it as an over-the-air digital network in May 2019, reviving the dormant brand after 11 years.

==== Shift to comedy ====
Although noting that it had experienced &quot;tremendous success&quot; with individual programs, TruTV&#x27;s new president and head of programming Chris Linn explained that the network&#x27;s overall growth as a brand had been hindered due to its lingering association with Court TV and its tone of programming, and its reliance on &quot;conflict-reliant, heavy, dramatic and maybe overly produced&quot; docuseries with derivative premises. In April 2014, the network announced that it would undergo a brand repositioning for the 2014–15 television season aimed towards &quot;funseekers&quot;, with a focus on comedy-oriented docusoaps, semi-scripted series, sketch comedies and reality competitions.

Building upon the success of &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot; (which Linn compared to a &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; due to its contrasting premise to other truTV programs at the time) and &quot;The Carbonaro Effect&quot;, the network greenlit a number of new series as part of the re-launch, including &quot;Barmageddon&quot;, the &quot;reality musical&quot; &quot;Branson Famous&quot;, &quot;Fake Off&quot;, &quot;Hack My Life&quot;, and &quot;Kart Life&quot;. As part of the relaunch, a new marketing campaign (&quot;Way More Fun&quot;) and updated logo were introduced on October 27, 2014, with the channel being temporarily marketed as &quot;The New truTV&quot; to emphasize the change in format.

Since the repositioning, TruTV has also parodied its temporary prominence during the NCAA tournament with various advertising campaigns, seeking to promote the channel and its programming to the expanded audience. A common theme of these campaigns, which have included the 2015 social media campaign &quot;#HaveUFoundtrutv&quot;, and a &quot;truTV Awareness Month&quot; campaign in 2018, involved commenting upon viewers who were having trouble finding TruTV on their television provider&#x27;s lineup, or were unaware of the channel entirely. Of the former, Puja Vohra, Senior vice president of marketing and digital, explained that the campaign was intended to portray the network&#x27;s brand as being &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;self-aware&quot;.

In December 2016, truTV unveiled a new marketing campaign and slogan, &quot;Funny Because It&#x27;s tru&quot;. The campaign reinforced the network&#x27;s focus on comedy by satirizing the &quot;cliches&quot; of television promos.

On March 4, 2019, AT&amp;T announced a major reorganization of its broadcasting assets to effectively dissolve Turner Broadcasting. Its assets were dispersed across multiple units of WarnerMedia with TruTV along with TBS, TNT and HBO moving to newly formed WarnerMedia Entertainment.

=== Expansion of sports programming ===
On March 11, 2024, TruTV soft launched a new evening and primetime block focused on TNT Sports content. This will include alternate broadcasts of sporting events carried by its sister networks, as well as new studio shows, and sports-related documentaries and films. The division&#x27;s vice president Luis Silberwasser stated that the block would give TNT Sports a more &quot;consistent&quot; and &quot;comprehensive&quot; presence on its networks. As part of these changes, the channel&#x27;s last original non-sports series, &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, would also move permanently to TBS beginning that summer (after having recently simulcast new episodes with TruTV). After its soft launch, it was announced in July 2024 that the block would be given a more &quot;pronounced&quot; presence and branding beginning in October.

==High definition==
The 1080 high-definition simulcast feed of TruTV is available on all major cable and satellite providers. In March 2011, the channel saw carriage of its HD feed increase, due to its coverage of the 2011 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament (and subsequent tournaments), which was its first-ever live sports telecast.

==Programming==

Presently, TruTV airs a mix of original comedy-genre reality and lifestyle series (such as &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, &quot;The Carbonaro Effect&quot;, and &quot;Adam Ruins Everything&quot;), as well as acquired sitcoms (such as &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;Family Matters&quot;) and films.

===Sports programming===
====Occasional coverage (2010–2022)====
On February 8, 2010, TruTV premiered &quot;NFL Full Contact&quot;, a show that gave a behind-the-scenes look at the television production for major football events such as the Super Bowl, the NFL draft, the Pro Bowl, and the season opener; the show was not renewed for a second season.

On March 15, 2011, TruTV began airing live sports programming for the first time with its telecasts of the 2011 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The agreement is part of a contract between Turner Sports and CBS Sports resulting in shared coverage of the NCAA men&#x27;s tournament through 2032. TruTV airs games during the opening rounds of the tournament, and exclusively carries the First Four play-in round, which was concurrently introduced the same year. It also carries the studio show &quot;Inside March Madness&quot; during the tournament. Until its discontinuation, TruTV also aired the pre-season Coaches vs. Cancer Classic.

In 2015, TruTV carried a series of HBO-produced Top Rank boxing telecasts under the title &quot;MetroPCS Friday Night Knockout&quot;, as a companion to &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;. In May 2016, TruTV broadcast the opening rounds of the inaugural NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship; Turner would also televise the event in 2017.

In 2021, TruTV began to serve as an overflow outlet for the &quot;NHL on TNT&quot;, in the event that a game in a TNT doubleheader runs long.

==== Expansion of sports (2023–present) ====
Beginning with the 2023 MLB postseason, Warner Bros. Discovery began expanding the number of sports offerings on TruTV. TruTV first simulcast TBS&#x27;s coverage of the 2023 National League Division Series, then provided the alternate broadcast &quot;Pelotoros&quot; during the NLCS, which was hosted by Alanna Rizzo and featured a panel of Hispanic and Latin American MLB players. In November 2023, TruTV began airing the Hall of Fame Series, an early-season college basketball showcase in Las Vegas. TruTV was announced as part of NASCAR&#x27;s new media rights with TNT beginning in 2025, airing practice and qualifying sessions for 19 NASCAR Cup Series races per season.

During the 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament, TruTV began airing a sports betting focused alternate telecast. This was shown for two quarterfinal games and TNT&#x27;s semifinal game. The &quot;BetCast&quot; airs alongside the TNT broadcast for select games. In March 2024, TruTV and Max acquired the U.S. rights to the MotoGP series. In the 2023–24 NHL season, TruTV aired multiple alternate broadcasts, including a February 14, 2024 broadcast featuring Paul Bissonnette and the panel of his &quot;Spittin&#x27; Chiclets&quot; podcast, an April 14 broadcast featuring a real-time 3D animated version of the game promoting the Warner Bros. Games-published video game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, and the &quot;NHL DataCast&quot; during the Western Conference final.

Ahead of the 2024 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, TruTV announced a new slate of sports-related studio programs as part of its relaunched primetime lineup, which includes the evening programs &quot;TNT Sports Tonight&quot;, hosted by CNN sports correspondent Coy Wire, and the sports betting show &quot;The Line&quot;, hosted by Adam Lefkoe. TruTV also airs the NBA TV program &quot;#Handles&quot; and a weekly House of Highlights television series hosted by &quot;The Broadcast Boys&quot;.

Ahead of the 2024 NCAA Division I FBS football season, TNT Sports signed a broadcasting agreement with the Mountain West Conference to broadcast 14 of the conference&#x27;s games on TruTV. In September 2024, FanDuel TV began syndicating its studio show &quot;Up &amp; Adams&quot; (hosted by former NFL Network host Kay Adams) on TruTV; the program had also been syndicated to Max.

TruTV, along with TNT, will begin live coverage of the new women&#x27;s three-on-three basketball league Unrivaled in January 2025.

===As Court TV===
As Court TV, the channel&#x27;s programming traditionally consisted of reality legal programming and legal dramas, such as legal-based news shows, legal-based talk shows, live homicide trial coverage, court shows, police force shows, and other criminal justice programming.

The channel also carried a week-daily news block, &quot;In Session&quot; (the successor to &quot;Court TV News&quot;), which provided live coverage of trials, legal news and details of highly publicized crimes Monday through Fridays from 9 to 11 a.m. ET (except during national holidays, with reruns of the channel&#x27;s reality programming airing in place of the block on such days). Its coverage included analysis from anchors and guests to help viewers understand legal proceedings. &quot;In Session&quot; also ran a blog, &quot;Sidebar,&quot; where the &quot;In Session&quot; team posted updated legal news and analysis. &quot;In Session&quot; moved to a new studio in Atlanta at the CNN Center on November 16, 2009. Online coverage of current trials later moved to CNN.com&#x27;s &quot;Crime&quot; section and production of the block was eventually taken over by sister network HLN. &quot;In Session&quot; anchors also appeared on CNN to provide legal analysis about current crime stories and trials. &quot;In Session&quot; concluded its run on September 26, 2013.

==International==

===Canada===
Court TV Canada, owned by CHUM Limited (and later acquired by CTVglobemedia which then sold its assets to Bell Canada under the Bell Media subsidiary), launched on September 7, 2001. Unlike its U.S. counterpart, it did not relaunch under the TruTV name and continued its previous format until August 30, 2010, when, as part of a wider licensing agreement with Discovery Communications and CTV, Court TV Canada was rebranded as a Canadian version of Investigation Discovery.

The U.S. version of Court TV had earlier been approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission as an eligible foreign channel in 1997, and indeed, had been carried by several Canadian service providers prior to the launch of the domestic service. Even after its rebrand, TruTV was never withdrawn as an eligible foreign service for carriage on cable and satellite, meaning that, particularly with the end of the licensing agreement with CHUM, there were few theoretical hurdles that prevented TruTV from re-emerging on Canadian service providers.

Ultimately, the rights to TruTV&#x27;s original programs have been dispersed across other Canadian cable channels, particularly CMT and Action, both owned by Corus Entertainment, and OLN, owned by Rogers Media. Of the three networks, Action had been the predominant broadcaster of TruTV programming. On April 1, 2019, Action was converted to a new full-time Adult Swim network.

===Latin America===
The channel was launched on April 1, 2009, in Latin America replacing Retro, also owned by Turner Broadcasting System. The announcement was made on March 25, 2009, by Turner Broadcasting System Latin America. The channel has the same programming, idents, and bumpers from the U.S. version. On September 3, 2023, it was announced that TruTV would be replaced by 24/7 channel, Adult Swim on October 31.

===UK and Ireland===
In May 2014, Turner Broadcasting System announced that it would launch a separate UK version of the U.S. channel. On February 16, 2017, Sony Pictures Television acquired the channel from Turner. On February 12, 2019, the UK channel was renamed True Crime.

===Asia===
The channel was launched on April 1, 2010, in several markets in Asia including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. The channel is owned and operated by Turner Broadcasting System Asia Pacific and has similar programming, idents, and bumpers to the U.S. version, but many are also created by the Turner regional office in Hong Kong. As of 31 December 2018, the selected TruTV programmes is currently shown on Warner TV Asia. The channel shut down alongside TCM.

<text>The Ramapo Mountains are a forested chain of the Appalachian Mountains in northeastern New Jersey and southeastern New York, in the United States. They range in height from in New Jersey, and in New York.

Several parks and forest preserves encompass parts of the Ramapos (see Points of interest, below), and many hiking trails are in the Ramapos, including sections of the Appalachian Trail, which is maintained and updated in the Ramapo Mountains by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference.

In New York, the mountains serve to divide Orange and Rockland Counties. The difficulty of crossing the mountains is what caused Rockland County to break away from Orange County in 1798.

The mountains are named after the Ramapo Fault, which trends northeast to southwest, and separates the eastern Piedmont geologic province from the Highland province.

The Ramapos are composed of granite, gneiss, and marble, as old as 1.3 billion years.

<doc id="455344" wikidata="Q5478669" url="?curid=455344" title="Frances Glessner Lee">
<text>Frances Glessner Lee (March 25, 1878 – January 27, 1962) was an American forensic scientist. She was influential in developing the science of forensics in the United States. To this end, she created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, twenty true crime scene dioramas recreated in minute detail at dollhouse scale, used for training homicide investigators. Eighteen of the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death are still in use for teaching purposes by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and the dioramas are also now considered works of art. Glessner Lee also helped to establish the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard University, and endowed the Magrath Library of Legal Medicine there. She became the first female police captain in the United States, and is known as the &quot;mother of forensic science&quot;.

==Early life==
Glessner Lee was born in Chicago on March 25, 1878. Her father, John Jacob Glessner, was an industrialist who became wealthy from International Harvester. She and her brother were educated at home; her brother went to Harvard.

As a child Frances fell ill with tonsillitis, and her mother took her to the doctor. When the first doctor prescribed a dangerous treatment for her illness, the Glessners sought a second opinion and Frances underwent a successful surgery at a time when surgery was very dangerous and often lethal.

Frances became interested in learning more about medicine because of this experience. When summering in the White Mountains, local doctors allowed her to attend home visits with them. There Glessner learned the skills of nursing.

She inherited the Harvester fortune and finally had the money to pursue an interest in how detectives could examine clues.

==Career==
Glessner Lee was inspired to pursue forensic investigation by one of her brother&#x27;s classmates, George Burgess Magrath, with whom she was close friends. He was studying medicine at Harvard Medical School and was particularly interested in death investigation. Magrath would become a professor in pathology at Harvard Medical School and a chief medical examiner in Boston and together they lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals.

In 1931, Glessner Lee endowed the Harvard Department of Legal Medicine—the first such department in the country—and her gifts would later establish the George Burgess Magrath Library, a chair in legal medicine, and the Harvard Seminars in Homicide Investigation.

She also endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, a national organization for the furtherance of forensic science; it has a division dedicated to her, called the Frances Glessner Lee Homicide School.

=== Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death ===

In 1945 Glessner Lee donated her dioramas to Harvard for use in her seminars. She hosted a series of semi-annual seminars, where she presented 30 to 40 men with the &quot;Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death&quot;, intricately constructed dioramas of actual crime scenes, complete with working doors, windows and lights. The 20 models were based on composites of actual cases and were designed to test the abilities of students to collect all relevant evidence. The models depicted multiple causes of death, and were based on autopsies and crime scenes that Glessner Lee visited.

Glessner Lee paid close attention to detail in creating the models. The rooms were filled with working mousetraps and rocking chairs, food in the kitchens, and more, and the corpses accurately represented discoloration or bloating that would be present at the crime scene. Each model cost about $3,000-$4,500 to create. Viewers were given 90 minutes to study the scene. Eighteen of the original dioramas were still used for training purposes by Harvard Associates in Police Science in 1999. As of 2020, the models could be found at the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, where they were still used in the annual Frances Glessner Lee homicide investigation seminar.

For her work, Glessner Lee was made a captain in the New Hampshire State Police on October 27, 1943, making her the first woman to join the International Association of Chiefs of Police. This has been reported as honorary, but in &quot;18 Tiny Deaths&quot; by Bruce Goldfarb, New Hampshire Police Superintendent Ralph Caswell (who appointed her captain) is quoted as saying, &quot;This was not an honorary post. She was actually a full fledged captain with all the authority and responsibility of the post.&quot;

The dioramas of the crime scenes Glessner depicted were as follows; three room dwelling, log cabin, blue bedroom, dark bathroom, burned cabin, unpapered bedroom, pink bathroom, attic, woodsman&#x27;s shack, barn, saloon and jail, striped bedroom, living room, two story porch, kitchen, garage, parsonage parlor, and bedroom. They were once part of an exhibit in the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

==Personal life==
Glessner married a lawyer, Blewett Harrison Lee, who was from the family line of General Robert E Lee, with whom she had three children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1914.

Glessner Lee&#x27;s perfectionism and dioramas reflect her family background. Her father was an avid collector of fine furniture with which he furnished the family home. He wrote a book on the subject, and the family home, designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, is now the John J. Glessner House museum on the near South Side of Chicago.

The first miniature Glessner built was of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She did so for her mother&#x27;s birthday and it was her biggest project at the time. Glessner Lee was fond of the stories of Sherlock Holmes, whose plot twists were often the result of overlooked details.

<doc id="455346" wikidata="Q3238884" url="?curid=455346" title="Gravesend, Brooklyn">
<text>Gravesend is a neighborhood in the south-central section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, on the southwestern edge of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York. It is bounded by the Belt Parkway to the south, Bay Parkway to the west, Avenue P to the north, and Ocean Parkway to the east.

Gravesend was one of the original towns in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. After the English took over, it was one of the six original towns of Kings County in colonial New York. Gravesend was the only English chartered town in what became Kings County, and is notable as being one of the first towns founded by a woman, Lady Deborah Moody. The Town of Gravesend encompassed in southern Kings County, including the entire peninsula of Coney Island, and was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894.

The modern-day neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community Board 11 and Brooklyn Community Board 13. As of 2020, Gravesend had a population of 30,587.

==Name==

The name &quot;Gravesend&quot; was given to the area by New Amsterdam&#x27;s Dutch authorities. Local sources think that the name probably comes from Dutch words, which when combined can mean &quot;groves end&quot; or &quot;Count&#x27;s beach&quot;.

Historic sources, written in Dutch, suggest that it was named by the Dutch governor general Willem Kieft for the Dutch settlement of &quot; &#x27;s&#x27;Gravesande&quot; (now &#x27;s-Gravenzande) in the Netherlands, which means &quot;Count&#x27;s Beach&quot; or &quot;Count&#x27;s Sand&quot;. A 1656 map of Nova Belgica confirms this, by mentioning the names of Dutch towns like Vlissingen (Flushing), Breukelen (Brooklyn), Amersfoort (Flatlands), Heemstee (Hempstead, Heemstede which means homestead) and Gravesant (&#x27;s-Gravenzande).

Because of the association with Lady Moody, some speculate that it was named after the English seaport of Gravesend, Kent.

==Geography==

The modern neighborhood of Gravesend lies between East 12th Street or Coney Island Avenue to the east, Stillwell Avenue to the west, Avenue P to the north, and Coney Island Creek and Shore Parkway to the south. To the east of Gravesend is Homecrest and Sheepshead Bay, to the northeast Midwood, to the northwest Bensonhurst, and to the west Bath Beach. To the south, across Coney Island Creek, lies the neighborhood of Coney Island, and across Shore Parkway lies Brighton Beach.

Calvert Vaux Park, formerly Dreier Offerman Park, is located southwest of the neighborhood.

===White Sands===
South of Shore Parkway and north of Coney Island Creek, is sometimes called White Sands. Originally, White Sands consisted of several short, dead-end streets with no through-routes within the neighborhood. Currently, it consists of two blocks of residences and a Home Depot location.

White Sands&#x27; name is derived from the white sand which formerly covered the shore and the mouth of Coney Island Creek. The first houses to be built in the neighborhood were bungalows that were raised on stilts above the sand, but as development slowly progressed, much of the sand was removed and replaced with landfill. In 1993, Home Depot became interested in White Sands as the location for a new store due to its location near the highly-used Cropsey Avenue and Shore Parkway. By 2000, Home Depot had acquired about two-thirds of the properties in White Sands, and by 2002, the acquired properties had been razed and replaced by a new Home Depot location.

==History==

===Early history===

The island and its environs were first inhabited by bands of Lenape, an Algonquian-speaking tribe that occupied territory along both sides of Long Island Sound, and through coastal areas through present-day New Jersey and down to Delaware. The first known European believed to set foot in the area that would become Gravesend was Henry Hudson, whose ship, &quot;the Half Moon&quot;, landed at Coney Island in the fall of 1609. The Dutch claimed this land as part of their New Netherland Colony.

Gravesend is notable as one of the few colonial towns to be founded by a woman, Lady Deborah Moody (Jeanne Mance being another notable female founder). In 1643, governor general Willem Kieft granted her and a group of English settlers a land patent on December 19, 1645. Moody, along with John Tilton and wife Mary Pearsall Tilton, came to Gravesend after choosing excommunication, following religious persecution in Lynn, Massachusetts. Moody and Mary Tilton had been tried because of their Anabaptist beliefs, accused of spreading religious dissent in the Puritan colony. Kieft was recruiting settlers to secure this land that his forces had taken from the Lenape. Some clashes continued, and the town organization was not completed until 1645. The signed town charter and grant was one of the first to ever be awarded to a woman in the New World. John Tilton became the first town clerk of Gravesend and owned part of what later would become Coney Island. Moody, the Tiltons, and other early English settlers were known to have paid the Lenape for their land. Another prominent early settler was Anthony Janszoon van Salee.

The Town of Gravesend encompassed in southern Kings County, including the entire island of Coney Island. This was originally used as the town&#x27;s common lands on the Atlantic Ocean. It was divided, as was the town itself, into 41 parcels for the original patentees. When the town was first laid out, almost half of the area was made up of salt marsh wetlands and sandhill dunes along the shore of Gravesend Bay. It was one of the earliest planned communities in America. It consisted of a square surrounded by a 20-foot-high wooden palisade. The town was bisected by two main roads, Gravesend Road (now McDonald Avenue) running from north to south, and Gravesend Neck Road, running from east to west. These roads divided the town into four quadrants, which were subdivided into ten plots of land each. This grid of the original town can still be seen on maps and aerial photographs of the area. At the center of town, where the two main roads met, a town hall was constructed where town meetings were held once a month.

The neighborhood center is still the four blocks bounded by Village Road South, Village Road East, Village Road North, and Van Sicklen Street, where the Moody House and Van Sicklen family cemetery are located. Next to, and parallel with the van Sicklen Family Cemetery is the Old Gravesend Cemetery, where Lady Moody is said to be interred. Egyptian émigré Mohammad Ben Misoud, who was part of a late 19th-century attraction at the Coney Island amusement park, was given a proper Muslim funeral upon his death in August 1896 and also buried in Old Gravesend Cemetery.

The religious freedom of early Gravesend made it a destination for ostracized or controversial groups, &quot;Nonconformists&quot; or &quot;Dissenters&quot; such as the Quakers, who briefly made their home in the town before being chased out by the succeeding New Netherland director general Peter Stuyvesant, who arrived in 1647. He was wary of Gravesend&#x27;s open acceptance of &quot;heretical&quot; sects.

In 1654 the people of Gravesend purchased Coney Island from the local Lenape band for about $15 worth of seashells, guns, and gunpowder.

In August 1776 during the American Revolutionary War, Gravesend Bay was the landing site of thousands of British soldiers and German mercenaries from their staging area on Staten Island, leading to the Battle of Long Island (also &quot;Battle of Brooklyn&quot;). The troops met little resistance from the Continental Army advance troops under General George Washington then headquartered in New York City (at the time limited to the tip of Manhattan Island). The battle, in addition to being the first, would prove to be the largest fought in the entire war.

===Popularity and success===

Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Gravesend remained a sleepy suburb. With the opening of three prominent racetracks (Sheepshead Bay Race Track, Gravesend Race Track, and Brighton Beach Race Course) in the late 19th century, and the blossoming of Coney Island into a popular vacation spot, the town was developed as a successful resort community. John Y. McKane was credited with this. A Sheepshead Bay carpenter and contractor, he gained a variety of elected and appointed positions: as Gravesend town supervisor, chief of police, chief of detectives, fire commissioner, schools commissioner, public lands commissioner, superintendent of the Sheepshead Bay Methodist Church, head tenor of the church choir, and Santa Claus at the annual Sabbath school Christmas celebration. From the 1870s to the 1890s, McKane cultivated Coney Island, which was then part of the township of Gravesend, as a pleasure ground. He participated in both political and physical development.

As town constable, McKane expanded the Gravesend police force considerably and personally patrolled the beach. McKane became corrupt, using the pretense of town permits to extort tribute from every business, large or small, on Coney Island. Presenting himself as a champion of law and order, he skimmed much money from the many brothels and gambling parlors that thrived in his bailiwick. During McKane&#x27;s reign Coney Island came to be known by many as &quot;Sodom by the Sea&quot;.

McKane became a Democratic Party ward boss and had loose standards on who was allowed to vote: immigrants, dead people, seasonal migrant workers, and criminals. Voting records show many specious entries. On the eve of the 1893 election, William Gaynor, a lawyer running for Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice, decided to test McKane&#x27;s methods by dispatching more than 20 Republican observers to examine the Gravesend voter registries and oversee the voting in all six districts of the town, as he was entitled to do by law. However, when the observers reached Gravesend town hall at dawn on election day, McKane, along with a large group of policemen and cronies, confronted them. When the observers balked and produced injunctions from the Brooklyn Supreme Court, McKane supposedly declared &quot;injunctions don&#x27;t go here&quot; and ordered the men away. A scuffle ensued and five of the observers were beaten and arrested. This event raised great outrage. Early in the following year, McKane was tried, convicted, and sentenced to six years in Sing Sing for such corruption. He was released near the end of the century and died of a stroke in his Sheepshead Bay home in 1899.

After McKane&#x27;s fall from power, Gravesend and Coney Island were annexed in 1894 by the city of Brooklyn, which in turn became part of New York City in 1898. George C. Tilyou created one of Coney Island’s first amusement parks, Steeplechase Park, the opening of which ushered in Coney Island’s golden age.

Around the same time, Gravesend was the site of testing for the Boynton Bicycle Railroad, the earliest forerunner of the monorail. The BBR consisted of a single-wheeled engine that hauled two double-decker passenger cars along a single track; a second rail above the train, supported by wooden arches, kept it from tipping over. The engine and cars were four feet wide and were capable of speeds far greater than the much bulkier standard trains. In 1889, the BBR began running a short route between the Gravesend stop of the Sea Beach Railroad (near the intersection of 86th and West Seventh Streets) and Brighton Beach in Coney Island, a distance of just over a mile. Despite the smooth and speedy ride, the BBR ultimately failed and the test route fell into disuse, as did the Boynton train and its shed.

===Later years===

Although Coney Island continued to be a major tourist attraction throughout the 20th century, the closing of Gravesend&#x27;s great racetracks in the century&#x27;s first decade resulted in the rest of the old town fading into obscurity. Most of it was developed as a working and middle-class residential Brooklyn neighborhood. During the 1920s, many one-family homes were built in Gravesend, which were then converted to two-family housing during the Great Depression.

In the 1950s, the city constructed the 28-building Marlboro Houses, public housing units run by the New York City Housing Authority, located between Avenues V and X from Stillwell Avenue to the Gravesend subway yards. Gradually this housing became occupied predominantly by African Americans. On the other hand, the area in the northeast part of Gravesend, bound by McDonald Avenue, Kings Highway, Ocean Parkway, and Avenue U, saw an influx of affluent Sephardi Jews (mostly Syrian Jews) during the 1970s. These residents built large Spanish Colonial-style houses, and had their own police force.

In 1982, an African-American transit worker named Willie Turks was beaten to death in Gravesend by a group of white teenagers. The relationship between the predominantly African-American and more poor population of the Marlboro Houses and the predominantly white surrounding neighborhoods continued to be tense through much of the 1980s. By 1986, crime was generally low in Gravesend, except for Marlboro Houses, where illegal drugs contributed to higher crime rates than in the rest of the neighborhood. On December 25, 1987, white youths beat two black men in the neighborhood in an apparent &quot;unprovoked attack.&quot; In January 1988, to protest the specific attack and the general climate of racial violence, Reverend Al Sharpton led 450 marchers between Marlboro Houses and a police station, and were met with chants of &quot;go back to Africa&quot; and various racial epithets from a predominantly white crowd.

Beginning in the 1990s, the northeast section of the neighborhood was redeveloped with larger, upscale single-family homes, whose prices reached $1 million. This dramatically changed the composition of part of the neighborhood. In addition, some two-family homes were being converted back to single-family houses. Despite high rates of car thefts, Gravesend&#x27;s crime rate remained relatively low.

==Demographics==

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Gravesend was 29,436, an increase of 179 (0.6%) from the 29,257 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 52.8% (15,535) White, 21.2% (6,250) Asian, 8.4% (2,469) African American, 0.1% (41) Native American, 0.0% (1) Pacific Islander, 0.1% (41) from other races, and 1.3% (383) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 16.0% (4,716) of the population.

In the 2020 census data from NYC Dept. Of City Planning, West Gravesend showed there were between 20,000 and 29,999 white residents and 26,700 Asian residents showing both their populations to be almost equivalent and there were between 5,000 and 9,999 Hispanic residents. South Gravesend has between 10,000 and 19,999 white residents and has between 5,000 and 9,999 Asian residents, but showed each the Hispanic and Black populations to be under 5000 residents. East Gravesend overlapping to Homecrest showed a higher proportion of white residents of between 30,000 and 39,999 with Hispanic residents of between 5,000 and 9,999 and as well as Asian residents of between 5,000 and 9,999. The affordable housing NYCHA development Marlboro Houses located right on the borderline of Gravesend and Coney Island holds a significant concentrated community of Black residents even though some Asian and Hispanic residents also live within the housing development as well.

===Historic demographics===
Gravesend&#x27;s earliest European settlers were predominantly English and Dutch. Slavery was legal in the colony, and many settlers had enslaved African Americans as workers until after the American Revolution, when New York gradually abolished the institution. African Americans continued to work and live in Gravesend after the abolition of slavery, clustering near the BMT Brighton Line at East 16th Street.

The now-defunct Gravesend Race Track opened on August 26, 1886 and hired mainly black workers, who tended to live nearby. Later, there was a surge in Irish, Italian, and Jewish residents, immigrants and their descendants who moved out from Manhattan. Chinese, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Russian, Ukrainian and West Indies immigrants are the most recent residents to share this neighborhood. The largest group is thought to be Italian American and named for Gravesend&#x27;s Italian community is a professional soccer team, the Brooklyn Italians who play in Gravesend&#x27;s John Dewey High School football stadium. Of the Italian-American community, Sicilians (especially from Castellammare del Golfo), make up the largest specific region of people.

In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the neighborhood had become particularly popular among Sephardic Jews. It was among several Syrian Jewish communities of the United States. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also reported that in the 2012 presidential election, a precinct in Gravesend was one of the few parts of New York City carried by Mitt Romney, with 133 votes to just 3 for Barack Obama.

==Transportation==
Gravesend is served by three New York City Subway corridors. The services and lines, respectively, are:
* on the BMT West End Line at 25th Avenue and Bay 50th Street; 
* on the IND Culver Line at Kings Highway, Avenue U, and Avenue X; and
* on the BMT Sea Beach Line at Kings Highway, Avenue U, and 86th Street.

The Coney Island Subway Yard is in the neighborhood.

The lines operate through Gravesend.

<text>The , or Oriental Library, is Japan&#x27;s largest Asian studies library and one of the world&#x27;s five largest, located in Tokyo. It also functions as a research institute dedicated to the study of Asian history and culture. It has greatly contributed to the development of Asian Studies through the acquisition of books and other source materials as well as the publication of research by Japanese scholars. Presently, the library contains approximately 950,000 volumes which are cataloged linguistically according to Asian, Western and Japanese language materials.

==History==
===Establishment and the early history===

The Oriental Library had its beginnings in 1917 when Hisaya Iwasaki, former third President of the Mitsubishi Company, purchased the vast private collection of China-related publications of Australian adventurer, journalist, and Republic of China government adviser George Morrison. After the purchase, he improved the collection by increasing the number of classical Chinese, Japanese, and Western language books by receiving advice from a bibliographer, Tunashiro Wada(和田 維四郎). 

He established Tōyō Bunko in 1924 to promote oriental studies. It was the first library institution in Japan that was devoted exclusively to oriental studies. Junnosuke Inoue was invited as the first Director of this Library. Hisaya Iwasaki stopped touching management after establishment, but continued financial support to promote collection and research.

===After the War===
After the Pacific War, GHQ dismantled Zaibatsu, because Zaibatsu were responsible for the War. Hisaya Iwasaki resigned from all of his posts in the Mitsubishi Group, and he moved into his cottage. Therefore, the Oriental Library lost its patron and faced a financial crisis. Kijūrō Shidehara, former prime minister, took up this problem to National Diet, and the library became a branch of the National Diet Library in 1948. 

From 1961, the library was a UNESCO affiliated organization as the Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies. Also, in 1994 a center was set up within the library to provide research facilities for scholars dispatched from France.

==Organization==
Major decisions concerning the management of the library are made by its Advisory Council and Board of Directors. Daily operations are supervised by the Committee of Department heads. As of 2007, the library was staffed by 20 full-time employees working under the supervision of the Director General Makihara Minoru, and Executive Director Yamakawa Naoyoshi. In addition, there were over 200 research fellows participating in Toyo Bunko-sponsored projects.

<text>School discipline relates to actions taken by teachers or school organizations toward students when their behavior disrupts the ongoing educational activity or breaks a rule created by the school. Discipline can guide the children&#x27;s behavior or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.

School systems set rules, and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline. These rules may, for example, define the expected standards of school uniforms, punctuality, social conduct, and work ethic. The term &quot;discipline&quot; is applied to the action that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc. The focus of discipline is shifting, and alternative approaches are emerging due to notably high dropout rates, disproportionate punishment upon minority students, and other educational inequalities.

== The purpose of discipline ==
Discipline is a set of consequences determined by the school district to remedy actions taken by a student that are deemed inappropriate. It is sometimes confused with classroom management, but while discipline is one dimension of classroom management, classroom management is a more general term.

Discipline is typically thought to have a positive influence on both the individual as well as the classroom environment. Utilizing disciplinary actions can be an opportunity for the class to reflect and learn about consequences, instill collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques. In particular, moderate interventions such as encouraging positive corrections of questionable behavior inside the classroom by clearly showing the boundaries and making it clear that the behavior is unacceptable, as opposed to more severe punishments outside the classroom such as detention, suspension, or expulsion, can promote learning and deter future misbehavior. Learning to &quot;own&quot; one&#x27;s bad behavior is also thought to contribute to positive growth in social emotional learning.

== Theory ==
School discipline practices are generally informed by theory from psychologists and educators. There are a number of theories to form a comprehensive discipline strategy for an entire school or a particular class.

*Positive approach is grounded in teachers&#x27; respect for students. This approach instills in students a sense of responsibility by using youth/adult partnerships to develop and share clear rules, provide daily opportunities for success, and administer in-school suspension for noncompliant students. Based on Glasser&#x27;s reality therapy. Research (e.g., Allen) is generally supportive of the PAD program.
*Teacher effectiveness training differentiates between teacher-owned and student-owned problems, and proposes different strategies for dealing with each. Students are taught problem-solving and negotiation techniques. Researchers (e.g., Emmer and Aussiker) find that teachers like the programme and that their behaviour is influenced by it, but effects on student behaviour remain unclear.
*Adlerian approaches is an umbrella term for a variety of methods which emphasize understanding the individual&#x27;s reasons for maladaptive behavior and helping misbehaving students to alter their behavior, whilst at the same time finding ways to get their needs met. Named after psychiatrist Alfred Adler, these approaches have shown some positive effects on self-concept, attitudes, and locus of control, but effects on behavior are inconclusive (Emmer and Aussiker). Not only were the statistics on suspensions and vandalism significant, but also the recorded interview of teachers demonstrates the improvement in student attitude and behaviour, school atmosphere, academic performance, and beyond that, personal and professional growth.
*Appropriate school learning theory and educational philosophy is a strategy for preventing violence and promoting order and discipline in schools, put forward by educational philosopher Daniel Greenberg and practiced by the Sudbury Valley School.
Some scholars think students misbehave because of the lack of engagement and stimulation in typical school settings, a rigid definition of acceptable behaviors and a lack of attention and love in a student&#x27;s personal life. In the United States, scholars have begun to explore alternative explanations for why students are being disciplined, in particular the disproportionate rate of discipline towards African-American and minority students.
* Lack of engagement and stimulation – students are curious and constantly searching for meaning and stimulation in the school environment. Classes that are too one-dimensional, that fail to involve students sufficiently, are too challenging or are content intensive (leaving little room for discussion and consideration), will not satisfy students&#x27; curiosities or needs for authentic intellectual stimulation.
* A rigid definition of acceptable behavior – Most students, particularly older ones, are asked to sit at their desks for too long and listen, read, and take notes. Teachers who fail to offer opportunities for movement and interpersonal engagement are likelier to have to use strictness and rules to maintain law and order.
* Lack of attention and love – When students fail to receive the attention that they crave, they are likelier to find other ways to get it, even if it means drawing negative attention to themselves and even negative consequences. The more teachers let their students know how much they care about them and value their work, the likelier they are to respect a teacher&#x27;s request and conform to their expectation.

Other models include:

===Obedience===
Discipline rooted in obedience centers on valuing hard work, diligence, adherence to authority, and self-discipline. An obedience-based model uses consequences and punishments as deterrents, whereas the responsibility-based model shifts away from using rules, limits, and consequences, as well as punitive measures like detention, suspension, expulsion, and counseling. Students have demonstrated improved academic success and better behavior management in schools with responsibility-centered discipline. 

===Responsibility===
Responsibility-centered discipline, also known as responsibility-based discipline, is a classroom-oriented technique that empowers students to find solutions to organizational issues. This approach involves fostering appreciation and warmth among students, embracing their interests, recognizing their efforts, encouraging feedback, achieving consensus on ground rules, and engaging them in rule-making and problem-solving, all while maintaining dignity and well-defined boundaries. Concepts like remorse and empathy are taught through actions like apologies, restitution, or creating action plans. Limits express a teacher&#x27;s beliefs, demands, and expectations within clear values and goals that help create a learning environment. The essence of responsibility-centered discipline is making choices that embody core values such as integrity, perseverance, respect, and responsibility rather than simply enforcing rules.

===Assertive===
Lee and Marlene Canter developed the assertive discipline model. It blends obedience-based principles with responsibility. In this approach, teachers require all students to consent to a set of rules establishing appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, clarifying the necessary corrections if a student exceeds these limits. Teachers acknowledge repetitive behaviors, maintaining an appreciation of good conduct. Disciplinary action must be applied throughout the classroom so all students believe that the rules matter. Simply offering rewards and consequences is not always sufficient; teachers must earn students&#x27; respect and trust.

Assertive discipline attempts to model appropriate behavior for students. Teachers guide students in adhering to behavioral expectations. The Canters emphasize building trust by greeting students, using their names, having one-on-one conversations, acknowledging birthdays and special events, and maintaining communication with parents. The model does not concentrate on individual students. It does not address the root causes of misbehavior, nor is it based on the needs of the students.

== Disparities for black students in the United States==
=== Federal level ===

==== Background ====
In the United States, many of the state and federal laws surrounding school discipline originate from zero-tolerance policies for student misconduct practiced by policy-makers from the 1980s and 1990s. With the increasing use of zero-tolerance policies, by 1997 the federal government was funding the use of police officers in schools, resulting in an increased use of discipline in schools across the country and an influx of students entering the juvenile justice system. By 2000, 41 states had laws in place requiring cases involving students who committed criminal violations in school, like drug possession, to be handled by law enforcement and juvenile courts, instead of the schools themselves. During this time, Black students accounted for over one-third of all corporal punishment cases and in-school and out-of-school suspensions, nearly one-third of all expulsions and school-related arrests, and over one-quarter of all referrals to law enforcement; rates around three times higher than that of white students.

Public schools are prohibited from using disciplinary practices as a form of discrimination. The Education Department&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights is tasked with deciding whether or not to investigate students&#x27; reports of disciplinary racial discrimination. Former United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos enacted delays and eliminations of student discipline guidance under the United States Education Department. In 2016, the Obama administration required states to address racial disparities in special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, but DeVos delayed the implementation of these requirements. In 2014, the United States Department of Justice and the Education Department&#x27;s Office for Civil Rights issued guidance to reduce racial disparities in suspension and expulsion. In 2019, DeVos defended the Education Department&#x27;s choice to repeal this guidance.

==== Student protections ====
Today, schools across the U.S. suspend, expel, and punish Black students at a higher rate than white students. Despite these rates, there are multiple federal laws against racial discrimination in schools. There are two groups for these laws: disparate treatment and disparate impact.

Disparate treatment laws allow students the right to testify against schools and school districts for intentional racial discrimination. Under the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, students who feel they have been intentionally racially discriminated against can testify against their schools or school districts.

Disparate impact laws, including the federal regulations of Title VI and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, allow federal agencies to testify against schools and school districts for policies they have put in place that ultimately result in racial discrimination, regardless of the intent behind the people practicing those policies. Violations of these regulations can cause schools and school districts to lose federal funding.

==== Mitigation and reform ====
Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS) programs examine disciplinary issues, attempt to reduce the severity of punishment for students, and provide increased support for students who have emotional and behavioral disorders. PBIS programs are supported by the United States Department of Education Office of Special Education Programs Technical Assistance Center and have been used by schools across the United States.

=== Across U.S. states ===

==== General trends ====
Racial disparities in suspension and expulsion vary across the United States, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois, Houston, Texas; and St. Paul. Minnesota has schools and school districts that, on average, suspend Black students at least six times more than white students. A study by the University of Pennsylvania concluded that Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia schools contribute over half of all suspensions and expulsions of Black students in America. In these thirteen states, Black students make up about 24% of the students in public schools, but 48% of suspension cases and 49% of expulsion cases. Today, 19 states allow the use of corporal punishment in schools, including Arkansas, a state that ranks 13th in the country for highest disciplinary disparity between Black and white students.

In the state of New York, black students are suspended at a rate over four times higher than white students; in New York City, this figure increases, with Black students being suspended at a rate over five times higher than white students. Schools in New York suspend nearly one in five Black male high-schoolers. In California, Black males are suspended more frequently than any other racial or gender group, and Black females are the third most often suspended group. Black students with disabilities in California lose about 44 more days of school instruction due to disciplinary consequences than their white peers with disabilities.

==== Mitigation and reform ====
Schools across the country are making efforts to reform their disciplinary systems and practices to reduce racial disparities. A study in North Carolina found that having Black teachers is associated with lowered amounts of exclusionary discipline for Black students, across all age, gender, and income ranges. To reduce its racial disciplinary disparity, Arkansas&#x27; state regulations are beginning to request that school districts make an effort to racially diversify their staff. School disciplinary policies in Arkansas are technically decided by state laws and the Arkansas Department of Education, but schools within Arkansas have some decision-making authority, which allowed them the power to suggest the diversification of their staff, as well as other policies that are being put into place to reduce racialized disciplinary disparities, including but not limited to:

* Disciplinary punishments permitted for students are required to be written into a school district&#x27;s policy.
* In school districts where corporal punishment is used, the district must establish specific policies for when and how to employ it.
* School districts are required to inform students&#x27; parents of disciplinary policies and provide written proof of the existence of said policies. These policies are required to be filed with the Arkansas Department of Education and include due process.
* All school personnel, including teachers, administrators, volunteers, and all employees are required to undergo student discipline training.

Similarly to Arkansas, schools in Virginia are attempting to improve training for teachers and administrators. In California, multiple school districts have completely eliminated suspensions for Kindergarten through twelfth grade in public schools. The New York State Education Department and the Board of Regents has included out-of-school suspensions in the Every Student Succeeds Act, attempting to hold schools accountable for the suspension rates of different groups of students, this includes Black students&#x27; higher suspension rates compared to that of other racial and ethnic groups.

=== Across school districts ===

==== Demographics ====
Within the United States of America, urban educational institutions service the largest portion of Black students in primary and secondary education. On a larger scale, urban educational institutions with a predominantly Black student body yield higher rates of punitive disciplinary actions in comparison to institutions with a predominantly white student body. Black students attending urban educational institutions are more likely to receive suspension and to be arrested than white students. On a smaller scale, rural school districts with a larger portion of Black students also yield higher rates of punitive disciplinary actions than predominantly white school districts.

==== County-level ====
Individual school districts within a state have jurisdiction to implement and enforce education-related policies within their educational institutions. Dependent on a school district&#x27;s approach to resolving behavioral conflicts, the disparities between rates and intensity of discipline between white and Black students can intensify or lessen. The subjectivity of approach to behavioral policies allows for external factors such as socioeconomic and racial demographic factors to feature into an institution&#x27;s utilization of disciplinary actions.

===== Truancy =====
An example of the varying racial disparities in discipline across U.S. counties and school districts is the different disciplinary approaches to solving truancy, eg. &quot;any intentional, unjustified, unauthorized, or illegal absence from compulsory education&quot;. The Los Angeles County District enacted punitive measures to decrease the rate of absenteeism occurring within the district&#x27;s educational institutions. It piloted the Abolish Chronic Truancy (ACT) program that would discipline absenteeism through penal punishments for both students and their parental guardians. Punishments for parental guardians include legal prosecution with a maximum penalty of a fine up to $2,500 per child and up to a year sentencing. For students, punishments may be prosecution in juvenile court with potential penalties including fines, probation, community service, and mandated attendance of a truancy education program. Socioeconomic factors—lack of transportation, acting as a caregiver for siblings, etc.-- that affect a student&#x27;s attendance and likelihood of penal punishments disproportionately affects low-income black students.

Another approach that some U.S. school districts have used to reduce truancy is rehabilitating students and accounting for external factors. For example, the office of Alameda County Assistant District Attorney Teresa Drenick within the Alameda County School District has piloted a diversion program to increase attendance. The program addresses students with high absenteeism rates with consistently absent students by providing access to therapy, health services, and resources such as bus passes. The county reports that the program has been &quot;more than 90% successful at getting students back in class&quot;, thereby decreasing absenteeism rates.

==== Students with disabilities ====
The disparity in punitive disciplinary actions between Black and white students is further widened for Black students with disabilities. National surveys on disparities in school discipline have found higher rates of suspension among Black students with disabilities. From 2014 to 2015, the national average of days lost per 100 enrolled for students with disabilities was 119.0 days for Black students and 43.0 days for white students.

An existent effort to decrease rates of disciplinary actions for Black students with disabilities have examined the effects of same-race teachers within the classroom. For example, from 2014 to 2015, North Carolina had a wider gap in disparities than the national average in which Black students lost 158.3 days per 100 enrolled and white students lost 64.1 days. North Carolina, like many states, has local school districts with a higher percentage of Black staff and teachers than other districts. A study by researchers Constance A. Lindsey and Cassandra M. D. Hart demonstrates that Black females reduced disciplinary rates for Black male students with disabilities by a &quot;2 percentage points to approximately 14 percent&quot; decline. Additionally, students with Black male teachers within the study had a reduced disciplinary rate by &quot;15 to 13 percent&quot;. The study suggests that school districts with an increased percentage of Black students may exhibit lower rates of punitive disciplinary actions for Black students with disabilities and have a lessened gap between Black and white students.

=== Within the classroom ===
In the United States, African-American students, particularly boys, are disciplined significantly more often and more severely than any other demographic. This disparity is very well documented and contributes substantially to negative life outcomes for affected students. The resulting tendency of minors and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds to become incarcerated is widely referred to as the &quot;school-to-prison pipeline&quot;.

According to data published by the U.S. Department of Education, African-American students are three times more likely to be suspended and expelled than their white peers. Research overwhelmingly suggests that when given an opportunity to choose among several disciplinary options for a relatively minor offense, teachers and school administrators disproportionately choose more severe punishment for African-American students than for white students for the same offense. Even when controlling factors such as family income, African-American boys are more likely to receive out-of-school suspensions than white boys for the same behavior within the same school.

A recent study published by the National Academy of Sciences, using U.S. federal data covering more than 32 million students and around 96,000 schools, showed that &quot;the disciplinary gap between black and white students across five types of disciplinary actions is associated with county-level rates of racial bias.&quot; Other high-powered studies have shown &quot;increased racial and gender disproportionality for subjectively defined behaviors in classrooms, and for incidents classified as more severe&quot;, and that &quot;Black-White disciplinary gaps . . . emerge as early as in prekindergarten and widen with grade progression.&quot; Such disparities in exclusionary forms of discipline have been shown to be mitigated in classrooms run by African-American teachers, with especially strong mitigation of office referrals for subjectively defined behavior such as &quot;willful defiance&quot;.

When disparities occur within the classroom they are often covert and passive. This means that instead of outwardly discriminating against a student because of their color teachers discreetly give fewer advantages to students of color. Examples of this could include counselors or teachers influencing students of color to take easier classes or to not attend four-year universities, and teachers not learning the correct way to pronounce student names. This can also include white students being given more chances before serious discipline is enacted, such as suspension or expulsion. According to a study published by the Association for Psychological Science, teachers often recognize second offenses in the classroom as the result of a pattern of wrongdoing when it comes to Black students while white students&#x27; offenses are often labeled as isolated incidents.

==== Black girls ====
While it has been proven that black boys in the U.S. tend to be disciplined more often and more severely, evidence also suggests that black girls experience more racial bias in their education. A research study conducted by the National Women&#x27;s Law Center and the Education Trust observed that &quot;Black girls are five times more likely than white girls to be suspended at least once and four times as likely as white girls to be arrested at school.&quot; The racial bias is compounded as girls also experience gender bias within the classroom, a phenomenon coined as educational inequality. Based on data published by The National Bureau of Economic Research on the short-term and long-term consequences of teachers&#x27; stereotypical biases, it was found that teacher biases have a positive effect on boys&#x27; achievements in class but have a negative effect on girls&#x27; achievements. This can have long-term consequences for the futures of Black girls as it can prevent them from enrolling in the advanced-level classes that are commonly required for STEM majors in college.

==== Socioeconomic status ====
Disciplinary methods also vary based on students&#x27; socioeconomic status. While high-income students are often reported to receive mild to moderate consequences (e.g. a teacher reprimand or seat reassignment), low-income students are reported to receive more severe consequences, sometimes delivered in a less-than-professional manner (e.g. being yelled at in front of class, being made to stand in the hallway all day, or having their personal belongings searched).

Some researchers argue that zero-tolerance discipline policies in effect criminalize infractions such as dress-code violations or talking back to a teacher, and that these policies disproportionately target disadvantaged students.

=== Implications ===
Due to increased suspension and expulsion rates, black students are losing instructional time by spending more time away from the classroom. Lost instructional time can result in lower retainment levels of educational material, lower graduation rates, and higher drop-out rates. Higher rates of punishment in schools can increase interactions between black students and law enforcement when black students are punished with referrals to law enforcement for disciplinary infractions. Referrals to law enforcement following the report of a student to a law enforcement agency or officer by a school employee can include citations, tickets, court referrals, and in some cases arrests, though not all referrals lead to arrests. These interactions with the law are a precursor for the school-to-prison pipeline, which disproportionately affects black students.

== Corporal punishment ==

Throughout the history of education, the most common means of maintaining discipline in schools was corporal punishment. While a child was in school, a teacher was expected to act as a substitute parent, with many forms of parental discipline or rewards open to them. This often meant that students were commonly chastised with the birch, cane, paddle, strap or yardstick if they did something wrong. Around 69 countries still use school corporal punishment.

Corporal punishment in schools has now disappeared from most Western countries, including all European countries. In the United States, corporal punishment is not used in public schools in 36 states, banned in 33, and permitted in 17, of which only 14 actually have school districts actively administering corporal punishment. Every U.S. state except New Jersey and Iowa permits corporal punishment in private schools, but an increasing number of private schools have abandoned the practice, especially Catholic schools. Thirty-one U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia have banned corporal punishment from public schools, most recently Colorado in 2023. The other 17 states (mostly in the South) continue to allow corporal punishment in public schools. Of the 17 which permit the practice, three – Arizona, North Carolina, Wyoming have no public schools that actually use corporal punishment as of 2023. In North Carolina however, all school districts have banned the practice. Paddling is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it, though many choose not to do so.

Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

Most mainstream schools in most other countries retain punishment for misbehavior, but it usually takes non-corporal forms such as detention and suspension.

In China, school corporal punishment was completely banned under the Article 29 of the Compulsory Education Act of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but in practice, beating by schoolteachers is still common, especially in rural areas.

In Australia, school corporal punishment has been banned in public schools in all states, but as of 2019, it is still permitted in private schools in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

== Non-corporal forms of disciplinary action ==
=== Detention ===
Detention, sometimes referred to as DT, is one of the most common punishments in schools in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and some other countries. It requires the student to report to a designated room (typically after the end of the school day, or during lunch or recess period) to complete extra work (such as writing lines or an essay, or the completion of chores). Detention can be supervised by the teacher setting the detention or through a centralised detention system. Detention may require a student to report at a certain time on a non-school day, e.g. &quot;Saturday detention&quot; at some US, UK, and Irish schools (especially for serious offences not quite serious enough for suspension).
In UK schools, after-school detention can be held the same day as it is issued without parental consent, and some schools make a detention room available daily, but many will require a student to return to school 1–2 hours after school ends on a specific day, e.g. &quot;Friday Night Detention&quot;. Failure to attend detention without a valid excuse can sometimes result in another being added, or a more severe punishment being administered, such as an in school or out of school suspension.

In Germany, detention is less common. In some states like Baden-Württemberg there is detention to rework missed school hours, but in others like Rheinland-Pfalz it is prohibited by law. In schools where some classes are held on Saturdays, pupils may get detention on a Saturday even if it is a non-school day for them.

In China, long-time detention is perhaps less common than in the US, the UK, Ireland, Singapore, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and some other countries. However, short-time detention by the teachers is still common. Teachers may ask the students to do some missed work after school.

In Australia, the school should consider circumstances when giving detentions. For example, in Victoria, it is recommended that no more than half the time for recess is used for detention, that detentions be held at a reasonable time and place, and when students are kept after school, parents should be informed at least the day before detention, and detention should not exceed 45 minutes.

=== Counseling ===
Counseling is also provided when students will have to see a school counselor (guidance counselor) for misbehavior. The purpose of counseling is to help the student recognize their mistakes and find positive ways to make changes in the student&#x27;s life. Counseling can also help the student clarify the school&#x27;s expectations, as well as understand the consequences of failing to meet those standards.

=== Suspension ===
Suspension or temporary exclusion is a mandatory leave assigned to a student as a form of punishment that can last anywhere from one day to a few weeks, during which the student is not allowed to attend regular lessons. In some US, UK, Australian, and Canadian schools, there are two types of suspension: In-school (ISS, internal exclusion, or isolation) and out-of-school (OSS, off-campus suspension, or external exclusion). In-school suspension means that the student comes to school as usual but must report to and stay in a designated room for the entire school day. Out-of-school suspension means that the student is banned from entering the school grounds, or being near their campus while suspended from school. A student who breaches an out-of-school suspension (by attending the school during their suspension) may be arrested for trespassing, and repeated breaches may lead to expulsion and/or possible criminal penalties. Students are also not allowed to attend after-school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school. Some schools even utilize a loss of privilege policy that prohibits students returning from an out-of-school suspension from participating in the above mentioned school sponsored activities for as long as 2 weeks. 

Schools are usually required to notify the student&#x27;s parents/guardians and sometimes social worker if the suspended student is in special education, and explain the reason for and duration of a suspension. Students involved in physical altercations on campus can be suspended from school for a period of 5 days, while students who throw temper tantrums on campus, direct foul language at school staff members, or engage in verbal altercations with fellow students can be suspended for 3 days. Students are often required to continue to learn and complete assignments during their suspension, sometimes receiving no credit for it. This could include a written essay stating that they will not engage again in the behavior that led to the suspension or journal detailing the reason for the student being suspended from school, which they would be required to hand in to a school administrator upon returning to school following their suspension. Sometimes schools will have meetings with the suspended student, the student&#x27;s parents, a school administrator, and sometimes a social worker in the case of a special education student to discuss and evaluate the matter following an out-of-school suspension. Studies suggest that school suspension is associated with increased risk of subsequent criminal justice system involvement and lower educational attainment.
School suspension can also be associated with psychological distress, and to have a bi-directional link with mental illness. In the United Kingdom, excluded children have been targeted by &quot;county lines&quot; drug traffickers.

=== Expulsion ===

Expulsion, dismissal, exclusion, withdrawing, or permanent exclusion terminates the student&#x27;s education. This is the last resort, when all other methods of discipline have failed. However, in extreme situations, it may also be used for an exceptionally serious &#x27;one-off&#x27; offense, such as setting fires on campus, the activation of false alarms, or assault and battery against faculty and staff members, killing students and teachers, or school administrators, bomb threats, breaking into classrooms and school offices during non school hours, and vandalism of school property. Setting off fireworks and firecrackers on campus can result in expulsion as well. Some education authorities have a nominated school in which all excluded students are collected; this typically has a much higher staffing level than mainstream schools. In some US public schools, expulsions are so serious that they require an appearance before the Board of Education or the court system. In the UK, head teachers may make the decision to exclude, but the student&#x27;s parents have the right of appeal to the local education authority. It was completely banned for compulsory schools in China. This has proved controversial in cases where the head teacher&#x27;s decision has been overturned (and his or her authority thereby undermined), and there are proposals to abolish the right of appeal. In the United States, when it comes to student discipline, there is a marked difference in procedure between public and private institutions.

With public schools, the school must provide the student with limited constitutional due process protections as public educational institutions operate as an extension of state governments. Conversely, with private schools, the student can be expelled for any reason – provided that the expulsion was not &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot; In Virginia, as long as a private school follows the procedures in its student handbook, a court will likely not view its actions as arbitrary and capricious.

=== Restorative justice ===

In schools, restorative justice is an offshoot of the model used by some courts and law enforcement; it seeks to repair the harm that has been done by acknowledging the impact on the victim, community, and offender, accepting responsibility for the wrongdoing, and repairing the harm that was caused. Restorative practices can &quot;also include preventive measures designed to build skills and capacity in students as well as adults.&quot; Some examples of preventative measures in restorative practices might include teachers and students devising classroom expectations together or setting up community building in the classroom. Restorative justice also focuses on justice as needs and obligations, expands justice as conversations between the offender, victim and school, and recognizes accountability as understanding the impact of actions and repairing the harm. Traditional styles of discipline do not always work well for students across every cultural community. As an alternative to the normative approaches of corporal punishment, detention, counseling, suspension, and expulsion, restorative justice was established to give students a voice in their consequences, as well as an opportunity to make a positive contribution to their community.

Restorative justice typically involves peer-mediation or adult-supervised conversations surrounding a perceived offence. Each student has the ability to contribute to the conversation, the person who has misbehaved has the opportunity not only to give their side of the story but also has a say in their consequence. Consequences defy the traditional methods of punitive punishment and instead give students an opportunity for restoration. Restorative justice focuses on relationship building and the community as a whole over the individual student and their offence, creating a sense that everyone has a part in the community and it is everyone&#x27;s responsibility to uphold the values of the particular community. This is a method that not only increases an understanding of perceived community values, but is also a method thought to work well in cultures and communities where there is a high value on the community, rather than just on the individual.

In 2012, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report entitled &quot;School Discipline and Disparate Impact,&quot; which was somewhat critical of the Department of Education&#x27;s approach to school discipline.

<doc id="455351" wikidata="Q758662" url="?curid=455351" title="Railroad Safety Appliance Act">
<text>The Safety Appliance Act is a United States federal law that made air brakes and automatic couplers mandatory on all trains in the United States. It was enacted on March 2, 1893, and took effect in 1900, after a seven-year grace period. The act is credited with a sharp drop in accidents on American railroads in the early 20th century.

==Background==
After the Civil War, railroads expanded rapidly throughout the United States. The increased traffic was accompanied by an increase in accidents among railroad personnel, especially brakemen. Many accidents were associated with coupling and uncoupling of railroad cars, and particularly with the use of link-and-pin couplers, which were widely used then. The operation of hand brakes was also very hazardous. The rise in accidents led to calls for safety legislation, as early as the 1870s. In the 1880s, on-the-job deaths of railroad workers were second only to those of coal miners. Through that decade, several state legislatures enacted safety laws. However, the specific requirements varied among the states, making implementation difficult for interstate rail carriers, and Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act in 1893 to provide a uniform standard. Former Iowa railroad commissioner Lorenzo Coffin doggedly lobbied for the act almost singlehandedly for six years before Congress finally passed the bill in 1893.

==1893 act==
The original act was entitled, &quot;An Act to Promote the Safety of Employees and Travelers upon Railroads by Compelling Common Carriers Engaged in Interstate Commerce to Equip Their Cars with Automatic Couplers and Continuous Brakes and Their Locomotives with Driving-wheel Brakes, and for Other Purposes.&quot; Its first section makes it unlawful, among other things, for a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce to run any train without having a sufficient number of the cars so equipped with train brakes (such as air brakes) that the engineer on the locomotive can control the speed of the train without requiring brakemen to use a hand brake for that purpose.

The second section prohibits such a carrier from hauling or using on its line in moving interstate traffic any car not equipped with couplers which can be coupled and uncoupled automatically &quot;without the necessity of men going between the ends of the cars&quot;, and the fourth section forbids the use in interstate commerce of any car not provided with secure grab irons or hand holds on the ends and sides of the car &quot;for greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars&quot;. The sixth section imposes for every violation of the act a penalty of $100.

==Summary of sections==

===Section 1===
Need safety checks on locomotive and a sufficient number of cars. Starting on January 1, 1898, unlawful for a common carrier used for interstate commerce to use locomotive engine not equipped with a power driving-wheel brake and appliances for operating the train-brake system. Also need sufficient number of cars equipped with power or train brakes so engineer in the locomotive can control its speed without requiring a brakeman to use a common hand brake to do so.

===Section 2===
Need automatic couplers that can be uncoupled without man going between. On January 1, 1898, it will be unlawful for a common carrier used for interstate commerce to haul or permit to be hauled any car that is not equipped with couplers coupling automatically by impact and which can be uncoupled without a man going between the ends of the cars.

===Section 3===
Can&#x27;t receive cars not equipped. When any person, firm, company, or corporation engaged in interstate commerce by railroad has equipped a sufficient number of cars to be in compliance with Section 1, he/it may refuse to receive the connecting lines of road or shippers of any cars not equipped in such a manner.

===Section 4===
Secure grab irons. After July 1, 1895, unless Interstate Commerce Commission says otherwise, unlawful for RR company to use any car in interstate commerce that doesn&#x27;t have secure grab irons or handholds in the ends and sides of each car (more secure for men who couple and uncouple cars.)

===Section 5===
Setting standards. Within 90 days of passage of act, the American Railway Association is authorized to set standard height of drawbars for freight cars and fix maximum variation from such standard heights to be allowed between drawbars of empty and loaded cars. Will submit these standards to the Interstate Commerce Commission, which will inform the carriers. If ARA fails to set standard, ICC will do so before July 1, 1894. After July 1, 1895, no cars can be used that don&#x27;t comply.

===Section 6===
If violate provision. Any common carrier in violation of any provisions will be liable to pay a penalty of $100 for every violation, to be recovered in federal court.

===Section 7===
Can extend time within which carriers need to comply with this act. ICC can extend period from time to time with a full hearing and for good reason.

===Section 8===
If someone working for a non-compliant train is injured. An employee injured in a train that is not in compliance with this act will not need to bear the risk occasioned even if he knew that it was unlawful to do things that way and still continued working for the employer.

==Amendments==
The original law was amended by a subsequent act in 1903, whose first section provides that the requirements of the original act respecting train brakes, automatic couplers, and grab irons shall be held to apply to all trains and cars used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, unless a minor exception were satisfied. By its second section this act requires that not less than 50 percent of the cars in a train shall have their train brakes used and operated by the engineer on the locomotive, and confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the authority to increase this minimum percentage to the end that the objects intended may be more fully accomplished. By an order promulgated June 6, 1910, the Commission increased the minimum number of cars whose train brakes must be under the engineer&#x27;s control to 85 percent.

A 1910 legislative amendment required additional equipment, including ladders, sill steps, and hand brakes.

==Transfer of implementation authority==
The 1966 &quot;Department of Transportation Act&quot; transferred authority for implementation of the Safety Appliance Act to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary designated the newly created Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) as the implementing agency. FRA began to take over enforcement responsibilities from the ICC in 1967.

==Subsequent railroad safety legislation==

The &quot;Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970&quot; expanded FRA&#x27;s safety responsibilities:
* covers all railroads, both intrastate and interstate
* all areas of railroad safety
* authority to issue emergency orders
* preemption of safety rules issued by individual states.

<doc id="455352" wikidata="Q5542706" url="?curid=455352" title="George Murdoch">
<text>George Murdoch (April 29, 1850 – February 2, 1910) was a Canadian politician, Alberta pioneer, saddle-maker, and the first mayor of Calgary, Alberta.

==Early life==
George Murdoch was born in Paisley, Scotland, on April 29, 1850, and at the age of four, Murdoch emigrated to Canada in 1854 and settled in Saint John, New Brunswick, where he spent much of his earlier years. At the age of 18 Murdoch moved to Chicago, where he learned the trade of saddle and harness making. Murdoch returned to New Brunswick after his shop was destroyed in the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. While in New Brunswick he married his wife Margaret, and together they had their first two children in the province. In total, they had at least three sons and two daughters.

==Move to Calgary==
On May 13, 1883, George Murdoch arrived in Calgary at the age of 33, just months before the Canadian Pacific Railway would reach the community in August 1883. In Calgary, he started a successful harness shop. As Calgary was at its early stages, his main clientele was the North-West Mounted Police based in Fort Calgary and Blackfoot Indians who had a reserve nearby. He was on good terms with the Blackfoot and had learned to speak their language.

In the community, Murdoch was involved with the Masonic Lodge and the Orange Order in Canada, literary and history societies, volunteer fire brigade, was one of the founders of Calgary&#x27;s Presbyterian Church and the first President of the Calgary St. Andrew&#x27;s Society. Being one of the first permanent businessmen in Calgary, he was an active participant in securing the incorporation of Calgary from the government of the North-West Territories in November 1884.

==Municipal Politics==
George Murdoch played a pivotal role in the formation of the Town of Calgary, joining prominent civic leaders as elected members of the seven-person civic committee, the precursor to the first town council. The elected group consisted of Murdoch, Major James Walker (1846-1936), Dr. Andrew Henderson, George Clift King, Thomas Swan, J. D. Moulton and Captain John Stewart (d. 1893).

On December 4, 1884, Murdoch was elected the first mayor of the Town of Calgary and was re-elected on January 4, 1886, holding the post until October 21, 1886. Murdoch, along with councillors Issac Sanford Freeze and Dr. Neville James Lindsay, was removed from office effective October 21, 1886, by a special Territorial Ordinance issued by stipendiary magistrate Jeremiah Travis.

===January 1886 Calgary Municipal Election===
Travis, a teetotaler and supporter of the temperance movement, was appalled by the open traffic of liquor, gambling and prostitution in Calgary despite legal prohibition in the Northwest Territories. Murdoch and the town solicitor Henry Bleeker were alleged to be members of a whisky ring, and rumors were rampant that both Murdoch and the town&#x27;s police chief James Ingram was receiving kickbacks from brothels and saloon keepers. Travis&#x27;s behavior soon reached Ottawa and Judge Thomas Wardlaw Taylor of Winnipeg was sent by the federal government to investigate the situation. Taylor&#x27;s report &quot;Precis of the case of Jeremiah Travis (late stipendiary magistrate at Calgary) as presented by the report of Mr. Justice Taylor and the correspondence and evidence&quot; which found Travis had exceeded his authority was released much later, in June 1887.

Shortly before the 1886 election, G. E. Marsh brought a charge of corruption against Murdoch and council over irregularities in the voters&#x27; list. Travis found Murdoch and the councillors guilty, disqualifying them from running in the 1886 election, barring them from municipal office for two years, and fining Murdoch $100, and the councillors $20. Taylor notes Council added about 78 names to the voter list without notice of sworn testimony, but the names added appeared to have the qualifications necessary to be entitled to be on the voters list. Taylor found treating the actions of council as a case of personal corruption was erroneous in law and irregular in form. Furthermore Taylor noted the punishment of removal from office, disqualification from re-election for two years and fines &quot;extreme&quot;. Taylor also notes when the voters&#x27; list was being revised and the &quot;corrupt practices&quot; were occurring, Murdoch was visiting his former home in Eastern Canada and not in Calgary.

The election occurred as planned in on January 6, 1886, with Murdoch and the councillors on the ballot and the &quot;irregular voter list&quot; in use. Travis served the returning officer with a judicial order forbidding him from receiving any vote for Murdoch which would have the effect of showing Murdoch&#x27;s opponents having received a majority of the vote. The returning officer ignored Travis&#x27;s order as there was no authority for it to be issued. The final result of the election showed Murdoch with a majority 180 votes and his opponent James Reilly with 18. Of the 78 names irregularly added to the voters&#x27; list, only 41 votes were cast.

Travis found Murdoch in contempt of court and disallowed the result of the election, instead installing James Reilly as mayor and other members as the council. The municipal government under Mayor Reilly was ineffective when the town&#x27;s books and seal disappeared.

The federal government acted before officially receiving Taylor&#x27;s report by reorganized the courts of the Northwest Territories, and the Territorial Council called for a new municipal election in Calgary on November 3, 1886. George Clift King was elected Mayor of Calgary.

===Later Municipal Politics===
Murdoch was elected town Councillor for single terms in both 1889 and 1895.

During the Calgary Fire of 1886 it was determined a firebreak would need to be formed, and former mayor George Murdoch agreed and participated in the demolishing of his harness shop. An attempt was made to use gunpowder to blow up Murdoch&#x27;s store. However, the Calgary Weekly Herald noted &quot;failed owing to the force of the charge not being sufficiently concentrated&quot;. The fire was stopped and the extinguished after the break was created.

==Later life==
In later life Murdoch suffered from paralysis, and died in Calgary on February 2, 1910.

<doc id="455355" wikidata="Q234574" url="?curid=455355" title="Ryōko Hirosue">
<text>is a Japanese actress and singer, best known to international audiences for her roles in the Luc Besson-produced &quot;Wasabi&quot; and the Academy Award-winning Japanese film &quot;Departures&quot;. She also starred in the 2008 comedy series &quot;Yasuko to Kenji&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hirosue was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture and grew up on Kōchi city, Kōchi prefecture, Japan. She joined the &quot;P&amp;G&quot; cosmetic model competition at age 14 and made her television debut the following year singing on the program,&quot; TK Music Camp&quot;. She made her television drama debut and is well known for her work as a spokesmodel for NTT DoCoMo. She studied at Waseda University but did not graduate.

== Career ==

=== 1995–2000 ===
Hirosue made her television debut in 1995 at age 15 in Fuji TV&#x27;s &quot;Heart ni S&quot;. She was also named &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; at the 10th Television Drama Academy Awards the same year when she starred in Fuji TV&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Shota no Sushi&quot;. In 1997, she appeared in the finale of medical drama &quot;Hoshi no Kinka&quot; and the special episode of &quot;Odoru Daisousasen&quot; before making her breakthrough performance in Fuji TV&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Beach Boys&quot;, where she was awarded &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; at the 14th Television Drama Academy Awards. Hirosue also made her film debut in the same year when she appeared in &quot;20-seki Nostalgia&quot; which won her critical acclaim. She was awarded the Sponichi Grand Prize New Talent Award at the Mainichi Film Awards, Best New Talent at the Yokohama Film Festival and perhaps most importantly, the Newcomer of the Year award at the 21st Japanese Academy Awards.

In 1998, Hirosue reprised her role in the special episode of &quot;Beach Boys&quot; while also appearing in four other television dramas in the same year. In 1999, she returned to the big screen in &quot;Poppoya&quot; and &quot;Himitsu&quot;. Her performances in both films won her much praise from award-giving bodies of Japan and she received two nominations at the 23rd Japanese Academy Awards for Best Actress (for &quot;Himitsu&quot;) and Best Supporting Actress (for &quot;Poppoya&quot;). Her international profile also increased when she received the Best Actress prize for her performance in &quot;Himitsu&quot; at the 30th Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival.

She returned prominently to television in 2000 playing Yuki Katase in the drama &quot;Summer Snow&quot;, which won 5 awards at the 26th Television Drama Academy Awards including &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; and &quot;Best Drama&quot; before showing off her comedic chops in TBS&#x27;s &quot;Oyaji&quot;. The latter role again won her &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; at the 27th awards ceremony.

=== 2001–2005 ===
In 2001, Hirosue made her international film debut in the French Film &quot;Wasabi&quot; written by Luc Besson and directed by Gérard Krawczyk. Not being able to speak French for her role, she had to learn her lines phonetically. She also reunited for the fourth time on television with her frequent co-star Yutaka Takenouchi (they starred together in &quot;Long Vacation&quot;, &quot;Beach Boys&quot; and &quot;Seikimatsu no Uta&quot;) in Fuji TV&#x27;s romantic comedy series &quot;Dekichatta Kekkon&quot;, starring as an expectant couple who did not know each other well before their one-night stand leading to the planning of a shotgun wedding. The series also starred Hiroshi Abe who won Best Supporting Actor at the 30th Television Drama Academy Awards.

In 2002, Hirosue appeared in the film &quot;Renai Shashin&quot; and the low-rated television drama &quot;Ai Nante Irane Yo, Natsu&quot; before capping the year in the family drama series &quot;Otousan&quot;. She reunited with her &quot;Summer Snow&quot; lead co-star, Tsuyoshi Dōmoto, in 2003&#x27;s romance series &quot;Moto Kare&quot;. Her portrayal as the initially flippant ex-girlfriend, Makoto Saeki, won her &quot;Best Supporting Actress&quot; yet again at the 38th Television Drama Academy Awards.

Hirosue married model Takahiro Okazawa on 17 January 2004 and gave birth to her son on 10 April 2004. They later divorced in March 2008. Her marriage and new motherhood decreased her workload and she only made one appearance in 2004 in the film &quot;Hana and Alice&quot; and one appearance on 2005&#x27;s Fuji TV&#x27;s romance drama &quot;Slow Dance&quot;.

=== 2006–2023 ===
Hirosue returned to film and television in 2006 by appearing in three television dramas, a TV movie and a film. In 2007, she co-starred for the third time with Hiroshi Abe (her fellow actor in &quot;Dekichatta Kekkon&quot; and &quot;Haruka Naru Yakusoku&quot;) in the film &quot;Bubble Fiction: Boom or Bust&quot;. She also appeared in two TV movies, &quot;Mama ga Ryori o Tsukuru Wake&quot;, broadcast by Fuji TV, and &quot;Long Wedding Road!&quot;, which was broadcast by TBS. Hirosue also made a guest appearance in the third episode, &quot;Rattles&quot;, of the detective series &quot;Galileo&quot;.

She had a supporting role in NTV&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Yasuko to Kenji&quot; in 2008.

She portrayed Mika Kobayashi opposite Masahiro Motoki in the 2008 Japanese film &quot;Departures&quot;, which won the 81st Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film.

In 2009, she is starring in the remake of the mystery film &quot;Zero Focus&quot; and the adaptation to film of the novel &quot;Villon&#x27;s Wife&quot; by Osamu Dazai.

She co-starred in the 2010 film &quot;Flowers&quot; with Yū Aoi, Kyōka Suzuki, Yūko Takeuchi, Rena Tanaka and Yukie Nakama.

In June 2023, in light of her affair incident, she announced that she would be retiring from the entertainment industry.

=== 2024–present ===
In February 2024, she resumed her entertainment activities by leaving her agency and going independent.

== Personal life ==
She married Okazawa Takahiro in December 2003. The marriage ended in early 2008. On 9 October 2010 she married Jun Izutsu, a candle artist. They met in Haiti in March 2010 participating in earthquake relief efforts. Her cousin is a former member of the House of Representatives in Japan.

She has three children. She gave birth to her first son in April 2004. On 10 March 2011 she had her second son. On 17 July 2015, she gave birth to her third child, a daughter.

On 7 June 2023, &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; reported that Hirosue was allegedly having an extramarital affair with married Michelin star chef Shusaku Toba after being spotted entering the Cerulean Tower Tokyo Hotel together. This was later confirmed by Hirosue herself through her official social media account apologizing on the incident. Her agency announced her divorce with Jun Izutsu on 26 July 2023. She holds custody of her three children as their guardian.

<text>Polycrates (; ), son of Aeaces, was the tyrant of Samos from the 540s BC to 522 BC. He had a reputation as both a fierce warrior and an enlightened tyrant.

== Sources ==
The main source for Polycrates&#x27; life and activities is the historian Herodotus, who devotes a large section of book 3 of his &quot;Histories&quot; to the rise and fall of Polycrates (3.39-60, 3.120-126). His account was written in the third quarter of the 5th century BC, nearly a century after Polycrates&#x27; death, was based mostly on oral traditions and incorporates many folk-tale elements. Furthermore, Herodotus creatively shaped his account of Polycrates in order to make general moral points and to comment on the imperialism of the Athenian empire in his own day. Some poetry from Polycrates&#x27; time comments on him in passing and there is a smattering of references to Polycrates in other literary sources ranging in date from the 4th century BC to the Roman Imperial period. These sources preserve useful information but tend to assimilate Polycrates to a stereotypical model of the tyrannical ruler, which may be anachronistic.

==Family==
Polycrates&#x27; family background is not clearly known to us. J.P. Barron proposed that Polycrates&#x27; ancestors formed a dynasty that ruled Samos from around 600 BC. A shadowy figure, Syloson, son of Calliteles might have been the founder of this dynasty. Barron further proposed that Polycrates&#x27; father, Aeaces, ruled Samos around the middle of the sixth century. An inscription survives from this period, in which an individual called Aeaces dedicates some plunder to Hera. Barron&#x27;s analysis was broadly accepted by Graham Shipley, but has been challenged by Aideen Carty.

Polycrates had two brothers, Pantagnotus and Syloson, who were originally his co-rulers. Syloson ruled Samos again after Polycrates&#x27; death, and was succeeded by his own son, Aeaces. Herodotus mentions a daughter in his account of Polycrates&#x27; death.

== Reign ==
=== Establishment of his power ===
In the mid-sixth century BCE, there was apparently a period of civil strife in Samos. This conflict is mentioned by Herodotus in the context of Polycrates&#x27; rise to power. John Boardman and Graham Shipley have cited archaeological evidence for serious disruption in this period. Around 550 BC, they say, funerary stele were shattered and aristocratic burials in the West Cemetery at Samos cease, while the first great temple of Hera, known as the Rhoikos temple, was destroyed - only a decade after it was built. However, more recent archaeological research has challenged this picture, showing that the destruction of the Rhoikos temple was a structural failure resulting from subsidence under the foundations, and that the West Cemetery fell out of use gradually over the course of the second half of the sixth century. Aideen Carty argues that shifts in the deposition of Laconian pottery on Samos suggest the development of pro- and anti-Spartan factions on the island, one faction associated with the Heraion and the other with the Artemision of Samos.

Herodotus reports that Polycrates took power with his brothers Pantagnotus and Syloson and a force of only fifteen men. This coup seems to have taken place in 540 BC or slightly earlier. Initially, Polycrates ruled along with his brothers, but soon had Pantagnotus killed and then exiled Syloson to take full control for himself. According to a Roman-period author, Polyaenus, there was a religious procession in armour out of the city of Samos to the Heraion, led by Pantagnotus and Syloson. When the procession was over, the Samians removed their armour to sacrifice, and Pantagnotus and Syloson seized the chance to murder their enemies. At the same time, Polycrates seized Astypalaea, the citadel of the city of Samos. The tyrant of Naxos, Lygdamis, invaded with a force to support Polycrates. However, it is uncertain whether Polyaenus&#x27; account describes Polycrates&#x27; initial seizure of power or the conflict with his brothers which left him as sole ruler.

===Thalassocracy===
Polycrates recruited an army of 1,000 archers and assembled a navy of 100 penteconters, which became the most powerful navy in the Greek world –– Herodotus says that Polycrates was the first Greek ruler to understand the importance of sea power and Thucydides includes him in his list of thalassocracies in the Aegean. With these forces he implemented a plan to bring all the Greek islands and cities of Ionia under his rule. Polycrates&#x27; rise to power took place in the period when the Achaemenid empire under Cyrus conquered western Anatolia. In theory, the Aegean islanders had accepted Persian overlordship after Cyrus conquered Lydia in 546 BC, but in practice the political situation in the Aegean was complicated. This confusion may have contributed to Polycrates&#x27; success in projecting his power.

Few specifics of Polycrates&#x27; naval activities and conquests are preserved. Herodotus refers to an attack on Miletus, in which the Lesbians came to the aid of Miletos and Polycrates won a great naval victory, capturing and enslaving large numbers of Lesbian sailors. The Milesians had become key Persian allies and this victory is probably identical with a victory over Persian navy mentioned in Thucydides and some other historians. Thucydides emphasises his conquest of Delos, the key religious centre of the Aegean. Polycrates formed an alliance with King Amasis of Egypt and A. Carty suggests that Polycrates assisted Amasis in the conquest of Cyprus. In general, though, the ancient sources stress not specific campaigns, but wide-ranging raiding, which may have been more like piracy than campaigns of conquest. Herodotus says that he &quot;raided everyone without any discrimination. For he said that a friend would be more appreciative if what was taken from him was returned than if it had not first been snatched away.&quot; Aideen Carty argues that the focus of this raiding was the acquisition of slaves whom he exported to Egypt to serve as mercenaries in Amasis&#x27; army.

The nature of Polycrates&#x27; navy is debated. Some scholars have conceived of his penteconters as powerful warships in a state navy which owned, crewed and operated them in accordance with Polycrates&#x27; command. Other scholars consider this picture anachronistic; they present the penteconters as trading and raiding vessels that were owned privately by individual Samian aristocrats, who were essentially autonomous pirates only loosely constrained by Polycrates and the Samian state. In addition to these ships, Polycrates is said to have commissioned a new type of ship called the Samaina, a decked ship with two banks of oars, apparently a merchant galley designed for the rapid transport of goods or troops.

=== Rebellion and Spartan attack ===
Herodotus states that Polycrates later established a fleet of 40 triremes, probably becoming the first Greek state with a fleet of such ships, which he crewed with sailors he considered to be politically dangerous, and sent to the Persian king Cambyses with instructions to put the crews to death. Modern scholars consider this story unlikely. The dispatch of these ships is usually connected with the Persian invasion of Egypt in 525 BC. Herman Wallinga argues that the ships were built at Amasis&#x27; expense, crewed by Polycrates, and sent by him to fight against the Persians. By contrast, Hans Van Wees thinks that this fleet was a gift from the Persians, crewed by Polycrates, in order to assist the Persians &quot;against&quot; Amasis.

The naval detachment turned back to attack Polycrates. They defeated him at sea but could not take the island. The rebels then sailed to mainland Greece and allied with Sparta and Corinth. Sparta and Corinth invaded the island of Samos in support of the Samian rebels around 520 BC. After 40 days they withdrew their unsuccessful siege.

&quot;It&#x27;s said that Polycrates was one of the earliest known coin counterfeiters. Herodotus wrote that Polycrates bought off the besieging Spartans in 525/4 B.C. with counterfeit Samian coins. Some of these fakes still exist and are described in Spink&#x27;s coin catalogue.&quot;

===Persian invasion and death===
Herodotus also tells the story of Polycrates&#x27; death. Near the end of the reign of Cambyses (around 522 BC), the satrap of Sardis, Oroetes, planned to kill Polycrates, either because he had been unable to add Samos to Persia&#x27;s territory, or because Polycrates had snubbed a Persian ambassador. Prior to this, according to Diodorus Siculus, some Lydians fleeing Oroestes&#x27; domineering rule sought sanctuary on Samos. Polycrates at first received them, but then put them to the sword and confiscated the possessions that they had brought (Diodorus Siculus, Library 10.16.4). Polycrates was invited to Magnesia, where Oroetes lived. Oroetes claimed that he wanted a promise of refuge on Samos in the event that Cambyses turned on him and that in return he would give Polycrates a large amount of money. Polycrates was convinced and went to Magnesia, where he was assassinated. Herodotus is vague about the manner of Polycrates&#x27; death, saying only that it was an undignified end for a glorious ruler; he may have been impaled and his dead body was crucified. Herodotus claims that Polycrates&#x27; daughter warned him not to go to Magnesia, reporting a prophetic dream that she had had of him hanging in the air, being washed by Zeus and anointed by the sun god Helios. His death fulfilled this prophecy as when it rained he was &#x27;washed by Zeus&#x27; and when the sun shone he was &#x27;anointed by Helios&#x27;, as the moisture was sweated from him.

After the murder of Polycrates by Oroetes, Samos was ruled by Maeandrius. After some time, Syloson, the brother of Polycrates, was installed as governor of Samos by Achaemenid ruler Darius I, receiving the help of general Otanes to expel the impostor who had taken control after Oroetes.

==Samos under Polycrates==
===Construction projects===

Under Polycrates the Samians developed an engineering and technological expertise to a level unusual in ancient Greece. In the midst of his account of Polycrates, Herodotus presents three astounding engineering works of the Samians. The first of these is an aqueduct in the form of a tunnel long which can still be seen and which is known as the Tunnel of Eupalinos. The tunnel was constructed by two teams tunnelling from opposite sides of a ridge who met in the middle with an error of only a few metres — a remarkable engineering feat for the time, and one which probably reflects the practical geometry skills which the Samians had learned from the Egyptians. Polycrates also sponsored construction of a large temple of Hera, the Heraion, to which Amasis dedicated many gifts, and which at long was one of the three largest temples in the Greek world, and he upgraded the harbour of his capital city (modern Pythagorion), ordering the construction of a deep-water mole nearly a quarter mile long, which is still used to shelter Greek fishing boats today. Although these projects are often associated with Polycrates on the strength of the passage of Herodotus, he is actually very vague about when these projects were carried out and what - if anything - they had to do with Polycrates. Archaeological work has made the picture more complicated, suggesting that the Tunnel of Eupalinos may have been dug before his reign and that Polycrates continued projects that were already in course at the Heraion.

=== Religious and cultural activities ===
One use to which Polycrates put his powerful navy was controlling the island of Delos, one of the most important religious centres in Greece, control of which would bolster Polycrates&#x27; claim to be the leader of the Ionian Greeks. Thucydides reports that Polycrates chained Delos to the neighbouring island of Rhenaia. In 522 BC Polycrates celebrated an unusual double festival in honour of the god Apollo of Delos and of Delphi; it has been suggested that the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, sometimes attributed to Cynaethus of Chios, was composed for this occasion.

Polycrates lived amid great luxury and spectacle and was a patron of the poets Anacreon and Ibycus. The philosopher Pythagoras was also on Samos during his reign but left for Croton about 531 BC, perhaps out of dissatisfaction with his dictatorship. He also attracted to his court, sometimes by offering generous subsidies, an array of prominent craftsmen and professionals from throughout the Greek world, including Eupalinos, the architect of the Tunnel, who was originally from Megara, the famous physician Demodocus of Croton, Rhoikos the architect of the Heraion, and the master metal-worker Theodoros, who had made a famous silver bowl which Croesus dedicated at Delphi and which is described by Herodotus, and who also made the ring which was Polycrates&#x27; most treasured personal possession. Polycrates established a library on Samos, and showed a sophisticated approach to economic development, importing improved breeds of sheep, goats, and dogs from elsewhere in the Greek world.

== Polycrates&#x27; ring ==
=== In legend ===

According to Herodotus, Amasis thought Polycrates was too successful, and advised him to throw away whatever he valued most in order to escape a reversal of fortune. Polycrates followed the advice and threw a jewel-encrusted ring into the sea; however, a few days later, a fisherman caught a large fish that he wished to share with the tyrant. While Polycrates&#x27; cooks were preparing the fish for eating, they discovered the ring inside of it. Polycrates told Amasis of his good fortune, and Amasis immediately broke off their alliance, believing that such a lucky man would eventually come to a disastrous end. Within Herodotus&#x27; work, this story serves to advance general themes about the mutability of fortune and how to judge success. Most subsequent references to Polycrates in literature and other media have focused on this story.

=== Cultural legacy ===
&quot;Polycrates&#x27; Ring&quot; (German: &quot;Der Ring des Polykrates&quot;) is a lyrical ballad written in June 1797 by Friedrich Schiller and first published in his 1798 Musen-Almanach annual. It is about how the greatest success gives reason to fear disaster. Schiller relied on the accounts of the fate of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, in Herodotus&#x27; Histories, Book III.

The early 20th century opera &quot;Der Ring des Polykrates&quot; by Erich Wolfgang Korngold retells the story of Polycrates as a modern fable.

Polycrates is mentioned in Byron&#x27;s famous stanzas &quot;The Isles of Greece:&quot;

:Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
:We will not think of themes like these!
:It made Anacreon&#x27;s song divine:
:He served—but served Polycrates—
:A tyrant; but our masters then
:Were still, at least, our countrymen.

In modern folkloristics, the tale of Polycrates&#x27; Ring originated the Aarne–Thompson–Uther tale type ATU 736A, named after this episode. The story is acknowledged by scholarship as &quot;widespread&quot; and &quot;attested in numerous literatures and languages&quot;.

<text>The Heinkel He 177 &quot;Greif&quot; (Griffin) was a long-range heavy bomber flown by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II. The introduction of the He 177 to combat operations was significantly delayed by problems both with the development of its engines and frequent changes to its intended role. Nevertheless, it was the only long-range, heavy bomber to become operational with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the conflict. The He 177 had a payload/range capability similar to that of four-engined heavy bombers used by the Allies in the European theatre.

Work on the design began in response to a 1936 requirement known as Bomber A, issued by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) for a purely strategic bomber. Thus, the He 177 was intended originally to be capable of a sustained bombing campaign against Soviet manufacturing capacity, deep inside Russia.

In contrast to its heavy payload and very wide, planform, the specifications called for the design to have only two very powerful engines. To deliver the power required, the He 177 needed engines of at least. Engines of this type were new and unproven at the time. The Daimler-Benz DB 606 power system that was selected, in conjunction with its relatively cramped nacelles, caused cooling and maintenance problems, such that the powerplants became infamous for catching fire in flight, and contributing to the He 177 gaining nicknames from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircrew such as &quot;Reichsfeuerzeug&quot; (&quot;Reich&#x27;s lighter&quot;) or &quot;Luftwaffenfeuerzeug&quot; (&quot;Air Force lighter&quot;).

The type matured into a usable design too late in the war to play an important role. It was built and used in some numbers, especially on the Eastern Front, where its range was particularly useful. The He 177 is notable for its use in mass raids on Velikiye Luki in 1944, one of the late-war heavy bombing efforts by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. It saw considerably less use on the Western Front, although the type played a role during Operation Steinbock (the &quot;Baby Blitz&quot;) against the British mainland in 1944.

==Design and development==
===Background===

During the mid 1930s, Generalleutnant Walther Wever, a longtime advocate of strategic bombing, pressed the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to develop a dedicated long-range bomber for the role of attacking the Soviet Union&#x27;s factories in the Ural Mountain area. This concept was received with significant skepticism amongst many senior officials within the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and, by 1936, this &quot;Ural bomber&quot; program had delivered two rather uninspiring designs, the Dornier Do 19 and Junkers Ju 89.

Wever continued to press for new designs for this role, and the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) finally released a new specification for what they called Bomber A on 3 June 1936. This called for a significantly more advanced design with higher speeds, longer range and larger payloads. This was also the same day that Wever was killed in an air crash, and the design lost its only politically powerful champion.

The specification required the plane to carry a bomb-load of at least 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) over a range of 5,000 km (3,100 mi), with a maximum speed of not less than 500 km/h (311 mph) at altitude. In addition to outperforming, by a considerable margin, any bomber then in service, the design&#x27;s speed was intended to allow it to outrun any contemporary fighter, the so-called &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; concept.

On 2 June 1937, Heinkel Flugzeugwerke received instructions to proceed with construction of a full-scale mock-up of its &quot;Projekt&quot; 1041 Bomber A. Heinkel Flugzeugwerke&#x27;s estimated performance figures for &quot;Projekt&quot; 1041 included a top speed of 550 km/h (342 mph) at 5,500 m (18,050 ft) and a loaded weight of 27,000 kg (59,500 lb). In order to achieve these estimates, Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s chief designer, Siegfried Günter, employed several revolutionary features.

===Engines===
The He 177 required at least a pair of 2,000 PS (1,973 hp, 1,471 kW) engines to meet performance requirements. No engine in the German aviation power-plant industry at that time developed such power. A four-engine version would have been possible with engines like the Daimler-Benz DB 601 but the four-engine layout would impose higher propeller drag to the detriment of performance in dive bombing. The use of only two counter-rotating propellers on a heavy bomber offered many advantages, such as a substantial reduction in drag, reduction of dive instability and a marked improvement in maneuverability. The eight initial V-series prototypes, and the larger number of A-0 pre-production models of the He 177, displayed an airspeed and maneuverability comparable to many heavy fighters of the time.
For the He 177, Günter decided to employ two of the complex Daimler-Benz DB 606 &quot;power system&quot; setups for propulsion. He had already employed these engines on the record-breaking Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance aircraft prototypes. They consisted of a pair of DB 601 liquid-cooled 12-cylinder inverted-vee inline engines mounted side by side in a nacelle – for the He 119, centrally within the fuselage, just behind its heavily glazed cockpit enclosure – driving one propeller. The two engines were inclined inwards by 30° when mounted onto either side of their common, vertical-plane space-frame primary engine mount so that the inner cylinder banks were disposed almost vertically. A common gear-housing connected the front ends of the two crankcases, with the two crankshaft pinions driving a single airscrew shaft gear. The outer sides of each of the component engines&#x27; crankcases were connected to the nacelle firewall through forged mountings similar to what would be used for either a single DB 601 or DB 605 engine-powered aircraft installation. When combined with the central space-frame mount designed especially for the &quot;power system&quot; format, this resulted in a Daimler-Benz &quot;coupled&quot; twin-crankcase &quot;power system&quot; having a trio of engine mount structures within its nacelle accommodation. The starboard DB 601 component engine had to be fitted with a mirror-image version of its mechanically driven centrifugal supercharger, drawing air from the starboard side of the engine. Two of the DB 606s, each of which initially developed 2,600 PS (2,564 hp, 1,912 kW) for take-off and weighing some 1,515 kg (3,340 lb) apiece, were to power the He 177. The DB 606 — and its eventual replacement, the Daimler-Benz DB 605-based &quot;DB 610&quot; — were to be the only two production German aviation powerplants designed to surpass 2,040 PS (2,010 hp, 1,500 kW) of power, something that the Germans had considerable challenges in developing during the war into production-ready, combat-reliable aviation engines.

===Surface evaporation cooling===
For aerodynamic cleanliness, Günter intended to dispense with the usual system of drag-producing engine radiators and planned on using a surface evaporative cooling system instead. Such surface cooling, in the form of simpler surface radiators, had been used on British high-speed racing seaplanes as early as 1929. This sort of system was pioneered on the eight examples built of the Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance aircraft prototype series, already flying with the twin-crankcase DB 606 &quot;power system&quot; engine with success from the beginning, and was also intended for use on the He 100 high-speed fighter prototypes. The coolant water is pressurized, raising its boiling point, in this case to about 110 °C (230 °F). As the superheated water leaves the engine it enters an expansion area where the pressure drops and the water flashes to steam. The steam is then cooled by running it in pipes along the outer skin of the fuselage and wings. Before the design of the He 177 was finalized, it was clear that such a system would be incapable of dealing with the vast amount of heat generated by each of the twinned DB 601-based powerplants, forcing the abandonment of the idea of using evaporative cooling systems, in favour of conventional annular radiators fitted directly behind each propeller. These resembled, but were larger in capacity, than those fitted to the Junkers Ju 88 A bomber, and added to the He 177&#x27;s weight and drag.

===Defensive armament===

Günter&#x27;s original intention had been to equip the He 177 with three cockpit-controlled remote gun turrets, with two of them to come from the Junkers Ju 288 program, leaving one manned emplacement in the tail. Compared with the manned position, a remotely controlled, turreted defensive armament emplacement system traded technical complexity for reduction of size, weight and drag; it had the advantage that the gunner could be placed in a protected position, with the best possible view and with less risk of being blinded by the flash from his own guns. Although work on remotely controlled aircraft defensive systems had reached a relatively advanced stage in Germany in the late 1930s, progress in this field within Germany&#x27;s aviation and armaments systems engineers and manufacturers was to prove insufficient to keep pace with the He 177. As a result, the He 177 had to be modified to accommodate larger and heavier manned positions, such as the manned rear dorsal turret usually fitted to almost all examples of the &quot;Greif&quot;, armed with a 13 mm MG 131 machine gun. That installation meant that the fuselage had to receive structural strengthening in several locations. Most of the later production aircraft did receive a remote forward dorsal turret, the &quot;Fernbedienbare Drehlafette&quot; (translated as &quot;Remotely operated rotating gun-mount&quot; and abbreviated &quot;FDL&quot;) 131Z, armed with two MG 131 machine guns, located at a point on the fuselage directly above the wing root&#x27;s leading-edge, with its rotating hemispherical sighting station dome located a short distance forward of the turret and slightly offset to starboard, just behind the forward cabin area.
A compact tail gun position was fitted for rearward defense, armed with one MG 131 machine gun but its streamlined glazing meant that the gunner lay prone, severely restricting his comfort on long missions. A revised tail gun position with a bulged upper glazing was fitted to the He 177A-3 and later models, which permitted the gunner to sit upright. The revised design required a reduction of the lower end of the rudder surface for clearance. The MG 131 gun would often be replaced with a 20 mm MG 151 cannon or in a few instances, a semi-experimental twin MG 131Z mount, with the twinned 13 mm calibre guns mounted one above the other, at the rear of the standard bulged upper glazing emplacement. Usually, a 7.92 mm MG 81 machine gun in a flexible mount was positioned in the upper starboard side of the cockpit nose glazing for defense against frontal attacks. The undernose, inverted-casemate &quot;Bola&quot; gondola (a common ventral armament fitment on many German bombers), which was the full width of the fuselage where it emerged from under the nose and centered under the forward cabin, usually had a flexibly mounted, drum-fed 20 mm MG FF cannon at the front end as added forward defense and a flexibly mounted MG 81 machine gun in the rear, for the initial He 177A-1. An MG 151 cannon replaced the forward MG FF cannon in later production models, with an MG 131 usually replacing the MG 81, for rearwards ventral defense.

===Wing===

The He 177 had Fowler-type extensible trailing edge flaps, which covered the trailing edge of the wing, including those portions covered by ailerons. Each aileron comprised upper and lower portions, the latter arranged to slide rearwards with flap extension, while the upper part retained its function of providing lateral control for take-off and landing. The original wing design did not fully take into account the stresses resulting from the operation of the Fowler flaps. A Rechlin report dated 9 October 1942 stated:

&quot;The examination has shown that the strength of the He 177&#x27;s wings is one-third below that estimated by Heinkel. The reason for this is the uneven rigidity of the individual members with consequent deformation under load. This condition was not recognized by Heinkel at the proper time, the failure tests having been undertaken too late in view of the size of the structure.&quot;

Tests on the 40th production A-1 aircraft in September 1942, revealed serious outer wing panel component damage after only some 20 flights, due to the aerodynamic stress from diving attack exercises. Costly and extensive strengthening was needed to solve the problem, which significantly increased the aircraft&#x27;s weight. Starting with the later versions of the He 177A-3, the Fowler flaps along the outboard wing sections were no longer fitted and a strengthened wing design was introduced on the He 177A-5.

===Dive bombing===
The inaccuracy of horizontal bombing during the Ural bomber program demonstrated weaknesses in German bombsights and created doubts about the effectiveness of level bombing of factories. While Wever had been advocating the Ural Bomber concept, others in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; were growing increasingly interested in dive bombing.

Diving on the target greatly increases the accuracy of the drop, allowing pin-point attacks on small targets like bridges and ships. Technical data supported the accuracy of &quot;Stuka&quot; bombing achieving greater target destruction over Dornier Do 17s or Heinkel He 111s. The experience of the Condor Legion in Spain tended to support the idea that dive bombing was superior and led some to believe that pinpoint accuracy was possible. Ernst Udet became a vocal supporter of this concept.

In the case of an aircraft attacking a larger target like a factory, the high-angle attacks of the Stuka would not be needed, but a shallower angle, sometimes known as &quot;glide bombing&quot; would be enough. Glide bombing would increase the accuracy to the point that a single aircraft would have a reasonable chance of hitting a factory, instead of having a fleet of aircraft drop a huge number of bombs in hopes that some would hit the target. Udet and others in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; began to see the Bomber not as the strategic bomber that Wever argued for, but what was essentially a long-range &quot;Stuka&quot;.

The mock-up aircraft was completed in November 1937, and on 5 November 1937 it was allocated the official RLM airframe type number &quot;8-177&quot;. That same day, the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL/Luftwaffe High Command) stipulated that the new design should possess sufficient structural strength to enable it to undertake medium-degree diving attacks. While viewing the aircraft at the Heinkel plant that day, Udet mentioned the new requirement to Heinkel. Heinkel replied that the aircraft would never be capable of it.

In spite of Heinkel&#x27;s concerns, the design was modified for glide bombing, which required it to be strengthened to allow it to safely pull out of dives. Then the requirement was again modified, this time calling for a maximum dive angle of 60°, which necessitated further structural strengthening and a big increase in weight.

Problems arising from the latest requirement were never satisfactorily solved, due to the constant increases in loaded weight. Despite strengthened airframes, it was possible to overstress the airframe during dive-bombing. Although the German bomb-sights of the 1930s were inadequate, the later versions of the Lotfernrohr 7 proved to be comparable to the American Norden bombsight. With the introduction of the Lotfe 7, which offered an error of from a release altitude of and Hermann Göring&#x27;s rescinding of the dive-attack requirement on 15 September 1942, the barred-gate type dive brakes on the wing&#x27;s lower surfaces, placed just forward of each of the outboard ends of the Fowler flap panels, were omitted from all He 177A built after the initial A-0 pre-production batch. A photo of one of the 12 &quot;destroyer&quot; He 177A-1/U2, heavy-cannon-armed test airframes, showed the retracted dive brake panel still fitted on the undersurface of the outer starboard wing.

===Undercarriage===

During development, the anticipated weight of the He 177 increased so much that a main undercarriage design sufficient to handle the loaded weight, was difficult to achieve. The engine nacelles and wings had little room for the main undercarriage members, which needed to be longer than usual, for ground clearance for the large diameter four-blade counter-rotating propellers. After several extremely complex arrangements had been considered during initial design, a novel system was adopted. Instead of a wheel leg under each engine nacelle, two-wheel legs were attached to the main spar at each nacelle, the outboard legs retracting upward and outward into shallow wing wells and the inboard legs swinging upward and inward into similar wells in the wing roots, with all units enclosed by flush fitting wheel and strut doors, which almost met under each engine nacelle when fully extended. During the retraction cycle, the forward-oriented lever-action lower gear strut sections (onto which the wheels were mounted on their axles), pivoted backwards to a 90° angle from 120° when fully extended. This was in order to position the wheels to fit into the wheel wells during the sideways folding action. A conventional rearwards-retracting single-leg twin wheel arrangement for each main gear, a design heavily influenced by the He 219&#x27;s similar main gear components, was used on the two prototypes built (one during the war, one post-war) of the He 274 in France. Drawings were made for a tricycle gear arrangement for the four-BMW 801E radial-engine powered &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; entry version of the proposed He 277 by February 1943, which was also depicted with single main gear struts with twin wheels. For the He 177A&#x27;s own landing gear maintenance needs, some two hours were required just to change a main gear tire, using special Heinkel-designed capacity main gear jacks and blocks.

==Prototypes==
On 9 November 1939, the first prototype, the He 177 V1, was flown for the first time with Dipl. Ing. Leutnant Carl Francke, then chief of the Rechlin central flight test center, at the controls. The flight terminated abruptly after only 12 minutes due to overheating engines. Francke was pleased with the general handling and landing characteristics of the prototype but complained of some vibration in the airscrew shafts, the inadequacy of the tail surfaces under certain conditions, and some flutter which accompanied any vigorous movement of the elevators. The He 177 V2 made its first flight soon afterwards.

Following Francke&#x27;s initial flight, the He 177 V1 received several modifications suggested by the initial trials, including a 20% increase in the tail surface area. These changes were not applied to the He 177 V2 when another test pilot undertook the first diving trials, during which the V2 developed severe control flutter and broke up in the air. Following this incident, the tail surfaces of the V3, V4, and V5 prototypes were modified in a similar fashion to those of the He 177 V1. The He 177 V3 was allocated the task of power plant development. The V1 through V3 prototype airframes were all equipped with two counterclockwise rotating DB 606 A powerplants, while the V4 prototype, and all later aircraft throughout the production run of the A-series, used a DB 606 A or DB 610 A engine on the starboard wing, and one clockwise rotating B-version of the same powerplant on the port wing, so that the propellers rotated &quot;away&quot; from each other at the tops of the propeller arcs. The He 177 V4 was retained at Heinkel&#x27;s test field at Rostock-Schmarl (then known as &quot;Rostock-Marienehe&quot;) where it undertook diving trials. While flying over the Baltic, the He 177 V4 failed to recover from a moderate dive, crashing into the sea near Ribnitz. It was discovered that the accident had resulted from the malfunctioning of an airscrew pitch control mechanism.

On 17 November 1938, before the construction of the He 177 V3 and V4 prototype airframes had even been started, Ernst Heinkel had personally asked the RLM to set aside the V3 and V4 airframes for a trial installation of four separate Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants to overcome the concerns that the RLM &quot;Technisches-Amt&quot; technical department&#x27;s director Ernst Udet and Heinkel had expressed about the RLM&#x27;s dive-bombing priority for the He 177A, but was turned down for the trial fitment.

The He 177 V5 incorporated a number of changes which were principally concerned with defensive armament installations. Early in 1941, during a simulated low-level attack, both DB 606 engines burst into flames, and the V5 hit the ground and exploded. The He 177 V6 was the first aircraft equipped with main production type DB 606 A/B engines instead of the pre-production units, which offered a slight increase in take-off power by 100 PS to 2700 PS (2,663 hp, 1,986 kW). The He 177 V7 featured a revised nose section which, while generally following the contours of the nose sections employed by the previous prototypes, was considerably reinforced and embodied fewer glazed panels. In September 1941, the He 177 V8, the last of the prototypes which had a different, &quot;bullet-like&quot; cockpit shaping and construction from the production He 177A series aircraft, was made available for engine tests. However, owing to the urgency of other development work it was returned to Heinkel after only 40 days, and it was not possible to resume engine tests in the air until February 1942. The He 177 V1 to V8 and the A-0 pre-production models are notable for having a broad-bladed set of four-bladed propellers, with blade shapes and profiles similar to those used on the Junkers Ju 88. These were not used on the production He 177A series aircraft.

Photographs of the first eight prototypes show a largely circular fuselage cross-section, especially forward of the wing root, with the A-0 series possessing flatter sides, dorsal and ventral surfaces of the main A-series production aircraft. The choice of what was called the &quot;Cabin 3&quot; cockpit design on 20 September 1939 for the production A-series run, placed a well-framed hemispherical &quot;fishbowl&quot; nose onto the He 177A-0, giving it the generic &quot;stepless cockpit&quot;, &quot;without&quot; the separate windshield for the pilot and co-pilot, that beginning with Heinkel&#x27;s own He 111 P almost all German bomber aircraft had in World War II, and indeed had on all eight of the prototypes with the earlier &quot;bullet&quot; nose design. The forward glazing of the He 177A&#x27;s &quot;stepless&quot; cockpit had each set of its characteristic framing members, of four supporting frame members per set running in each orthogonal direction, running as the parallels and meridians on a globe would. Two sets of four almost square windows, themselves arranged in a square of four windows each on each side of the upper cockpit, just behind the &quot;fishbowl&#x27;s&quot; rear edge, provided sideways vision from the cockpit for the pilot and crew. Photographic evidence shows these side windows were produced with slight differences in external appearance between those built by Heinkel (with its primary headquarters, &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; plant near Rostock, and the satellite &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; plants around Vienna) and those built by Arado Flugzeugwerke (nearby to the &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; plant, with Arado based in Warnemünde), the only major subcontractor for the He 177A&#x27;s airframes. Often, the two lower rows of the &quot;fishbowls&quot; windows in the nose glazing were made opaque, with the exception of the bombardier&#x27;s protruding bombsight window offset to starboard in the lower nose glazing, either by painting them over or replacing them with metal panels that performed the same function.

==Production==
Eight prototypes were completed, followed by 35 pre-production He 177A-0s (built by Arado and Heinkel) and 130 Arado-built He 177A-1s. The early aircraft in this batch were used for further trials, and after a brief and unhappy operational debut the remainder were withdrawn from service. From late 1942 they were replaced by He 177A-3s. Starting in August 1943, all He 177&#x27;s delivered had an extended rear fuselage - by - to both instill greater stability for bombing accuracy (see Airworthiness and handling section) and to offset the slightly lengthened engine nacelles (a &quot;stretch&quot; by ) and the associated centre of gravity change. Most of the short-fuselage A-3s were rebuilt to the longer standard by Eger Flugzeugwerke GmbH.
Note - One A-0, one A-3, and two A-5 rebuilt as He 177B prototypes from before December 1943 to July 1944.

==Engine difficulties==

The tendency of the twin-crankcase, -apiece DB 606 &quot;power system&quot; engines to catch fire became increasingly serious as the test programme progressed, and many of the He 177A-0 series of pre-production prototypes were destroyed in accidents or engine related incidents. The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating. There were several reasons for the flammability of the DB 606 engine as installed in the &quot;Greif&quot; engine nacelles. One was the common &quot;central&quot; exhaust manifold, serving a total of 12 cylinders, on the two inner cylinder banks of the twinned DB 601 component engines making up a DB 606. This central exhaust system routinely became excessively hot, causing the usual accumulation of oil and grease in the bottom of the engine cowling to catch fire. When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to &quot;lag&quot; in its response, delivering more fuel than was required by the engine. In addition, the fuel injection pump connections often leaked. To reduce the aircraft&#x27;s weight, no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants&#x27; engine blocks being placed behind the wing&#x27;s leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines&#x27; exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and oil from leaking connections. At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication caused disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, which sometimes resulted in conrods bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing oil tanks. The oil would then spill on to the often-overheated central exhaust pipe collector. The tightly packed nature of the &quot;power system&quot; engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation. As a result of these factors, in addition to a lack of routine maintenance in the field, the DB 606 powerplants frequently caught fire in flight. The mechanical coupling of two engines proved to be difficult to perfect and led to numerous engine complications with the service test He 177A-0 and initial production A-1 models.
By early August 1942 Göring became angry about the apparent slowness with which the He 177A&#x27;s powerplant problems were being dealt with. He received a report by &quot;Oberst&quot; Edgar Petersen (&quot;Kommandeur der Erprobungstellen&quot;; &quot;commander of test facilities&quot;) about the He 177A&#x27;s powerplant troubles, particularly containing remarks about the problems caused by the compromised design of the DB 606 powerplants&#x27; accommodation in the He 177A&#x27;s engine nacelles, and resultant poor maintenance access. On August 13, Göring responded: &quot;Why has this silly engine suddenly turned up, which is so idiotically welded together? They told me then, there would be two engines connected behind each other, and suddenly there appears this misbegotten monster of welded-together engines one cannot get at!&quot;

Starting with the He 177A-3/R2, the engines and nacelles were redesigned to eliminate the tendency for engine fires. The new &quot;power system&quot; was the Daimler-Benz DB 610, which consisted of two Daimler-Benz DB 605s coupled into a single unit like the DB 606. With the introduction of the DB 610 came several improvements, including the relocation of the engine oil tank, a changed oil flow pipe, an improved oil cooler, the lengthening of the engine mountings by 20 cm (8 in), the complete redesign of the exhaust system, which also facilitated the installation of exhaust flame dampers for night missions, and the setting of a power limitation on the engines which resulted in greater reliability. These major and minor modifications, supposedly numbering 56, were successful in eliminating engine fires, but other minor problems remained, involving the transfer gearbox fitted across the front ends of the &quot;twinned&quot;-component engines of each &quot;power system&quot; and their shared propeller.

&quot;Oberst&quot; Petersen, as well as a Major Mons (also a &quot;Gruppenkommandeur&quot; with II./KG 40, Petersen&#x27;s former bomber wing), through the &quot;Erprobungsstellen&quot; personnel and establishments, were responsible for backing the substantial numbers of upgrades to the He 177A from the time of the cancellation of its dive-bombing requirement in September 1942.

==Experimental weapon loads==
In addition to carrying a variety of bombs, torpedoes, and guided weapons, the He 177 was tested with a number of unorthodox offensive armaments. The first of the experimental weapons fitments known to have been tested was the 12 examples of the He 177A-1/U2 &quot;Zerstörer&quot; variant, which was armed with a pair of limited-traverse 30 mm MK 101 cannons in the extreme front of a dramatically enlarged &quot;Bola&quot; ventral gondola (beyond the hemispherical &quot;fishbowl&quot; nose glazing), and intended for ground attack, train busting, and possibly long-range anti-ship raids. These aircraft were also intended to be used against Allied long-range reconnaissance and bomber aircraft operating over the Atlantic Ocean, which were posing a danger to the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s U-boat fleet. Later, when assigned to flak-suppression sorties in the area of Stalingrad during the winter of 1942, Luftwaffe forward maintenance units modified a small number of He 177A-3s, fitting a 50 mm &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 5 cannon with a 21-round magazine within the aircraft&#x27;s undernose &quot;Bola&quot; gondola, with the long barrel protruding well forward, beyond the glazed &quot;fishbowl&quot; nose. This variant was unofficially dubbed the &quot;Stalingradtyp&quot;. Although a small number of He 177A-3/R5 models were to be built from scratch, with the larger PaK 40-based, autoloading 75 mm &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 7,5 autocannon in the &quot;Bola&quot; location fitted with its 12-round magazine, structural problems caused by the 75 mm weapon&#x27;s recoil meant that the &quot;Stalingradtyp&quot; did not see combat use outside of the original, BK 5 armed handful.

Five He 177A-5s were experimentally equipped in January 1944 with batteries of 33 obliquely mounted 21 cm (8¼ in) calibre rocket mortar tubes, physically similar to the BR 21 single units already in use with single and twin-engined Luftwaffe fighters for bomber destroyer missions, and also likely to have been similarly derived from components of the Nebelwerfer infantry barrage rocket system. The nearly three dozen launch tubes placed in a &quot;Greif&#x27;s&quot; fuselage in such a manner were meant to create the &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot; (&quot;Big Destroyer&quot;) flying battleship, designed to break up and destroy the tight combat box defensive formations used by USAAF daylight bombers over Germany. The bomb bays and fuselage-housed auxiliary fuel tanks were removed on these aircraft in order to provide space for the spin-stabilized 21 cm (8¼ in) rockets and their launch tubes. The tubes were inclined to fire upward at an angle of 60° to the horizontal, and slightly to starboard. The tubes could be fired individually, simultaneously, or in two salvoes of 15 and 18. Tests with fixed balloon targets showed the potential of this system, and limited operational trials against US Eighth Air Force bomber streams were authorized. The aircraft were operated by &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 25, flying out of the Baltic coastal &quot;Erprobungstelle&quot; facility at Tarnewitz. The intended mode of operation required the &quot;Grosszerstörer&quot; He 177s to follow the enemy bomber formations, passing below (as with a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; cannon fitment) and to port of the target, maintaining a difference of altitude of 2,000 m (6,560 ft) beneath the targets at the time of the attack. A few trial daylight operations were flown but no contact was made with Allied bomber formations, and as the escort fighters were becoming ever more numerous - in the manner of air superiority-purpose &quot;fighter sweeps&quot; well ahead of the massed USAAF bomber formations, starting in early 1944 as ordered by then Maj. Gen Jimmy Doolittle - the entire scheme was abandoned.

===Defensive ordnance experiments===
Experimental defensive weapon fitments were also fitted to a small number of He 177As set aside for such trials, mostly at the &quot;Erprobungstellen&quot; test detachment fields. One He 177A-1, s/n 15155 and bearing the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; GI+BP, was fitted with the first-ever example of a remote-controlled twin-gun &quot;chin turret&quot; at the front of its &quot;Bola&quot; undernose gondola. The type of guns fitted was not recorded, but the date on which GI+BP was written off following a mishap in May 1943 would place the fitting of its experimental &quot;chin turret&quot; simultaneously with the lead-up to the May 1943 service introduction of the &quot;gunship&quot; USAAF Flying Fortress, the YB-40 (first flight September 1942), which pioneered the same type of forward defensive armament on the best-known American heavy bomber to attack Germany. Similarly, the much-anticipated &quot;Hecklafette&quot; HL 131V &quot;quadmount&quot; manned tail turret, fitted with a quartet of 13mm MG 131 machine guns, was tried in the late spring and summer of 1943 on a trio of A-3 examples set aside as the V32 through V34 prototypes, but that innovation never made it to production status, never existing as more than a series of engineering department mockups with Heinkel and Junkers, among others (for their aircraft designs that were intended to mount them) and working prototypes. The HL 131V turret&#x27;s design originated with the Borsig division of Rheinmetall-Borsig (the manufacturer of the guns themselves) and was a design with promise, using hydraulic drive to both elevate the turret&#x27;s side-mount gunmount elevation units through a +/- 60º vertical arc either side of level, with a capability for horizontal traverse (of the entire turret) of some 100º to either side, all at a maximum traverse angular speed of 60º per second. One development proposed during 1943 was to create a chin turret using the earlier &quot;Hecklafette&#x27;s&quot; quadmount gun elevation assemblies to either side of a new, remote-control traverse core as the &quot;Bugstandlafette&quot; BL 131V, located at the forward end of the He 177A&#x27;s &quot;Bola&quot; undernose gondola. However, engineering studies of the quadmount chin turret project revealed that its fitment, proposed for a number of the later He 177A variants and the He 177 V104 prototype airframe, would lower airspeed by about 30 km/h (19 mph) and reduce the deployable bombload by a full tonne, making the BL 131V concept unacceptable, and prompting the idea of using a chin-turret mount version of the FDL 151Z twin-cannon remote turret instead for the B-series, four-DB 603 engined He 177Bs, close to what had been pioneered with the GI+BP airframe early in 1943. Even with its unsuitability for the He 177A, the BL 131V quadmount nose turret was prototyped for armament tests at the &quot;Erprobungsstelle Tarnewitz&quot; for potential fitment and use on the He 177B V104 prototype airframe; and had, by mid-July 1944, completed its tests.

==Airworthiness and handling==
Flight testing of the He 177 in late summer 1942 revealed deficient stability around the yaw and pitch axes, resulting in extremely poor bombing accuracy when using the Lotfe 7 bombsight. The main reason for this was the drifting motion of the aircraft in flight due to its relatively short, round fuselage. Shortly after these tests, the third production A-1 example (factory serial number 15153, with &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of GI + BN) had its fuselage lengthened by 160 cm (63 in) just aft of the trailing edge of the wing. The modified aircraft, with the longer distance of the &quot;tail moment&quot;, showed a marked degree of improvement in yaw and pitch axis stability, enough to mandate the construction of the He 177A-3 and all subsequent models of the He 177A with the lengthened fuselage.

In early September 1944, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) was ordered to supply an aircrew for an He 177 that the French Maquis would capture at an airfield in Blagnac near Toulouse, where elements of both the He 177A-equipped KG 4 and KG 100 bomber wings were based. A transport and two escort fighters from the RAE flew to the area to leave the Royal Aircraft Establishment Chief Test Pilot Roland Falk and a flight engineer with the commando group. On 10 September, as Operation Dragoon was wrapping up in the southeast of France, the aircraft was captured and flown back to the UK by Falk. Soon afterwards, Capt. Eric Brown, an RN pilot then posted to the RAE as a test pilot, flew the He 177. He wrote that the in-flight handling characteristics of the He 177A-5 were &quot;...positive about all axes, but the controls were all remarkably light for such a large aircraft. Indeed I had the feeling that the elevator was &quot;dangerously&quot; light and I was all too aware of the intelligence reports of He 177s breaking up in the air so I decided to treat this control very gently...The aircraft had an automatic pull-out device and an acceleration warning apparatus fitted, but it really was nailbiting to have to treat a giant like this immense Heinkel bomber as if it were made of glass. The stalling characteristics with flaps and undercarriage lowered, the aircraft buffeted violently at 140 km/h (87 mph) before the nose dropped at 135 km/h (84 mph). The buffet experienced was so violent that I had some concerns over structural damage. Somehow the He 177 always conveyed an impression of fragility despite its size.&quot; He added that it was &quot;one of the very few German aircraft of the period that I tested that I did not enjoy flying&quot;.

==Further development: the Heinkel He 177B==
Due to the continuing problems with the DB 606&#x27;s configuration and engine accommodation design, much development work was done in order to rectify engine complications. This included a complete redesign of the original He 177, primarily through newer wing designs and layouts to improve the engine installation design, in conjunction with the A-3 subtype&#x27;s lengthened rear fuselage, intended to create a four-engined version of the &quot;Greif&quot;″s airframe. The first concerns over the coupled-engine vs. four separate engine issue for the He 177 emerged in mid-November 1938, as Ernst Heinkel had requested that two of the under-construction airframes for the eight He 177 prototypes to be fitted out with four individual engines in place of the coupled-engine arrangements, eventually specifying that the V3 and V4 airframes get four individual Junkers Jumo 211 engines in an in-plant corporate meeting on 17 November – exactly the same type and number of engines used on the Messerschmitt AG &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; contender, the Me 264 V1 in late December 1942. Ernst Udet was also critical before the war of the coupled DB 606 powerplant choice for the He 177, with Göring voicing his own frustrations with the seemingly interminable engine problems delaying the introduction of the He 177A into service. Göring was reported as stating in late August 1942, following his earlier complaints to &quot;Oberst&quot; Petersen on the 13th of the month: &quot;I had told Udet from the start that I wanted this beast with four engines. This crate must have had four engines at some time! Nobody had told me anything about this hocus-pocus with welded-together engines!&quot;

Nearly four years after Heinkel had unsuccessfully requested that the V3 &amp; V4 be built with four individual powerplants, the RLM&#x27;s requirement that the He 177 perform diving attacks was finally rescinded by Göring himself in September 1942, and with that, Heinkel&#x27;s design work on the A-8 and A-10, collectively renamed the He 177B in August 1943, was then able to progress. They were meant to be powered with four individual Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines on new longer-span wings, with each liquid-cooled DB 603 fitted with a Heinkel He 219-style annular radiator right behind the propeller — most likely comprising a Heinkel-specific unitized engine installation that had already been perfected during the He 219&#x27;s development — for each of the quartet of DB 603s fitted, the same style of radiator that was used on the standard He 177.

By August 1943 much of the detail work for the He 177B series aircraft was well on its way to completion, and Erhard Milch eagerly approved the creation of three He 177B prototypes, designated He 177 V101 to V103. He stated on 10 August: &quot;The He 177A-4 and A-5 will be produced as before. The He 177B-5 will be tackled with vigor. It will be built in series as soon as possible.&quot;

The He 177B-5&#x27;s first-built prototype, the He 177 V101, was converted from a mid-production He 177A-3 airframe (number 535 550, with &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of NN + QQ), the V102 being converted from the eighth He 177A-0 production prototype aircraft (which required the He 177A-3 specification aft fuselage lengthening), and the V103 being converted from an existing, early production He 177A-5 airframe, with all three airframes initially retaining the production 177A-style single vertical tail surfaces. Although no photographs are known to exist verifying their fitment, the general arrangement &quot;Typenblatt&quot; drawing for the V101 airframe — bearing the &quot;B-5&quot; subtype designation within the drawing&#x27;s title block — showed that it was intended to be uniquely fitted with a small-area matching vertical pair of so-called pivoting &quot;drag rudders&quot; mounted, one per side, a short distance in from the horizontal stabilizers&#x27; tips, directly inline with the inner engine nacelles, to simulate &quot;engine-out&quot; conditions. Each of the pivoted &quot;drag rudders&quot; were to have their area divided equally above and below the plane of the stabilizer. Because flight testing had revealed that the single-tailed V101 exhibited an increasingly serious stability problem with higher airspeeds, the subsequent prototype, the V102, was both the first He 177B example to fly, on 20 December 1943, with the quartet of DB 603 engines, in combination with a brand-new empennage of twin tail configuration, fitted to it during the early autumn of 1943. When the V102 was tested later that autumn while still flying with its A-series wing and powerplants before its own pair of B-series &quot;four-engine&quot; wing units were ready, the new twin vertical tails gave the V102 significantly better in-flight handling compared to the original 177A-style empennage of the V101, except during the landing approach when the Fowler flaps were extended during its own initial flights with the twin tails in November 1943. On 24 February 1944, as the USAAF&#x27;s Big Week strategic bombing campaign against Germany continued, particularly against targets in northern France involving V-weapons installations — a meeting was held at the all turf-surfaced Wiener Neustadt military airfield. Erhard Milch, and fellow guests &quot;Oberst&quot; Edgar Petersen and &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Siegfried Knemeyer (Göring&#x27;s top aviation technology expert), each had a chance to fly the now four-engined V102 prototype after the B-series set of wings had been fitted. Knemeyer stated that he could not believe a four-engined heavy bomber could possess the &quot;excellent handling qualities&quot; that the V102 displayed. The only verifiable wartime photograph of any of these He 177B prototypes in an intact condition is one of the V101, parked outdoors on a foggy German airfield, most likely the &quot;Heinkel-Sud&quot; factory airfield at Schwechat. One additional surviving photo, showing what looks like a He 177B-series prototype from the right side with a production-style A-series single vertical tail surface set, and bearing the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; code of NE+OD, does not match any item of the surviving documentation for the four known 177B-series prototypes ordered, built or flown before the end of the war, and possessing one of the upgraded, upright-seating A-5 subtype&#x27;s tail gunner&#x27;s emplacements, as well as the usual twin dorsal turret defensive armament of the He 177A-5 subtype.

The He 177B was also intended to introduce a slightly enlarged, somewhat more aerodynamic fully glazed nose. It somewhat echoed the lines of the nose glazing from the Airspeed Horsa British troop glider in a side view comparison, and was first meant for use on the production A-7 version. It could incorporate a remotely controlled power chin turret at the front of its &quot;Bola&quot; for forward ventral defense, mounting either a pair of 13mm MG 131 machine guns or 20mm MG 151 cannon and closely modeled on the A-series 177&#x27;s existing FDL 131Z forward dorsal turret, but the new nose design was only tested on the He 177 V15 production prototype (converted from an A-3, factory serial 355 001), without the chin turret. It was never fitted on any of the He 177B prototypes, which all used the standard &quot;Cabin 3&quot; He 177A&#x27;s well-framed nose. No photographs of this new nose design are known to have survived the war and only drawings of it exist in modern archives, with the V15 airframe itself wrecked in a crash on 24 June 1944. The remaining defensive armament for the B-series design generally remained similar to the He 177A, particularly the twin dorsal gun turrets for the He 177B-5, with the aft manned dorsal turret being deleted on the planned He 177B-7 (as on the He 177A-7) to reduce weight, and a fully powered, manned &quot;Hecklafette&quot; HL 131V tail turret, carrying a quartet of MG 131 machine guns, was intended for installation on the prototypes. The &quot;Hecklafette&quot; HL 131V four-gun manned tail turret system would have been standardized on the production B-series aircraft, but never went beyond the mockup and working prototype stage, with a trio of the prototype tail turret units documented as being fitted to the He 177 V32 through V34 A-series DB 610-powered prototype airframes for trials. The cumbersome four-strut main landing gear of the A-series was retained for the B-series prototypes, even though the height, meant to allow clearance for the A-series&#x27; pair of large four-blade propellers, was not changed – the outer edge of the DB 603&#x27;s inner engine nacelle/wing surface juncture was located right at the &quot;centreline&quot; of each of the twin pairs of A-series main gear strut locations, on all four of the B-series prototypes.

The first flights of the He 177B prototypes, starting with the He 177 V102 on 20 December 1943, occurred between late December 1943 and early January 1944 in the vicinity of the Vienna-Schwechat airfield, at the firm&#x27;s &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; production facility. An additional prototype, the V104, whose purpose was to be the &quot;finalized&quot; pre-production prototype for the He 177B-5, and also meant to be a twin-tailed prototype like the earlier V102, was being completed thereby order from the RLM, converted from an early production He 177A-5. However, from 23 April, through July 1944, repeated Fifteenth Air Force bombing raids on German aircraft production facilities in Vienna, and on 8 July destroyed the airworthy V103 and the incomplete V104 at the Zwölfaxing factory airfield of the &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; complex, setting back plans to produce any series examples of the B-5 version. &quot;Arado Flugzeugwerke&quot;, which had been the major subcontractor for the A-series &quot;Greif&quot; airframes, was fully involved at that time with the production of its own, much more advanced Arado Ar 234 B turbojet-powered reconnaissance-bomber, and was not able to handle the anticipated demand from Heinkel to produce the B-5 by October 1944. Arado would not have been able to start the He 177 B-5&#x27;s production for another month (November 1944) due to its own focus on the Ar 234 B. The last known official account of the whereabouts of the two He 177B prototypes that escaped the bombing raids placed the V101 at the &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; plant&#x27;s airfield at Schwechat near Vienna, and the V102 also at Schwechat as late as February 1945. It had sustained damage from a bad landing in April 1944 while evading one of the initial USAAF 15th Air Force raids on the area, which had kept it from being flown north to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Rechlin test facility for safety.

The adoption of the Emergency Fighter Program in early July 1944 dealt the final blow to the entire He 177B development program, with the Heinkel He 162 &quot;Spatz&quot; jet fighter being the only new Heinkel aircraft design allowed into production.

==Operational history==
Beset by technical difficulties in development, the He 177 had a troubled history in service. Unduly demanding design requirements of long-range, high speed, heavy bomb load, and the formerly required dive bombing capability compounded the problems. Although the He 177 entered service in 1942, it was far from operational. In an assessment of the aircraft on 9 April 1942, the newly activated &quot;Erprobungsstaffel 177&quot; reported that the &quot;Greif&quot; had good flying characteristics, but had unacceptable engine troubles and problems with its airframe strength. As an emergency measure, aircraft from Kampfgeschwader 50 were used to supply the encircled 6th &quot;Armee&quot; at Stalingrad, where they were found to be unsuited for the transport role, carrying little more cargo than the smaller and more reliable Heinkel He 111, and proving useless for the evacuation of wounded. As a result, the He 177s reverted to bombing and flak-suppression missions near Stalingrad. Only thirteen missions were flown, and seven He 177s were lost to fire without any action attributable to the enemy.

As the war progressed, He 177 operations became increasingly ineffective. Fuel and personnel shortages presented difficulties, and He 177s were sitting on airfields all over Europe awaiting new engines or engine-related modifications. Of the 14 He 177A-3s (the primary subtype in use) that were sent out during Operation Steinbock, one suffered a burst tyre, and eight returned with overheating or burning engines. Of the four that reached London, one was lost to night fighters. These aircraft were brand new, delivered a week before the operation and not fully flown in, because the air unit had moved to a new airfield the day before and lacked sufficient maintenance personnel and material. Constant attacks against Luftwaffe long-range combat units in France made continuous operations difficult.

While Steinbock was unsuccessful, the He 177 did achieve some successes. During Steinbock crews typically carried two 1,800 kg (3,970 lb) and two 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) bombs. Climbing to 7,000 m (22,965 ft) while still over German territory, the He 177s approached the target in a shallow dive, both engines throttled back, the pilot putting his aircraft into a gliding descent to take it across the bomb release-point at about 4,500 m (14,760 ft). After releasing the bombs the pilot re-opened the throttles, but continued the descent at approximately 200 m (656 ft) per minute. The bombers typically re-entered German airspace at an altitude of 750 m (2,460 ft), and headed back to base. By such means, the He 177s were able to keep up speeds of about during their withdrawal phase. The higher speed and constant change of altitude made interceptions difficult, increasing the survivability of the aircraft, but decreased bombing accuracy and concentration. With an average loss rate of 60% for bomber aircraft types used in Operation Steinbock, the He 177&#x27;s loss rate below 10% made it the most survivable bomber in the campaign.

In February 1944, at around the same time as Operation Steinbock, He 177s and Dornier Do 217s carrying Henschel Hs 293 glide bombs attacked Allied shipping off the Anzio beachhead.

On the Eastern Front, the most notable action by the He 177 was a mass raid of some 87 aircraft against railway targets in the Velikiye Luki area, about west of Moscow on 19 July 1944. The participating Staffeln flew in three large attack wedges of about thirty aircraft, each loaded with four 250 kg (551 lb) or two 500 kg (1,102 lb) bombs. During this action, carried out in daylight at altitudes in excess of 6,000 m (19,690 ft), losses were relatively light. The Soviet Air Force, equipped mainly for low-level interception and ground-attack roles, could do little to hinder the high-flying bombers.

In common with most piston-engined German bombers, the He 177 was grounded from the summer of 1944 due to the implementation of the Emergency Fighter Program as well as the Allied bombing of German fuel production facilities.

:Meant to be a &quot;32 metric-ton&quot; loaded-weight long-range bomber, as a planned improvement over the A-5 version, the A-6 dispensed with the rear manned dorsal turret, and retained the A-5/R2&#x27;s single MG 151 flexible cannon at the front of the &quot;Bola&quot;, the flexible ball-mount MG 81 in the &quot;fishbowl&quot; nose glazing, along with the regular A-series FDL 131Z remote forward dorsal turret, and standardized the rear armament with the planned, Borsig-designed &quot;Hecklafette&quot; manned HL 131V quadmount MG 131 machine gun turret for the first time. Not produced, due to building volume of design work on the He 177B-series four-engined aircraft.
;;He 177A-6/R1
:Replacement of the forward and central bomb bays with full-fuselage-depth fuel tanks (as on the A-5/R6 modification) and the addition of external bomb rack under the new fuel tank bays, capable of carrying a single 2,500 kg (5,511 lb) bomb or Fritz X/Hs 293 in addition to the rear bomb-bay payload of four 250 kg (551 lb) or two 500 kg (1,102 lb) bombs, if equipped with &quot;Kehl&quot; control gear. Range of 5,800 km (3,604 mi), only six test conversions built, from A-5 versions.
;;He 177A-6/R2
:Equipped with a redesigned fuselage nose of improved aerodynamic form, abandoning the earlier &quot;Cabin 3&quot; cockpit, with the new nose being generally the same as intended for He 177A-7 and all He 177B development versions. Retained the FDL 131 remotely controlled forward dorsal turret, a single flexible-mount MG 131 in the rear of the &quot;Bola&quot;, a pair of MG 151/20 cannon in a remotely controlled FDL 151Z &quot;chin&quot; turret (to be standardized on the B-version) at the front of the &quot;Bola&quot;, and a manned &quot;Hecklafette&quot; HL 131V hydraulic-drive, quadruple-MG 131 armed &quot;quadmount&quot; tail turret. Similar bombload and range to He 177A-6/R1. Only one test airframe converted from an He 177A-3 to test the new cockpit/nose, as the He 177 V15, of which no photos are known to survive, and which itself was wrecked in a mishap in late July 1944.

;He 177A-7
:High-altitude bomber with an extended wing spanning 36 m (118 ft 1⅓ in) and powered solely with DB 610 A/B engines instead of the intended 3,800 PS (3,748 hp, 2,795 kW) DB 613 &quot;power systems&quot;, which never emerged from testing and used pairs of twinned DB 603 engines for each &quot;power system&quot;. Six examples, for wing tests, converted from He 177A-5 airframes, but never fitted with the intended He 177B-series advanced cockpit. One converted He 177A-5 example, &quot;Wk. Nr.&quot; 550 256 captured by American forces, scrapped postwar and believed buried under the grounds of Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport.
;He 177A-8
:First proposed He 177 design to feature four individual engines, using the A-3 or A-5 fuselage with a new wing design, and either Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines as prototyped (He 177 V101 through -V103 in 1943-44) or Junkers Jumo 213 engines (proposal only) with He 219 style annular radiators for the Heinkel-unitized DB 603s used in the He 219. Remained a paper project only, before re-designation as the &quot;He 177B-5&quot; by August 1943.
;He 177A-10
:Proposed four-engined He 177 design, similar to the He 177A-8, but based instead on the He 177A-7 definitive production fuselage, with manned rear dorsal gun turret omitted, and re-designated as the &quot;He 177B-7&quot; in August 1943.
;He 177B
:Developed as the direct, &quot;separate four-engined&quot; development of the &quot;coupled engine&quot; powered He 177A-series, four prototypes ordered (He 177 V101 to V104) with three built and flown under DB 603 power. Originally postulated in postwar aviation books to have been a &quot;cover designation&quot; for the never-produced, paper-only He 277 &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; design competitor by February 1943, itself cancelled in late April 1944.
;He 177H
:Initial project designation for the Heinkel He 274.
;He 179
:Proposed 1939 variant of He 177 with four separate piston engines; not built.

;Special variants
:He 177 V38
::An A-5 (&quot;Werknummer&quot; 550 002, bearing &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of KM+TB) – documented use was as testbed for FuG 200 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; ASV maritime patrol radar with flexible MG 131Z nose gun installation, speculated to have been intended for the installation of an enlarged bomb bay for test purposes, said to be intended for use in the Junkers Ju 287. A common myth claims V38 was the prototype for a German &quot;atomic bomber&quot; (purportedly capable of carrying a fission device as a droppable weapon). Remains found at Prague&#x27;s Ruzyne field on V-E Day.

* Royal Aircraft Establishment
:The He 177 A-5 (&quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; code of F8 + AP from 6./KG 40) that had been taken from Toulouse-Blagnac airfield in September 1944 was repainted with British markings and given the serial &quot;TS439&quot;. Used purely for evaluation purposes.

==Surviving aircraft==
All surviving He 177 A aircraft, including the photographed He 177 B wreck at Eger Flugzeugwerke GmbH and both He 274 airframes completed in France post-war, are known to have been reduced to scrap by the end of the 1950s, so there are no surviving examples.

<text>The Heinkel He 274 was a German heavy bomber aircraft with pressurized crew accommodation developed during World War II, designed for high-altitude bombing. Due to the Allied advance through Northwest Europe, the prototypes were abandoned at the factory in German-occupied France where they were being built. They were completed after the war by the French and used for high-altitude research.

== Background ==

On 17 November 1938, the owner of the Heinkel aviation firm, Ernst Heinkel, requested permission from the RLM that two of the requested eight prototype airframes for the nascent He 177 heavy bomber project, specifically the V3 and V4 airframes, be set aside for a trial installation of four separate Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants. Heinkel had foreseen that an individually engined version of his bomber would someday be preferred, quite unlike the requested fitment of the coupled pairs of Daimler-Benz DB 601 inverted V12 engines, each known as a DB 606 — weighing some 1.5 tonnes apiece — which ended up being fitted to all of the eight He 177 V-series prototypes at the request of the RLM, and the Luftwaffe High Command, with the concerned government agencies citing the desire for a dive-bombing capability to be present even with a heavy-bomber-sized offensive warplane, something Ernst Heinkel vehemently disagreed with.

By April 1939, interest in developing a high-altitude version of the He 177 had arisen, and on 27 April 1939, the first proposal for such an aircraft was presented to Heinkel by his firm&#x27;s engineering staff. The aircraft was intended to have a reduced crew of three, with a fully pressurized nose compartment for the pilot and bombardier/forward gunner, and separate pressurized tail gun emplacement. The result, in December 1940, was the specification for the He 177A-2 high altitude bomber design, with a four-person crew (pilot, bombardier, forward gunner and tail gunner) in the two specified pressurized compartments, and powered by the regular A-series pair of DB 606 coupled engines. The defensive armament had been reduced to a trio of &quot;Ferngesteuert-Lafette&quot; FL 81Z remote gun turrets, each with a twin-barrel MG 81 armament installation each in an upper nose mount, forward dorsal and (as part of the &quot;Bola&quot; casemate-style gondola under the nose) forward ventral location each, and a single MG 131 machine gun in an He 177A-1-style, pressurized manned flexible tailgun emplacement. The A-2 version had even been considered for a pioneering in-flight refueling capability, possibly using Ju 290 maritime patrol aircraft as the tankers. With in-flight refueling, the range of the A-2 would have been extendable to some 9,500 km (5,900 mi) of total flight distance.

The Heinkel firm had been working on practical cockpit pressurization methods and hardware for both the A-2, and slightly later A-4 versions (identical to the A-2, except for the fitting of a pair of the later DB 610 coupled engines) from 1940 through the late summer of 1941, when the DB 610-powered A-4&#x27;s pressurized cockpit in provisional form, almost identical in external appearance to the standard &quot;Cabin 3&quot; He 177A-series production cockpit, was ready for tests and development.

By October 1941, a more developed &quot;He 177H&quot; specification for a high-altitude Heinkel-designed heavy bomber had emerged from the proposed A-2 and A-4 coupled-engine designs, with the intent of carrying a 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) bombload over a maximum range of some 3,000 km (1,895 mi), and accepted by the RLM for the first time since the rejection of Dr. Heinkel&#x27;s initial November 1938 request for two of the early He 177 V-series prototype airframes to get them, an individual four-engine installation was being considered for any He 177-based bomber airframe, with a quartet of either BMW 801 or DB 603 unitized-installation engines — the DB 603 powerplants being unitized in a Heinkel factory-specific design also used for the He 219 — among the choices of powerplants being specified, with the same sort of reduced-armament defensive weapon format as the A-2 and A-4 were intended to have.

In conjunction with his request for help from &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz in May 1942, concerning the suitability of aircraft for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; contract competition as that proposal first appeared, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erhard Milch also received von Gablenz&#x27;s opinion on the He 177 and its He 274 development, with von Gablenz stating that neither of these Heinkel &quot;heavy bomber&quot; designs had anywhere near the range to conduct a mission approaching the demands of the new contract.

A pair of the early He 177A-0 pre-production prototypes were renamed the He 177 V10 and V11 for the purposes of high-altitude trials and were to be the first to test the A-4 pattern pressurized cockpit design at altitude. Only the V11 was used for the needed research and managed to achieve an altitude of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) on 9 August 1943. Further tests continued through October of that year, before the V10 and V11 were grounded in April 1944.

In February 1943, the same month by which the RLM&#x27;s first mention of any official status had occurred for design work on an entirely separate, Heinkel He 277-named heavy bomber design to be paid to Heinkel&#x27;s engineering shops by them, and becoming the Heinkel firm&#x27;s &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; contract contender, any further work on the coupled-engined He 177A-2 and A-4 designs was halted by order of the RLM. The four-engined He 177H high-altitude design proposal had gained in importance from that time, evidenced by &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring&#x27;s derisive &quot;welded-together engines&quot; complaints in August 1942, regarding the He 177 A-series unending engine problems from the choice of the 1.5 tonne-weight apiece DB 606 and 610 &quot;power systems&quot; for the A-series operational aircraft. This resulted in a trio of parallel programs under development by the Heinkel engineering shops for four-engined heavy bomber designs, from February 1943 to 20 April 1944.

== Development ==
The first proposal for what would become the He 274 started with six airframe orders for what had been known as the He 177H, which were requested from Heinkel as early as mid-October 1941, all to have four engines in stretched production He 177A-3 fuselages. The main production version had been lengthened by 160 cm aft of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge for better stability and also used for the A-5 subtype — mated to longer span, four-engined wings. These proposed aircraft were shortly thereafter officially given the airframe project number 8-274 by the RLM; due to the busy Heinkel factory design offices and aircraft manufacturing facilities, this new &quot;He 274&quot; high-altitude bomber was to have its prototypes built in France by the &quot;Societe des Usines Farman&quot; (Farman Brothers) in Suresnes. Two He 274 prototypes were ordered built in France by the Farman Brothers and four pre-production prototypes by the Heinkel&#x27;s &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; headquarters at its Rostock-Marienehe (today&#x27;s Rostock-Schmarl) facility. Farman at Suresnes, began their prototype development.

Work on the requested half-dozen He 274 prototype airframes was leveraged off Heinkel aircraft production at AIA Breguet, Toulouse where French factories produced Heinkel components and Junkers aviation engines. French production facilities at Toulouse for Heinkel aircraft were severely damaged by Royal Air Force (RAF) air raids on the night of 5/6 March 1944 and again by the US Eighth Air Force on 25 June 1944. This frustrated completion of the French prototypes, as design work in Germany and Austria had already begun by February 1943 on what had emerged as the Heinkel entry in the trans-Atlantic &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; strategic heavy bomber design competition, the newer Heinkel He 277. While the RLM-designated &quot;8-277&quot; airframe&#x27;s design work had been progressing at the &quot;Heinkel-Sud&quot; facility in Vienna from before that time, general arrangement &quot;Typenblatt&quot; the drawings for the never-completed He 277, with a design influence for the fuselage&#x27;s geometry from the smaller Heinkel He 219 night fighter, show that it had also adopted many features from the He 274, especially its twin tail. The Heinkel entry for the &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; competition was itself cancelled on 20 April 1944, with not one airframe completed.

== Characteristics ==
Major differences between the He 274 and the He 177 A were abandonment of the twin coupled &quot;power system&quot; engine arrangement in favor of four independent DB 603A-2 fully unitized engines, cooled by annular radiators nearly identical in appearance to those on the similarly-powered Heinkel He 219 night fighter as an integral part of each &quot;unitized&quot; engine&#x27;s installation, an extended rear fuselage with a twin tail fin empennage, a pressurized double glazed cockpit of nearly identical external appearance to the 177A&#x27;s standard &quot;Cabin 3&quot; nose, a longer wingspan, and a more conventional, single oleo strut-per-side set of twinned-wheel main undercarriage, abandoning the cumbersome four-strut main gear system of the He 177A, needed for the earlier design&#x27;s pair of larger-diameter, four-blade propellers.

The He 274&#x27;s advanced, high-altitude cockpit, despite its external resemblance to that of the He 177A, comprised a pressurized compartment for a crew of four employing double walls of heavy-gauge alloy, hollow sandwich-type glazing and inflatable rubber seals. This cockpit maintained a pressure at high altitude equivalent to that at . Largely unnecessary defensive armament was restricted to a forward-firing caliber MG 131 machine gun and remotely controlled dorsal and ventral &quot;Fernbedienbare Drehlafette&quot; FDL 131Z gun turrets each containing a pair of MG 131s machine guns and with the dorsal turret operated from a slightly offset Plexiglas domed rotating sighting station in the roof of the flight deck as most A-series He 177s were, with the ventral unit aimed from the rear of the ventral &quot;Bola&quot; gondola. The engines used were the same type of Daimler-Benz DB 603A &quot;Kraftei&quot; &quot;power-egg&quot; unitized engine installations, complete with their He 219-style annular radiators that were placed on the wings of the quartet of ordered He 177B prototypes, but for the He 274, added DVL-designed TK 11 turbochargers, one per engine, for better power output at high altitude.

== Abandoned prototypes ==
Construction of the two prototypes, the He 274 V1 and V2 did not commence until 1943. They were to have been built in France by SAUF at Suresnes, France, but the prototypes were not completed in time. The He 274 V1 was being readied for flight testing at Suresnes in July 1944 when the approach of Allied forces necessitated the evacuation of Heinkel personnel working on the project. Minor difficulties had delayed the flight testing and transfer of the aircraft to Germany, and orders were therefore given to destroy the virtually completed prototype. Only minor damage was actually done to the airframe of the He 274 V1, and repairs were begun after the Allied occupation.

The He 274 V1 was repaired by &quot;Ateliers Aéronautiques de Suresnes&quot; (AAS) and used by the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force) for several years as a high-altitude research plane. It was renamed the AAS 01A. The He 274 V2 was eventually completed as the AAS 01B, completed with the alternate choice of Heinkel-Hirth 2291 turbochargers, in place of the TK 11 units used by the He 274 V1&#x27;s engines.

Eventually the V2 flew exactly two years (on 27 December 1947) after the AAS 01A. By this time, the AAS organization had been absorbed into the French SNCASO (Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-ouest, or commonly, Sud-Ouest) aviation conglomerate. Both of the AAS 01 completed and airworthy versions of the He 274 were eventually broken up in late 1953, after serving as &quot;mother ships&quot; for aerial launching, in the manner of a composite or parasite aircraft, of a number of early French advanced jet and rocket test aircraft like the unpowered Sud-Ouest SO.4000 M.1, almost always launched from a strut-braced, above-fuselage position. The Leduc 0.10 and Leduc 0.16 also each had their first aerial tests from atop the pair of surviving He 274 prototypes. The slightly less powerful, French designed four-engined SNCASE SE.161 &quot;Languedoc&quot; airliner design took over this &quot;mother ship&quot; role later in the 1950s, for further air launch duties with French high-speed aerodynamic research prototypes.

<doc id="455378" wikidata="Q472700" url="?curid=455378" title="Heinkel He 277">
<text>The Heinkel He 277 was a four-engine, long-range heavy bomber design, originating as a derivative of the He 177, intended for production and use by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II. The main difference was in its engines. While the He 177 used four engines in two coupled pairs which proved troublesome, the He 277 was intended to use four unitized BMW 801E 14-cylinder radial engines, in single nacelle installations.

The design was never produced and no prototype airframe was completed. The deteriorating condition of the German aviation industry late in the war and the competition from other long-range bomber designs from other firms, led to the design being cancelled.

==Designation==
For many years after the war, some aviation history books and magazine articles stated that &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring, early in World War II, was becoming so frustrated by the 177A&#x27;s problems with its twin DB 606 &quot;coupled&quot; powerplants, that he forbade Ernst Heinkel from doing any work on a four-engined version of the 177 airframe, or even mentioning a new &quot;He 277&quot; design with four separate engines – by one account, in the late autumn of 1941 – until Heinkel brought the disagreement directly to Adolf Hitler, who supposedly not only approved of calling the new version of the 177 the &quot;He 277&quot;, but overruled Göring&#x27;s prohibition on working on the design (which Heinkel referred to as &quot;He 177B&quot; as a &quot;cover designation&quot; to hide its existence from Göring, and the RLM.)

Statements by Göring in August 1942 in response to &quot;Oberst&quot; Edgar Petersen&#x27;s reports - in his capacity as the &quot;Kommandeur der Erprobungstellen&quot; (&quot;commander of all Luftwaffe test stations&quot;), at &quot;Erprobungsstelle Rechlin&quot; - on solving the serious problems with the original Heinkel He 177A&#x27;s powerplants, seem to directly contradict elements of that narrative. ,The statements seem to show that Göring thought that the He 177A actually had four separate engines, and in late August 1942 Göring derisively labeled the He 177A&#x27;s coupled engine arrangements, the DB 606 and DB 610 &quot;power systems&quot;, as monstrous &quot;zusammengeschweißte Motoren&quot;, (&quot;welded-together engines&quot;,) He was anxious to see a four-engined version of the bomber developed and in production. The earliest-dated initiative to be undertaken by Ernst Heinkel himself to trial a true &quot;four-engined&quot; design format for the original He 177 dated back to 17 November 1938, before the construction of the He 177 V3 and V4 prototype airframes had even been started, when Heinkel had personally asked the RLM to set aside the He 177 V3 and V4 airframes for a trial installation of four separate unitized Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants to overcome the concerns that the RLM &quot;Technischen-Amt&quot; technical department&#x27;s director Ernst Udet and Heinkel had expressed about the RLM&#x27;s specific dive-bombing priority for the He 177A, but was turned down for the trial fitment. However, several publications listed the He 177B and He 277 as separate designs, including Nowarra (1972).

The erroneous assertion in some post-1945 aviation publications about He 177B being a cover designation for He 277&quot; could have been due to the fact that the RLM, in listing the He 177 development projects that they approved of the Heinkel firm doing work on as of February 1943 — six months after Göring&#x27;s recorded engine complaint statements, and 18 months after Heinkel conceived the paper-only &quot;He 177H&quot; high-altitude predecessor to the later He 274 in October 1941, only included the He 177 A-5 heavy bomber, A-6 high-altitude bomber, A-7 long-range version, and the He 277 itself, defining the February 1943 date as the earliest reliable date of any official RLM mention of He 277, as this date also indicates the time by which the RLM had issued the Heinkel firm the &quot;8-277&quot; number for the project. The RLM as of late spring of 1943 anticipated that three He 277 V-series prototype aircraft, and construction of ten pre-production He 277A-0 series service test machines would come from Heinkel&#x27;s Schwechat southern plant complex in Austria beginning in 1944.

The He 277&#x27;s fuselage design had been meant to originate with the last proposed &quot;coupled-engine&quot; variant of the He 177, the long-range A-7, which itself was to be the basis for a four-engined variant of the &quot;Greif&quot; as the He 177A-10 (redesignated He 177B-7 in the late summer of 1943). The considerable changes in the He 277&#x27;s overall design philosophy evolved after the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; requirement’s emergence in 1941, from the changes in the He 277&#x27;s general arrangement proposal drawings during that time period, especially after Heinkel had worked out the earlier P.1064 project in 1942 for a six-engine strategic bomber. The original proposal, which was meant to use the He 177A-7&#x27;s fuselage as the starting point, evolved into designing a dedicated, new and wider He 219-general pattern fuselage layout for the 277 from the Spring 1943 timeframe onward, which would be more capable of using a tricycle undercarriage then gaining favor with a few German aviation designers.

The main factor that seemingly required the lower-drag &quot;coupled&quot; powerplant format for the He 177A, the dive bomb attack mandated by the RLM (and which Ernst Heinkel had vehemently disagreed with from the late 1930s) was rescinded by Göring five months before approval of the &quot;He 277&#x27;s&quot; by the RLM in February 1943. Heinkel started work on the He 177B as a straightforward, separately four-engined development of the 177A under the B-series designation at least as early as the late summer of 1943, when official Heinkel documents began referring to the He 177B, evidenced from an August 1943-dated, Heinkel factory-created general arrangement &quot;Typenblatt&quot; drawing of the He 177 V101 being labeled with the &quot;8-177&quot; RLM designation for the entire line of &quot;Greif&quot; airframes, and &quot;B-5&quot; elsewhere in the drawing&#x27;s title block, as a fully RLM approved development of the original He 177 aircraft line, and not in any way directly related to the entirely separate He 277 advanced bomber project, which by the summer of 1943 was considered to be Heinkel&#x27;s &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; aviation contract contender. The first development of the original He 177A to fly with four &quot;individual&quot; engines – using a quartet of He 219-style annular radiators to cool its likely-unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants – was the second He 177B prototype, the He 177 V102, on December 20, 1943.

In total, there were four separate efforts, the movement toward which had been initiated by Ernst Heinkel as early as November 1938, to develop &quot;true four-engined versions&quot; of the A-series &quot;Greif&quot;: the unbuilt He 179 with four Jumkers Jumo 211s; the He 177B, which culminated in four prototype examples being built, with three getting airborne before the war&#x27;s end; the He 274, of which only two prototypes were started before the end of World War II and completed and flown in France after the war&#x27;s end; and the He 277, for which only a few airframe parts had been in the process of completion, with no completed prototypes at any time, before the project’s cancellation in May 1944.

==Design features==
The general arrangement &quot;Typenblatt&quot; drawings that Heinkel&#x27;s firm was developing for the He 277 by mid-1943 show an advanced design of heavy bomber, with a 133 square meter area (1,431.6 sq. ft.) &quot;shoulder mount&quot;, 40 meter (131 ft 3 in) span wing design, four separate BMW 801E powerplants of 1,471 kW (2,000 PS, 1,973 hp) output each at take-off, with each engine turning a propeller of up to four meters in diameter.

The fully retracting undercarriage considered for the design was to be either conventional or nosewheel landing gear, with main gear assemblies of twinned wheels on each unit, retracting into the inner engine nacelles (forward when combined with the nosewheel but rearwards for a conventional gear arrangement). Heinkel had designed a retractable tricycle undercarriage-equipped in late 1939 for the Heinkel He 280 jet fighter prototype, and followed that with the Heinkel He 219 night fighter.

The main crew accommodation of the He 277 consisted of a heavily glazed and &quot;greenhouse&quot;-framed clear view &quot;stepless&quot; cockpit, a common feature of many late-war German bomber airframes and new designs. Immediately aft of the heavily glazed nose, the cockpit glazing over the crew seating and pilot accommodation-enclosing upper section that was blended with the nose glazing&#x27;s contours, protruding above the 277&#x27;s forward dorsal fuselage decking level, with a rearward extension atop the fuselage that faired-in the forward upper dorsal turret&#x27;s forward surface, extending rearwards to just forward of the inner engine cowls. The fuselage outlines themselves were deep, and almost slab-sided in cross-section, with its general sideview profile lines being strongly reminiscent of the He 219. This similarity with the 219 even extended to the depictions of the He 277&#x27;s fuselage-mounted defensive armament emplacements as proposed by Heinkel, with one forward and two aft-facing &quot;steps&quot; along the slightly rounded dorsal and ventral surfaces of the fuselage, much like the smaller night fighter&#x27;s earliest prototypes had, for the 277&#x27;s manned aft dorsal and remote aft ventral turret defensive weapons mounts — the aft ventral emplacement being moved rearwards by roughly two meters, in comparison with the early He 219V-series prototypes, to accommodate the aft end of the He 277&#x27;s bomb bay. The twin tail empennage assembly of the He 219 night fighter was also a likely inspiration for the 277&#x27;s own similar unit, that added aerodynamic stability when compared to the 177A&#x27;s single vertical tail — proven to be true from the first flights of the He 177B-series&#x27; four-engined He 177 V102 twin-tailed prototype from late December 1943 onwards — and made mounting a powered traversable defensive tail turret easier. Provision was shown on the Heinkel &quot;Typenblatt&quot; general arrangement drawing for four underwing hardpoints, two per wing panel on either side outboard of the engines, potentially allowing external ordnance loads or drop tanks to extend the bomber&#x27;s capabilities or range.

A May 1943 Heinkel factory document showed possible offensive bombload configurations and flight consumable (fuel, etc.) weights for the He 277, two differing bomb bay sizes (interior dimensions of 1.5 x 7.5 meters for the tailwheel version, and 1.75 x 7.0 meters for the tricycle undercarriage version) were considered. The latter within a 1.90 meter wide fuselage. The lightest warload of six 500 kg (1,100 lb) SC 500 bombs for each bomb bay configuration, gave the tricycle-geared, 1.9 meter exterior width wider-fuselage version, considering a larger load (12,200 kg/26,895 lb) of fuel, a possible stated maximum range of , equalling the potential range capability of the earlier-designed Me 261, an indicator of what could have been achieved had the 277 been in full consideration from its beginnings for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; design competition.

=== Armament ===
As envisioned the defensive armament was in five turrets; two manned, and the other three remotely operated. A remotely operated &quot;Fernbedienbare Drehlafette&quot; (FDL) 151Z turret with twin 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon was in the &quot;chin&quot; position under the aircraft&#x27;s nose. Along the top of the fuselage were a remotely operated FDL 151Z in the forward dorsal and a manned &quot;Hydraulische Drehlafette&quot; (HDL) 151Z in the rear dorsal position; each turret with two MG 151/20 cannon. Underneath the rear fuselage, just to the rear of the bomb-bay was a remotely operated ventral turret with two more MG 151/20 cannon. The gunner for the turret would lay prone, facing rearwards in a starboard-side offset position with a slightly protruding ventral blister-like gondola for the gun sight. In the end of the tail was a manned &quot;Hecklafette&quot; (HL) 131V turret with four 13 mm MG 131 heavy machine guns. The &quot;Hecklafette&quot; four-gun turret was planned to be used on some of the other &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; airframes, Heinkel&#x27;s proposed developments of the He 177A airframe, and a projected &quot;C-version&quot; of the He 219 night fighter. This increasing demand for an advanced gun turret that had not even been produced by Borsig (the firm responsible for it), beyond a small number of test units and engineering mockups led to an alternative twin-cannon &quot;HL 151Z&quot; version with a single MG 151/20 cannon each side of the turret. Only a few ground test examples of the twin-cannon variant tail turret had been produced by March 1944. One of these twin-cannon experimental tail turrets was mounted on an He 177A airframe for testing. Some sideview line drawing depictions of purported &quot;He 277&quot; aircraft, usually in the same aviation history volumes that purveyed the erroneous &quot;He 177B/He 277&quot; storyline, also show what could be an early He 177A-7-based depiction of the later &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; competitor bearing the He 177A&#x27;s &quot;Cabin 3&quot; standard cockpit and a quartet of the He 219-derived &quot;Kraftei&quot; DB 603 inverted V12 engines actually used on the four He 177B-series prototypes (He 177 V101 through V104) for power, with the abandoned &quot;Bugstandlafette&quot; BL 131V quadmount remote turret as a &quot;chin turret&quot; in place of the FDL 151Z system in the Heinkel firm&#x27;s factory &quot;Typenblatt&quot; drawings — the BL 131V had been abandoned in 1943 as too heavy (reducing offensive bombload by a full tonne) and slowing the earlier He 177A airframe by some 30 km/h in top airspeed due to drag, making even the chance of its proposed existence on any He 277 design proposals unlikely.

==Competing bomber designs==
Throughout the time that the He 277 design was being worked on, Ernst Heinkel was facing competition from other heavy bomber designs under development, and other four-engined aircraft proposals that showed promise as heavy bombers: the Focke-Wulf Fw 300, and Ta 400, Junkers Ju 390, Messerschmitt Me 264, and Heinkel&#x27;s own He 274 four-engined, high-altitude development of the He 177.

The first of these designs that the He 277 was pitted against, mostly to determine the &quot;most producible&quot; bomber that could also be license-built, given Germany&#x27;s limited aircraft production capacity to arm the Luftwaffe with, and partially to determine the best long-range bomber design to fulfill the needs of the spring 1942-issued &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; program documents, the Messerschmitt Me 264 ended up being the first design to challenge the He 277&#x27;s chance for production. The Me 264 was a purpose-built long-range bomber, using a tricycle landing gear configuration from the start. The Me 264 prototypes were already flying their test programs with power of exactly the same choice that Heinkel had asked for on November 17, 1938, for the He 177 V3 and V4 prototypes: with four Junkers Jumo 211 engines as early as late December 1942 – a full year after Nazi Germany had declared war on the United States, five months after the Eighth Air Force had begun flying bomber missions against Nazi-occupied France, and two months before the RLM&#x27;s earliest-known mention of any recorded approval for the He 277 design itself — the later fitment of a quartet of the BMW 801 radials to each example of the trio of Me 264 prototypes also potentially challenged the availability of the same engine design that the He 277 was meant to use, had the Me 264 gone into production with them.

Development of the Me 264&#x27;s was stopped in May 1943 because of the need to use scarce strategic materials in its construction, and because of the better predicted performance of the Focke-Wulf Ta 400 and the He 277.

With the US involvement in the European theater commencing in mid-August 1942, the Luftwaffe now found that it had a serious need for a well-armed, long-range bomber, which could not be achieved with the 1,120 kW (1,500 hp) class engines it had. Such ongoing difficulties in developing high-output aviation powerplants of over 1,500 kW apiece, that could be used in combat with proven reliability — which excluded the DB 606 engines of the earlier He 177A variants, which themselves proved to be seriously troublesome from the start of the He 177A&#x27;s combat service in 1942 — meant that six engines of the under-1,500 kW (2,000 PS) power output levels would be needed on a strategic bomber design to fly from Europe, attack the US and safely return to base, with an effective bombload to be effective, and adequate defensive firepower. It was events on July 3, 1943, that seemed to cement this viewpoint in the RLM&#x27;s mind – no production decisions on the still-unfinalized He 277&#x27;s design had emerged by that date, and the continuing problems in Dessau with the high-output Junkers Jumo 222 engine had set back its development, making its use with the He 277, first proposed on that date, even more problematic. The Blohm &amp; Voss firm&#x27;s aviation division had already settled on six engines with success, as early as 1940, on the prototypes of the BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot; flying boat maritime patrol aircraft (a 46-meter wingspan aircraft). This emerging need for six engines for such an aircraft was also recognized by Messerschmitt AG, which fielded a paper project for a six-engined &quot;Me 264B&quot;, with a wingspan stretched to 47.5 meters (155 ft 10 in)), with two additional BMW 801 radial engines outboard of the existing four powerplants and the same &quot;Hecklafette&quot; four-gun tail turret as the He 277. Eventually, the Heinkel firm received an order on July 23, 1943 from the Reich Air Ministry&#x27;s technical department (&quot;Technischen Amt&quot;) — for Heinkel to design a set of wings for the 277&#x27;s unfinalized design that could accept four of the troubled Jumo 222 engines, alongside the still &quot;paper-only&quot; concept also being ordered to be designed and buildable with the desired six-engine format the RLM was now favoring for an &quot;Amerikabomber&quot;, intended to be upwards of a 170 square meter (1,830 sq. ft.) wing area of 45 meter (147 ft 7 in) span to possibly accommodate either four Jumo 222s or six BMW 801s.

In March 1943, Focke-Wulf came up with a six-engined version of their proposed Fw 300 bomber, originally powered with just four BMW 801E radials. Their more advanced Ta 400 design, first proposed in October 1943 with a tricycle landing gear setup and meant to be powered six of the same engines as the 277 was meant to use, was joined by the Ju 390, a Junkers six-engined development of their Junkers Ju 290 maritime patrol bomber, and also using six of the same BMW radials as the 277, with both the earlier four-engined A-8 variant of the Ju 290, and the Ju 390A-1 each meant to have a pair of the He 277&#x27;s &quot;Hecklafette&quot; quad-gun tail turrets, but with one each in the planned tail position and in a new nose-mount version.

By October 1943, Ernst Heinkel had compared the Messerschmitt and Junkers four-engined designs, and the six-engined BV 222, Ju 390 and Ta 400 designs to his own He 277 project, with the following conclusions:

Of these competing types mentioned by Dr. Heinkel — outside of the thirteen BV 222 six-engined maritime patrol flying boats actually built — only three of the Me 264 design, and a verified pair of the Ju 390 aircraft were ever built, solely as flyable prototypes, and none of these aircraft saw any action against the Allies.

The He 274, because of its own intended high-altitude role, was only a potential competitor with the He 277 for Heinkel&#x27;s own company engineering and production staff, and the He 274&#x27;s production had already been outsourced by the end of 1941 to the French &quot;Societe Anonyme des Usines Farman&quot;, or &quot;SAUF&quot; firm in Suresnes to partially allow Heinkel to work on other projects, like the He 277 and the more advanced Heinkel He 343 jet powered medium bomber design, both of which each had a few airframe components in the process of manufacture for prototype airframes, but with both designs never able to be completed as flyable aircraft.

==End of the project==
In April 1944, simultaneously with the four He 177B prototypes either flying (He 177 V101 to V103) or nearing completion (V104) at the &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; facility at Schwechat, the RLM ordered Heinkel to cease any further work on the He 277 project, and all components were also ordered to be scrapped, without any complete examples of the 277 ever having been completed by Heinkel, only three months before the &quot;Emergency Fighter Programme&quot; (&quot;Jägernotprogramm)&quot; took over all German military aircraft production priorities on July 3, 1944. Only the Heinkel He 162 &quot;Spatz&quot; lightweight jet fighter was allowed to progress into production by the RLM after that.

<doc id="455379" wikidata="Q428995" url="?curid=455379" title="Hellenistic period">
<text>In classical antiquity, the Hellenistic period covers the time in Greek history after Classical Greece, between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, which was followed by the ascendancy of the Roman Empire, as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the Roman conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year, which eliminated the last major Hellenistic kingdom. Its name stems from the Ancient Greek word &quot;Hellas&quot; (, &quot;Hellás&quot;), which was gradually recognized as the name for Greece, from which the modern historiographical term &quot;Hellenistic&quot; was derived. The term &quot;Hellenistic&quot; is to be distinguished from &quot;Hellenic&quot; in that the latter refers to Greece itself, while the former encompasses all the ancient territories of the period that had come under significant Greek influence, particularly the Hellenized Middle East, after the conquests of Alexander the Great.

After the Macedonian conquest of the Achaemenid Empire in 330 BC and its disintegration shortly thereafter in the Partition of Babylon and subsequent Wars of the Diadochi, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout West Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), Northeast Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in an influx of Greek colonists and the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms, a breadth spanning as far as modern-day India. These new Greek kingdoms were also influenced by regional indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where deemed beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the ancient Greek world with that of the Western Asian, Northeastern African, and Southwestern Asian worlds. The consequence of this mixture gave rise to a common Attic-based Greek dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the &quot;lingua franca&quot; throughout the ancient world.

During the Hellenistic period, Greek cultural influence reached its peak in the Mediterranean and beyond. Prosperity and progress in the arts, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science characterize the era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, translation efforts such as the Septuagint, and the philosophies of Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Pyrrhonism. In science, the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes are exemplary. Sculpture during this period was characterized by intense emotion and dynamic movement, as seen in sculptural works like the &quot;Dying Gaul&quot; and the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;. A form of Hellenistic architecture arose which especially emphasized the building of grand monuments and ornate decorations, as exemplified by structures such as the Pergamon Altar. The religious sphere of Greek religion expanded through syncretic facets to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele, and a syncretism between Hellenistic culture and Buddhism in Bactria and Northwest India.

Scholars and historians are divided as to which event signals the end of the Hellenistic era. There is a wide chronological range of proposed dates that have included the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by the expansionist Roman Republic in 146 BC following the Achaean War, the final defeat of the Ptolemaic Kingdom at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, the end of the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian in AD 138, and the move by the emperor Constantine the Great of the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople in AD 330. Though this scope of suggested dates demonstrates a range of academic opinion, a generally accepted date by most of scholarship has been that of 31/30 BC.

== Etymology ==

The word originated from Ancient Greek (&quot;Hellēnistḗs&quot;, &quot;one who uses the Greek language&quot;), from (&quot;Hellás&quot;, &quot;Greece&quot;); as if &quot;Hellenist&quot; + &quot;ic&quot;.

The idea of a Hellenistic period is a 19th-century concept, and did not exist in ancient Greece. Although words related in form or meaning, e.g. &quot;Hellenist&quot; (, &quot;Hellēnistēs&quot;), have been attested since ancient times, it has been attributed to the 19th-century German historian Johann Gustav Droysen, who in his classic work (&quot;History of Hellenism&quot;), coined the term &quot;Hellenistic&quot; to refer to and define the period when Greek culture spread in the non-Greek world after Alexander&#x27;s conquest. Following Droysen, &quot;Hellenistic&quot; and related terms, e.g. &quot;Hellenism&quot;, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; by Matthew Arnold, where Hellenism is used in contrast with Hebraism.

The major issue with the term Hellenistic lies in its convenience, as the spread of Greek culture was not the generalized phenomenon that the term implies. Some areas of the conquered world were more affected by Greek influences than others. The term Hellenistic also implies that the Greek populations were of majority in the areas in which they settled, but in many cases, the Greek settlers were actually the minority among the native populations. The Greek population and the native population did not always mix; the Greeks moved and brought their own culture, but interaction did not always occur.

== Sources ==
=== Literary works ===
While a few fragments exist, there are no complete surviving historical works that date to the hundred years following Alexander&#x27;s death. The works of the major Hellenistic historians Hieronymus of Cardia (who worked under Alexander, Antigonus I and other successors), Duris of Samos and Phylarchus, which were used by surviving sources, are all lost. The earliest and most credible surviving source for the Hellenistic period is Polybius of Megalopolis (c. 200–118), a statesman of the Achaean League until 168 BC when he was forced to go to Rome as a hostage. His &quot;Histories&quot; eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years 220 to 167 BC.

The most important source after Polybius is Diodorus Siculus who wrote his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; between 60 and 30 BC and reproduced some important earlier sources such as Hieronymus, but his account of the Hellenistic period breaks off after the battle of Ipsus (301 BC). Another important source, Plutarch&#x27;s () &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; although more preoccupied with issues of personal character and morality, outlines the history of important Hellenistic figures. Appian of Alexandria (late 1st century AD–before 165) wrote a history of the Roman Empire that includes information of some Hellenistic kingdoms.

Other sources include Justin&#x27;s (2nd century AD) epitome of Pompeius Trogus&#x27; &quot;Historiae Philipicae&quot; and a summary of Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Events after Alexander&quot;, by Photios I of Constantinople. Lesser supplementary sources include Curtius Rufus, Pausanias, Pliny, and the Byzantine encyclopedia the Suda. In the field of philosophy, Diogenes Laërtius&#x27; &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; is the main source; works such as Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot; also provide some further detail of philosophical schools in the Hellenistic period.

=== Inscriptions ===
Inscriptions on stone or metal were commonly erected throughout the Greek world for public display, a practice which originated well before the time of Alexander the Great, but saw substantial expansion during the Hellenistic Period. The majority of these inscriptions are located on the Greek mainland, the Greek islands, and western Asia Minor. While they become increasingly rare towards the eastern regions, they are not entirely absent there, and they are most notably featured in public buildings and sanctuaries. The content of these inscriptions is diverse, encompassing royal correspondence addressed to cities or individuals, municipal and legal edicts, decrees commemorating rulers, officials, and individuals for their contributions, as well as laws, treaties, religious rulings, and dedications. Despite challenges in their interpretation, inscriptions are often the only source available for understanding numerous events in Greek history.p:7-8

=== Papyri ===
Papyrus served as the predominant medium for handwritten documents across the Hellenistic world, though its production was confined to Egypt. Due to Egypt&#x27;s arid climate, papyrus manuscripts were almost exclusively preserved there as well. That being said, the different historical periods are not represented equally in the papyrological documents. Texts from the reign of Ptolemy I are notably scarce, while those from the reign of Ptolemy II are more frequently encountered, this is owing in part to the large quantities of papyri which were stuffed into human and animal mummies during his rule. Papyri have been classified into public and private documents, including literary texts, laws and regulations, official correspondence, petitions, records, and &quot;archives&quot; or collections of documents belonging to individuals of position and authority. Significant information about the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which might otherwise have been lost, has been preserved in papyrological documents. This is particularly noteworthy given the limited documentation available for their Seleucid counterparts.p:8-9

== Background ==


Ancient Greece had traditionally been a fractious collection of fiercely independent city-states. After the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), Greece had fallen under a Spartan hegemony, in which Sparta was pre-eminent but not all-powerful. Spartan hegemony was succeeded by a Theban hegemony after the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), but after the Battle of Mantinea (362 BC), all of Greece was so weakened that no one state could claim pre-eminence. It was against this backdrop that the ascendancy of Macedon began, under king Philip II. Macedon was located at the periphery of the Greek world, and although its royal family claimed Greek descent, the Macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the Greeks. However, Macedon controlled a large area and had a relatively strong centralized government, in comparison to most Greek states.

Philip II was a strong and expansionist king who took every opportunity to expand Macedonian territory. In 352 BC he annexed Thessaly and Magnesia. In 338 BC, Philip defeated a combined Theban and Athenian army at the Battle of Chaeronea after a decade of desultory conflict. In the aftermath, Philip formed the League of Corinth, effectively bringing the majority of Greece under his direct sway. He was elected &quot;Hegemon&quot; of the league, and a campaign against the Achaemenid Empire of Persia was planned. However in 336 BC, while this campaign was in its early stages, he was assassinated.
Succeeding his father, Alexander took over the Persian war himself. During a decade of campaigning, Alexander conquered the whole Persian Empire, overthrew the Persian king Darius III. The conquered lands included Asia Minor, Assyria, the Levant, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Media, Persia, and parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the steppes of central Asia. The years of constant campaigning had taken their toll, however, and Alexander died in 323 BC.

After his death, the huge territories Alexander had conquered became subject to a strong Greek influence (Hellenization) for the next two or three centuries, until the rise of Rome in the west, and of Parthia in the east. As the Greek and Levantine cultures mingled, the development of a hybrid Hellenistic culture began, and persisted even when isolated from the main centres of Greek culture (for instance, in the Greco-Bactrian kingdom).

It can be argued that some of the changes across the Macedonian Empire after Alexander&#x27;s conquests and during the rule of the Diadochi would have occurred without the influence of Greek rule. As mentioned by Peter Green, numerous factors of conquest have been merged under the term &quot;Hellenistic period&quot;. Specific areas conquered by Alexander&#x27;s invading army, including Egypt and areas of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia &quot;fell&quot; willingly to conquest and viewed Alexander as more of a liberator than a conqueror.

In addition, much of the area conquered would continue to be ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander&#x27;s generals and successors. Initially, the whole empire was divided among them; however, some territories were lost relatively quickly or only remained nominally under Macedonian rule. After 200 years, only much reduced and rather degenerate states remained, until the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt by Rome.

== The Diadochi ==

When Alexander the Great died (10 June 323 BC), he left behind a sprawling empire that was composed of many essentially autonomous territories called satrapies. Without a chosen successor, there were immediate disputes among his generals as to who should be king of Macedon. These generals became known as the Diadochi (, &quot;Diadokhoi&quot;, meaning &quot;Successors&quot;).

Meleager and the infantry supported the candidacy of Alexander&#x27;s half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus, while Perdiccas, the leading cavalry commander, supported waiting until the birth of Alexander&#x27;s child by Roxana. After the infantry stormed the palace of Babylon, a compromise was arranged – Arrhidaeus (as Philip III) should become king and should rule jointly with Roxana&#x27;s child, assuming that it was a boy (as it was, becoming Alexander IV). Perdiccas himself would become regent (&quot;epimeletes&quot;) of the empire, and Meleager his lieutenant. Soon, however, Perdiccas had Meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered and assumed full control. The generals who had supported Perdiccas were rewarded in the partition of Babylon by becoming satraps of the various parts of the empire, but Perdiccas&#x27; position was shaky because, as Arrian writes, &quot;everyone was suspicious of him, and he of them&quot;.

The first of the Diadochi wars broke out when Perdiccas planned to marry Alexander&#x27;s sister Cleopatra and began to question Antigonus I Monophthalmus&#x27; leadership in Asia Minor. Antigonus fled for Greece, and then, together with Antipater and Craterus (the satrap of Cilicia who had been in Greece fighting the Lamian war) invaded Anatolia. The rebels were supported by Lysimachus, the satrap of Thrace and Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Although Eumenes, satrap of Cappadocia, defeated the rebels in Asia Minor, Perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals Peithon, Seleucus, and Antigenes (possibly with Ptolemy&#x27;s aid) during his invasion of Egypt ( to 19 June, 320 BC). Ptolemy came to terms with Perdiccas&#x27;s murderers, making Peithon and Arrhidaeus regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with Antipater at the Treaty of Triparadisus. Antipater was made regent of the Empire, and the two kings were moved to Macedon. Antigonus remained in charge of Asia Minor, Ptolemy retained Egypt, Lysimachus retained Thrace and Seleucus I controlled Babylon.
The second Diadochi war began following the death of Antipater in 319 BC. Passing over his own son, Cassander, Antipater had declared Polyperchon his successor as Regent. Cassander rose in revolt against Polyperchon (who was joined by Eumenes) and was supported by Antigonus, Lysimachus and Ptolemy. In 317 BC, Cassander invaded Macedonia, attaining control of Macedon, sentencing Olympias to death and capturing the boy king Alexander IV, and his mother. In Asia, Eumenes was betrayed by his own men after years of campaign and was given up to Antigonus who had him executed.

The third war of the Diadochi broke out because of the growing power and ambition of Antigonus. He began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in Ecbatana, Persepolis and Susa, making off with 25,000 talents. Seleucus was forced to flee to Egypt and Antigonus was soon at war with Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Cassander. He then invaded Phoenicia, laid siege to Tyre, stormed Gaza and began building a fleet. Ptolemy invaded Syria and defeated Antigonus&#x27; son, Demetrius Poliorcetes, in the Battle of Gaza of 312 BC which allowed Seleucus to secure control of Babylonia, and the eastern satrapies. In 310 BC, Cassander had young King Alexander IV and his mother Roxana murdered, ending the Argead dynasty which had ruled Macedon for several centuries.

Antigonus then sent his son Demetrius to regain control of Greece. In 307 BC he took Athens, expelling Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassander&#x27;s governor, and proclaiming the city free again. Demetrius now turned his attention to Ptolemy, defeating his fleet at the Battle of Salamis and taking control of Cyprus. In the aftermath of this victory, Antigonus took the title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;) and bestowed it on his son Demetrius Poliorcetes, the rest of the Diadochi soon followed suit. Demetrius continued his campaigns by laying siege to Rhodes and conquering most of Greece in 302 BC, creating a league against Cassander&#x27;s Macedon.

The decisive engagement of the war came when Lysimachus invaded and overran much of western Anatolia, but was soon isolated by Antigonus and Demetrius near Ipsus in Phrygia. Seleucus arrived in time to save Lysimachus and utterly crushed Antigonus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC. Seleucus&#x27; war elephants proved decisive; Antigonus was killed, and Demetrius fled back to Greece to attempt to preserve the remnants of his rule, thereby recapturing a rebellious Athens. Meanwhile, Lysimachus took over Ionia, Seleucus took Cilicia, and Ptolemy captured Cyprus.

After Cassander&#x27;s death in , however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294 BC) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293–291 BC). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia Minor and wage war on Lysimachus&#x27; holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 BC and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia Minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BC at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus&#x27; European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (&quot;the thunderbolt&quot;), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279 BC—his head stuck on a spear—and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.

At this point the tripartite territorial division of the Hellenistic age was in place, with the main Hellenistic powers being Macedon under Demetrius&#x27;s son Antigonus II Gonatas, the Ptolemaic kingdom under Ptolemy&#x27;s son Ptolemy II and the Seleucid empire under Seleucus&#x27; son Antiochus I Soter.

== Southern Europe ==
=== Kingdom of Epirus ===

Epirus was a northwestern Greek kingdom in the western Balkans ruled by the Molossian Aeacidae dynasty. Epirus was an ally of Macedon during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander.

In 281 Pyrrhus (nicknamed &quot;the eagle&quot;, &quot;aetos&quot;) invaded southern Italy to aid the city state of Tarentum. Pyrrhus defeated the Romans in the Battle of Heraclea and at the Battle of Asculum. Though victorious, he was forced to retreat due to heavy losses, hence the term &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;. Pyrrhus then turned south and invaded Sicily but was unsuccessful and returned to Italy. After the Battle of Beneventum (275 BC) Pyrrhus lost all his Italian holdings and left for Epirus.

Pyrrhus then went to war with Macedonia in 275 BC, deposing Antigonus II Gonatas and briefly ruling over Macedonia and Thessaly until 272. Afterwards, he invaded southern Greece and was killed in battle against Argos in 272 BC. After the death of Pyrrhus, Epirus remained a minor power. In 233 BC the Aeacid royal family was deposed and a federal state was set up called the Epirote League. The league was conquered by Rome in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).

=== Kingdom of Macedon ===
Antigonus II, a student of Zeno of Citium, spent most of his rule defending Macedon against Epirus and cementing Macedonian power in Greece, first against the Athenians in the Chremonidean War, and then against the Achaean League of Aratus of Sicyon. Under the Antigonids, Macedonia was often short on funds, the Pangaeum mines were no longer as productive as under Philip II, the wealth from Alexander&#x27;s campaigns had been used up and the countryside pillaged by the Gallic invasion. A large number of the Macedonian population had also been resettled abroad by Alexander or had chosen to emigrate to the new eastern Greek cities. Up to two-thirds of the population emigrated, and the Macedonian army could only count on a levy of 25,000 men, a significantly smaller force than under Philip II.

Antigonus II ruled until his death in 239 BC. His son Demetrius II soon died in 229 BC, leaving a child (Philip V) as king, with the general Antigonus Doson as regent. Doson led Macedon to victory in the war against the Spartan king Cleomenes III, and occupied Sparta.

Philip V, who came to power when Doson died in 221 BC, was the last Macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite Greece and preserve its independence against the &quot;cloud rising in the west&quot;: the ever-increasing power of Rome. He was known as &quot;the darling of Hellas&quot;. Under his auspices the Peace of Naupactus (217 BC) brought the latest war between Macedon and the Greek leagues (the Social War of 220–217 BC) to an end, and at this time he controlled all of Greece except Athens, Rhodes and Pergamum.

In 215 BC Philip, with his eye on Illyria, formed an alliance with Rome&#x27;s enemy Hannibal of Carthage, which led to Roman alliances with the Achaean League, Rhodes and Pergamum. The First Macedonian War broke out in 212 BC, and ended inconclusively in 205 BC. Philip continued to wage war against Pergamum and Rhodes for control of the Aegean (204–200 BC) and ignored Roman demands for non-intervention in Greece by invading Attica. In 198 BC, during the Second Macedonian War Philip was decisively defeated at Cynoscephalae by the Roman proconsul Titus Quinctius Flamininus and Macedon lost all its territories in Greece proper. Southern Greece was now thoroughly brought into the Roman sphere of influence, though it retained nominal autonomy. The end of Antigonid Macedon came when Philip V&#x27;s son, Perseus, was defeated and captured by the Romans in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).

=== Rest of Greece ===
During the Hellenistic period, the importance of Greece proper within the Greek-speaking world declined sharply. The great centers of Hellenistic culture were Alexandria and Antioch, capitals of Ptolemaic Egypt and Seleucid Syria respectively. The conquests of Alexander greatly widened the horizons of the Greek world, making the endless conflicts between the cities that had marked the 5th and 4th centuries BC seem petty and unimportant. It led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new Greek empires in the east. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, and the many other new Hellenistic cities founded in Alexander&#x27;s wake, as far away as modern Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Independent city states were unable to compete with Hellenistic kingdoms and were usually forced to ally themselves to one of them for defense, giving honors to Hellenistic rulers in return for protection. One example is Athens, which had been decisively defeated by Antipater in the Lamian war (323–322 BC) and had its port in the Piraeus garrisoned by Macedonian troops who supported a conservative oligarchy. After Demetrius Poliorcetes captured Athens in 307 BC and restored the democracy, the Athenians honored him and his father Antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king. Athens later allied itself to Ptolemaic Egypt to throw off Macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the Ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city&#x27;s phyles in honour of Ptolemy for his aid against Macedon. In spite of the Ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, Athens and Sparta were defeated by Antigonus II during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC). Athens was then occupied by Macedonian troops, and run by Macedonian officials.

Sparta remained independent, but it was no longer the leading military power in the Peloponnese. The Spartan king Cleomenes III (235–222 BC) staged a military coup against the conservative ephors and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking Spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore Spartan power. Sparta&#x27;s bid for supremacy was crushed at the Battle of Sellasia (222 BC) by the Achaean league and Macedon, who restored the power of the ephors.

Other city states formed federated states in self-defense, such as the Aetolian League ( 370 BC), the Achaean League ( 280 BC), the Boeotian league, the &quot;Northern League&quot; (Byzantium, Chalcedon, Heraclea Pontica and Tium) and the &quot;Nesiotic League&quot; of the Cyclades. These federations involved a central government which controlled foreign policy and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed sympoliteia. In states such as the Achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-Achaeans. The Achean league was able to drive out the Macedonians from the Peloponnese and free Corinth, which duly joined the league.

One of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any Hellenistic kingdom was Rhodes. With a skilled navy to protect its trade fleets from pirates and an ideal strategic position covering the routes from the east into the Aegean, Rhodes prospered during the Hellenistic period. It became a center of culture and commerce, its coins were widely circulated and its philosophical schools became one of the best in the Mediterranean. After holding out for one year under siege by Demetrius Poliorcetes (305–304 BC), the Rhodians built the Colossus of Rhodes to commemorate their victory. They retained their independence by the maintenance of a powerful navy, by maintaining a carefully neutral posture and acting to preserve the balance of power between the major Hellenistic kingdoms.

Initially, Rhodes had very close ties with the Ptolemaic kingdom. Rhodes later became a Roman ally against the Seleucids, receiving some territory in Caria for their role in the Roman–Seleucid War (192–188 BC).

=== Balkans ===

The west Balkan coast was inhabited by various Illyrian tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the Dalmatae and of the Ardiaei, who often engaged in piracy under Queen Teuta (reigned 231–227 BC). Further inland was the Illyrian Paeonian Kingdom and the tribe of the Agrianes. Illyrians on the coast of the Adriatic were under the effects and influence of Hellenisation and some tribes adopted Greek, becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the Greek colonies in Illyria. Illyrians imported weapons and armor from the ancient Greeks (such as the Illyrian type helmet, originally a Greek type) and also adopted the ornamentation of ancient Macedon on their shields and their war belts (a single one has been found, dated 3rd century BC at modern Selcë e Poshtme, a part of Macedon at the time under Philip V of Macedon).

The Odrysian Kingdom was a union of Thracian tribes under the kings of the powerful Odrysian tribe. Various parts of Thrace were under Macedonian rule under Philip II of Macedon, Alexander the Great, Lysimachus, Ptolemy II, and Philip V but were also often ruled by their own kings. The Thracians and Agrianes were widely used by Alexander as peltasts and light cavalry, forming about one-fifth of his army. The Diadochi also used Thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists. The Odrysians used Greek as the language of administration and of the nobility. The nobility also adopted Greek fashions in dress, ornament, and military equipment, spreading it to the other tribes. Thracian kings were among the first to be Hellenized.

After 278 BC the Odrysians had a strong competitor in the Celtic Kingdom of Tylis ruled by the kings Comontorius and Cavarus, but in 212 BC they conquered their enemies and destroyed their capital.

=== Western Mediterranean ===
Southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and south-eastern Sicily had been colonized by the Greeks during the 8th century BC. In 4th-century BC Sicily the leading Greek city and hegemon was Syracuse. During the Hellenistic period the leading figure in Sicily was Agathocles of Syracuse (361–289 BC) who seized the city with an army of mercenaries in 317 BC. Agathocles extended his power throughout most of the Greek cities in Sicily, fought a long war with the Carthaginians, at one point invading Tunisia in 310 BC and defeating a Carthaginian army there. This was the first time a European force had invaded the region. After this war he controlled most of south-east Sicily and had himself proclaimed king, in imitation of the Hellenistic monarchs of the east. Agathocles then invaded Italy () in defense of Tarentum against the Bruttians and Romans, but was unsuccessful.
Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul were mostly limited to the Mediterranean coast of Provence, France. The first Greek colony in the region was Massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of Mediterranean by the 4th century BC with 6,000 inhabitants. Massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal Greek cities like Nice and Agde. The coins minted in Massalia have been found in all parts of Liguro-Celtic Gaul. Celtic coinage was influenced by Greek designs, and Greek letters can be found on various Celtic coins, especially those of Southern France. Traders from Massalia ventured inland deep into France on the Rivers Durance and Rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into Gaul, and to Switzerland and Burgundy. The Hellenistic period saw the Greek alphabet spread into southern Gaul from Massalia (3rd and 2nd centuries BC) and according to Strabo, Massalia was also a center of education, where Celts went to learn Greek. A staunch ally of Rome, Massalia retained its independence until it sided with Pompey in 49 BC and was then taken by Caesar&#x27;s forces.

The city of Emporion (modern Empúries), originally founded by Archaic-period settlers from Phocaea and Massalia in the 6th century BC near the village of Sant Martí d&#x27;Empúries (located on an offshore island that forms part of L&#x27;Escala, Catalonia, Spain), was reestablished in the 5th century BC with a new city (&quot;neapolis&quot;) on the Iberian mainland. Emporion contained a mixed population of Greek colonists and Iberian natives, and although Livy and Strabo assert that they lived in different quarters, these two groups were eventually integrated. The city became a dominant trading hub and center of Hellenistic civilization in Iberia, eventually siding with the Roman Republic against the Carthaginian Empire during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC). However, Emporion lost its political independence around 195 BC with the establishment of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior and by the 1st century BC had become fully Romanized in culture.

== Hellenistic Near East ==

The Hellenistic states of Asia and Egypt were run by an occupying imperial elite of Greco-Macedonian administrators and governors propped up by a standing army of mercenaries and a small core of Greco-Macedonian settlers. Promotion of immigration from Greece was important in the establishment of this system. Hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution. Macedonian and Hellenistic monarchs were expected to lead their armies on the field, along with a group of privileged aristocratic companions or friends (&quot;hetairoi&quot;, &quot;philoi&quot;) which dined and drank with the king and acted as his advisory council. The monarch was also expected to serve as a charitable patron of the people; this public philanthropy could mean building projects and handing out gifts but also promotion of Greek culture and religion.

=== Ptolemaic Kingdom ===

Ptolemy, a somatophylax, one of the seven bodyguards who served as Alexander the Great&#x27;s generals and deputies, was appointed satrap of Egypt after Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC. In 305 BC, he declared himself King Ptolemy I, later known as &quot;Soter&quot; (saviour) for his role in helping the Rhodians during the siege of Rhodes. Ptolemy built new cities such as Ptolemais Hermiou in upper Egypt and settled his veterans throughout the country, especially in the region of the Faiyum. Alexandria, a major center of Greek culture and trade, became his capital city. As Egypt&#x27;s first port city, it became the main grain exporter in the Mediterranean.

The Egyptians begrudgingly accepted the Ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent Egypt, though the kingdom went through several native revolts. Ptolemy I began to order monetary contributions from the people and, as a result, rewarded cities with high contributions with royal benefaction. This often resulted in the formation of a royal cult within the city. Reservations about this activity slowly dissipated as this worship of mortals was justified by the precedent of the worshipping of Greek heroes. The Ptolemies took on the traditions of the Egyptian Pharaohs, such as marrying their siblings (Ptolemy II was the first to adopt this custom), having themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participating in Egyptian religious life. The Ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the Ptolemies as gods, and temples to the Ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom. Ptolemy I even created a new god, Serapis, who was a combination of two Egyptian gods: Apis and Osiris, with attributes of Greek gods. Ptolemaic administration was, like the ancient Egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible through tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes, and so forth. A whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks, and overseers made this possible. The Egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy. External possessions such as Cyprus and Cyrene were run by &quot;strategoi&quot;, military commanders appointed by the crown.

Under Ptolemy II, Callimachus, Apollonius of Rhodes, Theocritus, and a host of other poets including the Alexandrian Pleiad made the city a center of Hellenistic literature. Ptolemy himself was eager to patronise the library, scientific research and individual scholars who lived on the grounds of the library. He and his successors also fought a series of wars with the Seleucids, known as the Syrian wars, over the region of Coele-Syria. Ptolemy IV won the great battle of Raphia (217 BC) against the Seleucids, using native Egyptians trained as phalangites. However these Egyptian soldiers revolted, eventually setting up a native breakaway Egyptian state in the Thebaid between 205 and 186/185 BC, severely weakening the Ptolemaic state.

Ptolemy&#x27;s family ruled Egypt until the Roman conquest of 30 BC. All the male rulers of the dynasty took the name Ptolemy. Ptolemaic queens, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called Cleopatra, Arsinoe, or Berenice. The most famous member of the line was the last queen, Cleopatra VII, known for her role in the Roman political battles between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and later between Octavian and Mark Antony. Her suicide at the conquest by Rome marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Egypt, though Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods until the Muslim conquest.

=== Seleucid Empire ===
Following division of Alexander&#x27;s empire, Seleucus I Nicator received Babylonia. From there, he created a new empire which expanded to include much of Alexander&#x27;s near eastern territories. At the height of its power, it included central Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia, today&#x27;s Turkmenistan, Pamir, and parts of Pakistan. It included a diverse population estimated at fifty to sixty million people.
Under Antiochus I ( – 261 BC), however, the unwieldy empire was already beginning to shed territories. Pergamum broke away under Eumenes I who defeated a Seleucid army sent against him. The kingdoms of Cappadocia, Bithynia and Pontus were all practically independent by this time as well. Like the Ptolemies, Antiochus I established a dynastic religious cult, deifying his father Seleucus I. Seleucus, officially said to be descended from Apollo, had his own priests and monthly sacrifices. The erosion of the empire continued under Seleucus II, who was forced to fight a civil war (239–236 BC) against his brother Antiochus Hierax and was unable to keep Bactria, Sogdiana and Parthia from breaking away. Hierax carved off most of Seleucid Anatolia for himself, but was defeated, along with his Galatian allies, by Attalus I of Pergamon who now also claimed kingship.

The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (&quot;choria&quot;), military colonies (&quot;katoikiai&quot;) and Greek villages (&quot;komai&quot;) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This &#x27;Greco-Macedonian&#x27; population (which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men (out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000) during the reign of Antiochus III. The rest of the army was made up of native troops.
Antiochus III (&quot;the Great&quot;) conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of Seleucus I. After being defeated by Ptolemy IV&#x27;s forces at Raphia (217 BC), Antiochus III led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces (212–205 BC) including Bactria, Parthia, Ariana, Sogdiana, Gedrosia and Drangiana. He was successful, bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers. After the death of Ptolemy IV (204 BC), Antiochus took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to conquer Coele-Syria in the fifth Syrian war (202–195 BC). He then began expanding his influence into Pergamene territory in Asia and crossed into Europe, fortifying Lysimachia on the Hellespont, but his expansion into Anatolia and Greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Magnesia (190 BC). In the Treaty of Apamea which ended the war, Antiochus lost all of his territories in Anatolia west of the Taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents.

Much of the eastern part of the empire was then conquered by the Parthians under Mithridates I of Parthia in the mid-2nd century BC, yet the Seleucid kings continued to rule a rump state from Syria until the invasion by the Armenian king Tigranes the Great and their ultimate overthrow by the Roman general Pompey.

=== Attalid Pergamum ===
After the death of Lysimachus, one of his officers, Philetaerus, took control of the city of Pergamum in 282 BC along with Lysimachus&#x27; war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to Seleucus I while remaining de facto independent. His descendant, Attalus I, defeated the invading Galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king. Attalus I (241–197 BC), was a staunch ally of Rome against Philip V of Macedon during the first and second Macedonian Wars. For his support against the Seleucids in 190 BC, Eumenes II was rewarded with all the former Seleucid domains in Asia Minor. Eumenes II turned Pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the Library of Pergamum which was said to be second only to the Library of Alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to Plutarch. It included a reading room and a collection of paintings. Eumenes II also constructed the Pergamum Altar with friezes depicting the Gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city. Pergamum was also a center of parchment (&quot;charta pergamena&quot;) production. The Attalids ruled Pergamon until Attalus III bequeathed the Kingdom of Pergamon to the Roman Republic in 133 BC to avoid a likely succession crisis.

=== Galatia ===

The Celts who settled in Galatia came through Thrace under the leadership of Leotarios and Leonnorios . They were defeated by Seleucus I in the &#x27;battle of the Elephants&#x27;, but were still able to establish a Celtic territory in central Anatolia. The Galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states. They continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as Bithynia and Pergamon, plundering and extracting tribute. This came to an end when they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince Antiochus Hierax who tried to defeat Attalus, the ruler of Pergamon (241–197 BC). Attalus severely defeated the Gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to Galatia. The theme of the &quot;Dying Gaul&quot; (a famous statue displayed in Pergamon) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the Greeks over a noble enemy. In the early 2nd century BC, the Galatians became allies of Antiochus the Great, the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over Asia Minor. In 189 BC, Rome sent Gnaeus Manlius Vulso on an expedition against the Galatians. Galatia was henceforth dominated by Rome through regional rulers from 189 BC onward.

After their defeats by Pergamon and Rome the Galatians slowly became Hellenized and they were called &quot;Gallo-Graeci&quot; by the historian Justin as well as (&quot;Hellēnogalátai&quot;) by Diodorus Siculus in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; v.32.5, who wrote that they were &quot;called Helleno-Galatians because of their connection with the Greeks.&quot;

=== Bithynia ===
The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander&#x27;s conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (&quot;basileus&quot;) in 297 BC. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (), as well as those of his successors, the Kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman Republic (74 BC).

=== Nabatean Kingdom ===
The Nabatean Kingdom was an Arab state located between the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula. Its capital was the city of Petra, an important trading city on the incense route. The Nabateans resisted the attacks of Antigonus and were allies of the Hasmoneans in their struggle against the Seleucids, but later fought against Herod the Great. The hellenization of the Nabateans occurred relatively late in comparison to the surrounding regions. Nabatean material culture does not show any Greek influence until the reign of Aretas III Philhellene in the 1st century BC. Aretas captured Damascus and built the Petra pool complex and gardens in the Hellenistic style. Though the Nabateans originally worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form such as stone blocks or pillars, during the Hellenistic period they began to identify their gods with Greek gods and depict them in figurative forms influenced by Greek sculpture. Nabatean art shows Greek influences, and paintings have been found depicting Dionysian scenes. They also slowly adopted Greek as a language of commerce along with Aramaic and Arabic.

=== Cappadocia ===

Cappadocia, a mountainous region situated between Pontus and the Taurus mountains, was ruled by a Persian dynasty. Ariarathes I (332–322 BC) was the satrap of Cappadocia under the Persians and after the conquests of Alexander he retained his post. After Alexander&#x27;s death he was defeated by Eumenes and crucified in 322 BC, but his son, Ariarathes II managed to regain the throne and maintain his autonomy against the warring Diadochi.

In 255 BC, Ariarathes III took the title of king and married Stratonice, a daughter of Antiochus II, remaining an ally of the Seleucid kingdom. Under Ariarathes IV, Cappadocia came into relations with Rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of Antiochus the Great, then as an ally against Perseus of Macedon and finally in a war against the Seleucids. Ariarathes V also waged war with Rome against Aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of Pergamon, and their forces were annihilated in 130 BC. This defeat allowed Pontus to invade and conquer the kingdom.

=== Armenia ===

Orontid Armenia formally passed to the empire of Alexander the Great following his conquest of Persia. Alexander appointed an Orontid named Mithranes to govern Armenia. Armenia later became a vassal state of the Seleucid Empire, but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy, retaining its native rulers. Towards the end 212 BC the country was divided into two kingdoms, Greater Armenia and Armenia Sophene, including Commagene or Armenia Minor. The kingdoms became so independent from Seleucid control that Antiochus III the Great waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers.

After the Seleucid defeat at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, the kings of Sophene and Greater Armenia revolted and declared their independence, with Artaxias becoming the first king of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia in 188 BC. During the reign of the Artaxiads, Armenia went through a period of hellenization. Numismatic evidence shows Greek artistic styles and the use of the Greek language. Some coins describe the Armenian kings as &quot;Philhellenes&quot;. During the reign of Tigranes the Great (95–55 BC), the kingdom of Armenia reached its greatest extent, containing many Greek cities, including the entire Syrian tetrapolis. Cleopatra, the wife of Tigranes the Great, invited Greeks such as the rhetor Amphicrates and the historian Metrodorus of Scepsis to the Armenian court, and—according to Plutarch—when the Roman general Lucullus seized the Armenian capital, Tigranocerta, he found a troupe of Greek actors who had arrived to perform plays for Tigranes. Tigranes&#x27; successor Artavasdes II even composed Greek tragedies himself.

=== Parthia ===

Parthia was a north-eastern Iranian satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire which later passed on to Alexander&#x27;s empire. Under the Seleucids, Parthia was governed by various Greek satraps such as Nicanor and Philip. In 247 BC, following the death of Antiochus II Theos, Andragoras, the Seleucid governor of Parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting coins showing himself wearing a royal diadem and claiming kingship. He ruled until 238 BC when Arsaces, the leader of the Parni tribe conquered Parthia, killing Andragoras and inaugurating the Arsacid dynasty. Antiochus III recaptured Arsacid controlled territory in 209 BC from Arsaces II. Arsaces II sued for peace and became a vassal of the Seleucids. It was not until the reign of Phraates I (), that the Arsacids would again begin to assert their independence.

During the reign of Mithridates I of Parthia, Arsacid control expanded to include Herat (in 167 BC), Babylonia (in 144 BC), Media (in 141 BC), Persia (in 139 BC), and large parts of Syria (in the 110s BC). The Seleucid–Parthian wars continued as the Seleucids invaded Mesopotamia under Antiochus VII Sidetes (reigned 138–129 BC), but he was eventually killed by a Parthian counterattack. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, the Parthians fought frequently against neighbouring Rome in the Roman–Parthian Wars (66 BC – AD 217). Abundant traces of Hellenism continued under the Parthian empire. The Parthians used Greek as well as their own Parthian language (though lesser than Greek) as languages of administration and also used Greek drachmas as coinage. They enjoyed Greek theater, and Greek art influenced Parthian art. The Parthians continued worshipping Greek gods syncretized together with Iranian deities. Their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of Hellenistic kings and often used Hellenistic royal epithets.

The Hellenistic influence in Iran was significant in terms of scope, but not depth and durability—unlike the Near East, the Iranian–Zoroastrian ideas and ideals remained the main source of inspiration in mainland Iran, and was soon revived in late Parthian and Sasanian periods.

=== Judea ===

During the Hellenistic period, Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the Syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic Judaism, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koiné Greek. The reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the Alexandrian Jews had lost the ability to speak Hebrew and Aramaic.

Between 301 and 219 BC the Ptolemies ruled Judea in relative peace, and Jews often found themselves working in the Ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a Hellenized Jewish elite class (e.g. the Tobiads). The wars of Antiochus III brought the region into the Seleucid empire; Jerusalem fell to his control in 198 BC and the Temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute. Antiochus IV Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem and looted the Temple in 169 BC after disturbances in Judea during his abortive invasion of Egypt. Antiochus then banned key Jewish religious rites and traditions in Judea. He may have been attempting to Hellenize the region and unify his empire and the Jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence. Whatever the case, tensions between pro- and anti-Seleucid Jewish factions led to the 174–135 BC Maccabean Revolt of Judas Maccabeus (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of Hanukkah).

Modern interpretations see this period as a civil war between Hellenized and orthodox forms of Judaism. Out of this revolt was formed an independent Jewish kingdom known as the Hasmonean dynasty, which lasted from 165 BC to 63 BC. The Hasmonean dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war, which coincided with civil wars in Rome. The last Hasmonean ruler, Antigonus II Mattathias, was captured by Herod and executed in 37 BC. In spite of originally being a revolt against Greek overlordship, the Hasmonean kingdom and also the Herodian kingdom which followed gradually became more and more hellenized. From 37 BC to 4 BC, Herod the Great ruled as a Jewish-Roman client king appointed by the Roman Senate. He considerably enlarged the Temple (see Herod&#x27;s Temple), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. The style of the enlarged temple and other Herodian architecture shows significant Hellenistic architectural influence. His son, Herod Archelaus, ruled from 4 BC to AD 7 when he was deposed for the formation of Roman Judea.

=== Kingdom of Pontus ===
The Kingdom of Pontus was a Hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the Black Sea. It was founded by Mithridates I in 291 BC and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63 BC. Despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the Persian Achaemenid Empire it became hellenized due to the influence of the Greek cities on the Black Sea and its neighboring kingdoms. Pontic culture was a mix of Greek and Iranian elements; the most hellenized parts of the kingdom were on the coast, populated by Greek colonies such as Trapezus and Sinope, the latter of which became the capital of the kingdom. Epigraphic evidence also shows extensive Hellenistic influence in the interior. During the reign of Mithridates II, Pontus was allied with the Seleucids through dynastic marriages. By the time of Mithridates VI Eupator, Greek was the official language of the kingdom, though Anatolian languages continued to be spoken.

The kingdom grew to its largest extent under Mithridates VI, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Lesser Armenia, the Bosporan Kingdom, the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos and, for a brief time, the Roman province of Asia. Mithridates, himself of mixed Persian and Greek ancestry, presented himself as the protector of the Greeks against the &#x27;barbarians&#x27; of Rome styling himself as &quot;King Mithridates Eupator Dionysus&quot; and as the &quot;great liberator&quot;. Mithridates also depicted himself with the &quot;anastole&quot; hairstyle of Alexander and used the symbolism of Herakles, from whom the Macedonian kings claimed descent. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province of Bithynia, while Pontus&#x27; eastern half survived as a client kingdom.

== Other realms ==
=== Greco-Bactrians ===

The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255 and 246 BC, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In , the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III the Great. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus&#x27;s son, thus legitimizing the Greco-Bactrian dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

According to Strabo, the Greco-Bactrians seem to have had contacts with Han China through the Silk Road trade routes (Strabo, XI.11.1). There is evidence of technology exchange between Bactria and China around this time in the form of metal alloys such as Copper-nickel, which was then unknown to the West. An interesting facet of this cultural exchange was the Ferghana horse, renowned for its strength and endurance. These horses were highly valued and played a crucial role in military and trade activities. The Greco-Bactrians likely facilitated their exchange along the Silk Road, significantly enhancing their cultural and economic influence across Central Asia. The demand for these horses even reached the Han Dynasty in China, underscoring their importance and the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations. Indian sources also maintain religious contact between Buddhist monks and the Greeks, and some Greco-Bactrians did convert to Buddhism. Demetrius, son and successor of Euthydemus, invaded north-western India around 180 BC, after the destruction of the Mauryan Empire there; the Mauryans were probably allies of the Bactrians (and Seleucids). The exact justification for the invasion remains unclear, but after 180 BC, the Greeks ruled over parts of northwestern India. This period also marks the beginning of the obfuscation of Greco-Bactrian history. Demetrius possibly died in about 180 BC; numismatic evidence suggests the existence of several other kings shortly thereafter. It is probable that at this point the Greco-Bactrian kingdom split into several semi-independent regions for some years, often warring amongst themselves. King Heliocles was the last Greek to clearly rule Bactria, his power collapsing in the face of central Asian tribal invasions (Scythian and Yuezhi), by about 130 BC. However, Greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in Bactria after the fall of the kingdom, having a hellenising effect on the tribes which had displaced Greek rule. The Kushan Empire which followed continued to use Greek on their coinage and Greeks continued being influential in the empire.

=== Indo-Greek kingdoms ===


The separation of the Indo-Greek kingdom from the Greco-Bactrian kingdom resulted in an even more isolated position, and thus the details of the Indo-Greek kingdom are even more obscure than for Bactria. Many supposed kings in India are known only because of coins bearing their name. After the death of the Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius, civil wars between Bactrian kings in India allowed Apollodotus I (from ) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I. 

In about 155 or 165 BC, a king named Menander rose to power. Menander was the most successful of the Indo-Greek kings and he seems to have been a great patron of Buddhism. He probably became a Buddhist and is remembered in some Buddhist texts as &#x27;Milinda&#x27;. He also expanded the kingdom further east into Punjab, though these conquests were rather ephemeral. After the death of Menander (), the Kingdom appears to have fragmented, with several &#x27;kings&#x27; attested contemporaneously in different regions. This inevitably weakened the Greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively. Around 70 BC, the western regions of Arachosia and Paropamisadae were lost to tribal invasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the Bactrian kingdom. The resulting Indo-Scythian kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining Indo-Greek kingdom towards the east. The Indo-Greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western Punjab until about AD 10, at which time it was finally ended by the Indo-Scythians. Strato III was the last of the dynasty of Diodotus was the last of the line of Diodotus and independent Hellenistic king to rule at his death in 10 AD.

After conquering the Indo-Greeks, the Kushan empire took over Greco-Buddhism, the Greek language, Greek script, Greek coinage and artistic styles. Greeks continued being an important part of the cultural world of India for generations. The depictions of the Buddha appear to have been influenced by Greek culture: Buddha representations in the Ghandara period often showed Buddha under the protection of Herakles. Several references in Indian literature praise the knowledge of the Yavanas or the Greeks. The Mahabharata compliments them as &quot;the all-knowing Yavanas&quot; (&quot;sarvajñā yavanā&quot;); e.g., &quot;The Yavanas, O king, are all-knowing; the Suras are particularly so. The mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy&quot;, such as flying machines that are generally called vimanas. The &quot;Brihat-Samhita&quot; of the mathematician Varahamihira says: &quot;The Greeks, though impure, must be honored since they were trained in sciences and therein, excelled others...&quot;.

== Rise of Rome ==

Widespread Roman interference in the Greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendancy of the Roman Republic. This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic. Shortly afterward, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the Carthaginians in the First Punic War. The result was the complete conquest of Sicily, including its previously powerful Greek cities, by the Romans.

After the Second Punic War, the Romans looked to re-assert their influence in the Balkans, and to curb the expansion of Philip V of Macedon. A pretext for war was provided by Philip&#x27;s refusal to end his war with Attalid Pergamum and Rhodes, both Roman allies. The Romans, also allied with the Aetolian League of Greek city-states (which resented Philip&#x27;s power), thus declared war on Macedon in 200 BC, starting the Second Macedonian War. This ended with a decisive Roman victory at the Battle of Cynoscephalae (197 BC). Like most Roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant &#x27;Peace of Flaminius&#x27; was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, Philip&#x27;s fleet was surrendered to Rome, and Macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern Greece, and land in Thrace and Asia Minor. The result was the end of Macedon as a major power in the Mediterranean.

In less than twenty years, Rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over Greece. This was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the Macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of Rome, though Rome was quick to exploit the situation. In another twenty years, the Macedonian kingdom was no more. Seeking to re-assert Macedonian power and Greek independence, Philip V&#x27;s son Perseus incurred the wrath of the Romans, resulting in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Victorious, the Romans abolished the Macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics until it was formally annexed as a Roman province after yet another rebellion under Andriscus. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans&#x27; side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground. In 146 BC, the Greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a Roman protectorate. Roman taxes were imposed, except in Athens and Sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by Rome&#x27;s local allies.

The Attalid dynasty of Pergamum lasted little longer; a Roman ally until the end, its final king Attalus III died in 133 BC without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed Pergamum to the Roman Republic. The final Greek resistance came in 88 BC, when King Mithridates of Pontus rebelled against Rome, captured Roman held Anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 Romans and Roman allies across Asia Minor. Many Greek cities, including Athens, overthrew their Roman puppet rulers and joined him in the Mithridatic wars. When he was driven out of Greece by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla, the latter laid siege to Athens and razed the city. Mithridates was finally defeated by Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey the Great) in 65 BC. Further ruin was brought to Greece by the Roman civil wars, which were partly fought in Greece. Finally, in 27 BC, Augustus directly annexed Greece to the new Roman Empire as the province of Achaea. The struggles with Rome had left Greece depopulated and demoralised. Nevertheless, Roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as Athens, Corinth, Thessaloniki and Patras soon recovered their prosperity.

Eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Seleucid Empire caused the Roman proconsul Pompey the Great to abolish the Seleucid rump state, absorbing much of Syria into the Roman Republic. Famously, the end of Ptolemaic Egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the Roman triumvirs Mark Anthony and Augustus Caesar. After the defeat of Anthony and his lover, the last Ptolemaic monarch, Cleopatra VII, at the Battle of Actium, Augustus invaded Egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom. He thereby completed the destruction of the Hellenistic kingdoms and transformed the Roman Republic into a monarchy, ending (in hindsight) the Hellenistic era.

== Hellenistic culture ==
=== Spread ===
Greek culture was at its height of world influence in the Hellenistic period. Hellenism or at least Philhellenism reached most regions on the frontiers of the Hellenistic kingdoms. Though some of these regions were not ruled by Greeks or even Greek speaking elites, Hellenistic influence can be seen in the historical record and material culture of these regions. Other regions had established contact with Greek colonies before this period, and simply saw a continued process of Hellenization and intermixing.

The spread of Greek culture and language throughout the Near East and Asia owed much to the development of newly founded cities and deliberate colonization policies by the successor states, which in turn was necessary for maintaining their military forces. Settlements such as Ai-Khanoum, on trade routes, allowed Greek culture to mix and spread. The language of Philip II&#x27;s and Alexander&#x27;s court and army (which was made up of various Greek and non-Greek speaking peoples) was a version of Attic Greek, and over time this language developed into Koine, the lingua franca of the successor states. The spread of Greek influence and language is also shown through ancient Greek coinage. Portraits became more realistic, and the obverse of the coin was often used to display a propagandistic image, commemorating an event or displaying the image of a favored god. The use of Greek-style portraits and Greek language continued under the Roman, Parthian, and Kushan empires, even as the use of Greek was in decline.

=== Institutions ===
In some fields Hellenistic culture thrived, particularly in its preservation of the past. The states of the Hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories. The preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature (including the works of the three great classical tragedians, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides) are due to the efforts of the Hellenistic Greeks. The Mouseion and Library of Alexandria were the center of this conservationist activity. With the support of royal stipends, Alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified, and critiqued every book they could find. Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied at Alexandria and conducted research there. They were scholar poets, writing not only poetry but treatises on Homer and other archaic and classical Greek literature.

Athens retained its position as the most prestigious seat of higher education, especially in the domains of philosophy and rhetoric, with considerable libraries and philosophical schools. Alexandria had the monumental Mouseion (a research center) and Library of Alexandria, with a estimated collection of 500,000 or more volumes. The city of Pergamon also had a large library and became a major center of book production. The island of Rhodes had a library and also boasted a famous finishing school for politics and diplomacy. Libraries were also present in Antioch, Pella, and Kos. Cicero was educated in Athens and Mark Antony in Rhodes. Antioch was founded as a metropolis and center of Greek learning which retained its status into the era of Christianity. Seleucia replaced Babylon as the metropolis of the lower Tigris.

The identification of local gods with similar Greek deities, a practice termed &quot;, stimulated the building of Greek-style temples, and Greek culture in the cities meant that buildings such as gymnasia and theaters became common. Many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or satrap, and often had Greek-style institutions. Greek dedications, statues, architecture, and inscriptions have all been found. However, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new Greco-Macedonian or otherwise Hellenized elite. An example that shows the spread of Greek theater is Plutarch&#x27;s story of the death of Crassus, in which his head was taken to the Parthian court and used as a prop in a performance of The Bacchae. Theaters have also been found: for example, in Ai-Khanoum on the edge of Bactria, the theater has 35 rows – larger than the theater in Babylon.

=== Hellenization and acculturation ===

The concept of Hellenization, meaning the adoption of Greek culture in non-Greek regions, has long been controversial. Undoubtedly Greek influence did spread through the Hellenistic realms, but to what extent, and whether this was a deliberate policy or mere cultural diffusion, have been hotly debated.

It seems likely that Alexander himself pursued policies which led to Hellenization, such as the foundations of new cities and Greek colonies. While it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread Greek culture (or as Arrian says, &quot;to civilise the natives&quot;), it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire. Cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and Macedonian power in a newly conquered region. Alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed Greco-Persian elite class as shown by the Susa weddings and his adoption of some forms of Persian dress and court culture. He also brought Persian and other non-Greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the companion cavalry. Again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire than to any idealized attempt to bringing Greek culture to the &#x27;barbarians&#x27;. This approach was bitterly resented by the Macedonians and discarded by most of the Diadochi after Alexander&#x27;s death. These policies can also be interpreted as the result of Alexander&#x27;s possible during his later years.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, the influx of Greek colonists into the new realms continued to spread Greek culture into Asia. The founding of new cities and military colonies continued to be a major part of the Successors&#x27; struggle for control of any particular region, and these continued to be centers of cultural diffusion. The spread of Greek culture under the Successors seems mostly to have occurred with the spreading of Greeks themselves, rather than as an active policy.

Throughout the Hellenistic world, these Greco-Macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native &quot;barbarians&quot; and excluded most non-Greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life. Most of the native population was not Hellenized, had little access to Greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their Hellenic overlords. Gymnasiums and their Greek education, for example, were for Greeks only. Greek cities and colonies may have exported Greek art and architecture as far as the Indus, but these were mostly enclaves of Greek culture for the transplanted Greek elite. The degree of influence that Greek culture had throughout the Hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like Alexandria and Antioch. Some natives did learn Greek and adopt Greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the Diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the Greek speaking upper class and their subjects. In the Seleucid Empire, for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class.

Hellenistic art nevertheless had a considerable influence on the cultures that had been affected by the Hellenistic expansion. As far as the Indian subcontinent, Hellenistic influence on Indian art was broad and far-reaching, and had effects for several centuries following the forays of Alexander the Great.

Despite their initial reluctance, the Successors seem to have later deliberately naturalized themselves to their different regions, presumably in order to help maintain control of the population. In the Ptolemaic kingdom, we find some Egyptianized Greeks by the 2nd century onwards. In the Indo-Greek kingdom we find kings who were converts to Buddhism (e.g., Menander). The Greeks in the regions therefore gradually become &#x27;localized&#x27;, adopting local customs as appropriate. In this way, hybrid &#x27;Hellenistic&#x27; cultures naturally emerged, at least among the upper echelons of society.

The trends of Hellenization were therefore accompanied by Greeks adopting native ways over time, but this was widely varied by place and by social class. The farther away from the Mediterranean and the lower in social status, the more likely that a colonist was to adopt local ways, while the Greco-Macedonian elites and royal families usually remained thoroughly Greek and viewed most non-Greeks with disdain. It was not until Cleopatra VII that a Ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the Egyptian language of their subjects.

=== Religion ===
In the Hellenistic period, there was much continuity in Greek religion: the Greek gods continued to be worshiped, and the same rites were practiced as before. However the socio-political changes brought on by the conquest of the Persian empire and Greek emigration abroad meant that change also came to religious practices. This varied greatly by location. Athens, Sparta and most cities in the Greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods (with the exception of the Egyptian Isis in Athens), while the multi-ethnic Alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including Egyptian, Jewish and Greek. Greek emigres brought their Greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as India and Afghanistan. Non-Greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the Mediterranean and in this period we can see Egyptian gods such as Serapis, and the Syrian gods Atargatis and Hadad, as well as a Jewish synagogue, all coexisting on the island of Delos alongside classical Greek deities. A common practice was to identify Greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like Zeus-Ammon, Aphrodite Hagne (a Hellenized Atargatis) and Isis-Demeter. Greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition.

Hellenistic monarchies were closely associated with the religious life of the kingdoms they ruled. This had already been a feature of Macedonian kingship, which had priestly duties. Hellenistic kings adopted patron deities as protectors of their house and sometimes claimed descent from them. The Seleucids for example took on Apollo as patron, the Antigonids had Herakles, and the Ptolemies claimed Dionysus among others.

The worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period, most notably in Egypt, where the Ptolemies adopted earlier Pharaonic practice, and established themselves as god-kings. These cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the &quot;Ptolemaieia&quot; at Alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances. The setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings (sacrifice, proskynesis, statues, altars, hymns) which put them on par with the gods (&quot;isotheism&quot;) than on actual belief of their divine nature. According to Peter Green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the Greeks and Macedonians. The worship of Alexander was also popular, as in the long lived cult at Erythrae and of course, at Alexandria, where his tomb was located.

The Hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion. The rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters. The Sophists proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism; the belief in Euhemerism (the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes), became popular. The popular philosopher Epicurus promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia. The apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth. While there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes.

Magic was practiced widely, and this, too, was a continuation from earlier times. Throughout the Hellenistic world, people would consult oracles, and use charms and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells. Also developed in this era was the complex system of astrology, which sought to determine a person&#x27;s character and future in the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. Astrology was widely associated with the cult of Tyche (luck, fortune), which grew in popularity during this period.

=== Literature ===

The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, the only few surviving representative texts being those of Menander (born 342/341 BC). Only one play, &quot;Dyskolos&quot;, survives in its entirety. The plots of this new Hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic, stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important, the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism, marriage, romance and luck (Tyche). Though no Hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model. The &quot;Supplementum Hellenisticum&quot;, a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors.
Hellenistic poets now sought patronage from kings, and wrote works in their honor. The scholars at the libraries in Alexandria and Pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and literary criticism of classical Athenian works and ancient Greek myths. The poet-critic Callimachus, a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating Ptolemy II to Zeus and Apollo. He promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram, epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common (&quot;big book, big evil&quot; was his doctrine). He also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of Alexandria, the famous Pinakes. Callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of Augustan poetry. Another poet, Apollonius of Rhodes, attempted to revive the epic for the Hellenistic world with his Argonautica. He had been a student of Callimachus and later became chief librarian (&quot;prostates&quot;) of the library of Alexandria. Apollonius and Callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other. Pastoral poetry also thrived during the Hellenistic era, Theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre.

Around 240 BC Livius Andronicus, a Greek slave from southern Italy, translated Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; into Latin. Greek literature would have a dominant effect on the development of the Latin literature of the Romans. The poetry of Virgil, Horace and Ovid were all based on Hellenistic styles.

=== Philosophy ===

During the Hellenistic period, many different schools of thought developed, and these schools of Hellenistic philosophy had a significant influence on the Greek and Roman ruling elite.

Athens, with its multiple philosophical schools, continued to remain the center of philosophical thought. However, Athens had now lost her political freedom, and Hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period. In this political climate, Hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia (un-disturbedness), autarky (self-sufficiency), and apatheia (freedom from suffering), which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune. This occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all Hellenistic philosophical schools have in common.

The Epicureans and the Cynics eschewed public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. The Cyrenaics and Epicureans embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (&quot;nomos&quot;) as unnatural and useless. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. Against these dogmatic schools of philosophy the Pyrrhonist school embraced philosophical skepticism, and, starting with Arcesilaus, Plato&#x27;s Academy also embraced skepticism in the form of Academic Skepticism.

The spread of Christianity throughout the Roman world, followed by the spread of Islam, ushered in the end of Hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of Medieval philosophy (often forcefully, as under Justinian I), which was dominated by the three Abrahamic traditions: Jewish philosophy, Christian philosophy, and early Islamic philosophy. In spite of this shift, Hellenistic philosophy continued to influence these three religious traditions and the Renaissance thought which followed them.

=== Sciences ===

Science in the Hellenistic age differed from that of the previous era in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of Greek ideas with those that had developed in older civilizations; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by Alexander&#x27;s successors. The cultural competition among the Hellenistic kingdoms produced seats of learning throughout the Mediterranean, of which the most important was Alexandria in Egypt, which became a major center of scholarship in the 3rd century BC. In their scientific investigations, Hellenistic scholars frequently employed the principles developed earlier in ancient Greece: the application of mathematics to natural phenomena and the undertaking of deliberate empirical research.

In mathematics, Hellenistic geometers built upon the work of mathematicians from the previous generation such as Theodorus, Archytas, Theaetetus, and Eudoxus. Euclid, whose &quot;Elements&quot; became the most important textbook in Western mathematics until the 19th century, presented proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem, for the infinitude of primes, and for the five Platonic solids. Archimedes made use of a technique dependent on proof by contradiction to solve problems with an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Known as the method of exhaustion, Archimedes used it in several of his works, including to approximate the value of π (&quot;Measurement of the Circle&quot;) and to prove that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a triangle with equal base and height (&quot;Quadrature of the Parabola&quot;). The most characteristic product of Hellenistic mathematics was the theory of conic sections, reaching its greatest achievement in the work of Apollonius. It made no explicit use of either algebra or trigonometry, the latter appearing around the time of Hipparchus.

In the exact sciences, Eratosthenes measured the Earth&#x27;s circumference and calculated the tilt of the Earth&#x27;s axis with remarkable accuracy. He might have also determined the distance from the Earth to the Sun and invented the leap day. Eratosthenes drew a map of the world incorporating parallels and meridians, based on the available geographical knowledge of the era. Another important figure is the astronomer Hipparchus, who used Babylonian astronomical data and discovered the phenomena of Earth&#x27;s precession. Pliny reports that Hipparchus produced the first systematic star catalog after he observed a new star, wishing to preserve astronomical record of the stars so that new ones could be discovered. A celestial globe based on Hipparchus&#x27; star catalog presumably sits atop the broad shoulders of a large 2nd-century Roman statue known as the Farnese Atlas. Another astronomer, Aristarchos of Samos, measured the distances of the Earth, Sun, and Moon, and developed a heliocentric theory. In mechanics, Ctesibius wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps, and allegedly designed a kind of cannon as reported by Hero of Alexandria.

In the life sciences, medicine made significant advances within the framework of the Hippocratic tradition. Praxagoras theorized that blood traveled through the veins, while Herophilos and Erasistratus performed dissections and vivisections of humans and animals, providing accurate descriptions of the nervous system, liver and other key organs. Influenced by Philinus of Cos, a student of Herophilos, the Empiric school of medicine focused on strict observation and rejected the unseen causes of the Dogmatic school. In botany, Theophrastus was known for his work in plant classification while Crateuas wrote a compendium on botanic pharmacy. The library of Alexandria presumably included a zoo for research and Hellenistic zoologists include Archelaos, Leonidas of Byzantion, Apollodoros of Alexandria and Bion of Soloi.

The technological achievement of the Hellenistic age is masterly displayed in the Antikythera mechanism, a 37-gear mechanical analog computer which calculated the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, including lunar and solar eclipses. Devices of this sort are not found again until the 10th century, when a simpler eight-geared luni-solar calculator incorporated into an astrolabe was described by the Persian scholar, Al-Biruni. Similarly complex devices were also developed by other Muslim engineers and astronomers during the Middle Ages. Other technological developments of the Hellenistic age include cogged gears, pulleys, Archimedes&#x27; screw, the screw press, glassblowing, hollow bronze casting, surveying instruments, the odometer, the pantograph, the water clock, the watermill, the water organ, and the piston pump.

Past interpretations of Hellenistic science often downplayed its significance, as found for instance in the English classical scholar Francis Cornford, who believed that &quot;all the most important and original work was done in the three centuries from 600 to 300 BC&quot;. Recent interpretations tend to be more generous, leading a few people like mathematician Lucio Russo to claim that the scientific method was actually born in the 3rd century BC, to be largely forgotten during the Roman period and only revived in full during the Renaissance.

=== Military science ===
Hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of Iphicrates and Philip II of Macedon, particularly his use of the Macedonian phalanx, a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry. Armies of the Hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare. Hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical Greece relying increasingly on Greek mercenaries (&quot;misthophoroi&quot;; men-for-pay) and also on non-Greek soldiery such as Thracians, Galatians, Egyptians and Iranians. Some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including Tarantine cavalry, Cretan archers, Rhodian slingers and Thracian peltasts. This period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as Thureophoroi and the Thorakitai who used the oval Thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword. The use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the Seleucids, Greco-Bactrians, Armenians and Pontus. The use of war elephants also became common. Seleucus received Indian war elephants from the Mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of Ipsus. He kept a core of 500 of them at Apameia. The Ptolemies used the smaller African elephant.

Hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size. Hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the Quadrireme and Quinquereme. The Ptolemaic Tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in Antiquity. New siege engines were developed during this period. An unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult () and Dionysios of Alexandria designed a repeating ballista, the Polybolos. Preserved examples of ball projectiles range from . Demetrius Poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns, especially during the 12-month siege of Rhodes when he had Epimachos of Athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named Helepolis, filled with artillery.

=== Art ===
The term &quot;Hellenistic&quot; is a modern invention; the Hellenistic World not only included a huge area covering the whole of the Aegean, rather than the Classical Greece focused on the Poleis of Athens and Sparta, but also a huge time range. In artistic terms this means that there is huge variety which is often put under the heading of &quot;Hellenistic Art&quot; for convenience.

Hardly any examples of Hellenistic paintings or sculptures survive, but we have many Roman copies. For Hellenistic sculpture we have some originals, including Laocoön and his Sons, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. Many surviving frescoes and mosaics from the Roman period are believed to be loose copies of Hellenistic paintings, but it is difficult to assess what the original artworks were like.

Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (&quot;aletheia&quot;) is reflected in stories such as that of the pre-Hellenistic painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g., Leda and the Swan and Scopa&#x27;s Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion.

People of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the Hellenistic age. Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, &quot;He painted barbers&#x27; shops, cobblers&#x27; stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of &quot;rhyparographos&quot; [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures&quot; (Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the Galatians, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander&#x27;s youthful look.

Developments in painting included experiments in chiaroscuro by Zeuxis and the development of landscape painting and still life painting. Greek temples built during the Hellenistic period were generally larger than classical ones, such as the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the temple of Artemis at Sardis, and the temple of Apollo at Didyma (rebuilt by Seleucus in 300 BC). The royal palace (&quot;basileion&quot;) also came into its own during the Hellenistic period, the first extant example being the massive 4th-century villa of Cassander at Vergina.

This period also saw the first written works of art history in the histories of Duris of Samos and Xenocrates of Athens, a sculptor and a historian of sculpture and painting.

There has been a trend in writing the history of this period to depict Hellenistic art as a decadent style, following the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Classical Athens. Pliny the Elder, after having described the sculpture of the classical period, says: &quot;Cessavit deinde ars&quot; (&quot;then art disappeared&quot;). The 18th century terms &quot;Baroque&quot; and &quot;Rococo&quot; have sometimes been applied to the art of this complex and individual period. The renewal of the historiographical approach as well as some recent discoveries, such as the tombs of Vergina, allow a better appreciation of this period&#x27;s artistic richness.

=== Sport ===

Throughout the Hellenistic period, several sports were practiced and promoted across the different cities and kingdoms of the time. Sport was culturally associated as a major compositional component of the &quot;Hellenic self-image&quot; and the participation in athleticism was seen as an important civic quality for representing one&#x27;s homeland or city-state. During this period, this Hellenic perception on sport would go on to spread throughout the Hellenistic world. One contrast to the classical period is that the increased fluidity of citizenship and civic identity during the Hellenistic period meant that there arose a greater emphasis on honoring the philanthropic sponsors of athletic festivals rather than the athletes themselves, observed by the &quot;scarcity of Hellenistic honorific decrees praising athletes&quot; as highlighted by Antiopi Argyriou-Casmeridis. 

Hunting was both a favorite pastime of the Macedonian kings and nobles of that age and a favorite subject for paintings. In Egypt, the Ptolemaic kings sponsored new athletic festivals, and subsidize &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; or &#x27;Alexandrian&#x27; athletes at major competitions. Egyptian kings also provided funds for athletic facilities to be built, which housed ephebic education and encouraged citizens to partake in gymnasium classes. Ptolemaic and other Hellenistic royals often competed at athletic competitions like The Olympics or other Panathenaic games.

Females during the Hellenistic period were often given opportunities to show off their athletic abilities in similar ways to men. In Egypt, Ptolemaic females were well known in terms of court, and during equestrian competitions. Despite females being banned from watching sports and events like the male Olympics, in Hellenistic Empires, female sport (especially equestrian sport) flourished. Discoveries of poems in 2001 depicted eighteen different wins for equestrian sport. These wins took place at competitions like Olympia and Athens, and all originated from the royal court. Several of these wins resulted from women and confirmed the desires and self-representation of Hellenistic rulers as they tried to influence the Greek World.

Other forms of leisure activities included public presentations and demonstrations. These performances were often orchestrated by the royals for their own enjoyment. It is noted that these events were catered for both the female and male audiences. These events would often contain displays of exotic animals and other paraphernalia that aided to display their wealth and the territories that they controlled. While empires during the Hellenistic period ruled, they witnessed &quot;expansion of &#x27;crown&#x27; or &#x27;Iso-&#x27; (equal to) major athletic festivals&quot;. This movement as well as the public displays for royalty were both trends what would continue into the Roman Empire.

== Legacy ==
The focus on the Hellenistic period over the course of the 19th century by scholars and historians has led to an issue common to the study of historical periods; historians see the period of focus as a mirror of the period in which they are living. Many 19th-century scholars contended that the Hellenistic period represented a cultural decline from the brilliance of classical Greece. Though this comparison is now seen as unfair and meaningless, it has been noted that even commentators of the time saw the end of a cultural era which could not be matched again. This may be inextricably linked with the nature of government. It has been noted by Herodotus that after the establishment of the Athenian democracy:

the Athenians found themselves suddenly a great power. Not just in one field, but in everything they set their minds to ... As subjects of a tyrant, what had they accomplished? ...Held down like slaves they had shirked and slacked; once they had won their freedom, not a citizen but he could feel like he was labouring for himself

Thus, with the decline of the Greek polis, and the establishment of monarchical states, the environment and social freedom in which to excel may have been reduced. A parallel can be drawn with the productivity of the city states of Italy during the Renaissance, and their subsequent decline under autocratic rulers.

However, William Woodthorpe Tarn, between World War I and World War II and the heyday of the League of Nations, focused on the issues of racial and cultural confrontation and the nature of colonial rule. Michael Rostovtzeff, who fled the Russian Revolution, concentrated predominantly on the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie in areas of Greek rule. Arnaldo Momigliano, an Italian Jew who wrote before and after the Second World War, studied the problem of mutual understanding between races in the conquered areas. Moses Hadas portrayed an optimistic picture of synthesis of culture from the perspective of the 1950s, while Frank William Walbank in the 1960s and 1970s had a materialistic approach to the Hellenistic period, focusing mainly on class relations. Recently, however, papyrologist C. Préaux has concentrated predominantly on the economic system, interactions between kings and cities, and provides a generally pessimistic view on the period. Peter Green, on the other hand, writes from the point of view of late-20th-century liberalism, his focus being on individualism, the breakdown of convention, experiments, and a postmodern disillusionment with all institutions and political processes.

=== Influence on Christianity ===
Alexander&#x27;s conquests expanded the influence of Greek culture in Asia, which many centuries later contributed to the spread of Christianity (from: Greek Χρῑστῐᾱνισμός). One of Alexander&#x27;s generals, Seleucus I Nicator who controlled most of Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian Plateau after Alexander&#x27;s death, founded Antioch, which later became known as the cradle of Christianity, since the name &quot;Christian&quot; for Jesus&#x27; followers first emerged there. The New Testament of the Bible (from: Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, &quot;the books&quot;) was written in Koine Greek.

<doc id="455381" wikidata="Q4888672" url="?curid=455381" title="Benjamin Franklin True Patriot Act">
<text>The Benjamin Franklin True Patriot Act () is a bill introduced in the United States House of Representatives intended to review the previously passed USA PATRIOT Act. The bill was referred to subcommittees where it languished without action taken before the end of the 108th United States Congress. The bill will have to be reintroduced in order to be considered again.

==Overview==
The bill was sponsored by Representatives Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) and Ron Paul (R-Texas), with 27 co-sponsors, all Democrats except for Ron Paul. The intent was to review the USA PATRIOT Act to make sure it does not &quot;inappropriately undermine civil liberties.&quot; Its name, as described in Sec. 2, No. 1, refers to Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s famous quote, &quot;Those who would give up Essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.&quot;

The act had the goal of creating a 90-day review period in which parts of Sections 4-10 of the USA PATRIOT Act could be removed. These aspects would include: the use of roving wiretaps, secret record searches, detention and deportation of noncitizens, monitoring of religious institutions and the requirement that airport baggage screeners be U.S. citizens. This bill was presented to the House on September 24, 2003, and was referred to subcommittees for consideration. No action was taken before the end of the 108th Congress.

== Support ==
The proposed bill enjoyed rare support from both the left as well as right-leaning libertarians due to concerns that the USA PATRIOT Act had gone too far in removing essential freedoms and civil liberties.
In addition to members of Congress, the proposed bill had many high-profile supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the NAACP and a number of groups in the Jewish community. Sponsors admitted they didn&#x27;t expect the bill to pass, but maintain it was brought up to encourage debate about the issues surrounding the controversial Patriot Act. A number of cities, including San Francisco, had already passed measures condemning the Patriot Act.

<text>A mental calculator or human calculator is a person with a prodigious ability in some area of mental calculation (such as adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing large numbers).

In 2005, a group of researchers led by Michael W. O&#x27;Boyle, an American psychologist previously working in Australia and now at Texas Tech University, has used MRI scanning of blood flow during mental operation in computational prodigies. These math prodigies have shown increases in blood flow to parts of the brain responsible for mathematical operations during a mental rotation task that are greater than the typical increases.

Mental calculators were in great demand in research centers such as CERN before the advent of modern electronic calculators and computers. See, for instance, Steven B. Smith&#x27;s 1983 book &quot;The Great Mental Calculators&quot;, or the 2016 book &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; and the film adapted from it.

==Champion mental calculators==
The Mental Calculation World Cup is an international competition that attempts to find the world&#x27;s best mental calculator, and also the best at specific types of mental calculation, such as addition, multiplication, square root or calendar reckoning. The Mental Calculation World Cup is arranged every two years. The last edition was organized in September 2024 and won by Aaryan Nitin Shukla, who successfully defended his title to become two time World Champion. 

The Mind Sports Olympiad has staged annual world championships since 1998.

The Mind Sports Organisation recognizes six grandmasters of mental calculation: Robert Fountain (1999), George Lane (2001), Gert Mittring (2005), Chris Bryant (2017), Wenzel Grüß (2019), and Kaloyan Geshev (2022), and one international master, Andy Robertshaw (2008). In 2021, Aaryan Nitin Shukla became the youngest champion ever at an age of just 11 years.

Shakuntala Devi from India has been often mentioned on the Guinness World Records. Neelakantha Bhanu Prakash from India has been often mentioned on the Limca Book of Records for racing past the speed of a calculator in addition. Sri Lankan-Malaysian performer Yaashwin Sarawanan was the runner-up in 2019 &quot;Asia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

==Mental calculators in fiction==
===Dune===
In Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Dune&quot;, specially trained mental calculators known as Mentats have replaced mechanical computers completely. Several important supporting characters in the novel, namely Piter De Vries and Thufir Hawat, are Mentats. Paul Atreides was originally trained as one without his knowledge. However, these Mentats do not specialize in mathematical calculations, but in total recall of many different kinds of data. For example, Thufir Hawat is able to recite various details of a mining operation, including the number of various pieces of equipment, the people to work them, the profits and costs involved, etc. In the novel he is never depicted as doing actual academic mathematical calculations. Mentats were valued for their capacity as humans to store data, because &quot;thinking machines&quot; are outlawed.

===Matilda===
In Roald Dahl&#x27;s novel &quot;Matilda&quot;, the lead character is portrayed having exceptional computational skills as she computes her father&#x27;s profit without the need for paper computations. During class (she is a first-year elementary school student), she does large-number multiplication problems in her head almost instantly.

<doc id="455395" wikidata="Q27070220" url="?curid=455395" title="Nacelle">
<text>A nacelle ( ) is a streamlined container for aircraft parts such as engines, fuel or equipment. When attached entirely outside the airframe, it is sometimes called a pod, in which case it is attached with a pylon or strut and the engine is known as a podded engine. In some cases—for instance in the typical &quot;Farman&quot; type &quot;pusher&quot; aircraft, or the World War II-era P-38 Lightning or SAAB J21—an aircraft cockpit may also be housed in a nacelle, rather than in a conventional fuselage.

==Etymology==
Like many aviation terms, the word comes from French, in this case from a word for a small boat.

== Development ==
The Arado Ar 234 was one of the first operational jet aircraft with engines mounted in nacelles. During its development, the four engines had four distinct nacelles. They once had their own landing gear wheel, but they were later combined to two nacelles with two engines each.

Around 2010, General Electric and NASA have developed nacelles with chevron-shaped trailing edges to reduce the engine noise of commercial aircraft, using an experimental Boeing 777 as a test platform.

==Applications==

Usually, multi-engined aircraft use nacelles for housing the engines. Combat aircraft (such as the Eurofighter Typhoon) usually have the engines mounted within the fuselage. Some engines are installed in the aircraft wing, as in the De Havilland Comet and Flying Wing type aircraft. Engines may be mounted in individual nacelles, or in the case of larger aircraft such as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress (pictured right) may have two engines mounted in a single nacelle. Nacelles can be made fully or partially detachable for holding expendable resources such as fuel and armaments. Nacelles may be used to house equipment that will only function remote from the fuselage, for example the Boeing E-3 Sentry radar is housed in a nacelle called a radome.
===Other uses===
*Edward Turner used the term to describe his styling device introduced in 1949 to tidy the area around the headlamp and instrument panel of his Triumph Speed Twin, Thunderbird and Tiger 100 motorcycles. This styling device was much copied within the British industry thereafter, although Czech motorcycle manufacturer Česká Zbrojovka Strakonice was using it beforehand. Indeed, the Royal Enfield Bullet still retains its version, the &#x27;casquette&#x27;, on its current models. The last Triumphs to sport nacelles were the 1966 models of the 6T Triumph Thunderbird 650, 5TA Triumph Speed Twin 500, and 3TA Triumph Twenty One 350.
*The generator and gearbox &quot;shell&quot; – with rotator shaft – on a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT).
*A forward projection of a catamaran&#x27;s bridgedeck designed to soften the impact of seas or make more space inside the cabin.
*In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise it is also used as a term for the housing containing coils that generate the warp field. This is separate to the engine that powers them.

==Design considerations==
The primary design issue with aircraft-mounted nacelles is streamlining to minimise drag so nacelles are mounted on slender pylons. This can cause issues with directing the needed conduits mounted within the nacelle to connect to the aircraft through such a narrow space. This is especially concerning with nacelles containing engines, as the fuel, and control, lines for multiple engine functions must all go through the pylons. 
It is often necessary for nacelles to be asymmetrical, but aircraft designers try to keep asymmetrical elements to a minimum to reduce operator maintenance costs associated with having two sets of parts for either side of the aircraft.

<doc id="455398" wikidata="Q5649948" url="?curid=455398" title="Hans Eberstark">
<text>Hans Eberstark (27 January 1929, Vienna – 19 December 2001) was an Austrian linguist and translator, known as a mental calculator, multilinguist and interpreter.

== Life ==
Eberstark often lectured on language and translation in Europe and was known for asking someone whose first language was a small local dialect of German (particularly Swiss German, of which there are countless dialects) to speak with him (during the lecture); after a few minutes Eberstark would suddenly start speaking fluently in that dialect.

Eberstark was of Viennese Jewish origin. He spent eight years in Shanghai during World War II, with many other displaced people from all over Europe. It was there that he was exposed to many different languages. He once told science writer Jeremy Bernstein that to his &quot;eternal disgrace&quot; he had not learned to speak Chinese &quot;properly&quot; while there, but Bernstein noted that Eberstark&#x27;s standards for speaking a language were &quot;different from most people&#x27;s.&quot;

Eberstark was living in Vienna, Austria, when he joined Mensa International. After he moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1965 to work as an interpreter with the International Labour Organization, he founded Mensa Switzerland. He took early retirement in 1967 and became a free-lance and also taught courses in translating and interpreting at the University of Geneva.

Eberstark was prepared to interpret into English and German and from French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and Catalan. He also knew how to speak Surinamese Creole, Haitian Creole and Papiamento, from the Netherlands Antilles, as well as Yiddish, several varieties of Swiss German, Albanian and Hebrew.

In the late 1960s he was married with two children. He once told a group of friends that he &quot;knew&quot; the date he would die.

He also is known for having once recited 11,944 successive digits of the mathematical quantity of pi from memory. During an earlier attempt he had intended on reciting roughly half that many but had made a mistake. He was angry with himself for the mistake so he memorized even more.

Eberstark once wrote that the &quot;external rewards&quot; of excelling in mental arithmetic were &quot;Making friends, making money, showing off, and giving pleasure.&quot;

<text>George Peter (&quot;Pete&quot;) Murdock (May 11, 1897 – March 29, 1985), also known as G. P. Murdock, was an American anthropologist who was professor at Yale University and University of Pittsburgh. He is remembered for his empirical approach to ethnological studies and his study of family and kinship structures across differing cultures. 

His 1967 &quot;Ethnographic Atlas&quot; dataset on more than 1,200 pre-industrial societies is influential and frequently used in social science research. He also created the &quot;Standard Cross-Cultural Sample&quot; with Douglas R. White.

He is also known for his work as an FBI informant on his fellow anthropologists during McCarthyism.

==Early life==
Born in Meriden, Connecticut, to a family that had farmed there for five generations, Murdock spent many childhood hours working on the family farm and acquired a wide knowledge of traditional, non-mechanized, farming methods. He graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover, in 1915 and earned a BA in American History at Yale University. He then attended Harvard Law School, but quit in his second year and took a long trip around the world. This trip, combined with his interest in traditional material culture, and perhaps a bit of inspiration from the popular Yale teacher A.G. Keller, prompted Murdock to study anthropology at Yale. Yale&#x27;s anthropology program still maintained something of the evolutionary tradition of William Graham Sumner, a quite different emphasis from the historical particularism promulgated by Franz Boas at Columbia. In 1925, he received his doctorate and continued at Yale as a faculty member and chair of the anthropology department.

Even in his earliest writings, Murdock&#x27;s distinctive approach is apparent. He advocates an empirical approach to anthropology, through the compilation of data from independent cultures, and then testing hypotheses by subjecting the data to the appropriate statistical tests. He also sees himself as a social scientist rather than more narrowly as an anthropologist, and is in constant dialogue with researchers in other disciplines. At Yale, he assembled a team of colleagues and employees in an effort to create a cross-cultural data set.

Believing that a cross-cultural approach would help the U.S. war effort during World War II, Murdock and a few colleagues enlisted in the Navy and wrote handbooks on the cultures of Micronesia, working out of an office at Columbia University. After completing the handbooks, Murdock and his fellow officers were sent to the Pacific as military government officials, serving for nearly a year in the administration of occupied Okinawa. While his pre-war fieldwork had been among the Haida and other indigenous peoples of the Northwest North American coast, Murdock&#x27;s interests were now focused on Micronesia, and he conducted fieldwork there episodically until the 1960s.

==Yale==
Murdock joined the faculty of Yale University in 1928. His PhD from the institution was in the field of Sociology, as Yale at that time did not yet have a Department of Anthropology. Murdock taught courses in physical anthropology. In 1931, Yale established an anthropology department and hired Edward Sapir as the chairman. Murdock&#x27;s sociological and positivist approach to anthropology was at odds with Sapir&#x27;s Boasian approach to cultural anthropology. Following Sapir&#x27;s death, Murdock served as chairman of the Department of Anthropology from 1938 until 1960, when he reached the then mandatory retirement age at Yale. However, he was offered the chair of Andrew Mellon Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. Leaving his long-time residence at 960 Ridge Road in Hamden, Connecticut, Murdock moved with his wife to 4150 Bigelow Boulevard in Pittsburgh. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh until his retirement in 1973, at which point he moved to the Philadelphia area to be close to his son.

Murdock and his wife had one child, Robert Douglas Murdock. He was born in 1929 and died in 2011. Bob and Jean Murdock had three children, Nancy and Karen (born 1955) and Douglas (born 1959).

For Murdock&#x27;s war service in World War II, the best source is his own account as published in &quot;A Twenty-Five Year Record: Yale College Class of 1919&quot;, a class yearbook published in New Haven, Connecticut in 1946. These are Murdock&#x27;s own recollections, as shared with his classmates in the class of 1919 at Yale:

According to David H. Price, in a chapter of the book Threatening Anthropology, entitled &quot;Hoover&#x27;s Informer&quot;, devoted to Murdock during McCarthyism, Murdock had secretly informed on AAA colleagues to J. Edgar Hoover[ref. Duke University Press, 2004]. Murdock was particularly antagonistic of Boasian cultural anthropology, which he considered to be aligned with communist thought. Murdock was not the only person in his field or at his university to cooperate with intelligence agencies. For much of the 20th century, agencies such as the CIA and the FBI enjoyed a close relationship with American universities. Yale University was especially known (later) as a breeding ground for employees of the agencies. Researchers in anthropology and foreign relations were often debriefed after foreign field trips. Murdock later served as chair of the American Anthropological Association&#x27;s (AAA&#x27;s) Committee on Scientific Freedom, established to defend anthropologists from unfair attacks.

In 1948, Murdock decided that his cross-cultural data set would be more valuable were it available to researchers at schools other than Yale. He approached the Social Science Research Council and obtained the funding to establish an inter-university organization, the Human Relations Area Files, with collections maintained at Yale University (Whiting 1986: 684).

==Major works==
In 1954, Murdock published a list of every known culture, the &quot;Outline of World Cultures&quot;. In 1957, he published his first cross-cultural data set, the &quot;World Ethnographic Sample&quot;, consisting of 565 cultures coded for 30 variables. In 1959, despite having no professional experience in Africa, Murdock published &quot;Africa: Its peoples and their culture history&quot;, a reference book on African ethnic groups heavily reliant on colonial sources that attributed African innovations to diffusion from cultures outside Africa. There is also a list of his other major works:
* &quot;Correlations of Matrilineal and Patrilineal Institutions.&quot; // G. P. Murdock (ed.) Studies in the Science of Society, New Haven: Yale, 1937.
* &quot;Social Structure.&quot; New York: The MacMillan Company. 1949.
* &quot;Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary.&quot; Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press. 1967.
* &quot;Standard Cross-Cultural Sample&quot; // Ethnology 8 (4): 329–369. 1969.
* &quot;Atlas of World Cultures.&quot; Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press. 1981.

==University of Pittsburgh==
In 1960, Murdock moved to the University of Pittsburgh, where he occupied the Andrew Mellon Chair of Anthropology. In 1971, he was instrumental in founding the Society for Cross-Cultural Research, a scholarly society composed primarily of anthropologists and psychologists (Whiting 1986: 685). Between 1962 and 1967, he published installments of his &quot;Ethnographic Atlas&quot; in the journal &quot;Ethnology&quot;—a data set eventually containing almost 1,200 cultures coded for over 100 variables. In 1969, together with Douglas R. White, he developed the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, consisting of a carefully selected set of 186 well-documented cultures that today are coded for about 2000 variables (Whiting 1986: 685). At the end of his career, he felt &quot;no hesitation in rejecting the validity and utility of the entire body of anthropological theory, including the bulk of my own work...consigning it to the realm of mythology [not] science&quot; as in &quot;anthropology there&#x27;s virtually no [...] consensus&quot; on &quot;the essential core of its body of theory.&quot;

After his retirement from Pitt, Murdock moved to the Philadelphia area to be close to his son and grandchildren. He is buried in a military cemetery, Valley Forge Memorial Gardens, 352 South Gulph Road, King of Prussia, PA.

==Ethnology==
In 1962, Murdock founded &quot;Ethnology&quot; An International Journal of Cultural and Social Anthropology, published by the University of Pittsburgh. Publication ended in 2012 owing to a lack of interest from the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh. Journal staff was released shortly thereafter, and offices were permanently repurposed.

==Contributions==
Murdock is known most of all for his main sequence theory whose gist was spelled out by him initially as follows: &quot;When any social system which has attained equilibrium begins to change, such change regularly begins with modification of the rule of residence. Alteration in residence rules is followed by development or change in form of descent consistent with residence rules. Finally adaptive changes in kinship terminology follow (Murdock 1949:221–222).&quot;

<doc id="455401" wikidata="Q2021531" url="?curid=455401" title="Frankenstein's monster">
<text>Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, commonly referred to as Frankenstein, is a fictional character that first appeared in Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; as its main antagonist. Shelley&#x27;s title compares the monster&#x27;s creator, Victor Frankenstein, to the mythological character Prometheus, who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.

In Shelley&#x27;s Gothic story, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguous method based on a scientific principle he discovered. Shelley describes the monster as tall and emotional. The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar Joseph Carroll, the monster occupies &quot;a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists&quot;.

Frankenstein&#x27;s monster became iconic in popular culture, and has been featured in various forms of media, including films, television series, merchandise and video games. The most popularly recognized version is Boris Karloff&#x27;s portrayal in the 1930s films &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, and &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;.

==Names==
Mary Shelley&#x27;s original novel does not give the character a specific name. In the novel, Victor Frankenstein variously refers to his creation as the &quot;creature&quot;, &quot;fiend&quot;, &quot;spectre&quot;, &quot;dæmon&quot;, &quot;wretch&quot;, &quot;devil&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;, &quot;being&quot;, and &quot;ogre&quot;. Frankenstein&#x27;s creation referred to himself as a &quot;monster&quot; at least once, as did the residents of a hamlet who saw the creature towards the end of the novel.

As in Shelley&#x27;s story, the creature&#x27;s namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in London and Paris during the decades after the novel&#x27;s first appearance. In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of Richard Brinsley Peake&#x27;s &quot;Presumption&quot;, the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. &quot;The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of dramatis personae came, -------- by Mr T. Cooke,&quot; she wrote to her friend Leigh Hunt. &quot;This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good.&quot;

Within a decade of publication, the name of the creator, &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, was used to refer to the creature, but it did not become firmly established until much later. The story was adapted for the stage in 1927 by Peggy Webling, and Webling&#x27;s Victor Frankenstein does give the creature his name. However, the creature has no name in the Universal film series starring Boris Karloff during the 1930s, which was largely based upon Webling&#x27;s play. The 1931 Universal film treated the creature&#x27;s identity in a similar way as Shelley&#x27;s novel: in the opening credits, the character is referred to merely as &quot;The Monster&quot; (the actor&#x27;s name is replaced by a question mark, but Karloff is listed in the closing credits). However, in the sequel &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), the frame narration by a character representing Shelley&#x27;s friend Lord Byron does refer to the monster as Frankenstein. Nevertheless, the creature soon enough became best known in the popular imagination as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but some usage commentators regard the monster sense of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as well-established and not an error.

Modern practice varies somewhat. For example, in &quot;Dean Koontz&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot;, first published in 2004, the creature is named &quot;Deucalion&quot;, after the character from Greek mythology, who is the son of the Titan Prometheus, a reference to the original novel&#x27;s title. Another example is the second episode of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;, which first aired in 2014. Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation &quot;Adam&quot;, before deciding instead to let the monster &quot;pick his own name&quot;. He is also referred to as Adam in the 2014 film &quot;I, Frankenstein&quot;, where the Queen of the Gargoyles Leonore gives him the name after understanding Victor never gave him one. Thumbing through a book of the works of William Shakespeare, the monster chooses &quot;Proteus&quot; from &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the &quot;second&quot; monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named &quot;Caliban&quot;, from &quot;The Tempest&quot;, by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet John Clare. Another example is an attempt by Randall Munroe of webcomic &quot;xkcd&quot; to make &quot;Frankenstein&quot; the canonical name of the monster, by publishing a short derivative version which directly states that it is. In &quot;The Strange Case of the Alchemist&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the 2017 novel by Theodora Goss, the creature is named Adam.

==Shelley&#x27;s plot==

Victor Frankenstein builds the creature over a two-year period in the attic of his boarding house in Ingolstadt after discovering a scientific principle which allows him to create life from non-living matter. Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness.

He finds solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by an older, blind man and his two children. Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes an eloquent, educated, and well-mannered individual. During this time, he also finds Frankenstein&#x27;s journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory and learns how he was created. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family&#x27;s blind father, De Lacey, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Enraged, the creature feels that humankind is his enemy and begins to hate his creator for abandoning him. Although he despises Frankenstein, he sets out to find him, believing that he is the only person who will help him. On his journey, the creature rescues a young girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by the child&#x27;s father, believing the creature intended to harm his child. Enraged by this final act of cruelty, the creature swears revenge on humankind for the suffering they have caused him. He seeks revenge against his creator in particular for leaving him alone in a world where he is hated. Using the information in Frankenstein&#x27;s notes, the creature resolves to find him.

The monster kills Victor&#x27;s younger brother William upon learning of the boy&#x27;s relation to his creator and frames Justine Moritz, a young woman who lives with the Frankensteins, as the culprit (causing her execution afterwards). When Frankenstein retreats to the Alps, the monster approaches him at the summit, recounts his experiences, and asks his creator to build him a female mate. He promises, in return, to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again, but threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail or refuse. Frankenstein agrees, and eventually constructs a female creature on a remote island in Orkney, but aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys the female creature before it is complete. Horrified and enraged, the creature immediately appears, and gives Frankenstein a final threat: &quot;I will be with you on your wedding night.&quot;

After leaving his creator, the creature goes on to kill Victor&#x27;s best friend, Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein&#x27;s bride, Elizabeth Lavenza, on their wedding night, whereupon Frankenstein&#x27;s father dies of grief. With nothing left to live for but revenge, Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation, and the creature goads him into pursuing him north, through Scandinavia and into Russia, staying ahead of him the entire way.

As they reach the Arctic Circle and travel over the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean, Frankenstein, suffering from severe exhaustion and hypothermia, comes within a mile of the creature, but is separated from him when the ice he is traveling over splits. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship&#x27;s captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship, but upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at &quot;the Northernmost extremity of the globe&quot;. He then departs, never to be seen again.

==Appearance==
Shelley described Frankenstein&#x27;s monster as an creature of hideous contrasts:His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster&#x27;s skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster&#x27;s image remained variable according to the artist.

===Universal Pictures films===

The best-known image of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in popular culture derives from Boris Karloff&#x27;s portrayal in the 1931 movie &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; in which he wore makeup applied and designed by Jack P. Pierce, who based the monster&#x27;s face and iconic flat head shape on a drawing Pierce&#x27;s daughter (whom Pierce feared to be psychic) had drawn from a dream. Universal Studios, which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;; Lon Chaney Jr. took over the part from Karloff in &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein;&quot; Bela Lugosi portrayed the role in &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man;&quot; and Glenn Strange played the monster in the last three Universal Studios films to feature the character – &quot;House of Frankenstein,&quot; &quot;House of Dracula,&quot; and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.&quot; However, the makeup worn by subsequent actors replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. The image of Karloff&#x27;s face is currently owned by his daughter&#x27;s company, Karloff Enterprises, secured for her in a lawsuit for which she was represented by attorney Bela G. Lugosi (Bela Lugosi&#x27;s son), after which Universal replaced Karloff&#x27;s features with those of Glenn Strange in most of their marketing. In 1969, the New York Times mistakenly ran a photograph of Strange for Karloff&#x27;s obituary.

Since Karloff&#x27;s portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, undead-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as the Hulk.

===Hammer Films Productions version===
In the 1957 film &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot;, Christopher Lee was cast as the creature. The producers Hammer Film Productions refrained from duplicating aspects of Universal&#x27;s 1931 film, and so Phil Leakey designed a new look for the creature bearing no resemblance to the Boris Karloff design created by Jack Pierce. For his performance as the creature Lee played him as a loose-limbed and childlike, fearful and lonely, with a suggestion of being in pain. Author Paul Leggett describes the creature as being like an abused child; afraid but also violently angry. Christopher Lee was annoyed on getting the script and discovering that the monster had no dialogue, for this creature was totally mute. According to Marcus K. Harmes in contrasting Lee&#x27;s creature with the one played by Karloff, &quot;Lee&#x27;s actions as the monster seem more directly evil, to judge from the expression on his face when he bears down on the helpless old blind man but these are explained in the film as psychopathic impulses caused by brain damage, not the cunning of the literary monster. Lee also evokes considerable pathos in his performance.&quot;
In this film the aggressive and childish demeanour of the monster are in contrast with that of the murdered Professor Bernstein, once the &quot;finest brain in Europe&quot;, from whom the creature&#x27;s now damaged brain was taken.

The sequels to &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; would feature Victor Frankenstein creating various different Frankenstein monsters, none of which would be played by Christopher Lee:

* The film &quot;The Revenge of Frankenstein&quot; has Victor Frankenstein placing the brain of a hunchback named Karl (portrayed by Oscar Quitak) into a makeshift body (portrayed by Michael Gwynn). Though the procedure works, Karl starts to redevelop his deformities and later dies in front of Victor.
* The film &quot;The Evil of Frankenstein&quot; reveals that Victor Frankenstein had made a prototype version of his monster which was kept in a frozen cave. After being thawed out and reanimated, the Monster (portrayed by Kiwi Kingston) has his brain awakened by a hypnotist named Zoltan (portrayed by Peter Woodthorpe). When Frankenstein&#x27;s lab went off the cliff, it apparently killed Victor and the Monster.
* The film &quot;Frankenstein Created Woman&quot; has Victor Frankenstein surviving the lab&#x27;s destruction and making a female monster from the remains of a cowardly innkeeper&#x27;s half-disfigured daughter Christina Kleve (portrayed by Susan Denberg) after she threw herself in the river following the death of Victor&#x27;s ally Hans. He and Dr. Hertz transferred Hans&#x27; soul into Christina&#x27;s body causing her to become possessed by him. After coming to her senses, Christina commits suicide by drowning herself in the river.
* The film &quot;Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed&quot; has Victor Frankenstein making a monster out of the remains of the asylum&#x27;s administrator Professor Richter (portrayed by Freddie Jones) that involves placing the brain of Victor&#x27;s former assistant Dr. Frederick Brant (portrayed by George Pravda) into Professor Richter&#x27;s body. The Monster later drags Victor into the burning house.
* The film &quot;Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell&quot; has Victor surviving the fire and making a monster from the hulking ape-like asylum inmate Herr Schneider (portrayed by David Prowse) while also giving him a new brain and new eyes. During its plans for revenge, the Monster is killed by a mob of asylum inmates.

===Toho versions===
In the 1965 Toho film &quot;Frankenstein vs. Baragon&quot;, the heart of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster was transported from Germany to Hiroshima as World War II neared its end, only to be irradiated during the atomic bombing of the city, granting it miraculous regenerative capabilities. Over the ensuing 20 years, it grows into a complete human child, who then rapidly matures into a giant, 20-metre-tall man after he is rediscovered. Frankenstein escapes a laboratory in the city after being agitated by news reporters using flash photography on him, and goes to fend for himself in the countryside, only to be accused of attacking villages and killing people, actually the victims of the underground monster Baragon. The two monsters face off in a showdown that ends with Frankenstein&#x27;s monster victorious, though he falls into the depths of the Earth after the ground collapses beneath his feet.

The film&#x27;s sequel &quot;The War of the Gargantuas&quot; would see cell samples of the monster regenerate into the titular Gargantuas, two hairy giants consisting of the malicious green sea monster Gaira and the friendly brown mountain monster Sanda. Gaira and Sanda later appear in the IDW Publishing comic &quot;Godzilla: Rulers of Earth&quot;.

===Other film versions===
In the 1973 TV miniseries &quot;,&quot; in which the creature is played by Michael Sarrazin, he appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.

In the 1994 film &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein,&quot; the creature is played by Robert De Niro and has an appearance closer to that described in the original novel, though this version of the creature possesses balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, Doctor Waldman, while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman&#x27;s &quot;trace memories&quot; that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.

In the 2004 film &quot;Van Helsing,&quot; the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electrical origin of the creature is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart, and he also has hydraulic pistons in his legs, with the design being similar to that of a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.

In 2004, a TV miniseries adaptation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was made by Hallmark. Luke Goss plays the creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.

The 2005 film &quot;Frankenstein Reborn&quot; portrays the creature as a paraplegic man who tries to regain the ability to walk by having a nanobots surging through his body but has side effects. Instead, the surgeon kills him and resurrects his corpse as a reanimated zombie-like creature. This version of the creature has stitches on his face where he was shot, strains of brown hair, black pants, a dark hoodie, and a black jacket with a brown fur collar.

The 2014 TV series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; also rejects the Karloff design in favour of Shelley&#x27;s description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. Additionally, he is of average height, being even shorter than other characters in the series. In this series, the monster names himself &quot;Caliban&quot;, after the character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.

Frankenstein&#x27;s monster appears in the Reiwa era film &quot;The Great Yokai War: Guardians&quot;.

==Personality==
As depicted by Shelley, the creature is a sensitive, emotional person whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel portrayed him as versed in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Plutarch&#x27;s Lives&quot;, and &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; books he finds after having learnt language.

From the beginning, the creature is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his &quot;birth&quot; that even his own creator cannot stand the sight of him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says &quot;…one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped…&quot;. Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too is repulsed by his appearance. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.

The creature is a vegetarian. While speaking to Frankenstein, he tells him, &quot;My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment...The picture I present to you is peaceful and human.&quot; At the time the novel was written, many writers, including Percy Shelley in &quot;A Vindication of Natural Diet&quot;, argued that practicing vegetarianism was the morally right thing to do.

Contrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his speech. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature is able to speak English fluently as well. The &quot;Van Helsing&quot; and &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character&#x27;s violent reactions to rejection. In the 1931 film adaptation, the creature is depicted as mute and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal&#x27;s &quot;abnormal&quot; brain. In the subsequent sequel, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, the creature learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. However, his intelligence is implied to be fairly developed, since what little dialogue he speaks suggests he has a world-weary attitude to life, and a deep understanding of his unnatural state. When rejected by his bride, he briefly goes through a suicidal state and attempts suicide, blowing up the laboratory he is in. In the second sequel, &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot;, the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, &quot;The Ghost of Frankenstein&quot;, the creature speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, but the dialogue was excised before release. The creature was effectively mute in later sequels, although he refers to Count Dracula as his &quot;master&quot; in &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;. The creature is often portrayed as being afraid of fire, although he is not afraid of it in the novel, even using fire to destroy himself.

==Interpretations==

===The monster as a metaphor===
Scholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley&#x27;s story, and have drawn an analogy between the monster and a motherless child; Shelley&#x27;s own mother died while giving birth to her. The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized &quot;the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty&quot;. Others see in the monster the dangers of uncontrolled scientific progress, especially as at the time of publishing; Galvanism had convinced many scientists that raising the dead through use of electrical currents was a scientific possibility.

Another proposal is that Victor Frankenstein was based on a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus – Benjamin Franklin. Accordingly, the monster would represent the new nation that Franklin helped to create out of remnants left by England. Victor Frankenstein&#x27;s father &quot;made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds,&quot; wrote Shelley, similar to Franklin&#x27;s famous kite experiment.

===Racial interpretations===

In discussing the physical description of the monster, there has been some speculation about the potential his design is rooted in common perceptions of race during the 18th century. Three scholars have noted that Shelley&#x27;s description of the monster seems to be racially coded; one argues that, &quot;Shelley&#x27;s portrayal of her monster drew upon contemporary attitudes towards non-whites, in particular on fears and hopes of the abolition of slavery in the West Indies.&quot;

In her article &quot;Frankenstein, Racial Science, and the Yellow Peril&quot;, Anne Mellor claims that the monster&#x27;s features share a lot in common with the Mongoloid race. This term, now out of fashion and carrying some negative connotations, is used to describe the &quot;yellow&quot; races of Asia as distinct from the Caucasian or white races. To support her claim, Mellor points out that both Mary and Percy Shelley were friends with William Lawrence, an early proponent of racial science and someone whom Mary &quot;continued to consult on medical matters and [met with] socially until his death in 1830.&quot; While Mellor points out to allusions to Orientalism and the Yellow Peril, John Malchow in his article &quot;Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster and Images of Race in Nineteenth-Century Britain&quot; explores the possibility of the monster either being intentionally or unintentionally coded as black. Malchow argues that the monster&#x27;s depiction is based in an 18th-century understanding of &quot;popular racial discourse [which] managed to conflate such descriptions of particular ethnic characteristics into a general image of the &#x27;Negro&#x27; body in which repulsive features, brute-like strength and size of limbs featured prominently.&quot; Malchow makes it clear that it is difficult to tell if this alleged racial allegory was intentional on Shelley&#x27;s part or if it was inspired by the society she lived in (or if it exists in the text at all outside of his interpretation), and he states that &quot;There is no clear proof that Mary Shelley consciously set out to create a monster which suggested, explicitly, the Jamaican escaped slave or maroon, or that she drew directly from any person knowledge of either planter or abolitionist propaganda.&quot; In addition to the previous interpretations, Karen Lynnea Piper argues in her article, &quot;Inuit Diasporas: Frankenstein and the Inuit in England&quot; that the symbolism surrounding Frankenstein&#x27;s monster could stem from the Inuit of the Arctic. Piper argues that the monster accounts for the &quot;missing presence&quot; of any indigenous people during Waldon&#x27;s expedition, and that he represents the fear of the savage, lurking on the outskirts of civilization.

<text>Video game art is a form of computer art employing video games as the artistic medium. Video game art often involves the use of patched or modified video games or the repurposing of existing games or game structures, however it relies on a broader range of artistic techniques and outcomes than artistic modification and it may also include painting, sculpture, appropriation, in-game intervention and performance, sampling, etc. It may also include the creation of art games either from scratch or by modifying existing games.

Notable examples of video game art include Cory Arcangel&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Clouds&quot; and &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, Joseph Delappe&#x27;s projects including &quot;Dead in Iraq&quot; and the &quot;Salt Satyagraha Online: Gandhi&#x27;s March to Dandi in Second Life,&quot; the 2004-2005 Rhizome Commissions &quot;relating to the theme of games,&quot; Paolo Pedercini&#x27;s Molleindustria games such as &quot;Unmanned&quot; and &quot;Every Day the Same Dream&quot;, and Ian Bogost&#x27;s &quot;Cowclicker.&quot;

Artistic modifications are frequently made possible through the use of level editors, though other techniques exist. Some artists make use of machinima applications to produce non-interactive animated artworks, however artistic modification is not synonymous with machinima as these form only a small proportion of artistic modifications. Machinima is distinct from art mods as it relies on different tools, though there are many similarities with some art mods.

Like video games, artistic game modifications are often interactive and may allow for single-player or multiplayer experience. Multiplayer works make use of networked environments to develop new kinds of interaction and collaborative art production.

==Techniques==
===Machinima===


Machinima is the use of real-time three-dimensional (3-D) graphics rendering engines to generate computer animation. The term also refers to works that incorporate this animation technique.

===In-game intervention and performance===
Artists may intervene in online games in a non-play manner, often disrupting games in progress in order to challenge or expose underlying conventions and functions of game play. Examples of this include Anne Marie Schleiner&#x27;s &quot;Velvet-Strike&quot; (a project designed to allow players of realistic first person shooter games to use anti-war graffiti within the game to make an artistic statement) and &quot;Dead in Iraq&quot; (an art project created by Joseph DeLappe in which the player character purposely allows himself to be shot and then recites the names of US soldiers who have died in the Iraq War).

===Site-specific installations and site-relative mods===
Site-specific installations and site-relative gaming modifications (&quot;mods&quot;), replicate real-world places (often the art gallery in which they are displayed) to explore similarities and differences between real and virtual worlds. An example is &quot;What It Is Without the Hand That Wields It&quot;, where blood from kills in Counterstrike manifests and spills into a real life gallery.

===Real-time performance instruments===
Video games can be incorporated into live audio and visual performance using a variety of instruments and computers such as electronic keyboards embedded with music chips. See also chiptune and the Fijuu project.

===Generative art mods===
Generative art mods exploit the real-time capabilities of game technologies to produce ever-renewing autonomous artworks. Examples include Julian Oliver&#x27;s &quot;ioq3apaint&quot;, a generative painting system that uses the actions of software agents in combat to drive the painting process, Alison Mealy&#x27;s &quot;UnrealArt&quot; which takes the movements of game entities and uses them to control a drawing process in an external program, Kent Sheely&#x27;s &quot;Cities in Flux,&quot; a &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; mod that glitches and distorts the game&#x27;s world in real-time, and RetroYou&#x27;s &quot;R/C Racer&quot; a modification of the graphic elements of a racing game which results in rich fields of colour and shape.

<doc id="455405" wikidata="Q366217" url="?curid=455405" title="Marcel Janco">
<text>Marcel Janco (, ; common rendition of the Romanian name Marcel Hermann Iancu ; 24 May 1895 – 21 April 1984) was a Romanian and Israeli visual artist, architect and art theorist. He was the co-inventor of Dadaism and a leading exponent of Constructivism in Eastern Europe. In the 1910s, he co-edited, with Ion Vinea and Tristan Tzara, the Romanian art magazine &quot;Simbolul&quot;. Janco was a practitioner of Art Nouveau, Futurism and Expressionism before contributing his painting and stage design to Tzara&#x27;s literary Dadaism. He parted with Dada in 1919, when he and painter Hans Arp founded a Constructivist circle, &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot;.

Reunited with Vinea, he founded &quot;Contimporanul&quot;, the influential tribune of the Romanian avant-garde, advocating a mix of Constructivism, Futurism and Cubism. At &quot;Contimporanul&quot;, Janco expounded a &quot;revolutionary&quot; vision of urban planning. He designed some of the most innovative landmarks of downtown Bucharest. He worked in many art forms, including illustration, sculpture and oil painting.

Janco was one of the leading Romanian Jewish intellectuals of his generation. Targeted by antisemitic persecution before and during World War II, he emigrated to the British Mandate for Palestine in 1941. He won the Dizengoff Prize and Israel Prize, and was a founder of Ein Hod, a utopian art colony.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marcel Janco was born on 24 May 1895 in Bucharest to an upper middle class Jewish family. His father, Hermann Zui Iancu, was a textile merchant. His mother, Rachel née Iuster, was from Moldavia. The couple lived outside Bucharest&#x27;s Jewish quarter, on Decebal Street. He was the oldest of four children. His brothers were Iuliu (Jules) and George. His sister, Lucia, was born in 1900. The Iancus moved from Decebal to Gândului Street, and then to Trinității, where they built one of the largest home-and-garden complexes in early 20th century Bucharest. In 1980, Janco revisited his childhood years, writing: &quot;Born as I was in beautiful Romania, into a family of well-to-do people, I had the fortune of being educated in a climate of freedom and spiritual enlightenment. My mother, [...] possessing a genuine musical talent, and my father, a stern man and industrious merchant, had created the conditions favorable for developing all of my aptitudes. [...] I was of a sensitive and emotional nature, a withdrawn child who was predisposed to dreaming and meditating. [...] I grew up [...] dominated by a strong sense of humanity and social justice. The existence of disadvantaged, weak, people, of impoverished workers, of beggars, hurt me and, when compared to our family&#x27;s decent condition, awoke in me a feeling of guilt.&quot;

Janco attended Gheorghe Șincai School and studied drawing art with the Romanian Jewish painter and cartoonist Iosif Iser. In his teenage years, the family traveled widely, from Austria-Hungary to Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. At Gheorghe Lazăr High School, he met several students who would become his artistic companions: Tzara (known then as &quot;S. Samyro&quot;), Vinea (&quot;Iovanaki&quot;), writers Jacques G. Costin and Poldi Chapier. Janco also became friends with pianist Clara Haskil, the subject of his first published drawing, which appeared in &quot;Flacăra&quot; magazine in March 1912.

As a group, the students were under the influence of Romanian Symbolist clubs, which were at the time the more radical expressions of artistic rejuvenation in Romania. Marcel and Jules Janco&#x27;s first moment of cultural significance took place in October 1912, when they joined Tzara in editing the Symbolist venue &quot;Simbolul&quot;, which managed to receive contributions from some of Romania&#x27;s leading modern poets, from Alexandru Macedonski to Ion Minulescu and Adrian Maniu. The magazine nevertheless struggled to find its voice, alternating modernism with the more conventional Symbolism. Janco was perhaps the main graphic designer of &quot;Simbolul&quot;, and he may even have persuaded his wealthy parents to support the venture (which closed down in early 1913). Unlike Tzara, who refused to look back on &quot;Simbolul&quot; with anything but embarrassment, Janco proudly regarded it as his first participation in artistic revolution.

After the &quot;Simbolul&quot; moment, Marcel Janco worked at &quot;Seara&quot; daily, where he took further training in draftsmanship. The newspaper took him in as illustrator, probably as a result of intercessions from Vinea, its literary columnist. Their &quot;Simbolul&quot; colleague Costin joined them as &quot;Seara&quot;″s cultural editor. Janco was also a visitor of the literary and art club meeting at the home of controversial politician and Symbolist poet Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, who was for a while the manager of &quot;Seara&quot;.

It is possible that, during those years, Tzara and Janco first came to hear and be influenced by the absurdist prose of Urmuz, the lonesome civil clerk and amateur writer who would later become the hero of Romanian modernism. Years later, in 1923, Janco drew an ink portrait of Urmuz. In maturity, he also remarked that Urmuz was the original rebel figure in Romanian literature. In the 1910s, Janco was also interested in the parallel development of French literature, and read passionately from such authors as Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire. Another immediate source of inspiration for his attitude on life was provided by Futurism, an anti-establishment movement created in Italy by poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and his artists&#x27; circle.

===Swiss journey and Dada events===

Janco eventually decided to leave Romania, probably because he wanted to attend international events such as the &quot;Sonderbund&quot; exhibit, but also because of quarrels with his father. In quick succession after the start of World War I, Marcel, Jules and Tzara left Bucharest for Zürich. According to various accounts, their departure may have been either a search for new opportunities (abundant in cosmopolitan Switzerland) or a discreet pacifist statement. Initially, the Jancos were registered with the University of Zurich, where Marcel took Chemistry courses, before applying to study architecture at the Federal Institute of Technology. His real ambition, later confessed, was to pursue more training in painting. The two brothers were soon joined by younger Georges Janco, but all three were left without any financial support when the war began hampering Europe&#x27;s trade routes; until October 1917, both Jules and Marcel (who found it impossible to sell his paintings) earned a living as cabaret performers. Marcel was noted for performing selections from Romanian folklore and playing the accordion, as well as for his rendition of &quot;chansons&quot;. It was during this time that the young artist and his brothers began using the consecrated version of the surname &quot;Iancu&quot;, probably in hopes that it would sound more familiar to foreigners.

In this context, the Romanians came into contact with Hugo Ball and the other independent artists plying their trade at the Malerei building, which soon after became known as Cabaret Voltaire. Ball later recalled that four &quot;Oriental&quot; men introduced themselves to him late after a show—the description refers to Tzara, the older Jancos and, probably, the Romanian painter Arthur Segal. Ball found the young painter especially pleasant, and was impressed that, unlike his peers, Janco was melancholy rather than ironic; other participants remember him as a very handsome presence in the group, and he allegedly had the reputation of a &quot;lady-killer&quot;.

Accounts of what happened next differ, but it is presumed that, shortly after the four new participants were accepted, the performances became more daring, and the transition was made from Ball&#x27;s Futurism to the virulent anti-art performances of Tzara and Richard Huelsenbeck. With help from Segal and others, Marcel Janco was personally involved in decorating the Cabaret Voltaire. Its hectic atmosphere would inspire Janco to create an eponymous oil painting, dated 1916 and believed to have been lost. He was a major contributor to the cabaret&#x27;s events: he notably carved the grotesque masks worn by performers on stilts, gave &quot;hissing concerts&quot; and, in unison with Huelsenbeck and Tzara, improvised some of the first (and mostly onomatopoeic) &quot;simultaneous poems&quot; to be read on stage.

His work with masks became especially influential, opening up a new field of theatrical exploration for the Dadaists (as the Cabaret Voltaire crew began calling themselves), and earning special praise from Ball. Contrary to Ball&#x27;s later claim of authorship, Janco is also credited with having tailored the &quot;bishop dress&quot;, another one of the iconic products of early Dadaism. The actual birth of &quot;Dadaism&quot;, at an unknown date, later formed the basis of disputes between Tzara, Ball, and Huelsenbeck. In this context, Janco is cited as a source for the story according to which the invention of the term &quot;Dada&quot; belonged exclusively to Tzara. Janco also circulated stories according to which their shows were attended for informative purposes by communist theorist Vladimir Lenin and psychiatrist Carl Jung.

His various contributions were harnessed by Dada&#x27;s international effort of self-promotion. In April 1917, he welcomed the Dada affiliation of Switzerland&#x27;s own Paul Klee, calling Klee&#x27;s contribution to the Dada exhibit a &quot;great event&quot;. His mask designs were popular beyond Europe, and inspired similar creations by Mexico&#x27;s Germán Cueto, the &quot;Stridentist&quot; painter-puppeteer. The Dadaist popularization effort received lukewarm responses in Janco&#x27;s native country, where the traditionalist press expressed alarm at being confronted with Dada precepts. Vinea himself was ambivalent about the activities of his two friends, preserving a link with poetic tradition which made his publication in Tzara&#x27;s press impossible. In a letter to Janco, Vinea spoke about having personally presented one of Janco&#x27;s posters to modernist poet and art critic Tudor Arghezi: &quot;[He] said, critically, that you cannot say whether a person is talented or not on the basis of only one drawing. Rubbish.&quot;

Exhibited at the Dada group shows, Janco also illustrated the Dada advertisements, including an April 1917 program which features his sketches of Ball, Tzara and Ball&#x27;s actress wife Emmy Hennings. The event featured his production of Oskar Kokoschka&#x27;s farce &quot;Sphinx und Strohmann&quot;, for which he was also the stage designer, and which was turned into one of the most notorious among Dada provocations. Janco was the director and mask designer for the Dada production for another one of Kokoschka&#x27;s plays, &quot;Job&quot;. He also returned as Tzara&#x27;s illustrator, producing the linocuts to &quot;The First Heavenly Adventure of Mr. Antipyrine&quot;, having already created the props for its theatrical production.

===&quot;Two-speeds&quot; Dada and &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot;===

As early as 1917, Marcel Janco began taking his distance from the movement he had helped to generate. His work, in both woodcut and linocut, continued to be used as the illustration to Dada almanacs for another two years, but he was more often than not in disagreement with Tzara, while also trying to diversify his style. As noted by critics, he found himself split between the urge to mock traditional art and the belief that something just as elaborate needed to take its place: in the conflict between Tzara&#x27;s nihilism and Ball&#x27;s art for art&#x27;s sake, Janco tended to support the latter. In a 1966 text, he further assessed that there were &quot;two speeds&quot; in Dada, and that the &quot;spiritual violence&quot; phase had eclipsed the &quot;best Dadas&quot;, including his fellow painter Hans Arp.

Janco recalled: &quot;We [Janco and Tzara] couldn&#x27;t agree any more on the importance of Dada, and the misunderstandings accumulated.&quot; There were, he noted, &quot;dramatic fights&quot; sparked by Tzara&#x27;s taste for &quot;bad jokes and scandal&quot;. The artist preserved a grudge, and his retrospective views on Tzara&#x27;s role in Zürich are often sarcastic, depicting him as an excellent organizer and vindictive self-promoter, but not truly a man of culture; a few years into the scandal, he even started a rumor that Tzara was illegally trading in opium. As noted in 2007 by Romanian literary historian Paul Cernat: &quot;All the efforts by Ion Vinea to reunite them [...] would be in vain. Iancu and Tzara would ignore (or banter) each other for the rest of their lives&quot;. With this split, there came a certain classicization in Marcel Janco&#x27;s discourse. In February 1918, Janco was even invited to lecture at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, where he spoke about modernism and authenticity in art as related phenomena, drawing comparisons between the Renaissance and African art. However, having decided to focus on his other projects, Janco nearly abandoned his studies, and failed his final exam.

In this context, he moved closer to the cell of post-Dada Constructivists exhibiting collectively as &quot;Neue Kunst&quot; (&quot;New Art&quot;)—Arp, Fritz Baumann, Hans Richter, Otto Morach. As a result, Janco was made a member of &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot; faction, which supported an educational approach to modern art, coupled with socialist ideals and Constructivist aesthetics. In its art manifesto, the group declared its ideal of &quot;rebuild[ing] the human community&quot; in preparation for the end of capitalism. Janco was even affiliated with &quot;Artistes Radicaux&quot;, a more politically inclined section of &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot;, where his colleagues included other former Dadas: Arp, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling. The &quot;Artistes Radicaux&quot; were in touch with the German Revolution, and Richter, who worked for the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic, even offered Janco and the others virtual teaching positions at the Academy of Fine Arts under a workers&#x27; government.

===Between Béthune and Bucharest===
Janco made his final contribution to the Dada adventure in April 1919, when he designed the masks for a major Dada event organized by Tzara at the Saal zur Kaufleutern, and which degenerated into an infamous mass brawl. By May, he was mandated by &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot; to create and publish a journal for the movement. Although this never saw print, the preparations placed Janco in contact with the representatives of various modernist currents: Arthur Segal, Walter Gropius, Alexej von Jawlensky, Oscar Lüthy and Enrico Prampolini. This period also witnessed the start of a friendly relationship between Janco and the Expressionist artists who published in Herwarth Walden&#x27;s magazine &quot;Der Sturm&quot;.

A little more than a year after the end of war, in December 1919, Marcel and Jules left Switzerland for France. After passing through Paris, the painter was in Béthune, where he married Amélie Micheline &quot;Lily&quot; Ackermann, in what was described as a gesture of fronde against his father. The girl was a Swiss Catholic of lowly condition, who had first met the Jancos at &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot;. Janco was probably in Béthune for a longer while: he was listed as one of those considered for helping to rebuild war-affected French Flanders, redesigned the Chevalier-Westrelin store in Hinges, and was perhaps the co-owner of an architectural enterprise, &quot;Ianco &amp; Déquire&quot;. It is not unlikely that Janco followed with curiosity the activities of Dada&#x27;s Parisian cell, which were overseen by Tzara and his pupil André Breton, and he is known to have impressed Breton with his own architectural projects. He was also announced, with Tzara, as a contributor to the post-Dada magazine &quot;L&#x27;Esprit Nouveau&quot;, published by Paul Dermée. Nevertheless, Janco was invited to exhibit elsewhere, rallying with &quot;Section d&#x27;Or&quot;, a Cubist collective.

Late in 1921, Janco and his wife left for Romania, where they had a second marriage to seal their union in front of familial disputes. Janco was soon reconciled with his parents, and, although still unlicensed as an architect, began receiving his first commissions, some of which came from within his own family. His first known design, constructed in 1922 and officially registered as the work of one I. Rosenthal, is a group of seven alley houses, 3 pairs and corner residence, on his father Hermann Iancu&#x27;s property, at 79 Maximilian Popper Street (prev Trinității Street 29); one of these became his new home. Essentially traditional in style, they are also somewhat stylised, recalling the plainness of the English Arts &amp; Crafts or the Czech &#x27;Cubist&#x27; style.

Soon after making his comeback, Marcel Janco reconnected himself with the local avant-garde salons, and had his first Romanian exhibits, at the &quot;Maison d&#x27;Art&quot; club in Bucharest. His friends and collaborators, among them actress Dida Solomon and journalist-director Sandu Eliad, would describe him as exceptionally charismatic and knowledgeable. In December 1926, he was present at the Hasefer Art Show in Bucharest. Around that year, Janco took commissions as an art teacher at his studio in Bucharest—in the words of his pupil, the future painter Hedda Sterne, these were informal: &quot;We were given easels, etc. but nobody looked, nobody advised us.&quot;

===&quot;Contimporanul&quot; beginnings===
From his position as Constructivist mentor and international artist, Janco proceeded to network between Romanian modernist currents, and joined up with his old colleague Vinea. Early in 1922, the two men founded a political and art magazine, the influential &quot;Contimporanul&quot;—historically, the longest-lived venue of the Romanian avant-garde. Janco was abroad that year, as one of guests at the First Constructivist Congress, convened by Dutch artist Theo van Doesburg in Düsseldorf. He was in Zürich around 1923, receiving the visit of a compatriot, writer Victor Eftimiu, who declared him a hard-working artist able to reconcile the modern with the traditional.

&quot;Contimporanul&quot; followed Janco&#x27;s Constructivist affiliation. Initially a venue for socialist satire and political commentary, it reflected Vinea&#x27;s strong dislike for the ruling National Liberal Party. However, by 1923, the journal became increasingly cultural and artistic in its revolt, headlining with translations from van Doesburg and Breton, publishing Vinea&#x27;s own homage to Futurism, and featuring illustrations and international notices which Janco may have handpicked himself. Some researchers have attributed the change exclusively to the painter&#x27;s growing say in editorial policy. Janco was at the time in correspondence with Dermée, who was to contribute the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; anthology of modern French poetry, and with fellow painter Michel Seuphor, who collected Janco&#x27;s Constructivist sculptures. He maintained a link between &quot;Contimporanul&quot; and &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, which republished his drawings alongside the contributions of various Romanian avant-garde writers and artists. The reciprocal popularization was taken up by &quot;Ma&quot;, the Vienna-based tribune of Hungarian modernists, which also published samples of Janco&#x27;s graphics. Owing to Janco&#x27;s resentments and Vinea&#x27;s apprehension, the magazine never covered the issuing of new Dada manifestos, and responded critically to Tzara&#x27;s new versions of Dada history.

Marcel Janco also took charge of &quot;Contimporanul&quot;″s business side, designing its offices on Imprimerie Street and overseeing the publication of postcards. Over the years, his own contributions to &quot;Contimporanul&quot; came to include some 60 illustrations, some 40 articles on art and architectural topics, and a number of his architectural designs or photographs of buildings erected from them. He oversaw one of the journal&#x27;s first special issues, dedicated to &quot;Modern Architecture&quot;, and notably hosting his own contributions to architectural theory, as well as his design of a &quot;country workshop&quot; for Vinea&#x27;s use. Other issues also featured his essay on film and theater, his furniture designs, and his interview with the French Cubist Robert Delaunay. Janco was also largely responsible for the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; issue on Surrealism, which included his interviews with writers such as Joseph Delteil, and his inquiry about the publisher Simon Krà.

Together with Romanian Cubist painter M. H. Maxy, Janco was personally involved in curating the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; International Art Exhibit of 1924. This event reunited the major currents of Europe&#x27;s modern art, reflecting &quot;Contimporanul&quot;″s eclectic agenda and international profile. It hosted samples of works by leading modernists: the Romanians Segal, Constantin Brâncuși, Victor Brauner, János Mattis-Teutsch, Milița Petrașcu, alongside Arp, Eggeling, Klee, Richter, Lajos Kassák and Kurt Schwitters. The exhibit included samples of Janco&#x27;s work in furniture design, and featured his managerial contribution to a Dada-like opening party, co-produced by him, Maxy, Vinea and journalist Eugen Filotti. He was also involved in preparing the magazine&#x27;s theatrical parties, including the 1925 production of &quot;A Merry Death&quot;, by Nikolai Evreinov; Janco was the set and costume designer, and Eliad the director. An unusual echo of the exhibit came in 1925, when &quot;Contimporanul&quot; published a photograph of Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;Princess X&quot; sculpture. The Romanian Police saw this as a sexually explicit artwork, and Vinea and Janco were briefly taken into custody. Janco was a dedicated admirer of Brâncuși, visiting him in Paris and writing in &quot;Contimporanul&quot; about Brâncuși&#x27;s &quot;spirituality of form&quot; theories.

In their work as cultural campaigners, Vinea and Janco even collaborated with &quot;75 HP&quot;, a periodical edited by poet Ilarie Voronca, which was nominally anti-&quot;Contimporanul&quot; and pro-Dada. Janco was also an occasional presence in the pages of &quot;Punct&quot;, the Dadaist-Constructivist paper put out by the socialist Scarlat Callimachi. It was here that he notably published articles on architectural styles and a lampoon, in French and German, titled &quot;T.S.F. Dialogue entre le bourgeois mort et l&#x27;apôtre de la vie nouvelle&quot; (&quot;Cablegram. The Dialogue between a Dead Bourgeois and the Apostle of New Living&quot;). In addition, his graphic work was popularized by Voronca&#x27;s other magazine, the Futurist tribune &quot;Integral&quot;. Janco was also called upon by authors Ion Pillat and Perpessicius to illustrate their &quot;Antologia poeților de azi&quot; (&quot;The Anthology of Present-Day Poets&quot;). His portraits of the writers included, drawn in sharply modernist style, were received with amusement by the traditionalist public. In 1926, Janco further antagonized the traditionalists by publishing sensual drawings for Camil Baltazar&#x27;s book of erotic poems, &quot;Strigări trupești lîngă glezne&quot; (&quot;Bodily Exhortations around the Ankles&quot;).

===Functionalist breakthrough===
Some time in the late 1920s, Janco set up an architectural studio &quot;Birou de Studii Moderne&quot; (Office of Modern Studies), a partnership with his brother Jules (Iulius), a venture often identified by the name &quot;Marcel Iuliu Iancu&quot;, combining the two brothers as one. Heralding the change of architectural tastes with his articles in &quot;Contimporanul&quot;, Marcel Janco described Romania&#x27;s capital as a chaotic, inharmonious, backward town, in which the traffic was hampered by carts and trams, a city in need of Modernist revolution.

Profiting from the building boom of Greater Romania, and the rising popularity of functionalism, Janco&#x27;s &quot;Birou&quot; received commissions from 1926 onwards that were occasional and small-scale. Compared with mainstream functionalist architects like Horia Creangă, Duiliu Marcu or Jean Monda, the Jancos had a decisive role in popularizing the functionalist versions of Constructivism or Cubism, designing the first examples of this new stylistic approach to be built in Romania. The first clear, though unheralded, expression of Modernism in Romania, was the construction in 1926 of a small apartment building near his earlier houses, also built for his father Herman, with an apartment for Herman, one for Marcel as well as his rooftop studio. The structure simply follows the curved line of the corner lot, the severe elevations devoid of decoration, enlivened only by a triangular bay window and balcony above, and a scheme of different colours (now lost) applied to the three wall areas differentiated by slight variations on depth.

A major breakthrough was his Villa for Jean Fuchs, built in 1927 on Negustori Street. Its cosmopolitan owner allowed the artist complete freedom in designing the building, and a budget of 1 million lei, and he created what is often described as the first Constructivist (and therefore Modernist) structure in Bucharest. The design was quite unlike anything seen in Bucharest before, the front facade composed of complex overlapping, projecting and receding rectangular volumes, horizontal and corner windows, three circular porthole windows, and stepped flat roof areas including a rooftop lookout. The result caused a stir in the neighborhood, and the press found it to be reminiscent of a &quot;morgue&quot; and a &quot;crematorium&quot;. The architect and his patrons were undeterred by such reactions, and the Janco firm received commissions to build similar villas.

Until 1933, when Marcel Janco finally received his certification, his designs continued to be officially recorded under different names, most usually attributed to a Constantin Simionescu. This had little effect on the &quot;Birou&quot;″s output: by the time of his last known design in 1938, Janco and his brother are thought to have designed some 40 permanent or temporary structures in Bucharest, many in the wealthier northern residential districts of Aviatorilor and Primaverii, but by far the largest concentration in or to the north of the Jewish Quarter, just the east of the old town centre, reflecting the family and community ties of many of his commissions.

A series of modernist villas for sometimes wealthy clients followed despite the Fuchs controversy. The Villa Henri Daniel (1927, demolished) on Strada Ceres returned to the almost unadorned flat facade, enlivened by a play of horizontal and vertical lines, while the Maria Lambru Villa (1928), on Popa Savu Street, was a simplified version of the Fuchs design. The Florica Chihăescu house on Șoseaua Kiseleff (1929) is surprisingly formal with a central porch below strip windows, and also marks collaboration with Milița Petrașcu from the 1924 exhibition who provided some statuary (now lost). The Villa Bordeanu (1930) on Labirint Street plays with symmetrical formality while the Villa Paul Iluta (1931, altered) employs bold rectangular volumes over three floors, as does the Paul Wexler Villa (1931), on Silvestru and Grigore Mora streets. The Jean Juster Villa (1931) nearby at Strada Silvestru 75 combines the bold rectangular volumes with a projecting semi-circular one. Another project was a house for his &quot;Simbolul&quot; friend Poldi Chapier; located on Ipătescu Alley and finished in 1929, this is occasionally described as &quot;Bucharest&#x27;s first Cubist lodging&quot;, even though the Villa Fuchs was two year earlier. In 1931 he designed his first tenement/apartment building at Strada Caimatei 20, a small stack of 3 apartments of boldly projecting forms, developed himself for his family with other floors to rent, in the name of his wife Clara Janco. It is thought the studios for his Birou were on the top floor, and the design was published in &quot;Contimporanul&quot; in 1932. Two more followed in 1933 on Strada Paleologu next to each other, simpler in conception, with a second one in his wife&#x27;s name, and one for Jaques Costin - which features a bas relief panel of women working with wool by Militia Pătraşcu by the door. These projects are joined by a private sanatorium of Predeal, Janco&#x27;s only design outside of Bucharest. Built in 1934 at the base of a wooded hill, it has the sweeping horizontals of international streamlined Modernism, with Janco&#x27;s innovation of diagonally placed rooms creating a striking zigzag effect.

Janco had one daughter from his marriage to Lily Ackermann, who signed her name Josine Ianco-Starrels (b. 1926), and was raised a Catholic. Her sister Claude-Simone had died in infancy. By the mid-1920s, Marcel and Lily Janco were estranged: already by the time of their divorce (1930), she was living by herself in a Brașov home designed by Janco. The artist remarried to Clara &quot;Medi&quot; Goldschlager, the sister of his old friend Jacques G. Costin. The couple had a girl, Deborah Theodora (&quot;Dadi&quot; for short).

With his new family, Janco lived a comfortable life, traveling throughout Europe and spending his summer vacations in the resort town of Balchik. The Jancos and the Costins also shared ownership of a country estate: known as &quot;Jacquesmara&quot;, it was located in Budeni-Comana, Giurgiu County. The house is especially known for hosting Clara Haskil during one of her triumphant returns to Romania.

===Between &quot;Contimporanul&quot; and &quot;Criterion&quot;===
Janco was still active as the art editor of &quot;Contimporanul&quot; during its final and most eclectic series of 1929, when he took part in selecting new young contributors, such as publicist and art critic Barbu Brezianu. At that junction, the magazine triumphantly published a &quot;Letter to Janco&quot;, in which the formerly traditionalist architect George Matei Cantacuzino spoke about his colleague&#x27;s decade-long contribution to the development of Romanian functionalism. Beyond his &quot;Contimporanul&quot; affiliation, Janco rallied with the Bucharest collective &quot;Arta Nouă&quot; (&quot;New Art&quot;), also joined by Maxy, Brauner, Mattis-Teutsch, Petrașcu, Nina Arbore, Cornelia Babic-Daniel, Alexandru Brătășanu, Olga Greceanu, Corneliu Michăilescu, Claudia Millian, Tania Șeptilici and others.

Janco and some other regulars of &quot;Contimporanul&quot; also reached out to the Surrealist faction at &quot;unu&quot; review—Janco is notably mentioned as a &quot;contributor&quot; on the cover of &quot;unu&quot;, Summer 1930 issue, where all 8 containing pages were purposefully left blank. Janco prepared woodcuts for the first edition of Vinea&#x27;s novel &quot;Paradisul suspinelor&quot; (&quot;The Paradise of Sobs&quot;), printed with Editura Cultura Națională in 1930, and for Vinea&#x27;s poems in their magazine versions. His drawings were used in illustrating two volumes of interviews with writers, compiled by &quot;Contimporanul&quot; sympathizer Felix Aderca, and Costin&#x27;s only volume of prose, the 1931 &quot;Exerciții pentru mâna dreaptă&quot; (&quot;Right-handed Exercises&quot;).

Janco attended the 1930 reunion organized by &quot;Contimporanul&quot; in honor of the visiting Futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and gave a welcoming speech. Marinetti was again praised by the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; group (Vinea, Janco, Petrașcu, Costin) in February 1934, in an open letter stating: &quot;We are soldiers of the same army.&quot; These developments created a definitive split in Romania&#x27;s avant-garde movement, and contributed to &quot;Contimporanul&quot;″s eventual fall: the Surrealists and socialists at &quot;unu&quot; condemned Vinea and the rest for having established, through Marinetti, a connection with the Italian fascists. After the incidents, Janco&#x27;s art was openly questioned by &quot;unu&quot; contributors such as Stephan Roll.

Although &quot;Contimporanul&quot; went bankrupt, an artistic faction of the same name survived until 1936. During the interval, Janco found other backers in the specialized art and architecture magazines, such as &quot;Orașul&quot;, &quot;Arta și Orașul&quot;, &quot;Rampa&quot;, &quot;Ziarul Științelor și al Călătoriilor&quot;. In 1932, his villa designs were included by Alberto Sartoris in his guide to modern architecture, &quot;Gli elementi dell&#x27;architettura razionale&quot;. The early 1930s also witnessed Janco&#x27;s participation with the literary and art society &quot;Criterion&quot;, whose leader was philosopher Mircea Eliade. The group was mostly a venue Romania&#x27;s intellectual youth, interested in redefining the national specificity around modernist values, but also offered a venue for dialogue between the far right and the far left. With Maxy, Petrașcu, Mac Constantinescu, Petre Iorgulescu-Yor, Margareta Sterian and others, Janco represented the art collective at &quot;Criterion&quot;, which, in 1933, exhibited at Dalles Hall, Bucharest. The same year, Janco erected a blockhouse for Costin (Paleologu Street, 5), which doubled as his own working address and the administrative office of &quot;Contimporanul&quot;.

From 1929, Janco&#x27;s efforts to reform the capital received administrative support from Dem. I. Dobrescu, the left-wing Mayor of Bucharest. 1934 was the year when Janco returned as architectural theorist, with &quot;Urbanism, nu romantism&quot; (&quot;Urbanism, Not Romanticism&quot;), an essay in the review &quot;Orașul&quot;. Janco&#x27;s text restated the need and opportunity for modernist urban planning, especially in Bucharest. &quot;Orașul&quot;, edited by Eliad and writer Cicerone Theodorescu, introduced him as a world-famous architect and &quot;revolutionary&quot;, praising the diversity of his contributions. In 1935, Janco published the pamphlet &quot;Către o arhitectură a Bucureștilor&quot; (&quot;Toward an Architecture of Bucharest&quot;), which recommended a &quot;utopian&quot; project to solve the city&#x27;s social crisis. Like some of his &quot;Contimporanul&quot; colleagues, he was by then collaborating with &quot;Cuvântul Liber&quot;, the self-styled &quot;moderate left-wing review&quot; and with Isac Ludo&#x27;s modernist magazine, &quot;Adam&quot;.

The mid-1930s was his most prolific period as an architect, designing more villas, more small apartment buildings, and larger ones as well. His Bazaltin Company headquarters, a mixed use project os offices and apartments that rose up to a topmost 9th floor on Jianu Square, his largest and most prominent, and still most well known (albeit abandoned), was built in 1935. The Solly Gold apartments on a corner on Hristo Botev Avenue (1934) is his best known smaller block, with interlocking angular volumes and balconies on all five sides visible, a double level apartment on the top, and a panel depicting Diana by Militia Pătraşcu by the door. Another well known design is the David Haimovici (1937) on Strada Olteni, its well kept smooth grey walls outlined in white, and a Mediterranean pergola on the top floor. The seven level Frida Cohen tower (1935) dominates a small roundabout on Stelea Spătarul Street with its curved balconies, while a six level one on Luchian Street, probably a real estate investment of his own, is more restrained, with long strip windows the main feature, and another panel by Milita Petraşcu in the lobby. Villas included one for Florica Reich (1936) on Grigore Mora, a simple rectangular volume with a double-height corner cut-out topped by an inventive gridded glass roof, and one for Hermina Hassner (1937), almost square in plan, and with almost the opposite effect, a first floor corner balcony wall pierced by a grid of small circular openings. Probably commissioned by Mircea Eliade, in 1935 Janco also designed the Alexandrescu Building, a severe four storey tenement for Eliade&#x27;s sister and her family. One of his last projects was a collaboration with Milita Petrascu for her family home and studio, the Villa Emil Pătraşcu (1937) at Pictor Ion Negulici Street 19, a boldly blocky design.

Together with Margareta Sterian, who became his disciple, Janco was working on artistic projects involving ceramics and fresco. In 1936, some works by Janco, Maxy and Petrașcu represented Romania at the Futurist art show in New York City. Throughout the period, Janco was still on demand as a draftsman: in 1934, his depiction of poet Constantin Nissipeanu opened the first print of Nisspeanu&#x27;s &quot;Metamorfoze&quot;; in 1936, he published a posthumous portrait of writer Mateiu Caragiale, to illustrate the Perpessicius edition of Caragiale&#x27;s poems. His prints also served to illustrate &quot;Sadismul adevărului&quot; (&quot;The Sadism of Truth&quot;), written by &quot;unu&quot; founder Sașa Pană.

===Persecution and departure===

By that time, the Janco family was faced with the rise of antisemitism, and alarmed by the growth of fascist movements such as the Iron Guard. In the 1920s, the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; leadership had sustained a xenophobic attack from the traditionalist review &quot;Țara Noastră&quot;. It cited Vinea&#x27;s Greek origins as a cause for concern, and described Janco as the &quot;painter of the cylinder&quot;, and an alien, cosmopolitan, Jew. That objection to Janco&#x27;s work, and to &quot;Contimporanul&quot; in general, was also taken up in 1926 by the anti-modernist essayist I. E. Torouțiu. &quot;Criterion&quot; itself split in 1934, when some of its members openly rallied with the Iron Guard, and the radical press accused the remaining ones of promoting pederasty through their public performances. Josine was expelled from Catholic school in 1935, the reason invoked being that her father was a Jew.

For Marcel Janco, the events were an opportunity to discuss his own assimilation into Romanian society: in one of his conferences, he defined himself as &quot;an artist who is a Jew&quot;, rather than &quot;a Jewish artist&quot;. He later confessed his dismay at the attacks targeting him: &quot;nowhere, never, in Romania or elsewhere in Europe, during peacetime or the cruel years of [World War I], did anyone ask me whether I was a Jew or... a kike. [...] Hitler&#x27;s Romanian minions managed to change this climate, to turn Romania into an antisemitic country.&quot; The ideological shift, he recalled, destroyed his relationships with the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; poet Ion Barbu, who reportedly concluded, after admiring a 1936 exhibit: &quot;Too bad you&#x27;re a kike!&quot; At around that time, pianist and fascist sympathizer Cella Delavrancea also assessed that Janco&#x27;s contribution to theater was the prime example of &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;bastard&quot; art.

When the antisemitic National Christian Party took power, Janco was coming to terms with the Zionist ideology, describing the Land of Israel as the &quot;cradle&quot; and &quot;salvation&quot; of Jews the world over. At Budeni, he and Costin hosted Betar paramilitaries, who were attempting to organize a Jewish self-defense movement. Janco subsequently made his first trip to British Palestine, and began arranging his and his family&#x27;s relocation there. Although Jules and his family emigrated soon after the visit, Marcel returned to Bucharest and, shortly before Jewish art was officially censored, had his one last exhibit there, together with Milița Petrașcu. He was also working on one of his last, and most experimental, contributions to Romanian architecture: the Hermina Hassner Villa (which also hosted his 1928 painting of the &quot;Jardin du Luxembourg&quot;), the Emil Petrașcu residence, and a tower behind the Atheneum.

In 1939, the Nazi-aligned Ion Gigurtu cabinet enforced racial discrimination throughout the land, and, as a consequence, &quot;Jaquesmara&quot; was confiscated by the state. Many of the Bucharest villas he had designed, which had Jewish landlords, were also taken over forcefully by the authorities. Some months after, the National Renaissance Front government prevented Janco from publishing his work anywhere in Romania, but he was still able to find a niche at &quot;Timpul&quot; daily—its anti-fascist manager, Grigore Gafencu, gave imprimatur to sketches, including the landscapes of Palestine. He was also finding work with the ghettoized Jewish community, designing the new Barașeum Studio, located in the vicinity of Caimatei.

During the first two years of World War II, although he prepared his documents and received a special passport, Janco was still undecided. He was still in Romania when the Iron Guard established its National Legionary State. He was receiving and helping Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe, and hearing from them about the concentration camp system, but refused offers to emigrate into a neutral or Allied country. His mind was made up in January 1941, when the Iron Guard&#x27;s struggle for maintaining power resulted in the Bucharest Pogrom. Janco himself was a personal witness to the violent events, noting for instance that the Nazi German bystanders would declare themselves impressed by the Guard&#x27;s murderous efficiency, or how the thugs made an example of the Jews trapped in the Choral Temple. The Străulești Abattoir murders and the stories of Jewish survivors also inspired several of Janco&#x27;s drawings. One of the victims of the Abattoir massacre was Costin&#x27;s brother Michael Goldschlager. He was kidnapped from his house by Guardsmen, and his corpse was among those found hanging on hooks, mutilated in such way as to mock the Jewish &quot;kashrut&quot; ritual.
Janco later stated that, over the course of a few days, the pogrom had made him a militant Jew. With clandestine assistance from England, Marcel, Medi and their two daughters left Romania through Constanța harbor, and arrived in Turkey on 4 February 1941. They then made their way to Islahiye and French Syria, crossing through the Kingdom of Iraq and Transjordan, and, on 23 February, ended their journey in Tel Aviv. The painter found his first employment as architect for Tel Aviv&#x27;s city government, sharing the office with a Holocaust survivor who informed him about the genocide in occupied Poland. In Romania, the new regime of &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu planned a new series of antisemitic measures and atrocities (&quot;see Holocaust in Romania&quot;). In November 1941, Costin and his wife Laura, who had stayed behind in Bucharest, were among those deported to the occupied region of Transnistria. Costin survived, joining up with his sister and with Janco in Palestine, but later moved back to Romania.

===In British Palestine and Israel===
During his years in British Palestine, Marcel Janco became a noted participant in the development of local Jewish art. He was one of the four Romanian Jewish artists who marked the development of Zionist arts and crafts before 1950—the others were Jean David, Reuven Rubin, Jacob Eisenscher; David, who was Janco&#x27;s friend in Bucharest, joined him in Tel Aviv after an adventurous trip and internment in Cyprus. In particular, Janco was an early influence on three Zionist artists who had arrived to Palestine from other regions: Avigdor Stematsky, Yehezkel Streichman and Joseph Zaritsky. He was soon recognized as a leading presence in the artist community, receiving Tel Aviv Municipality&#x27;s Dizengoff Prize in 1945, and again in 1946.

These contacts were not interrupted by the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and Janco was a figure of prominence in the art scene of independent Israel. The new nation enlisted his services as planner, and he was assigned to the team of Arieh Sharon, being tasked with designing and preserving the Israeli national parks. As a result of his intervention, in 1949 the area of Old Jaffa was turned into an artist-friendly community. He was again a recipient of the Dizengoff Prize in 1950 and 1951, resuming his activity as an art promoter and teacher, with lectures at the &quot;Seminar HaKibbutzim&quot; college (1953). His artwork was again on show in New York City for a 1950 retrospective. In 1952 he was one of three artists whose work was displayed at the Israeli pavilion at the Venice Biennale, the first year Israel had its own pavilion at the Biennale. The other two artists were Reuven Rubin and Moshe Mokady.

Marcel Janco began his main Israeli project in May 1953, after he had been mandated by the Israeli government to prospect the mountainous regions and delimit a new national park south of Mount Carmel. In his own account (since disputed by others), he came across the deserted village of Ein Hod, whose Palestinian inhabitants had been largely displaced during the 1948 expulsion. Janco felt that the place should not be demolished, obtaining a lease on it from the authorities, and rebuilt the place with other Israeli artists who worked there on weekends; Janco&#x27;s main residence continued to be in the neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. His plot of land in Ein Hod was previously owned by the Arab Abu Faruq, who died in 1991 at the Jenin refugee camp. Janco became the site&#x27;s first mayor, reorganizing it into a utopian society, art colony and tourist attraction, and instituted the strict code of requirements for one&#x27;s settlement in Ein Hod.
Also in the 1950s, Janco was a founding member of &quot;Ofakim Hadashim&quot; (&quot;New Horizons&quot;) group, comprising Israeli painters committed to abstract art, and headed by Zaritsky. Although he shared the artistic vision, Janco probably did not approve of Zaritsky&#x27;s rejection of all narrative art and, in 1956, left the group. He continued to explore new media, and, together with artisan Itche Mambush, he created a series of reliefs and tapestries. Janco also drew in pastel, and created humorous illustrations to &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

His individual contributions received further praise from his peers and his public: in 1958, he was honored with the Histadrut union&#x27;s prize. Over the next two decades, Marcel Janco had several new personal exhibits, notably in Tel Aviv (1959, 1972), Milan (1960) and Paris (1963). Having attended the 1966 Venice Biennale, he won the Israel Prize of 1967, in recognition of his work as painter.

In 1960, Janco&#x27;s presence in Ein Hod was challenged by the returning Palestinians, who tried to reclaim the land. He organized a community defense force, headed by sculptor Tuvia Iuster, which guarded Ein Hod until Israel Police intervened against the protesters. Janco was generally tolerant of those Palestinians who set up the small rival community of Ein Hawd: he notably maintained contacts with tribal leader Abu Hilmi and with Arab landscape artist Muin Zaydan Abu al-Hayja, but the relationship between the two villages was generally distant. Janco has also been described as &quot;disinterested&quot; in the fate of his Arab neighbors.

For a second time, Janco reunited with Costin when the latter fled Communist Romania. The writer was a political refugee, singled out at home for &quot;Zionist&quot; activities, and implicated in the show trial of Milița Petrașcu. Costin later left Israel, settling in France. Janco himself made efforts to preserve a link with Romania, and sent albums to his artist friends beyond the Iron Curtain. He met with folklorist and former political prisoner Harry Brauner, poet Ștefan Iureș, painter Matilda Ulmu and art historian Geo Șerban. His studio was home to other Jewish Romanian emigrants fleeing communism, including female artist Liana Saxone-Horodi. From Israel, he spoke about his Romanian experience at length, first in an interview with writer Solo Har and then in a 1980 article for &quot;Shevet Romania&quot; magazine. A year later, from his home in Australia, the modernist promoter Lucian Boz headlined a selection of his works with Janco&#x27;s portrait of the author.

Also in 1981, a selection of Janco&#x27;s drawings of Holocaust crimes was issued with the Am Oved album &quot;Kav Haketz/On the Edge&quot;. The following year, he received the &quot;Worthy of Tel Aviv&quot; distinction, granted by the city government. One of the last public events to be attended by Marcel Janco was the creation of the Janco-Dada Museum at his home in Ein Hod. By then, Janco is said to have been concerned about the overall benefits of Jewish relocation into an Arab village. Among his final appearances in public was a 1984 interview with Schweizer Fernsehen station, in which he revisited his Dada activities.

==Work==

===From Iser&#x27;s Postimpressionism to Expressionist Dada===
The earliest works by Janco show the influence of Iosif Iser, adopting the visual trappings of Postimpressionism and illustrating, for the first time in Janco&#x27;s career, the interest in modern composition techniques; Liana Saxone-Horodi believes that Iser&#x27;s manner is most evident in Janco&#x27;s 1911 work, &quot;Self-portrait with Hat&quot;, preserved at the Janco-Dada Museum. Around 1913, Janco was in more direct contact with the French sources of Iser&#x27;s Postimpressionism, having by then discovered on his own the work of André Derain. However, his covers and vignettes for &quot;Simbolul&quot; are generally Art Nouveau and Symbolist to the point of pastiche. Researcher Tom Sandqvist presumes that Janco was in effect following his friends&#x27; command, as &quot;his own preferences were soon closer to Cézanne and cubist-influenced modes of expression&quot;.

Futurism was thrown into the mix, a fact acknowledged by Janco during his 1930 encounter with Marinetti: &quot;we were nourished by [Futurist] ideas and empowered to be enthusiastic.&quot; A third major source for Janco&#x27;s imagery was Expressionism, initially coming to him from both &quot;Die Brücke&quot; artists and Oskar Kokoschka, and later reactivated by his contacts at &quot;Der Sturm&quot;. Among his early canvasses, the self-portraits and the portraits of clowns have been discussed as particularly notable samples of Romanian Expressionism.

The influence of Germanic Postimpressionism on Janco&#x27;s art was crystallized during his studies at the Federal Institute of Technology. His more important teachers there, Sandqvist observes, were sculptor Johann Jakob Graf and architect Karl Moser—the latter in particular, for his ideas on the architectural &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;. Sandqvist suggests that, after modernizing Moser&#x27;s ideas, Janco first theorized that Abstract-Expressionistic decorations needed to an integral part of the basic architectural design. In paintings from Janco&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret Voltaire&quot; period, the figurative element is not canceled, but usually subdued: the works show a mix of influences, primarily from Cubism or Futurism, and have been described by Janco&#x27;s colleague Arp as &quot;zigzag naturalism&quot;. His series on dancers, painted before 1917 and housed by the Israel Museum, moves between the atmospheric qualities of a Futurism filtered through Dada and Janco&#x27;s first experiments in purely abstract art.

His assimilation of Expressionism has led scholar John Willett to discuss Dadaism as visually an Expressionist sub-current, and, in retrospect, Janco himself claimed that Dada was not as much a fully-fledged new artistic style as &quot;a force coming from the physical instincts&quot;, directed against &quot;everything cheap&quot;. However, his own work also features the quintessentially Dada found object art, or everyday objects rearranged as art—reportedly, he was the first Dadaist to experiment in such manner. His other studies, in collage and relief, have been described by reviewers as &quot;a personal synthesis which is identifiable as his own to this day&quot;, and ranked among &quot;the most courageous and original experiments in abstract art.&quot;

The &quot;Contimporanul&quot; years were a period of artistic exploration. Although a Constructivist architect and designer, Janco was still identifiable as an Expressionist in his ink-drawn portraits of writers and in some of his canvasses. According to scholar Dan Grigorescu, his essays of the time fluctuate away from Constructivism, and adopt ideas common in Expressionism, Surrealism, or even the Byzantine revival suggested by anti-modernist reviews. His &quot;Rolling the Dice&quot; piece is a meditation on the tragedy of human existence, which reinterprets the symbolism of zodiacs and probably alludes to the seedier side of urban life. The Expressionist transfiguration of shapes was especially noted in his drawings of Mateiu Caragiale and Stephan Roll, created from harsh and seemingly spontaneous lines. The style was ridiculed at the time by traditionalist poet George Topîrceanu, who wrote that, in &quot;Antologia poeților de azi&quot;, Ion Barbu looked &quot;a Mongolian bandit&quot;, Felix Aderca &quot;a shoemaker&#x27;s apprentice&quot;, and Alice Călugăru &quot;an alcoholic fishwife&quot;. Such views were contrasted by Perpessicius&#x27; publicized belief that Janco was &quot;the purest artist&quot;, his drawings evidencing the &quot;great vital force&quot; of his subjects. Topîrceanu&#x27;s claim is contradicted by literary historian Barbu Cioculescu, who finds the &quot;Antologia&quot; drawings: &quot;exquisitely synthetic—some of them masterpieces; take it from someone who has seen from up close many of the writers portrayed&quot;.

===Primitive and collective art===
As a Dada, Janco was interested in the raw and primitive art, generated by &quot;the instinctive power of creation&quot;, and he credited Paul Klee with having helped him &quot;interpret the soul of primitive man&quot;. A distinct application of Dada was his own work with masks, seen by Hugo Ball as having generated fascination with their unusual &quot;kinetic power&quot;, and useful for performing &quot;larger-than-life characters and passions.&quot; However, Janco&#x27;s understanding of African masks, idols and ritual was, according to art historians Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, &quot;deeply romanticized&quot; and &quot;reductive&quot;.

At the end of the Dada episode, Janco also took his growing interest in primitivism to the level of academia: in his 1918 speech at the Zürich Institute, he declared that African, Etruscan, Byzantine and Romanesque arts were more genuine and &quot;spiritual&quot; than the Renaissance and its derivatives, while also issuing special praise for the modern spirituality of Derain, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse; his lecture rated all Cubists above all Impressionists. In his contribution to &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot; theory, he spoke about a return to the handicrafts, ending the &quot;divorce&quot; between art and life. Art critic Harry Seiwert also notes that Janco&#x27;s art also reflected his contact with various other alternative models, found in Ancient Egyptian and Far Eastern art, in the paintings of Cimabue and El Greco, and in Cloisonnism. Seiwert and Sandqvist both propose that Janco&#x27;s work had other enduring connections with the visual conventions of Hassidism and the dark tones often favored by 20th-century Jewish art.

Around 1919, Janco had come to describe Constructivism as a needed transition from &quot;negative&quot; Dada, an idea also pioneered by his colleagues Kurt Schwitters and Theo van Doesburg, and finding an early expression in Janco&#x27;s plaster relief &quot;Soleil jardin clair&quot; (1918). In part, Janco&#x27;s post-Dadaism responded to the socialist ideals of Constructivism. According to Sandqvist, his affiliation to &quot;Das Neue Leben&quot; and his sporadic contacts with the Art Soviet of Munich meant that he was trying to &quot;adjust to the spirit of the age.&quot; Historian Hubert F. van der Berg also notes that the socialist ideal of &quot;a new life&quot;, implicitly adopted by Janco, was a natural peacetime development of Dada&#x27;s discourse about &quot;the new man&quot;.

The activity at &quot;Contimporanul&quot; cemented Janco&#x27;s belief in primitivism and the values of outsider art. In a 1924 piece, he argued: &quot;The art of children, folk art, the art of psychopaths, of primitive people are the liveliest ones, the most expressive ones, coming to us from organic depths, without cultivated beauty.&quot; He ridiculed, like Ion Vinea before him, the substance of Romania&#x27;s academic traditionalism, notably in a provocative drawing which showed a grazing donkey under the title &quot;Tradition&quot;. Instead, Janco was publicizing the idea that Dada and various other strands of modernism were the actual tradition, for being indirectly indebted to the absurdist nature of Romanian folklore. The matter of Janco&#x27;s own debt to his country&#x27;s peasant art is more controversial. In the 1920s, Vinea discussed Janco&#x27;s Cubism is a direct echo of an old abstract art that is supposedly native and exclusive to Romania—an assumption considered exaggerated by Paul Cernat. Seiwert suggests that virtually none of Janco&#x27;s paintings show a verifiable contact with Romanian primitivism, but his opinion is questioned by Sandqvist: he writes that Janco&#x27;s masks and prints are homages to traditional Romanian decorative patterns.

===Beyond Constructivism===
For a while, Janco rediscovered himself in abstract and semi-abstract art, describing the basic geometrical shapes as pure forms, and art as the effort to organize these forms—ideas akin with the &quot;picto-poetry&quot; of Romanian avant-garde writers such as Ilarie Voronca. After 1930, when Constructivism lost its position of leadership on Romania&#x27;s artistic scene, Janco made a return to &quot;analytic&quot; Cubism, echoing the early work of Picasso in his painting &quot;Peasant Woman and Eggs&quot;. This period centered on semi-figurative cityscapes, which, according to critics such as Alexandru D. Broșteanu and Sorin Alexandrescu, stand out for their objectification of the human figure. Also then, Janco worked on seascape and still life canvasses, in brown tones and Cubist arrangements. Diversification touched his other activities. His theory of set design still mixed Expressionism into Futurism and Constructivism, calling for an actor-based Expressionist theater and a mechanized, movement-based, cinema. However, his parallel work in costume design evidenced a toning down of avant-garde tendencies (to the displeasure of his colleagues at &quot;Integral&quot; magazine), and a growing preoccupation with &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

In discussing architecture, Janco described himself and the other &quot;Artistes Radicaux&quot; as the mentors of Europe&#x27;s modernist urban planners, including Bruno Taut and the &quot;Bauhaus&quot; group. The ideals of collectivism in art, &quot;art as life&quot;, and a &quot;Constructivist revolution&quot; dominated his programmatic texts of the mid-1920s, which offered as examples the activism of &quot;De Stijl&quot;, &quot;Blok&quot; and Soviet Constructivist architecture. His own architectural work was entirely dedicated to functionalism: in his words, the purpose of architecture was a &quot;harmony of forms&quot;, with designs as simplified as to resemble crystals. His experiment on Trinității Street, with its angular pattern and multicolored facade, has been rated one of the most spectacular samples of Romanian modernism, while the buildings he designed later came with Art Deco elements, including the &quot;ocean liner&quot;-type balconies. At the other end, his Predeal sanatorium was described by Sandqvist as &quot;a long, narrow white building clearly signaling its function as a hospital&quot; and &quot;smoothly adapting to the landscape.&quot; Functionalism was further illustrated by Janco&#x27;s ideas on furniture design, where he favored &quot;small heights&quot;, &quot;simple aesthetics&quot;, as well as &quot;a maximum of comfort&quot; which would &quot;pay no tribute to richness&quot;.

Scholars have also noted that &quot;the breath of humanitarianism&quot; unites the work of Janco, Maxy and Corneliu Michăilescu, beyond their shared eclecticism. Cernat nevertheless suggests that the &quot;Contimporanul&quot; group was politically disengaged and making efforts to separate art from politics, giving positive coverage to both Marxism and Italian fascism. In that context, a more evidently Marxist form of Constructivism, close to Proletkult, was being taken up independently by Maxy. Janco&#x27;s functionalist goal was still coupled with socialist imagery, as in &quot;Către o arhitectură a Bucureștilor&quot;, called an architectural &quot;tikkun olam&quot; by Sandqvist. Indebted to Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;New Architecture&quot;, Janco theorized that Bucharest had the &quot;luck&quot; of not yet being systematized or built-up, and that it could be easily turned into a garden city, without ever repeating the West&#x27;s &quot;chain of mistakes&quot;. According to architecture historians Mihaela Criticos and Ana Maria Zahariade, Janco&#x27;s creed was not in fact radically different from mainstream Romanian opinions: &quot;although declaring themselves committed to the modernist agenda, [Janco and others] nuance it with their own formulas, away from the abstract utopias of the International Style.&quot; A similar point is made by Sorin Alexandrescu, who attested a &quot;general contradiction&quot; in Janco&#x27;s architecture, that between Janco&#x27;s own wishes and those of his patrons.

===Holocaust art and Israeli abstractionism===
Soon after his first visit to Palestine and his Zionist conversion, Janco began painting landscapes in optimistic tones, including a general view over Tiberias and bucolic watercolors. By the time of World War II, however, he was again an Expressionist, fascinated with the major existential themes. The war experience inspired his 1945 painting &quot;Fascist Genocide&quot;, which is also seen by Grigorescu as one of his contributions to Expressionism. Janco&#x27;s sketches of the Bucharest Pogrom are, according to cultural historian David G. Roskies, &quot;extraordinary&quot; and in complete break with Janco&#x27;s &quot;earlier surrealistic style&quot;; he paraphrases the rationale for this change as: &quot;Why bother with surrealism when the world itself has gone crazy?&quot; According to the painter&#x27;s own definition: &quot;I was drawing with the thirst of one who is being chased around, desperate to quench it and find his refuge.&quot; As he recalled, these works were not well received in the post-war Zionist community, because they evoked painful memories in a general mood of optimism; as a result, Janco decided to change his palette and tackle subjects which related exclusively to his new country. An exception to this self-imposed rule was the motif of &quot;wounded soldiers&quot;, which continued to preoccupy him after 1948, and was also thematically linked to the wartime massacres.

During and after his &quot;Ofakim Hadashim&quot; engagement, Marcel Janco again moved into the realm of pure abstraction, which he believed represented the artistic &quot;language&quot; of a new age. This was an older idea, as first illustrated by his 1925 attempt to create an &quot;alphabet of shapes&quot;, the basis for any abstractionist composition. His subsequent preoccupations were linked to the Jewish tradition of interpreting symbols, and he reportedly told scholar Moshe Idel: &quot;I paint in &quot;Kabbalah&quot;&quot;. He was still eclectic beyond abstractionism, and made frequent returns to brightly colored, semi-figurative, landscapes. Also eclectic is Janco&#x27;s sparse contribution to the architecture of Israel, including a Herzliya Pituah villa that is entirely built in the non-modernist &quot;Poble Espanyol&quot; style. Another component of Janco&#x27;s work was his revisiting of earlier Dada experiments: he redid some of his Dada masks, and supported the international avant-garde group &quot;NO!art&quot;. He later worked on the &quot;Imaginary Animals&quot; cycle of paintings, inspired by the short stories of Urmuz.

Meanwhile, his Ein Hod project was in various ways the culmination of his promotion of folk art, and, in Janco&#x27;s own definition, &quot;my last Dada activity&quot;. According to some interpretations, he may have been directly following the example of Hans Arp&#x27;s &quot;Waggis&quot; commune, which existed in 1920s Switzerland. Anthropologist Susan Slyomovics argues that the Ein Hod project as a whole was an alternative to the standard practice of Zionist colonization, since, instead of creating new buildings in the ancient scenery, it showed attempts to cultivate the existing Arab-style masonry. She also writes that Janco&#x27;s landscapes of the place &quot;romanticize&quot; his own contact with the Palestinians, and that they fail to clarify whether he thought of Arabs as refugees or as fellow inhabitants. Journalist Esther Zanberg describes Janco as an &quot;Orientalist&quot; driven by &quot;the mythology surrounding Israeli nationalistic Zionism.&quot; Art historian Nissim Gal also concludes: &quot;the pastoral vision of Janco [does not] include any trace of the inhabitants of the former Arab village&quot;.

==Legacy==

Admired by his contemporaries on the avant-garde scene, Marcel Janco is mentioned or portrayed in several works by Romanian authors. In the 1910s, Vinea dedicated him the poem &quot;Tuzla&quot;, which is one of his first contributions to modernist literature; a decade later, one of the Janco exhibits inspired him to write the prose poem &quot;Danțul pe frânghie&quot; (&quot;Dancing on a Wire&quot;). Following his conflict with the painter, Tzara struck out all similar dedications from his own poems. Before their friendship waned, Ion Barbu also contributed a homage to Janco, referring to his Constructivist paintings as &quot;storms of protractors&quot;. In addition, Janco was dedicated a poem by Belgian artist Émile Malespine, and is mentioned in one of Marinetti&#x27;s poetic texts about the 1930 visit to Romania, as well as in the verse of neo-Dadaist Valery Oisteanu. Janco&#x27;s portrait was painted by colleague Victor Brauner, in 1924.

According to Sandqvist, there are three competing aspects in Janco&#x27;s legacy, which relate to the complexity of his profile: &quot;In Western cultural history Marcel Janco is best known as one of the founding members of Dada in Zürich in 1916. Regarding the Romanian avant-garde in the interwar period Marcel Hermann Iancu is more known as the spider in the web and as the designer of a great number of Romania&#x27;s first constructivist buildings [...]. On the other hand, in Israel Marcel Janco is best known as the &#x27;father&#x27; of the artists&#x27; colony of Ein Hod [...] and for his pedagogic achievements in the young Jewish state.&quot; Janco&#x27;s memory is principally maintained by his Ein Hod museum. The building was damaged by the 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire, but reopened and grew to include a permanent exhibit of Janco&#x27;s art. Janco&#x27;s paintings still have a measurable impact on the contemporary Israeli avant-garde, which is largely divided between the abstractionism he helped introduce and the neorealistic disciples of Michail Grobman and Avraham Ofek.

The Romanian communist regime, which cracked down on modernism, reconfirmed the confiscation of villas built by the &quot;Birou de Studii Moderne&quot;, which it then leased to other families. One of these lodgings, the Wexler Villa, was assigned as the residence of communist poet Eugen Jebeleanu. The regime tended to ignore Janco&#x27;s contributions, which were not listed in the architectural who&#x27;s who, and it became standard practice to generally omit references to his Jewish ethnicity. He was however honored with a special issue of &quot;Secolul 20&quot; literary magazine, in 1979, and interviewed for &quot;Tribuna&quot; and &quot;Luceafărul&quot; journals (1981, 1984). His architectural legacy was affected by the large-scale demolition program of the 1980s. Most of the buildings were spared, however, because they are scattered throughout residential Bucharest. Some 20 of his Bucharest structures were still standing twenty years later, but the lack of a renovation program and the shortages of late communism brought steady decay.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marcel Janco&#x27;s buildings were subject to legal battles, as the original owners and their descendants were allowed to contest the nationalization. These landmarks, like other modernist assets, became treasured real estate: in 1996, a Janco house was valued at 500,000 United States dollars. The sale of such property happened at a fast pace, reportedly surpassing the standardized conservation effort, and experts noted with alarm that Janco villas were being defaced with anachronistic additions, such as insulated glazing and structural interventions, or eclipsed by the newer highrise. In 2008, despite calls from within the academic community, only three of his buildings had been inscribed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.

Janco was again being referenced as a possible model for new generations of Romanian architects and urban planners. In a 2011 article, poet and architect August Ioan claimed: &quot;Romanian architecture is, apart from its few years with Marcel Janco, one that has denied itself experimentation, projective thinking, anticipation. [...] it is content with imports, copies, nuances or pure and simple stagnation.&quot; This stance is contrasted by that of designer Radu Comșa, who argues that praise for Janco often lacks &quot;the recoil of objectivity&quot;. Janco&#x27;s programmatic texts on the issue were collected and reviewed by historian Andrei Pippidi in the 2003 retrospective anthology &quot;București – Istorie și urbanism&quot; (&quot;Bucharest. History and Urban Planning&quot;). Following a proposal formulated by poet and publicist Nicolae Tzone at the Bucharest Conference on Surrealism, in 2001, Janco&#x27;s sketch for Vinea&#x27;s &quot;country workshop&quot; was used in designing Bucharest&#x27;s ICARE, the Institute for the Study of the Romanian and European Avant-garde. The Bazaltin building was used as the offices of TVR Cultural station.

In the realm of visual arts, curators Anca Bocăneț and Dana Herbay organized a centennial Marcel Janco exhibit at the Bucharest Museum of Art (MNAR), with additional contributions from writer Magda Cârneci. In 2000, his work was featured in the &quot;Jewish Art of Romania&quot; retrospective, hosted by Cotroceni Palace. The local art market rediscovered Janco&#x27;s art, and, in June 2009, one of his seascapes sold in auction for 130,000 Euro, the second largest sum ever fetched by a painting in Romania. There was a noted increase in his overall market value, and he became interesting to art forgers.

Outside Romania, Janco&#x27;s work has been reviewed in specialized monographs by Harry Seiwert (1993) and Michael Ilk (2001). His work as painter and sculptor has been dedicated special exhibits in Berlin, Essen (Museum Folkwang) and Budapest, while his architecture was presented abroad with exhibitions at the Technical University Munich and Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv. Among the events showcasing Janco&#x27;s art, some focused exclusively on his rediscovered Holocaust paintings and drawings. These shows include &quot;On the Edge&quot; (Yad Vashem, 1990) and &quot;Destine la răscruce&quot; (&quot;Destinies at Crossroads&quot;, MNAR, 2011). His canvasses and collages went on sale at Bonhams and Sotheby&#x27;s.

<text>The taskbar is a graphical user interface element that has been part of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95, displaying and facilitating switching between running programs. The taskbar and the associated Start Menu were created and named in 1993 by Daniel Oran, a program manager at Microsoft who had previously collaborated on great ape language research with the behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner at Harvard.

The taskbar is an exemplar of a category of always-visible graphical user interface elements that provide access to fundamental operating system functions and information. At the time of its introduction in 1995, the taskbar was unique among such elements because it provided the user with a means of switching between running programs through a single click of the pointing device.

Since the introduction of Windows 95, other operating systems have incorporated graphical user interface elements that closely resemble the taskbar or have similar features. The designs vary, but generally include a strip along one edge of the screen. Icons or textual descriptions on this strip correspond to open windows. Clicking the icons or text enables the user to easily switch between windows, with the active window often appearing differently from the others on the strip. In some versions of recent operating systems, users can &quot;pin&quot; programs or files to this strip for quick access. In many cases, there is also a notification area, which includes interactive icons that display real-time information about the computer system and some of the running programs.

With the rapid evolution of operating systems and graphical user interfaces, items that are native to each operating system have been included in the various designs.

== Antecedents ==

=== Windows 1.0 ===
Windows 1.0, released in 1985, features a horizontal bar located at the bottom of the screen where running programs reside when minimized (referred to as &quot;iconization&quot; at the time), represented by icons. A window can be minimized by double-clicking its title bar, dragging it onto an empty spot on the bar, or by issuing a command from one of its menus. A minimized window is restored by double-clicking its icon or dragging the icon out of the bar.

The bar features multiple slots for icons and expands vertically to provide the user with more rows as more slots are needed. Its color is the same as that of the screen background, which can be customized. Minimized windows can be freely placed in any of the empty slots. Program windows cannot overlap the bar unless maximized.

The Start button did not make an appearance in these early implementations of the taskbar, and would be introduced at a much later date with the release of Windows 95.
=== Arthur ===
Another early implementation can be seen in the Arthur operating system from Acorn Computers. It is called the &quot;icon bar&quot; and remains an essential part of Arthur&#x27;s succeeding RISC OS operating system. The icon bar holds icons which represent mounted disc drives and RAM discs, running applications and system utilities. These icons have their own context-sensitive menus and support drag and drop behaviour.

=== Amiga ===
AmigaOS featured various third party implementations of the taskbar concept, and this inheritance is present also in its successors. For example, AmiDock, born as third-party utility, has then been integrated into AmigaOS 3.9 and AmigaOS 4.0. The AROS operating system has its version of Amistart that is provided with the OS and free to be installed by users, while MorphOS has been equipped with a dock utility just like in AmigaOS or Mac OS X.

== Microsoft Windows ==
The default settings for the taskbar in Microsoft Windows place it at the bottom of the screen and includes from left to right the Start menu button, Quick Launch bar, taskbar buttons, and notification area. The Quick Launch toolbar was added with the Windows Desktop Update and is not enabled by default in Windows XP. Windows 7 removed the Quick Launch feature in favor of pinning applications to the taskbar itself. In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, a hotspot located in the bottom-left corner of the screen replaced the Start button, although this change was reverted in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.

The Windows 95 taskbar buttons evolved from an earlier task-switching design by Daniel Oran, a program manager at Microsoft, that featured file-folder-like tabs across the top of the screen, similar to those that later appeared in web browsers. For this reason, the taskbar was originally intended to be at the top of the screen. But the final configuration of Windows 95 put the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, replacing a user interface element called the tray that had been borrowed from Microsoft&#x27;s Cairo project. Windows 95 OSR 2.5 would add the Quick Launch toolbar. 

With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft changed the behavior of the taskbar to take advantage of Fitts&#x27;s law by removing a border of pixels surrounding the Start button which did not activate the menu, allowing the menu to be activated by clicking directly in the corner of the screen. Icons in the notification area could now be hidden to save space and revealed with the arrow button.For Windows Vista, the taskbar remained functionally the same but received a visual overhaul to align the new Windows Aero design language, introducing transparency effects to the taskbar, and a start button that now slightly overlapped the content displayed above the taskbar.With Windows 7 saw the first major redesign of the taskbar since its introduction with larger application icons, the ability to pin application to the taskbar so that they&#x27;re shown even if they aren&#x27;t running, and hiding the application names by default. Quick Launch was also disabled by default. Users still had the option to show the application labels and reduce the taskbar height to create a taskbar similar to the design used in Windows Vista. At the right side of the taskbar, the Aero Peak button was added, allowing users to quickly view the contents of the desktop and their widgets by hovering over the button, or minimize all applications by clicking on it.Windows 8 introduced no functional changes to the taskbar, but replaced the Start button and Aero Peek button with hot corners for desktop users. Tablet users could now use the Charms bar. Windows 8.1 restored the Start button, and with Windows 8.1 Update, it was now possible to see Metro apps on the taskbar and pin them, as well as to access the taskbar while on the Start screen.

Windows 10, version 1507 added various major changes to the taskbar. A search bar was now shown by default that could be replaced with a search button or be hidden, when Cortana was available, the search function was replaced with the digital assistant. The Task View button allowed users to quickly view their running apps and desktops. A button to open the Action Center was also added on the left hand side of the clock, before being moved to the right hand side in Windows 10, version 1607. Additionally, the taskbar would now change when Windows was set to tablet mode, hiding the pinned and running apps and collapsing the search bar into a search icon. It would also show a back button.



=== Taskbar elements ===
* The Start button, a button that invokes the Start menu (or the Start screen in Windows 8.1). It appears in Windows 9x, Windows NT 4.0 and all its successors, except Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
* The Quick Launch bar, introduced on Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 through the Windows Desktop Update for Internet Explorer 4 and bundled with Windows 95 OSR 2.5 Windows 98, contains shortcuts to applications. Windows provides default entries, such as &quot;Launch Internet Explorer Browser&quot;, and the user or third-party software may add any further shortcuts that they choose. A single click on the application&#x27;s icon in this area launches the application. This section may not always be present: for example it is turned off by default in Windows XP and Windows 7.
* The Windows shell places a taskbar button on the taskbar whenever an application creates an unowned window: that is, a window that does not have a parent and that is created according to normal Windows user interface guidelines. Typically all Single Document Interface applications have a single taskbar button for each open window, although modal windows may also appear there.
** Windows 98 and Windows Desktop Update for Windows 95 introduced the ability to minimize foreground windows by clicking their button on the taskbar. They also introduced DeskBands (band objects).
** Windows 2000 introduced balloon notifications.
** Windows Me added an option to disable moving or resizing the taskbar.
** Windows XP introduced &quot;taskbar grouping&quot;, which can group the taskbar buttons of several windows from the same application into a single button. This button pops up a menu listing all the grouped windows when clicked. This keeps the taskbar from being overcrowded when many windows are open at once.
** Windows Vista introduced window previews which show thumbnail views of the application in real-time. This capability is provided by the Desktop Window Manager. The Start menu tooltip no longer says &quot;Click here to begin&quot; but now says simply &quot;Start&quot;.
** Windows 7 introduced jumplists which are menus that provide shortcuts to recently opened documents, frequently opened documents, folders paths (in case of Windows Explorer), or various options (called Tasks) which apply to that specific program or pinned website shortcut. Jump lists appear when the user right-clicks on an icon in the taskbar or drags the icon upwards with the mouse left click. Recent and frequent files and folders can be pinned inside the jump list.
** Windows 7 introduced the ability to pin applications to the taskbar so that buttons for launching them appear when they are not running. Previously, the Quick Launch was used to pin applications to the taskbar; however, running programs appeared as a separate button.
** Windows 7 removed several classic taskbar features.
** Windows 11 removed &quot;taskbar grouping&quot;, possibly to have the functionality to move the taskbar to the left side of the screen, etc., but the old taskbar could be reactivated.
* are minimized functional, long-running programs, such as Windows Media Player. Programs that minimize to deskbands are not displayed in the taskbar.
* The is the portion of the taskbar that displays icons for system and program features that have no presence on the desktop as well as the time and the volume icon. It contains mainly icons that show status information, though some programs, such as Winamp, use it for minimized windows. By default, this is located in the bottom-right of the primary monitor (or bottom-left on languages of Windows that use right-to-left reading order), or at the bottom of the taskbar if docked vertically. The clock appears here, and applications can put icons in the notification area to indicate the status of an operation or to notify the user about an event. For example, an application might put a printer icon in the status area to show that a print job is under way, or a display driver application may provide quick access to various screen resolutions. The notification area is commonly referred to as the system tray, which Microsoft states is wrong, although the term is sometimes used in Microsoft documentation, articles, software descriptions, and even applications from Microsoft such as Bing Desktop. Raymond Chen suggests the confusion originated with systray.exe, a small application that controlled some icons within the notification area in Windows 95. The notification area is also referred to as the status area by Microsoft. In the current edition of Microsoft Writing Style Guide, Microsoft has clarified that beginning with Windows 11, system tray is now the preferred term, while notification area is the term used in Windows 10 and Windows 8.
** In older versions of Windows the notification area icons were limited to 16 colors. Windows Me added support for high color notification area icons.
** Starting with Windows XP, the user can choose to always show or hide some icons, or hide them if inactive for some time. A button allows the user to reveal all the icons.
** Starting with Windows Vista, the taskbar notification area is split into two areas: one reserved for system icons including clock, volume, network and power; the other for applications.
** Starting with Windows 7, the system icons and applications are shown in the same area again.
** Starting with Windows 11, the separate volume, network, and power icons are combined into a single button that opens a quick settings menu when clicked. The clock and notification center buttons are also combined.
* Since the Windows 95 Desktop Update, the Quick Launch bar featured as one of its default shortcuts which automatically minimizes all opened applications, redundant with the Winkey-D key combination. On Windows 7, a dedicated Show desktop button was placed to the right of the notification area and could not be removed. With the &quot;Peek&quot; option enabled, hovering over the button hides all opened windows to expose the desktop (leaving outlines of them on-screen). On Windows 10, the &quot;Show desktop&quot; widget changed yet again, being reduced to a narrow iconless strip at the far right of the taskbar. On Windows 11, the &quot;Show Desktop&quot; widget can be disabled from the taskbar settings.

=== Customization ===
The Windows taskbar can be modified by users in several ways. The position of the taskbar can be changed to appear on any edge of the primary display (except in Windows 11, where the taskbar is permanently fixed at the bottom of the screen and cannot be moved to the top, left, or right side). Up to and including Windows Server 2008, the taskbar is constrained to single display, although third-party utilities such as UltraMon allow it to span multiple displays. When the taskbar is displayed vertically on versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista, the Start menu button will only display the text &quot;Start&quot; or translated equivalent if the taskbar is wide enough to show the full text. However, the edge of the taskbar (in any position) can be dragged to control its height (width for a vertical taskbar); this is especially useful for a vertical taskbar to show window titles next to the window icons.

Users can resize the height (or width when displayed vertically) of the taskbar up to half of the display area. To avoid inadvertent resizing or repositioning of the taskbar, Windows XP and later lock the taskbar by default. When unlocked, &quot;grips&quot; are displayed next to the movable elements which allow grabbing with the mouse to move and size. These grips slightly decrease amount of available space in the taskbar.

The taskbar as a whole can be hidden until the mouse pointer is moved to the display edge, or has keyboard focus. The Windows 7+ taskbar does not allow pinning any arbitrary folder to the taskbar, it gets pinned instead to the jumplist of a pinned Explorer shortcut, however third party utilities such as Winaero&#x27;s Taskbar Pinner can be used to pin any type of shortcut to the taskbar.

=== Desktop toolbars ===
Other toolbars, known as &quot;Deskbands&quot;, may be added to the taskbar. This feature, along with many other taskbar features is currently absent in Windows 11. Windows includes the following deskbands but does not display them by default (except the Quick Launch toolbar in certain versions and configurations).
* Address. Contains an address bar similar to that found in Internet Explorer. (not available in Windows XP SP3, due to legal restrictions).
* Windows Media Player. Optionally shown when the Windows Media Player is minimized.(Windows XP, Windows Vista)
* Links. Shortcuts to items located in the user&#x27;s Links folder. Usually shortcuts to internet sites.
* Tablet PC Input Panel. Contains a button to show the Tablet PC input panel for ink text entry.
* Desktop. Contains shortcuts to items contained on the user&#x27;s desktop. Since the taskbar is always shown, this provides easy access to desktop items without having to minimize applications.
* Quick Launch. Contains shortcuts to Internet Explorer, email applications and a link to display the desktop. Windows Vista adds a link to the Flip 3D feature.
* Language. Contains shortcuts to quickly change the desired language for the keyboard to follow.

In addition to deskbands, Windows supports &quot;Application Desktop Toolbars&quot; (also called &quot;appbands&quot;) that supports creating additional toolbars that can dock to any side of the screen, and cannot be overlaid by other applications.

Users can add additional toolbars that display the contents of folders. The display for toolbars that represent folder items (such as Links, Desktop and Quick Launch) can be changed to show large icons and the text for each item. Prior to Windows Vista, the Desktop Toolbars could be dragged off the taskbar and float independently, or docked to a display edge. Windows Vista greatly limited, but did not eliminate the ability to have desktop toolbar not attached to the taskbar. Windows 7 has deprecated the use of Floating Deskbands altogether; they only appear pinned into the taskbar.

* Upon opening the taskbar properties on Windows 95 and Windows 98 whilst holding down the CTRL key, an extra tab for DeskBar Options is shown, but no part of it can be used. The DeskBar option was a feature that was never included within these versions of Windows.

== macOS ==
Classic Mac OS did not display a taskbar onscreen by default. Application switching prior to Mac OS 8.5 was done by clicking on an application&#x27;s window or via a pull-down menu at the right end of the menu bar. Prior to version 8.5 the menu&#x27;s title was the icon of the foreground application. Version 8.5 introduced the ability to optionally also display the application name and to &quot;tear off&quot; the menu by dragging the title with the mouse. The torn off menu was displayed as a palette. The palette window could be configured using AppleScript to appear much like a taskbar, with no title bar and fixed to one edge of the screen. No control panel was provided by Apple to access this functionality, but third-party developers quickly wrote applications that allowed users unfamiliar with AppleScript to customize their application palettes. Third party taskbars such as DragThing were a popular category of shareware on these systems.

The Dock, as featured in macOS and its predecessor NeXTSTEP, is also a kind of taskbar. The macOS Dock is application-oriented instead of window-oriented. Each running application is represented by one icon in the Dock regardless of how many windows it has on screen. A textual menu can be opened by right-clicking on the dock icon that gives access to an application&#x27;s windows. Mac OS X 10.2 added the ability for an application to add items of its own to this menu. Minimized windows also appear in the dock, in the rightmost section, represented by a real-time graphical thumbnail of the window&#x27;s contents. The trash can is also represented in the Dock, as a universal metaphor for deletion. For example, dragging selected text to the trash should remove the text from the document and create a clipping file in the trash.

The right side of macOS&#x27;s Menu bar also typically contains several notification widgets and quick access functions, called Menu extras.

== Unix-like operating systems ==

=== KDE Plasma ===
In KDE Plasma 5, taskbar uses Widgets as elements in taskbar. In the update 5.20 (November 2020) they updated the taskbar to look more like Windows 10 by only displaying icons by default and grouping application windows together.

=== GNOME ===
GNOME 2 used its own type of taskbar, known as panels (the program responsible for them is therefore called gnome-panel). By default, GNOME 2 usually contains two full-width panels at the top and bottom of the screen. The top panel usually contains navigation menus labeled &quot;Applications&quot;, &quot;Places&quot;, and &quot;System&quot; in that order. These menus hold links to common applications, areas of the file system, and system preferences and administration utilities, respectively.

The top panel usually contains a clock and notification area, while the bottom panel contains buttons for navigating between virtual desktops, the window list proper, and a button which minimizes all windows (similarly to Windows&#x27; Show desktop button). The contents of panels are handled by widgets called panel applets, which can consist of application shortcuts, search tools, or other tools. The contents of the panels can be moved, removed, or configured in other ways.
In GNOME 3, panels are replaced by GNOME Shell, which consists of a bar across the top of the screen with an &quot;Activities&quot; button on the left, a clock in the centre, and a notification area on the right. GNOME Shell does not contain a traditional taskbar; users can manage windows, virtual desktops, and launch applications from either a &quot;Dash&quot; on the side of the screen, or by searching from Activities Overview, which is displayed by clicking on the &quot;Activities&quot; button. GNOME 3.8 introduces Classic Mode, which re-implements certain aspects of GNOME 2&#x27;s desktop as an alternate desktop environment that can be selected at the login screen.

=== Other Unix environments ===
These desktop environments provide their own implementation of a taskbar:
* Cinnamon
* MATE
* LXDE
* Xfce
* Trinity Desktop (based on KDE3&#x27;s Kicker)

Standalone window managers that provide an integrated taskbar include:
* Fluxbox
* FVWM95
* IceWM
* qvwm
* WindowLab
* Window Maker

Programs that offer standalone taskbars for desktop environments or window managers without one include Avant Window Navigator, pypanel, fbpanel, perlpanel, tint2, and others.

<doc id="455412" wikidata="Q126966" url="?curid=455412" title="Dornier Do 217">
<text>The Dornier Do 217 was a bomber used by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II. It was a more powerful development of the Dornier Do 17, known as the &quot;Fliegender Bleistift&quot; (German: &quot;flying pencil&quot;). Designed in 1937-38 as a heavy bomber but not meant to be capable of the longer-range missions envisioned for the larger Heinkel He 177, the Do 217&#x27;s design was refined during 1939 and production began in late 1940. It entered service in early 1941 and by the beginning of 1942 was available in significant numbers.

The Dornier Do 217 had a much larger bomb load and a much greater range than the Do 17. In later variants, dive bombing and maritime strike capabilities using glide bombs were experimented with, considerable success being achieved. Early Do 217 variants were more powerful than the contemporary Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88, having a greater speed, range and bomb load. Owing to this it was called a heavy bomber rather than a medium bomber. The Do 217 served on all fronts in all roles. On the Eastern Front and Western Front it was used as a strategic bomber, torpedo bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used for tactical operations, either direct ground assault or anti-shipping strikes during the Battle of the Atlantic and Battle of Normandy. The Do 217 was also converted to become a night fighter and saw considerable action in the Defence of the Reich campaign until late in the war.

The type also served in anti-shipping units in the Mediterranean, attacking Allied convoys and naval units during the Battle of the Mediterranean. In 1943, the Do 217 was the first aircraft to deploy precision-guided munitions in combat, when Fritz X radio-guided bombs sank the Italian battleship &quot;Roma&quot; in the Mediterranean. After the end of the war, at least one Dornier Do 217 continued in military operational service with the Swiss Air Force until 1946.
==Development and design==

===Early designs and marine plans===
At the beginning of 1938, Dornier issued manufacturing specification No. 1323, recognising the need for a twin-engine bomber or long-range reconnaissance aircraft powered by Daimler-Benz DB 601B engines. In February 1938 the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) authorized a testing program.
Dornier worked on a version of the Do 17M with the all round vision cockpit of the Do 17Z and a fuselage with a large bomb bay capable of holding a maximum of two and ten bombs. For reconnaissance an Rb 50/30 movie camera was fitted ahead of the front spar of the wing, and an Rb 20/30 was mounted in the second bomb bay. Jettisonable fuel tanks were carried in the forward bomb bay. For smoke-laying, the aircraft could be fitted with two Type S200 smoke generators. Dornier also envisaged the Do 217 as a naval dive bomber, in which case it was to be fitted with twin floats. In April and May 1938, the Do 217 WV1 and WV2 prototypes were produced.

The wing span was to be one metre greater than that of the Dornier Do 17, giving an overall span of . Under the wing a retractable diving air brake was to be installed. To power the aircraft the Dornier office at Manzell favoured two DB 601B engines, which could generate 1175 PS (1159 hp, 864 kW) for take off. The Jumo 211, Bramo 329 and BMW 139 (forerunner to the BMW 801) were also considered. Whichever power plant was selected, the RLM expected the aircraft to have a maximum speed of and weigh fully loaded.
On 5 June 1938 Dornier&#x27;s overview of its design submitted to the Technical Bureau (&quot;Technisches Amt&quot;) highlighted some structural differences from the Do 17. In particular, the proposed increase in the bomb load to had to have been a vital factor in the design&#x27;s acceptance. The fuselage was to be not only bigger but also stronger.

The RLM also had other requirements for Dornier to satisfy. Since 1933 the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; had pressed for the formation of a Naval Air Arm. In January 1938 the Naval Air Arm Inspectorate of the Luftwaffe presented its requirements for a multi-role twin-engined all-metal aircraft which could also conduct maritime operations. On 5 February 1938 it was agreed with the General Staff. The ineffectiveness of horizontal bombing of ship targets had already been noted. At the &quot;Erprobungsstelle Travemünde&quot; military aviation test centre at Greifswald, training units together with a few naval air units practiced bombing the ship &quot;Zähringen&quot; with concrete bombs. The results were a two percent hit rate. Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers repeated the assault with a 40% hit rate. The superior accuracy of dive bombing was clearly demonstrated. The Luftwaffe also wanted a machine that could operate as a fighter aircraft to combat enemy aircraft. Essentially they wanted a &quot;sea &quot;Stuka&quot;&quot; (Junkers Ju 87). The aircraft was to have floats and a range of and a maximum speed of .

Dornier set about designing a floatplane. For hitting targets in the air and sea surface, four automatic weapons would be fitted in the nose. The armament would consist of two MG 17 machine guns (500 rounds of ammunition each) and two MG 204 (aka Lb 204) 20mm autocannon (200 rounds of ammunition) as part of the Dornier Do P.85 project (in German sources these were all classified as &quot;machine guns&quot;, since the Luftwaffe considered anything 20mm or lower a &quot;machine gun&quot;, rather than a cannon like Western nations, hence the &quot;MG&quot; designation). Heavy weapons consisted of one 500 kg or two 250 kg bombs for assaulting enemy warships. Dornier faced competition from Heinkel and Junkers who were developing the Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 115.
Instead of MG 204s, MG 151 or MG FF was installed instead. Defensive armament was to consist of MG 15s to cover the aft approach. In addition the pay load could be modified to one and eight bombs or even two SC 500 bombs. The floats had a volume of and were broken into compartments for safety reasons. Each float was to contain a fuel tank with a capacity of . The tail was to consist of the same twin stabilizer configuration as the Do 217, although a single fin was planned.

For dive bombing capability a dive brake was installed underneath the wing. The power plants were to reflect the speed requirements. It was envisaged as having two DB 601G engines, generating , or two Jumo 211s. The fuel tanks were located in the wing and fuselage which had a capacity for of fuel and of oil. At full weight the Dornier would reach and its effective range was expected to be . Its optimum range at an average cruising speed of at an altitude of , was . The specifications were dated 8 March 1938.
The Do 217 lost out in the naval aircraft race to the Ju 88 and Blohm &amp; Voss Ha 140, as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; favoured these designs owing to the Do 217 failing to live up to the specifications given.
Although specifically ordered to cease development of the naval version of the Do 217, Dornier unofficially pursued the project and produced the Do 217W V1 and W V2 prototypes.

By the summer, 1940 the Luftwaffe had been using the Dornier Do 18, Heinkel He 115, Heinkel He 59, Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 88 in maritime operations in the Baltic. At this point, the Ju 88 and He 111 equipped units were ordered to cease providing maritime support en masse. Instead, the Luftwaffe returned to the idea of the Do 217 and its floatplane version as a specialized naval attack aircraft. At the same time more plans were in place to produce extremely long-range aircraft (probably for operations deep in the Soviet Union). It is possible that the data sheet which Dornier gave the designation Do 217G was a part of that project. Unlike the &quot;Sea Stuka&quot;, a floatplane, the G was to carry an MG 151 mounted in the nose and three MG 15s fitted for defence. The G was expected to reach . It was still designed for a crew of four and equipped with sprung floats which would allow the aircraft to land in rough open seas. The G could also carry the entire variation of the E-1 bomb load it could carry a load twice that of the Do P.85 aircraft. However, the Do 217 E-1s performance was favoured. Nevertheless, the Gs design features figured and influenced the E-4 which went into production as the aircraft that was envisaged to be the backbone of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bomber fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic.

===Focus on a heavy bomber===
At the end of August 1938 arguments against the floatplane version were made and proposing a land based aircraft to serve as a torpedo bomber, with more potential applications, were accepted. At the beginning of January 1939 the RLM stopped all work on the marine dive bomber version, as its estimated performance was not adequate.
On 8 July 1939 Dornier issued a manufacturing specification for a glide bomb-deploying version for full maritime use. It was to be equipped with unitized BMW 801 engines. The Do 217 E had a new nose and the nose, cockpit rear, and ventral positions carried one MG 15 each. It was to carry a maximum bomb load of two SC 500 and two SC 250 bombs. It was also possible to carry an aerial mine or torpedo, for which the bomb bay had been substantially extended rearwards, nearly 70% longer than that of the earlier Do 17Z.
A &quot;clamshell&quot;-like dive brake was fitted aft of the tail, with rear-hinged single dorsal and ventral panels. These features increased the design&#x27;s weight to . Dornier had intended the speed to be in the region of .
Superficially a bigger Dornier Do 215, and initially powered by the same engines, the Do 217 was actually considerably larger and totally different in both structural and aerodynamic design. The first prototype (the Do 217 V1) flew on 4 October 1938, but crashed seven days later during a single-engine flying test. The aircraft had been piloted by Rolf Koeppe, a flight commander at the central &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; facility at Rechlin. A Dornier mechanic, Eugen Bausenhart was also on board. It was found to be underpowered and was not manoeuvrable when compared with contemporary bombers. Instability was a problem at first, but modifications such as fixed Handley-Page leading edge slots along the leading edges of the vertical stabilizers helped to improve flight stability.

The second prototype flew on 5 November 1938. After arriving at Friedrichshafen in June 1939, further evaluations were scheduled to take place. Plans were made to install unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines to enable the aircraft for high-altitude reconnaissance. This meant the fitting of a pressurized cabin. When Daimler-Benz failed to supply the engines, development came to a standstill. On 29 October the RLM ordered the aircraft to be scrapped, or a new use found for it.
A third prototype flew on 25 February 1939 with Jumo 211A engines in place of the DB 601s. On 15 August 1939 and 23 January 1940, the aircraft was flown to Rechlin, where it was tested in night flying trials. A number of the flights were to assess the performance of the new Siemens navigation aids under development. At the same time, Dornier also carried out fuel jettisoning and drop tank trials using the standardized 900 L capacity, vertical-finned drop tanks pioneered by the Bf 110D extended-range heavy fighter. As with the Do 17, the test team tried several tail configurations with the Do 217 V3. single, double and triangular-planform assemblies were tried. These designs were used in the Do 217 M-3, M-9 and Dornier Do 317.

The same units were used on the fourth prototype V4 which flew in April 1939 at Friedrichshafen and Rechlin. The Jumo proved to be superior, and the designers deemed them to be essential if the desired performance was to be achieved. In February 1941, the V4 began trials with the dive brake which was installed in the tail. This was to satisfy a demand for the Do 217 to conduct dive bombing missions. It also was fitted with a brake parachute to test the ability of the Dornier to conduct short landings. The parachute brake was also considered in use as a dive brake. The V5 prototype was fitted with them and flew in June 1939. Later it was retested with DB 601s and was the third of six aircraft given the official designation Do 217 A-0. The Jumo 211 B-1 was used in the V5 prototype. But in September 1939 the water pump and entire cooling system failed. On 28 April 1940 the DB 601 A-1s were fitted.

The V6 prototype was powered by Jumo 211B engines, but was also tested with DB 601s. The V7 was tested with BMW 139 engines, but as these had been abandoned for use in the Fw 190 fighter as early as 1939, use of the unpopular BMW 139 powerplants was never taken beyond the prototype stage. The V8 was given BMW 801 engines, which became the fixture for the entire E series. The Do 217A and C series were only built in small numbers. Owing to this the following D and F types never advanced beyond the design stage.

There was a desire for the Do 217 to be capable of performing dive bombing, so it was therefore fitted with the aforementioned, tail-mounted dive brakes, with dorsal and ventral panels that were hinged, &quot;clamshell&quot;-fashion, at the extreme rear of the tail extension they emerged from. This could not be made to function adequately in the early models however, and was omitted until the Do 217 E-2 entered service. When this mark reached service, use of the dive brake was found to sometimes overstrain the rear fuselage, so it was often removed.

The production specifications were ratified on 8 July 1939, with the ultimate goal of the Do 217 having the capability of flying maritime and land operations armed with glide bombs. The four-seat aircraft was adaptable to both land and maritime operations wherein the tactical emphasis was on bombing from a 50-degree dive angle, and it had a maximum speed of . In contrast with earlier specifications for a modified version of the Do 17M, the proposed Do 217E had a new nose section design in which the A-Stand position was armed with a MG 15 machine gun. Additional MG 15s were to be located in the B and C-Stand gun emplacements. The design teams configured the bomb bay to carry two SC 500 and 250 bombs or four SC 250 bomb loads. In addition a LMB II aerial mine, or an F5 Torpedo could be loaded. Instead of the dive brakes being installed under the wings as on the R variant, it was placed on the tail of the aircraft. The design was tested in the E-1 and became the blueprint for all subsequent sub-variants. The E-1 carried strengthened wing and tail structures to deal with the upgraded armament, which increased the aircraft&#x27;s weight.

==Basic design (Do 217 E-2)==

===Wing===
The Do 217 was a shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane. Its two-spar wing was built in three sections: the centre section, incorporating part of the fuselage, and two outer wing sections with very little taper on the leading and trailing edges, leading out to a pair of broad, semi-circular wing tips. The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of Z-section frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.
The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using heat pumped through lagged pipes from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the front spar flanges and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.
The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the main tanks were located. In the centre section a fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.

===Fuselage===
The fuselage was an all-metal structure built in three main sections: the nose section, which accommodated the crew; the section including the wing centre section; and the rear fuselage. The main structure had a conventional stringer and former framework, to which stressed skin was riveted.
The centre and rear sections were divided in the horizontal plane to within a couple of metres of the tail. The lower half of the fuselage contained the bomb cells, while the remainder and upper parts contained the bracing frames which supported and kept the bomb load secure.
In the lower half of the fuselage the bomb bay extended past the trailing edge wing roots to nearly a quarter of the way down the rear fuselage. Extra doors were added for torpedo operations against Naval targets. The extreme rear of the fuselage contained stowage space for anti-shipping weapons.
In the upper fuselage, directly above the forward bomb cells in the centre section, just aft of the cockpit, the 242 gallon fuel tank was located. This had a jettison pipe which was attached to the roof of the fuselage and extended to behind the tail wheel..
Above the two rear bomb cells in the centre section there was an armoured dinghy stowage place. Either side of the dinghy, aft of the fuel tank, and directly above the rear bomb bay, were the oxygen bottles.

The tail wheel was retractable and had its own folding doors. The tip of the fuselage could be removed to allow quick access to the jack mechanism which controlled the tail plane incidence and pivot. The tail incidence was automatically changed when the landing flaps were lowered; it could also be adjusted manually.
This tip would be replaced by dive brakes in the event the Dornier was required to attack precision targets.
The horizontal stabilizer surfaces were conventional, as part of a twin tail empennage with &quot;endplate&quot; vertical fin/rudder units, as on the previous production Do 17 airframes. The rudder contained a balance tab while the elevators contained an elevator balance tab and an automatic dive pull-out tab, in the event of a dive-bombing mission. The stabilisers were fitted with fixed slats, with the trailing edges of the slats positioned inside of the fins. The rudders had very narrow horn balances (the amount of rudder or active control surface forward of the rudder-stabilizer hinge) which allowed for better balance, and the trimming tabs extended the full length of the stabilizers trailing edges. The stabilizers also had the Handley-Page leading edge slots installed on the inboard side.

===Powerplants===
All the Do 217E variants were fitted with unitized, BMW 801A air-cooled 14-cylinder radial aircraft engine. The early E-series variants were intended to be fitted with a BMW 801B engine on the port side to give counter-rotating propellers. The engines were mounted on welded steel tube mountings at the extremities of the wing centre section. The oil coolers were integral to the front lower section of the BMW-designed cowlings, as used in all twin and multi-engined aircraft that used BMW 801 radials for power. The machine had two oil and five fuel tanks which were protected with rubber and self-sealing coverings. In an emergency, CO2 could be released into the tanks to extinguish fires. The engines had three-blade, light alloy VDM propeller units. Flame dampers were also fitted in the form of &quot;fish tail&quot; exhaust pipes. Such a configuration gave a speed of (282 mph) at sea level and (318 mph) at . It enabled a service ceiling of when fully loaded and when lightly loaded. The Do 217&#x27;s range was a much more impressive , (compared with the other German bomber types).

The engines and their supporting struts were positioned well forward of the leading edge, allowing plenty of room for the undercarriage and other components. In the upper forward part of the nacelle the de-icing tank was located. The undercarriage was the main structure in this part of the aircraft. Each main unit comprised two oleo legs and a single wheel. It was retracted electrically via the crew in the cockpit.
The adoption by the Luftwaffe midway through the war, of a general system of unitized powerplant installations for twin and multi-engined combat aircraft incorporating as many of the engine&#x27;s auxiliary components (radiator and oil cooler, and all fluid and mechanical connections) into a single, easily interchangeable unitized &quot;bolt-on&quot; package, known as the &quot;Kraftei&quot; (power-egg) concept, was being widely adopted by the time of the Do 217&#x27;s initial frontline appearance. The Junkers Jumo 211 was one of the first engines to be unitized as seen on the Ju 88A, with the BMW 801 radial and Daimler-Benz DB 603 following not long afterwards, as both the BMW radial and the DB 603 inline engines were to be used in such a &quot;unitized&quot; format to power the frontline models of the Do 217.

===Cockpit===
The Do 217 usually carried a crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio operator and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centred in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180 degrees to starboard, placing the yoke in front of the bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K and M with stepless windscreen, the centre pivot was mounted on a rocking control arm or pedestal, rather than a sliding piston, since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung from the edge of the fuselage wall and from the glazing frames above the yoke, respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb release gear or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer&#x27;s window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.
The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( in) of armour and another 5mm ( in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.
The &quot;Funkgerät&quot; or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic pilot panel was located next to the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in the wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.
The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder &quot;PeilG V&quot; direction finder (PeilG – &quot;Peilgerät&quot;) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.

===Armament===
The defensive armament consisted of an A-Stand (forward firing machine gun position) in the nose with a MG 15 machine gun. In the C-Stand (lower rear gun emplacement) at the rear end of the undernose &quot;Bola&quot; gondola – a standard feature on many German twin-engined bombers – and a B-Stand position (rear-upper gun post) at the rear of the cockpit glazing, the crew were provided with MG 15 (E-1) or MG 131 machine guns (E-2). In the side of the cockpit, two MG 15s were mounted (one on each side) on bearings. As well as the manual machine gun positions, the E-2 was equipped with a &quot;Drehlafette&quot; DL 131 rotating turret armed with a 13 mm machine gun. In some instances, a moveable 20 mm cannon was fitted in the nose and a fixed 15 mm weapon was installed in the floor of the nose. The weapons could be controlled by the pilot, via a firing button located on the yoke. To assist in acquiring his target, a Revi C12/C was installed in the cockpit.

The maximum permissible bomb load of the E-series without sacrificing fuel load was of bombs of which a maximum of 3,000 kg could be carried internally. To have the maximum load of 4,000 kg, part of the fuselage fuel tank had to be sacrificed. If long-distance operations had to be flown, drop tanks could be fitted under the wings, which affected speed. Beside the bomb load a LT F5 Torpedo could be carried in its long bomb bay, as well as three aerial mines (the E-1 did not carry the mine load of the E-2).

==Level and dive bomber variants – radial-engined==

===Do 217 E===
The E series was the initial major production variant, based on V9 prototype, and powered by two BMW 801 radial engines. Deepened fuselage with larger bomb-bay, entered production in 1940.
The V9 had been planned as the prototype for the E-1 variant. The V9 had a fixed MG 151 with 250 rounds of ammunition while the MG 204 was to be installed in the nose. The type was fitted with a dummy run of Lofte 7 and BZA 1 bombing systems. The main armament was to be a single torpedo of either SD 1000 or SC 1700 standard. When the mock up had been given the green light for technical development construction began in the spring, 1940. During September 1940 engine vibration problems were experienced but fixed quickly. During flight tests it was discovered the air brake caused a speed loss of . The V9 underwent heavy tests and was withdrawn to Rechlin, where it acted as a prototype until at least October 1943. During this time it also had trials with BMW 801A and BMW 801G engines.

====Do 217 E-0 and E-1====
The E-0 was a pre-production bomber/reconnaissance version of Do 217E. It was powered by BMW 801A engines and armed with one forward firing 15 mm MG 151 cannon and five 7.92 mm MG 15 machine guns on gimbal mounts. It entered production and service in late 1940. Continued development led to the Do 217 E-1. The Do 217 E-1 first flew on 1 October 1940. Full production level bomber/reconnaissance variant, similar to the E-0, and followed it into production and service in late 1940, 94 were built. Additional armament consisted of a 20 mm cannon fitted in the nose. Its power plants were BMW 801s of 1,560 PS (). The aircraft could carry an internal bombload of 2,000 kg. Alternatively, it could carry a load of two LMW aerial mines or one torpedo. The E-2 could carry three mines.

In late 1940, testing under operational conditions began. By March 1941, 37 217s had been built and test flown. Many of the E-1 variants, now being built in increasing numbers, were selected for conversion to the new improved fighter variants; the planned 217H, P and R series. A large number of these &quot;fighter/bomber&quot; aircraft were put through severe testing runs between July and September 1941. Dornier was able to gain valuable knowledge for the future improvement of the armament and bomb jettisoning systems. Of the first six prototypes, two (the third and sixth) were delivered to operational units. The third, Wrk Nr. 1003 was lost on 22 May 1941 (at Rechlin) and 1006, the sixth prototype, was severely damaged on 11 April 1941 whilst with &quot;Kampfgeschwader 40&quot;.

====Do 217 E-2====
The E-2 was designated as a level and dive bomber, which could be fitted with a clamshell-type dive brake mounted on the fuselage aft of the elevator&#x27;s trailing edge , with rear-end-hinged dorsal and ventral panels opened and closed by a jackscrew. It was powered by BMW 801L engines and armed with forward firing 15 mm MG 151, a single MG 131 machine gun in the dorsal turret, an MG 131 flexibly mounted at the rear of the ventral gondola and three MG-15 machine guns. The E-2 entered production slightly later than the E-3 level bomber, and was produced in parallel, a total of 185 being built and entering service from the summer of 1941.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; continued to develop the E series. Not satisfied with the E-1, it perfected a modified version it designated the E-2. Testing was not complete until March 1942. Improvements were added to existing E-1s, which were already being produced by late 1940, and to the prototypes V2 and V4 which would serve as the prototypes for the E-2. The V2 was given the DB 601 engines and a third aircraft, designated V4, was tested with Jumo 211s. Studies of the aircraft began on 15 August 1939, running concurrently with the development of the E-1s. Level, dive and torpedo carrying roles were all examined. Emphasis was also placed on developing a reliable reconnaissance type. These developments were significant as the trials undertaken by the E-1 prototype had &quot;not&quot; shown any negative characteristics. Level bombing tests were very positive. Only glide-bombing attacks using interception control, and with dive-brakes open, did not quite match the stringent specifications set some four years earlier. According to the test pilots, the aircraft performed well with either the DB 601A, Jumo 211A/B, or even the BMW 801A-1 engines. Pleasing the designers, the test pilots also noted that with all auxiliary bomb racks removed test flights showed at an altitude of 6,000 metres, the Do 217 was quite capable of making an operational range of 2,400 km. With the addition of two 900-litre tanks, it increased to 3,700 km.

The BMW 801 was the preferred powerplant, and although it had been tested by the summer of 1942, the lack of replacements, low production and their use in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 series prevented large-scale operational testing under combat conditions. In September 1941 flame dampeners were fitted and testing completed. Further innovations were made regarding the installment of reconnaissance equipment, namely the standard Rb 20/30 cameras. During this final phase, plans to construct and designate an E-1b with MG 131 turret was explored, but later shelved. Modifications were also made on the already operational E-1s before the E-2 entered service. One such modification was the installation of MG FF 20 mm cannons, the installation of a hand-held MG 131 in the forward-facing glazing of the cockpit and a MG 131 turret facing aft in the B position (rear cockpit covering the rear). De-icing systems were also installed in the cabin and tailplane for high altitude operations.

Production of the E-2 began in March 1942. About twelve of the 280 produced at Friedrichshafen were used as testbeds to keep pace with the constantly changing series specifications. Two, Wrk. Nr. 1221 and 1228, served as testbeds for the BMW 801 L-2 engines as well as flights to assess the installation of auxiliary 300-, 900- and 1,200-litre fuel tanks. During this time, an E-2 equipped with lattice-type airbrakes appeared. It had been designed in June 1940. Its weaponry consisted of a fixed MG 151 in its nose and a MG 15 and the A position. Three rotating positions were put in the B and C stand positions. The machine resembled the Junkers Ju 188. Later it was installed with &quot;Kutonase&quot; (cable cutting equipment). The Do 217 E-1 and E-2 could reach 535 km/h at 5,300 m and none had a problem with maintaining altitude with BMW 801s, even with weapons, dive-brakes and dampers added, provided it had an all-up-weight of less than twelve tonnes. Machines over thirteen tonnes were difficult to handle and needed experienced pilots at the controls.

The failure of the Heinkel He 111, Dornier Do 17, and Junkers Ju 88 during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz led the OKL to see the Do 217 as the only heavy bomber with the range, bombload and defences for long-range bombing. The E-2 had incorporated all the new design features such as the &quot;Drehlafette&quot; DL 131 turret and a modified bomb bay which allowed to hold 3,000 kg of bombs. The E-1s originally were given the FuG X, 16, 25 and PeilG V and FuBI 1 radio sets and navigation aids. The E-2 was given the FuBI2. In the next two variants, the E-3 and E-4, the Siemens FuG 101 radio altimeter was also added enabling the pilot to conduct more accurate and safer low-level attacks. The E-1 had &quot;Rüstsätz&quot; /R1 racks for 1,800 kg or bombs, the /R2 wing rack and /R3s for 50 kg of bombs. Dornier wanted to increase the strength of the racks to increase the size of external loads. A specialist company which had often collaborated with Dornier, Technischer Aussendienst, developed the /R20 rack which enabled heavier loads to be carried. The /R20 enabled fixed MG 81Zs to be installed in the tail cone. The previous lattice air brake was removed; the drag was too much and it bent the fuselage out of shape, making the aircraft unsafe and hastening metal fatigue.

====Do 217 E-3 to E-5====
In the E-3, additional armour was fitted to protect crew. Armed with forward firing 20 mm MG FF cannon and seven MG 15 machine guns. (Despite the large number of machine guns, the defensive weight of fire was light, with five of the gimbal mounted machine guns to be operated by the radio-operator, who could only use one at a time).

The E-4 was similar to the E-2, which it replaced in production, but with the dive brakes removed. It was fitted with &quot;Kuto-Nase&quot; barrage-balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings. 258 E-3 and E-4 were built. The E-4 was identical to the E-2, with the exception of the heavy MG FF in the nose. Five of the six positions were flexible, with only one fixed gun; the MG FF installed along the floor, just off centre. The cannon in the nose could be moved. Both were powered by BMW 801L engines.

The E-5 was a modified version of E-4 for anti-shipping operations. It was fitted with a bomb carrier for a Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb or a drop tank under each of the outer wings, and carried the appropriate &quot;Kehl&quot; series radio guidance and control transmitter system for the missile. It was usually operated with a missile under the starboard wing and a drop tank under the port wing. Sixty-seven were new-built with additional 34 converted from E-4 airframes.

Testing with glide bombs was halted as the electrics were too sensitive to moisture, rockets prone to icing and the radio valves in the control units (in the aircraft) were disrupted by vibrations. By May 1942, hit rates were just 50 percent. In April 1942, the first E-5 reached the test centres at Peenemünde. Various test were made with aircraft with anywhere from 15.4 and 16.5 tonnes in all up weight. Often these tests were made to assess flight characteristics when carrying glide bombs such as the Hs 293. The E-5 was given heating units to keep the cold from the heat-sensitive glide bombs&#x27; electrics. With external ETCs, but without Glide bombs and auxiliary fuel tanks, the E-5 could attain of a speed of 480 km/h at 5,000 m. With two external stores, its speed was reduced to 445 km/h and its weight, including 4,300 litres of fuel, was 16.85 tonnes. The Do 217 E-2/U1 was used as an E-5 prototype. Whether an E series Do 217 ever launched a Hs 294 glide bomb is unclear. The only known fact is that a Do 217 flew a Hs 294 to Berlin-Schonefeld in May 1943. The first launch of the missile was done from a Messerschmitt Bf 110, and thereafter was taken over by the Heinkel He 177 equipped with the FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; transmitter to control the missile. Only the Do 217, He 177 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 could carry a Hs 293/4 or Fritz X missile.

===Do 217 K===
To replace the Do 217, the RLM planned for the He 177 A-3 and A-5 to be the long-range carrier aircraft for missiles, owing to the lack of BMW engines to power the Dornier but problems with the engine reliability of the He 177A led to the failure of the plan. The Battle of Stalingrad used up more and more aircrew which prevented them retraining on the Do 217 for glide bomb operations. Owing to the problems with the He 177A, Air Inspector General Erhard Milch returned his attention to the Do 217 and demanded a greater number of improved variants for Precision-guided munition (PGM) operations.

In early 1942, tests on a new and improved, completely glazed cockpit for the Do 217 series had been underway at the &quot;Hamburger Schiffbauanstalt&quot; (Hamburg Shipbuilding Institute). E-2s were fitted with a new streamlined &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; following its conceptual debut in January 1938 for the He 111P, as this design philosophy became the standard for almost all German bombers later in World War II, which eliminated the separate windscreen panels for the pilot of earlier versions of the Do 217. The lower nose of the K-version also retained the &quot;Bola&quot; inverted-casemate gondola for a rearwards-aimed ventral defensive armament emplacement, with its forward end fully incorporated with the new nose glazing design. The testing for this new well-framed cockpit glazing format for the later models of the Do 217, was carried out at the Shipbuilding Institute in Hamburg. The design of the cockpit was put to the test using water pressure to simulate a speed of 700 km/h. Only a few of the glass panels failed, caused by inadequate mounting. The cabin design passed the tests easily. Initial flights took place on 31 March 1942 after teething problems had been resolved. The Do 217 K V1 flew with BMW 801A-1s from Löwenthal and &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; Rechlin. This was followed by the ten-airframe pre-production batch, Do 217 K-01 to K-010. Mass production of the Do 217 K-1 began at the Dornier factory at Wismar.

The first prototype, a modified E-2 flew on 31 March 1942, with the aircraft showing higher maximum speed owing to reduced drag. The Do 217 K entered production from September 1942. BMW believed that the type could reach an operational ceiling of 7,000 m, notwithstanding a [Maximum takeoff weight|MTOW] of 16.8 tonnes. Tests at Peenemünde in June and July 1943 showed that while the Do 217K could carry and deploy a Fritz-X PGM, it was still controllable.

====Do 217 K-1====
The Do 217 K-1 was a night bomber version with the 1560 PS BMW 801L engine. It carried the same crew of four in the &quot;stepless cockpit&quot; crew compartment with a revised defensive armament of a twin-barreled 7.92 mm MG 81Z machine gun in the nose, two single MG 81s or twin-barrelled MG 81Z in beam positions, a MG 131 in the B stand position dorsal turret, the DL 131/1C, and another in a ventral position inserted in a &quot;Walzenlafette&quot; WL 131/1 cylindrical carriage at the rear of its &quot;Bola&quot; gondola. 220 were built. It had an average flying weight of 12,700 kg, this aircraft achieved speeds of 520 km/h at 5,200 m.

The K-1 was equipped with GM 1 nitrous oxide boost, which increased its maximum speed by 84 km/h at 8,000 m at a rate of 100 g/s. With 50 g/s the aircraft&#x27;s operational ceiling could be extended from 8,400 to 9,800 metres. Failure rates of the GM 1 were very high and attention was shifting to other Do 217 variants and the use of GM 1 soon stopped. Serious shortages of the BMW 801 led to the cancellation of the K series but tests with BMW 801ML &quot;Motoranlage&quot; unitized-mount format radial engines, added a supplementary command unit to the usual 801 &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; engine control unit for each radial, which could engage the booster switch, ignition timing and the weak-rich mixture control automatically, which made the 801L powerplants easy to operate. Oil pressures also triggered operation of the VDM propellers, which on the K-1 subtype were 3.9 m in diameter. A smaller, 3.8 meter diameter wood-bladed propeller could be used as an alternative, though with a slight loss of speed. The standard 2,165-litre fuel tank could be supplemented by two fuselage tanks with 700-litre capacity or with either the standardized Luftwaffe 300-litre drop tank used on many German front-line military aircraft or fin-stabilized 900-litre drop tank as the Bf 110D used. An all-up-weight of 15 to 16.5 tonnes could be expected. The K-1 would need some 850 to 1,110 m to get airborne. Taking off from a grass strip, an altitude of 20 m was reached after 1,500 m and from a concrete runway it was 1,300. With two auxiliary tanks its speed dropped by 4.5 percent, and with bombs, by 6 percent. Flame-damper equipment also caused serious speed reductions; 7 percent in level flight and 9 percent when at operational ceiling.

====Do 217 K-2====
This was a specialised anti-shipping version based on the K-1, intended to carry the Fritz X guided bomb, being fitted with pylon-faired hardpoints to allow carriage of two Fritz Xs inboard of the engines and the FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; guidance system. It had longer-span wings (24.8 m (81 ft  in) compared with 19 m (62 ft 4 in) for the K-1) to give better high-altitude performance when carrying the heavy Fritz-X bombs. 50 were converted from K-1 airframes. The wing area was expanded by a total of 67 m2, but most of the K-2s internal equipment was the same as the K-1. The increase in area was to increase high-altitude performance. Some of the K-2s had a rigid tail MG 81Z which was not especially effective. It was loaded with 350 rounds and controlled by the use of a rear-facing telescope mounted in the forward section of the canopy left of the pilot. Either the gunners or pilot could fire the weapon, which could be jettisoned in case of an emergency to reduce weight.

====Do 217 K-3====
The next variant was the Do 217 K-3. A revised anti-shipping version, the Do 217 K-3 was similar to the K-2 but fitted with improved FuG 203-series &quot;Kehl&quot; missile guidance equipment for Fritz-X glide-bombs or Hs 293 missiles. 40 were converted from M-1 airframes. It was given the K-2s larger wings. When fitted with external ETC weapons racks it was named the K-3/U1. It had improved armament, a MG 81Z and MG 81 J in the nose. The K-3 did not roll off the production lines until the beginning of 1944. The Dornier Do 217 M-11, its intended successor as the standard missile platform, was only produced in small numbers owing to lack of production capacity.

==Level and dive bomber variants – inline-engined==

===Do 217 M===
As the BMW 801 radial engine used by the Do 217K was in great demand for the Fw 190 fighter, the Do 217M, a version powered by &quot;Kraftei&quot;-unitized installation versions of the largest displacement inverted V12 then in service, the 44.5-litre displacement Daimler-Benz DB 603 liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine, was developed in parallel with the 217K. It shared the new forward fuselage of the 217K, with the first prototype flying on 16 June 1942.
According to RLM plans, production of the M model, which was powered by DB 603 A-1s was due to commence with two aircraft in May 1942 and 10 M-1s in the summer. By March 1943 a production target of 42 aircraft per month was to be achieved. The DB 603 A-3 was chosen as the increased performance handed the aircraft improved characteristics. However, it had not been fully tested and a number of technical problems arose. A Do 217H (a glider-bomber for land operations with E-2 airframe) would be used for endurance testing. This would provide useful testing evaluations for the M-1.

The M V1 was to be the first prototype. It was an E-2 conversion with altered cockpit and DB 603 engines and operated from the central Luftwaffe &quot;Erprobungstelle&quot; aircraft test centre at Rechlin from September 1942. During the winter, the prototype performed long-range and high-altitude flights. On 16 November it was forced landed for unstated reasons. Different engine-cooling systems were tried and flame retarders added, although the addition of the dampers caused a reduction in speed of 15 to 25 km/h depending on altitude. The first production prototype series M-0 aircraft (M-01) crashed in Lake Müritz, just north of the Rechlin test base, on 9 September 1942, while on an engine test. The M-02 was given wing reduction to 59 m2, which became the predecessor of the M-3. The M-03 refined the design with DB 603 A-1 engines but crashed after a mid-air collision with a Dornier Do 215 on 14 May 1943. Six 0-series aircraft (Wrk Nr. 1241 to 1245) were manufactured. Rechlin log books included frequent references to a M-04 from December 1942 to May 1943. This aircraft was apparently used for de-icing and cabin heating tests as well as high-altitude testing with DB603s. Some M-0s were used to evaluate performance with glide bombs (Wrk Nr. 1244 and 1245). These aircraft were named M-0/U1. Each had an ETC 2000 XII, under the fuselage.

====Do 217 M-1====
The M-1 night bomber version, equivalent to Do 217 K-1 but with DB603A engines, carried similar armament and bomb load to K-1. Daimler-Benz DB 601s were also used on some variants to keep the airframes in service (the shortage of powerplants made this difficult). Mostly though, DB603A-1 engines were used on the M-1, its only major difference from the K series. The M-1/&quot;Umrüst-Bausätze&quot; 1 (abbreviated &quot;/U1&quot;) incorporated the M defensive armament and the lattice air brake of the E-2. The MG 81Z and 131 were to be replaced by the MG 151 in the A-stand position. Problems with the air brakes prevented serial conversions. By November 1943 the M-1/U1 had matured into a night bomber with anti-glare protection in the cabin. The machine was equipped with a MG 131 in the nose, two MG 81Js in the cabin windows and two MG 131s in the B and C stand. Some M-1/U2s were fitted for deployment of German PGM guided ordnance with the required FuG 203d &quot;Kehl IV&quot; guidance transmitter, and rear-looking FuG 216 &quot;Neptun R&quot; radar equipment. 438 M-1 were built by Dornier in Munich and Wismar.

====Do 217 M-2 to M-11====
Torpedo-bomber version of Do 217M. Only a single prototype was built, the Junkers Ju 88 being chosen as a torpedo-bomber instead. The M-5 series was a modified version of M-1 fitted with Hs 293 missile recessed under fuselage. Only one prototype was built. The last in the M series was the M-11. It was a revised anti-shipping version of M-1, with extended wings of K-2 and provision for one Fritz-X or Hs-293 under fuselage. 37 M-11 were converted from M-1 airframes.

====Do 217 R====
In 1941, Dornier worked out a derivative of the Do 217M with dive brakes, a greater wing area, and increased defensive armament, designated Do 217R. Three Do 217R versions were planned, the baseline Do 217R-0 powered by either DB 603As or BMW 801ML, the Do 217R-1 dive bomber/torpedo bomber, and the Do 217R-2 dive bomber. Four Do 217R prototypes were converted from existing airframes, the first of which flew on August 6, 1942, but the Do 217R did not go into production.

==Night fighter variants==

===Do 217 J===
In 1941, with Germany under increased night-time attack by RAF Bomber Command and with shortages of the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the preferred Junkers Ju 88C night fighters, it was decided to supplement the night-fighter force with a version of the Do 217 E, despite its much greater size and 15-ton weight. This aircraft, the Do 217 J, was fitted with a new &quot;solid&quot; nose, similar to that used by Dornier in night fighter versions of the Do 17 and Do 215, with four forward firing 2 cm MG FF cannon and four 7.92 mm machine guns. By October 1940, the production of heavy night fighters and night fighters such as the Do 217 and Ju 88, had been discussed comprehensively and by 5 November 1941 these discussions had been concluded. On 23 November the &quot;Technische Amt&quot; (T.A.) had ordered the Dornier bomber fleet to be withdrawn in accordance with a decision made earlier that year on 23 May. Dornier designated the subject of their new project the &quot;Do 217 Z&quot;, later renamed the Do 217 J.

The Japanese Imperial Navy and Japanese Army Air Force had also taken an interest in license building the type in the summer 1942, demonstrating the type&#x27;s potential. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, however, had no intention of delivering the Do 217 to Japan, and none were ever exported. Dornier encountered many problems in procuring the BMW 801 engines required for the night fighter versions. Junkers had also struggled with BMW deliveries, its Ju 88C variants were to be powered by the BMW as the initial Jumo 211B/F engine plan had been abandoned. The Do 217s competitor, the Ju 88 C, had only four fixed guns, whereas the Dornier could hold eight. In most cases, the Ju 88 C carried only one 2 cm MG FF and three 7.92 mm MG 17s.

In January 1941 Junkers concentrated on the C variant designs. It planned on producing 60 C-4s and 374 C-6s powered by Jumo 211s. It later transpired to Dornier that Junkers also wanted the BMW 801 to power the C-6. The power plants would also be supplemented with GM-1 nitrous oxide injection engine performance boosters for greater performance or alternatively, using the new, more powerful Jumo 213. The Ju 88s weaponry was improved by the addition of one or two MG FFs in the fuselage. Both the Do 217 and Ju 88 used the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C sets, but later Ju 88s were given FuG 212 Lichtenstein C-1s and later FuG 220s. The equipment of the Dornier did not change. Against this competition Dornier needed to improve the types&#x27; abilities as a night fighter.
The first problem Dornier attempted to overcome was long and short range capabilities. A modified E-1, (Wrk Nr. 42) was used to test the equipment for the forthcoming Do 217 J. During testing the characteristics of the various types fire extinguisher hardware were carried out. Performance trials were carried out in January 1942 using an E-2, Wrk Nr. 1122 which was put through its paces at the Löwenthal testing facility.

Dornier intended the prototype to ready by February 1942. The machine, Wrk Nr. 1134, was a modified E-2 and equipped with FuG 202 and a &quot;Spanner-Anlage&quot; Infrared gun sight. These systems enabled the Dornier to detect the heat signature of enemy aircraft. Heat seeking detection at limited range making the Dornier a good proposition for the Defence of the Reich campaign. Testing was set back as the prototype crashed owing to engine failure. The continuing slow development of the IR equipment precluded its use in the J-1. Work on the IR program was sped up until late 1943. Modified IR equipment appeared in 1945 and was installed in the Ju 88 G-6.

Delays of BMW 801 engine deliveries forced the project to be temporarily abandoned. In November 1941 the directive for the design team had been a J-1 with a Spanner IR system, and a J-2 with Lichtenstein radar. In 1942 the directive changed slightly, and the J-2 was to be fitted with AI radar. Specifically, the Dornier was to be armed with four MG FF fuselage mounted cannon and machine guns for bomber assault, and one MG 131 each in the B-Stand and C-Stand positions for defence from RAF night fighters. Curiously, the night fighter version was ordered to be able to carry eight 50 kg bombs so the type could act as a night fighter and intruder over enemy territory.

The electronic equipment to be installed was listed as the FuG X, 16, 25 Peil G V air-to-ground communications and blind landing devices. The FuB1.1 was also listed as a potential piece, and if possible a FuG 101 radio equipment was to be fitted as standard. It was intended to equip J-1 with the Lichtenstein FuG 202, which had an effective range of 4,000-metre, with three tubes. The weight of the equipment would reduce the performance of the J-1 by 30 – 40 km/h so in January 1942, Dornier opted to install the IR spanner equipment instead of the Lichtensten. A rear braking system had also been in the original plan, but it was deemed unnecessary. The design was declared ready on 5 January 1942 and first flew later that month. The prototype was delivered to the Tarnewitz test facility where gunnery trials took place with MG FF and MG 17 weapons. Satisfied with the performance, series production began in March 1942.

====Do 217 J-1====
The operational Dornier night fighter, redesignated J-1, before entering operations was powered by BMW 801L engines. It was fitted with a revised crew compartment housing a crew of three, with a solid nose housing four fixed 7.92 mm MG 17 machine guns, with four 20 mm MG FF/M cannon in the forward part of the ventral gondola. It retained the MG 131s in a dorsal turret and ventral position of the bomber, and could carry eight bombs in the rear bomb-bay, with a fuel tank in the forward bomb-bay.

Production had commenced in March 1942, during which eight J-1s were built. In April, 13 followed and 55 were built in May. Despite this start production declined in June and this trend continued until November 1942, when only four were built. Dornier had been ordered to withdraw Dornier airframes for unspecified reasons. Owing to this, by 31 December 1942, only 130 J-1s had been completed.
Dornier kept a production run of 19 aircraft for evaluating equipment. These were to be used when Josef Kammhuber, General of the Night fighters demanded the J-1 to have a modified fuselages made available for upward firing cannon installed within the dorsal areas of the fuselage, above the wing roots. This armament configuration was called &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; (&quot;slanted&quot; or &quot;oblique&quot; Music). A prototype was given four MG 151s in place of its MG FFs and named J-1/U1. The prototype was modified in September 1942 and sent to the Tarnwitz Experimental Establishment on 14 October for tests on gunnery performance. The guns delivered 125,000 rounds during tests without problems. The concept was available for adoption, although Dornier had some reservations about the slow firing pattern of the MG 151/20.

The Dornier appeared to be a very effective night fighter with significant hitting power. However it attracted strong criticism from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. After the first J-1 was delivered to 4./&quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 1&quot;, in March 1942, the crew complained it was too heavy, and criticised its takeoff and landing characteristics. The pilot complained it had &quot;too little performance reserve&quot;. The aircraft&#x27;s high service loading and its poor manoeuvrability in aerial combat did not enhance its performance reputation. Part of the types performance issues lay with the fact the MG 131 defensive guns and bomb release mechanisms had remained, and been built into the J-1 to allow for its use as a bomber. With eight machine guns mounted in the fuselage and the supporting ammunition, the weight was increased and outweighed the Do 217E by 750 kg.

====Do 217 J-2====
The J-2 night-fighter version of Do-217J was fitted with FuG 202 Lichtenstein radar in the nose, and had the rear bomb-bay plated over. The MG FF/M of the J-1 were replaced by 20 mm MG 151 cannons. The J-1 was withdrawn from intruder duty following an order stopping night intruder raids against England, while the J-2 proved disappointing as a night fighter, showing poor performance and manoeuvrability, although they were used for early trials of the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; arrangement of upward firing cannon, three Js being used for tests in July 1942. The J-2 was only converted from J-1s.

There was little difference in design between the J-1 and J-2, save for the FuG 202 Lichtenstein C1 radar fitted to the later. The first C-1 had been used in the Dornier Do 17 Z-10. Production of the C-1 began in full only after the Do 217J production had ceased. FuG 202 Lichtenstein radar continued to be used in Dorniers, although historian Manfred Griehl points out this was only according to the manuals.

Complaints were made by crews about the performance of the Dornier in comparison to other German types. On 12 May 1942 Erhard Milch ordered that Dornier cease all night fighter design. It was decided that the Ju 88 series only (Ju 88 C-6) would continue to be developed and serve as a heavy night fighter. Strangely, the order was not passed onto the Dornier design team who continued to produce the N variant.

===Do 217 N===
The end of the J series did not mean the end of the Dornier night fighter. One of the few German fighter pilots to side with the type against its critics was &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Rudolf Schoenert of &quot;III./Nachtjagdgeschwader 3&quot;. Schoenert suggested to his Commanding officer, in July 1942, that trials be made of weapons slanting upwards at an angle of 70° (later known as &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;) in the fuselage in the hope of increasing the efficiency of his Do 217. This entailed mounting four to six MG 151/20 autocannon in the centre of the fuselage. At &quot;Technisches Amt&quot;, two Do 217s, one with four and the other with six MG/151/20 cannon were ready for inspection on 5 August 1942 and testing in September. The idea of the upward firing cannon had originally come from an engineer, Dr. Poppendieck, in June 1942. Nevertheless, Schoenert built on it, and with the introduction of the IR &quot;spanner&quot; and headlight, the bomber could approach from below a British bomber and avoid exposure to its powerful powered turrets guarding its tail, nose and upper fuselage by attacking from behind or head-on. Unlike the B-17 Flying Fortress or B-24 Liberator, the British bombers did not have a ventrally-located Ball turret, and the new Dornier design attempted to take advantage. It was decided, due to cost, to limit the upward-firing armament to four guns. Other tactical improvements involved fitting a semi-rigid brake parachute in October 1942, allowing the Dornier to adjust to the speed of the bomber before firing on its target. The prototypes J-1/U2 and J-1/U4 were tested under these conditions.

These designs were to be carried forward into the new variant, the Dornier Do 217 N. The BMW 801 that powered the Do 217 J proved underpowered, so a night-fighter using the more powerful DB 603 A-1 engines was produced, with the first prototype flying on 31 July 1942. While it had much improved performance, it was still unpopular due to its poor agility and climb rate, and was prone to engine problems.
Ten pre-production series N variants were designated as test beds. Trials began in the summer of 1942. On 16 August the second prototype Do 217, N V2, entered trials. The N V1 and N V2 were the main testbeds, and the DB 603 A-1s they were powered by were tested at high altitude. On 11 October 1942 the N V1 crashed after stalling with its landing gear down and crashing into Müritz Lake, killing the crew.
On 21 December 1942, 100-hour engine endurance trials began at Rechlin with the DB engines. The pistons became useless after 91 hours. Testing of DB 603 A-2 inline engines was carried out between 28 April and 8 May 1943, but the programme was beset by continual breakdowns and the project was abandoned. There was no further record of the N variant prototypes after 20 June 1943.

In April 1943, the four MG FF guns had started but were not completed until the late summer. The third prototype, N-1/U was fitted with MG 151/20 and unspecified aerodynamic refinements. The machine was used in high-altitude de-icing tests, and the aircraft was tested with &quot;Lichtenstein BCR&quot; and &quot;Bernhardine&quot; radar. In August ten of these aircraft were constructed, and between 27 and 31 August, they were fitted with their &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; at &quot;Erprobungsstelle Tarnewitz&quot; and Wismar Testing Facilities. The tenth N variant, designated N-0, underwent radio trials. The machine was tested with the Peil G VI/APZ 6, a later and more sophisticated variant automatic direction-finding equipment. On 2 December further tactical trials were carried out with infrared target-illuminating equipment. These trials were carried out with DB 601 powered J-1s.

====N-1 and N-2====

After testing was satisfied the two variants, the N-1 and N-2, which had two sub-variants, were fitted with FuG 202. The N-1 variants were given two sub-variants which were to follow the design of the E-2/E-4 and the J-1/J-2 with emphasis on range and endurance. Extra fuel tanks were added to the empty bomb bay. For operations over water the heavy night fighters were fitted with lifeboats and radio transmitters. The FuG X with TZG 10 and FuG 16. IFF equipment was the FuG 25s. The N also had the FuG 101 radio altimeter, blind flying equipment FuB1 2 and PeilG V. AI search radar was the FuG 202. The no longer needed bomb release gear remained, bringing the aircraft up to on take-off, so it was barely able to reach . Fuel consumption lightened the load, and the Dornier could reach a maximum operational ceiling of . The speed of the N was a maximum of at . The N-2 was much improved, as it was much lighter and refined.

Overall the N-1 was an initial production of the J-1 version. Powered by a DB 603 it had similar armament to Do 217 J-2, retaining defensive armament. Entered service in April 1943. Some modified with dorsal and ventral guns replaced by wooden fairings as Do 217 N-1/U1, conversion with &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; arrangement of four upward-firing 20 mm MG 151s as Do 217 N-1/U3. About 240 built.

The Do 217 N-2 was a new build equivalent of Do 217 N-1/U1; some were fitted with two or four cannon in &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; installation. About 95 were built until it was retired from front line use in mid-1944.

The N-2 was originally not to have the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; armament configuration or a brake parachute, but it was then decided to fit the armament set for tactical reasons. A semi-rigid brake parachute was also installed for unspecified reasons. The N-2 prototype was a converted E-1, serial 0174, code PE+AW. Communications were improved on the FuG 16 ZY and FuG 214. The B and C cupolas were removed and the positions fared over with Plexiglas and wood. The MG FF guns were replaced by MG 151/20 cannon. The MG 17s in the nose were to be abandoned with more powerful armament, but this was never carried out. To kill the excess weight that had plagued earlier types, the bomb bay, its doors, and the bomb release gear were removed, and changes were made to the control panels. The gaps were replaced by lighter wood parts which reduced weight, allowing heavier armour protection for the crew. The N variant was the most heavily armoured Dornier variant.
The improvements enabled a top speed of (an increase of ) and a reduction from to , which increased ceiling height to .

==Projects, minor production variants==

===Do 217A===
The A variant was a pre-production reconnaissance version, with original shallow fuselage and powered by DB 601A engines. Armed with three MG 15 machine guns. Nine were built, entering service in late 1940, and used for secret reconnaissance missions over the then-neutral Soviet Union.
Although the specifications had originally envisaged a multi-role aircraft which could perform bombing missions, it was to function in reconnaissance roles. The fuselage had to be extended to accommodate the two cameras which could be &quot;accessed directly by the crew&quot; (presumably in flight).
Dornier was ordered to produce three A-0 series machines up to the E variant. This changed to six as the number of reconnaissance machines was inadequate for the military&#x27;s need. The small production run would consist of six aircraft. The original power plants, the DB 601Fs, could not be installed in time and the lower performance DB 601B engines were assigned to the type instead for the short term. As in the Dornier Do 17, Rb 20/30 and 50/30 cameras were to be installed. The 20/30 would be fitted in the fuselage while the 50/30 camera was to be placed in the cockpit and be jettisonable. For emergencies the aircraft was to have a fuel transfer unit control installed to move fuel from one tank to another.
The first four A-0 aircraft were powered by DB 601Bs while the last two were given DB 601N engines in January 1940. The tests were problem free. However the RLM requested a B variant design which would have a fairing in which the film footage would be stored. Dornier reported that the A-0s were not getting the power plants they required for high altitude reconnaissance sorties so construction had to be delayed. The Do 217B program was suspended, as it turned out, altogether.

Dornier completed work on the V6 prototype, the fourth A-0 aircraft. On 15 October 1939 it was flown successfully. The bomb bay had been enlarged and continued testing various weaponry until 1941. It had DB 601P engines installed and its wing was enlarged in early 1941. The DB 601Ps could operate a maximum altitude of 5,800 m and would use high octane C3 aviation fuel. It should have been ready to fly by March, but problems with the engines slowed progress.
At that time Dornier was working on additional features, in particular a new pressurised cabin for the A variant. It also hoped to introduce GM-1 booster units to increase performance at extreme altitudes. The first trial of this aircraft took place on 23 April 1940.

The RLM had stated it wanted the A prototypes to be tested by May 1940 with its high altitude engines. Owing to unresolved engine complications testing was delayed. Finally, on 1 October 1941 RLM ordered Dornier to return the aircraft to its original condition and abandon high altitude modifications. In January 1942 Dornier was ordered to prepare the two Do 217A aircraft fitted with DB 601Fs for immediate combat operations in both transport and bomber roles. The conversion was to be complete by February but the aircraft were not operational. Finally one machine was made ready and began operations with DB 601F engines on 30 December 1942, some ten months later. The other machine was sent to Löwenthal in July 1940 and had undergone trials with autopilot controls. From March 1941 it had been fitted with BMW 801A-1s and later A-2 engines for greater reliability on long-range sorties. In the summer of 1942 BMW 801G-1 engines were installed while later it had trials with BMW 801G-2 engines which had GM-1 boosters fitted in January 1943 for high performance at altitude.
A number of the A prototypes served as test beds through the war. The last (V7) flew testing improvised de-icing systems at altitudes of 9,000 metres. In December 1944 the Dornier projects were halted owing to lack of fuel.

In 1940–1941 the A-0s that were allocated to combat units saw service mainly in Western Europe serving in &quot;Kampfgeschwader 2&quot; from bases in the Netherlands.

===Do 217C===
The C series was a pre-production bomber powered by DB 601A engines and original shallow fuselage. It had five MG 15 machine guns installed and bombs as its main offensive armament. Five were built and used as test beds.
The V9, which had acted as a prototype for the E variant was also used for the C-0 series. The C-0 was a three crew combat aircraft powered by Jumo 211B engines and had a four-bladed 3.8 m airscrew. The RLM found no faults with the new machine in a June 1939 inspection. The only minor complaint was the limited view from the pilots&#x27; seat. Apart from the same engines and small fuselage space inherent in C-series aircraft, externally the C looked like the A-0 series.
On 12 November 1940 Dornier increased the number of the crew to four to enable the five MG 15 weapons in the A, B and C-Stand positions to operate with the maximum protection. The bomb bay had also been modified to take four SC 500 or multiple SC 50 bomb loads. The Do 217 C-0 was equipped with a Lotfe 7A bomb aiming system and a Revi 12C sight for the pilot. For high-altitude flight sixteen 32-litre oxygen bottles were installed. The C-0 was capable of achieving a maximum speed of at an altitude of . Carrying a full operational load, its maximum speed was reduced by .

The first Do 217 series aircraft, Wk Nr. 2710 flew on tests between September 1940 and March 1941. It crashed on 2 July 1942 at Rechlin. The second C-0 prototype was fitted with dive brakes on the under side of the wings but this configuration was abandoned in January 1941 and replaced by a brake parachute installed in the tail. The third prototype flew on 6 September 1940 and four further machines flew between September and November 1940. The final machine, 2716, flew on 6 November 1940. The eight machines remained at Rechlin in various test bed roles until at least July 1942. The C series project was abandoned and its variants never entered mass production.

===Do 217H, L and R===
The Do 217 H was a conversion of a Do 217E with DB 601 engines fitted with experimental turbo-superchargers. The H V1 to H V3 prototypes were designed as unarmed bombers with DB engines with 3.8 m VDM propellers. Bombs, Recon cameras, and dive brakes were all dispensable. The H V1 was delivered in September 1941 but crashed soon after as a result of propeller failure. After the evaluation of the flight, the wings were expanded to 67 m2. In September 1943, after nearly two years of constant delays, the H V1 was fitted with DB603G prototype engines. It is unknown how these tests developed. The H V2 also crashed on 25 October 1942, severely injuring the crew. The cause was the propellers. The H V3 tested a variety of DB603s until November 1944. On 9 June 1942 it successfully tested at high altitude. It also proved successful testing twin exhausts and pulse jets. Later, in October three and four-bladed duralumin propellers were used. Because of better vibration characteristics, the four-bladed VDM was judged the best performer. On 11 October 1942 the first flight was made at 8,000 m. After, 9,000 m flights were reached. In September 1943 the DB603E had improved superchargers, giving better high-altitude performance. The H series continued as test beds for the M series until October, when they were cancelled for lack of fuel.

The L was a variant of the Do 217K with revised cockpit layout and armament. Only two prototypes were built. The R was a Dornier Do 317 with cabin pressurisation systems removed and modified to carry Hs 293 missiles. Only five built.

===Do 217P===
High altitude reconnaissance/bomber version with two DB 603B engines supercharged by a single Daimler-Benz DB 605T engine, in a so-called &quot;Hohen-Zentrale Anlage&quot; (HZ-Anlage) installation in the central fuselage, as one example of the Henschel Hs 130E had been fitted with, solely for powering a shaft-driven centrifugal supercharger.

==Production==
The production of the Do 217 lasted until December 1943. Between January and August 1944 conversions only took place. Below is a list of the numbers produced.

Quarterly production 1939–1944:
==Flying the Do 217 M-1==
In October 1945 British Captain Eric Brown undertook full handling trials with a Do 217 M-1 WNr 56158 at RAF Farnborough. He recalled a distinctly &quot;underwhelming&quot; experience.
Brown recalled that he took off with full power of some 2,700 rpm and the lightly loaded Do 217 M left the runway at . Brown held a shallow climb, waiting to reach before retracting the undercarriage. Brown timed the time it took to retract, which was between 30 and 40 seconds.
At he reduced power to 2,500 rpm and raised the flaps at about . With the flaps up a climbing speed of was established giving a rate of &quot;very moderate proportions&quot;.

While in cruising mode, Brown took the Dornier to and with the tail at +2 degrees angle of incidence, gave it a top speed of , true air speed.
Brown stated the aircraft was very stable about all three axes, and the controls were well harmonised and effective, and not unduly heavy for bomber operations. At the other end of the speed range, stall occurred at , and was characterised by a gentle nose-down pitch.
At this stage Brown tried the Dornier&#x27;s single-engine performance and this &quot;proved decidedly unimpressive&quot;. It underlined that the aircraft was underpowered. Above , height could not be maintained at 2,300 rpm and its ceiling was barely .
Brown reverted to &quot;normal power&quot;, and decided to &quot;chance his arm&quot; (risk) on a dive-bombing procedure in what he described as a &quot;ponderous aeroplane&quot;.
Brown made a straight dive to , the maximum permitted below in order to get a feel for the controls, which began to stiffen considerably. The engine revolutions built to 2,750 during the dive causing a lot of noise. Brown pulled the aircraft out of its dive though it called for a &quot;good full-blooded heave&quot; on the control column.

After climbing to regain the height lost, Brown decided to test the tail-mounted, clamshell-like dive brake and automatic pull-out equipment. The Dornier entered the dive automatically when the dive switch was selected and soon attained its &quot;braked condition&quot;, limiting the airspeed to . The pull-out was initiated by hitting the bomb-release stick on the control column or selecting the &quot;level flight&quot; switch, which also retracted the dive-brake. Brown stated, &quot;All very sedate and totally unimpressive as a precision weapon&quot;.

The landing procedure began at an air speed of . The oil coolers were opened fully and the radiator hatches opened to 30 degrees. At the undercarriage was lowered, which again took 30 to 40 seconds. Flaps were lowered to their start position at and fully deployed at . The tail had to be trimmed to 4 degrees incidence (tail heavy).
Final approach was made at and touchdown occurred at about . Landing weight was roughly . The control column had to be held back beyond the neutral to keep the tail wheel locked until the landing run was complete.

==Operational history==
The first deliveries of Do 217s to operational units of the Luftwaffe was the pre-production Do 217A-0 reconnaissance aircraft, which entered service with the &quot;Aufklärungsgruppe der Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe&quot; to carry out clandestine reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union. Deliveries of the Do 217E started late in 1940, with some aircraft joining another reconnaissance unit, 2 &quot;Staffel&quot; of &quot;Fernaufklärungsgruppe 11&quot;, which was also involved in spyflights over the Soviet Union from bases in Romania.

===Western Europe===

The first bomber unit to receive the Dornier Do 217 was II &quot;Gruppe&quot; of &quot;Kampfgeschwader 40&quot; (II/KG 40) in March 1941, followed by KG 2 later that year. At first these units, based in the Netherlands, were used to carry out minelaying and anti-shipping operations over the North Sea. On the night of 24/25 April 1942, however, Dornier Do 217s of KG 2 took part in an attack on the city of Exeter, the first raid of what was to become known as the Baedeker Blitz. &#x27;s Dorniers were heavily deployed during the Baedeker raids, against British provincial cities which were less heavily defended than London, which continued until July that year.

The Do 217 squadrons had little time to recover as on 19 August 1942 the Allies launched an amphibious raid on Dieppe in Northern France, with KG 2 launching almost its entire strength of 80 aircraft in response, losing 20 over Dieppe. It had suffered serious losses of trained personnel during operations during 1942, with the number of combat ready crews in KG 2 falling from 88 at the start of the year to 23 by September.

The Dornier Do 217-equipped bomber units spent most of the rest of 1942 recovering from these losses and re-equipping with the more capable Do 217K and M. Night attacks against Britain re-commenced in January 1943, and continued sporadically throughout the year, often suffering heavy losses. As an example the Do 217 equipped KG 2 lost 26 complete crews during March 1943. The pace of bombing attacks against Britain increased again in January 1944 with the launch of Operation Steinbock, with the Do 217 equipped I and III KG/2 and I/KG 66 being involved, these attacks continuing until
May, with the bomber units again taking heavy losses.

Two &quot;Gruppen&quot; of the anti-shipping &quot;Kampfgeschwader 100&quot; (KG 100) equipped with Do 217s in 1943, with II/KG 100 receiving the Do 217E-5, equipped to carry the Hs 293 guided missile and III/KG 100 the Do 217K-2, with the Fritz-X guided bomb. II/KG 100 made its combat debut against Royal Navy warships in the Bay of Biscay on 25 August 1943, when it near missed the sloop HMS &quot;Landguard&quot;, while on 27 August, a second attack by 18 Do 217s sank the sloop HMS &quot;Egret&quot; and badly damaged the destroyer HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. This attack lead to a temporary withdrawal of Royal Navy surface ships from the Bay of Biscay until the guided weapon equipped aircraft were transferred to the Mediterranean following the allied landings at Salerno.

The final actions of Do 217 equipped units over Western Europe was against the allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, when the remaining Do 217 equipped bomber units, II/KG 2 and III/KG 100 were thrown into action against the Allied landings. Losses were heavy, with III/KG 100 losing 8 of 13 servicible Do 217s in 10 days of operations. As American forces broke out of the bridgehead at the end of July, III/KG 100 sent its remaining Do 217s to carry out attacks on bridges over the Rivers Sée and Sélune with Hs 293 missiles. They managed a single hit on one of the bridges, which remained in use, while seven Dorniers were lost.

===Mediterranean and Italy===
Twelve Do 217 J-1 and J-2 variants were acquired by Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; between September 1942 and June 1943 for night fighter operations. One Italian unit was equipped: 235a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; of 60° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (41° &quot;Stormo&quot;). Based at Treviso San Giuseppe, then at Lonate Pozzolo, the unit performed poorly. The unit shot down only one enemy aircraft, and lost one of their own, after nearly a year of activity.

When the Italian Armistice with the Allies was announced on 9 September 1943, the Italian Fleet was instructed to sail to Malta to surrender. III/KG 100, based at Marseilles launched an attack from its base at comprising 11 Do 217s armed with Fritz-X guided bombs against Italian warships near Corsica, sinking the battleship &quot;Roma&quot; and damaging the battleship &quot;Italia&quot;. The Dorniers were then deployed against the Allied landings at Salerno, damaging the cruisers USS &quot;Savannah&quot; and HMS &quot;Uganda&quot; and the battleship HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; with Fritz X bombs.

The Dorniers of KG 100 continued to be deployed against convoys in the Mediterranean, but by the time of the Anzio landings in January 1944, heavy allied fighter cover and jamming reduced the effectiveness of the attacks, although Hs 293 missiles sank the cruiser HMS &quot;Spartan&quot; and several destroyers and merchant ships.

===Defence of the Reich===
Deliveries of the Dornier Do 217J-1 started in March 1942, with night-fighter pilots being unimpressed, considering the type to have poor manoeuvrability and speed. The J-1 was relegated to the training role by summer that year, replaced by the radar equipped J-2 in front-line units. Despite the aircraft&#x27;s faults, the Do 217 was widely used, being used by 11 night-fighter &quot;Gruppen&quot;, although it did not completely equip any unit, usually being operated in conjunction with the more popular Messerschmitt Bf 110. The Luftwaffe deployed the Do 217 night-fighter over Italy and the Eastern front as well as in direct defence of Germany, but the type had been phased out of service by mid-1944.

==Surviving aircraft==
A total of 1,925 Do 217s were produced, however no complete aircraft survives. The largest known relic of this aircraft, a large piece of the rear fuselage, can be found at the Italian Air Force Museum in Rome. One remnant of a Do 217 in the United States is one of the &quot;Motoranlage&quot; unitized BMW 801ML (BMW 801L) radials, still fully cowled, at the New England Air Museum that used to power a Do 217. The remains of two aircraft then based at Toulouse that crashed over the Pyrenées in July 1944, were being recovered in 2013.

<text>The Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF), located in New Haven, Connecticut, US, is an international nonprofit membership organization with over 500 member institutions in more than 20 countries. A financially autonomous research agency based at Yale University since 1949, its mission is to promote understanding of cultural diversity and commonality in the past and present. To accomplish this mission, the Human Relations Area Files produces scholarly resources and infrastructure for research, teaching and learning, and supports and conducts original research on cross-cultural variation. 

HRAF produces two flagship databases accessible by its members: &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; and &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot;. HRAF also sponsors and edits the quarterly journal, &quot;Cross-Cultural Research: The Journal of Comparative Social Science&quot;. Expanded and updated annually, &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; includes ethnographic materials on cultures, past and present, all over the world. Also expanding annually, &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot; covers major archaeological traditions and many more sub-traditions and sites around the world. Documents in both &quot;eHRAF&quot; databases are subject-indexed at the paragraph level by HRAF anthropologists. 

In addition, HRAF offers several open-access resources. &quot;Explaining Human Culture&quot; is a database with standardized summaries that provides a searchable way for researchers to find out what has been learned from previous cross-cultural research about cultural universals and differences. &quot;Explaining Human Culture&quot; also features topical articles on cross-cultural insights (e.g., cross-cultural perspectives on childhood, dwellings, and sports). &quot;Introducing Cross-Cultural Research&quot; is a series of PDFs constituting a &quot;crash course&quot; in cross-cultural methods. Finally, &quot;Teaching eHRAF&quot; is a library of teaching exercises and syllabi (many designed by professors at member institutions) that use &quot;eHRAF&quot; to explore cultural diversity.

==History==
On February 26, 1949, delegates from Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Washington, and Yale University met in New Haven, Connecticut to pledge their membership in a new nonprofit research consortium to be based at Yale. The plan was to &quot;develop and distribute files of organized information related to human societies and cultures.&quot; The name of the new inter-university corporation was the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF). It is an ever-growing catalogue of cross-indexed ethnographic data, sorted and filed by geographic location and cultural characteristics.

The name came from the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary program at Yale at the time. The Institute of Human Relations had sponsored HRAF&#x27;s precursor, the &quot;Cross-Cultural Survey&quot; (see George Peter Murdock), as part of an effort to develop an integrated science of human behavior and culture. On May 7, 1949, the HRAF consortium was formally established with three additional universities—the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Southern California. As of 2018, there are 21 sponsoring members and hundreds of associate members. The HRAF Collection of Ethnography (the pre-electronic precursor to &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot;) was originally distributed as paper files. From the early 1960s until 1994, most members received their annual installments on microfiche. Since 1994, the annual installments have been in electronic form, first on CD-ROM and later online.

==Distinctiveness of the databases==

The HRAF databases were developed to foster comparative research on humans in all their variety, from small-scale hunting and gathering societies to complex states. This provides a contrast to databases that focus solely on countries. In addition, the databases, in contrast to bibliographic ones that provide pointers to materials, actually contain those materials. Searching across cultures for particular kinds of information is facilitated by the unique ethnographic subject classification system that HRAF has developed and refined over more than 60 years, the Outline of Cultural Materials or OCM. In contrast to most subject-indexing which is done at the document level, HRAF has its indexers subject index at the paragraph level. 

For example, suppose users are interested in assessing the degree to which various cultures depend on stored foods. They would discover that there is an index subject category called &quot;Preservation and Storage of Food&quot; (OCM 251). Searching by that subject category would retrieve all of the paragraphs that describe dried, smoked, pickled, refrigerated, frozen, and canned foods, and whatever other ways the people of the given culture store or preserve food. The analysts at HRAF, who have read through and indexed every page of every text that goes into the HRAF files, have made it possible to find the relevant information, even when the user does not know in advance which particular words (including untranslated native words) the original authors may have used. It is also possible to search the eHRAF texts by the words that actually appear in them. The most efficient searches may use a combination of OCM subject categories and keywords, using Boolean operators. But, if there is no standard vocabulary for the subject matter of interest, the user can always use the OCM subject categories to get to the particular kinds of information sought.

==Uses of the eHRAF collections==

The eHRAF Collections can be used for teaching and research on any aspect of cultural and social life. The collections are primarily organized by major geographical region, and then by culture or archaeological tradition, so researchers can access information about particular cultures, particular regions of the world, or do a worldwide or regional cross-cultural comparison. See Cross-cultural studies.

===Cross-cultural research===
Although the HRAF collections can be used for many purposes, they were primarily designed to enable researchers to find information quickly across a broad range of cultures so that societies could be compared on particular dimensions of variation. Most cross-cultural researchers test hypotheses on worldwide samples with the aim of arriving at valid generalizations about human behavior and social and cultural life. But smaller-scale comparisons are also possible, such as regional comparisons, or comparisons of particular types of societies (such as hunter-gatherers or prehistoric states). While passages in ethnographies or archaeological reports are readily found using HRAF&#x27;s subject-indexing system, there are few pre-coded variables in eHRAF. Therefore, researchers need to develop nominal, ordinal, or interval coding scales to measure the particular types of variation.

For example, the subject category &quot;Techniques of Socialization&quot; (OCM 861) will find passages that deal with cultural ideas about childtraining or general methods of discipline, but coding schemes need to be developed to measure dimensions of variation, such as &quot;degree to which corporal punishment is employed,&quot; &quot;degree to which threatening is employed,&quot; or &quot;degree to which children are praised.&quot; It is not difficult, after a little practice, to develop ordinal scales that can allow for the coding of words into quantitative measures, and once that is done it is easy to use available software to test hypotheses, and compare, combine, and model the results. The indexed texts in HRAF are also amenable to qualitative cross-cultural comparisons.

The HRAF databases were built somewhat opportunistically, so for hypothesis-testing research it is best to use a sub-sample within &quot;eHRAF&quot; that was designed to be representative. There are two main representative sub-samples within &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; and one within &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot;. &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; contains 1) a 60-culture sample known as the &quot;Probability Sample Files&quot; (PSF); and 2) most of the societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (expected to be completely included by 2020). Researchers can use the PSF to test hypotheses on a fairly large and unbiased sample of the world&#x27;s cultures. Because the PSF sample includes only one culture (that met data quality criteria) randomly selected from each of 60 macro-culture areas around the world, correlations and other statistical results are likely to be trustworthy and functional, not due to duplications in the sample because of random diffusion or common ancestry. From 2000 on, &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; has included additional randomly selected cases that may be added to the PSF for scientific sampling (called the Simple Random Sample). The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample of 186 societies also stratified the world into culture areas and then chose one society per culture area, but it differs from the PSF in that 200 culture areas were used and the choice of a society was based on judgmental rather than random selection. &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot; includes an annually-growing Simple Random Sample (SRS) of archaeological traditions drawn from the Outline Of Archaeological Traditions that can be used for hypothesis-testing. In addition, &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot; contains complete tradition sequences. 

The results of cross-cultural studies using ethnography are usually correlational. But it would be informative to go beyond cross-sectional validation, in particular to see if temporal sequences validate causal theories. The &quot;eHRAF World Cultures&quot; database often contains information from more than one time period, so while not often done, it is possible to measure ethnographic cases for two different points in time. But for many questions about cultural evolution, the ethnographic (or ethnohistorical) record is not likely to provide enough of the necessary time-series data for statistical analysis.

This dilemma particularly applies to the classical questions about human cultural evolution, including the emergence of agriculture, the rise of social inequality and the first cities, and the origins of the state. Investigators of cultural evolution can use the &quot;eHRAF World Cultures and eHRAF Archaeology&quot; databases to study and model causal sequences. Cross-cultural (comparative ethnographic) studies can provide archaeological indicators of cultural and other (e.g., physical and social environmental) features. Using those indicators, researchers could test many causal ideas about the major events in cultural evolution and devolution on the time-series data in the archaeological record. Thus, the data in &quot;eHRAF Archaeology&quot; can allow researchers to determine whether evolutionary patterns in one region are repeated in others, and to determine whether the presumed causal factors in one region are important, and antecedent, in other world regions too. Comparative ethnography can tell us about cultural statics, what predicts cross-cultural variation in recent times. Comparative archaeology can tell us about cultural dynamics, what comes first and what follows what in prehistory.

<text>The Smoking Gun is a website that posts legal documents, arrest records, and police mugshots on a daily basis. The intent is to bring to the public light information that is somewhat obscure or unreported by more mainstream media sources. Most of the site&#x27;s content revolves around historical and current events, although it also features documents and photos relating to out-of-the-ordinary crimes and people.

==History==
The website was founded in 1997, by William Bastone; his wife, Barbara Glauber, a graphic designer; and Daniel Green, a freelance journalist, formerly of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and the son of Stephen L. Green. Most of The Smoking Gun&#x27;s content is obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, and from public records such as court documents. The site has used those requests to assemble a collection of mugshots of current and historical celebrities.

The cable network truTV, formerly Court TV, purchased The Smoking Gun, as well as the website Crime Library, in 2000. A series of the same name premiered on Court TV in 2005, which featured some of the site&#x27;s stories and assorted sketch humor, using string puppets. This series was later moved and shown on Adult Swim.

The site published its second book, &quot;The Dog Dialed 911: A Book of Lists from The Smoking Gun&quot;, in October 2006.

From March 2008 until January 2011, on truTV, The Smoking Gun sponsored a cable television series called &quot;The Smoking Gun Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot;. The series was originally known as &quot;World&#x27;s Dumbest Criminals&quot;, but was re-titled &quot;World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; and began covering other topics. William was a cast member on the show alongside Smoking Gun writer Andrew Goldberg. They left the show after season 1. As of January 2011, the program was re-titled again to &quot;truTV Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot;

In June 2014, The Smoking Gun was sold back to William Bastone.

== Investigations ==

The Smoking Gun began to conduct investigations of criminal activity and publicize its results. In August 2009, the site outed members of Pranknet, a virtual community notorious for tricking hotel and fast-food restaurant employees into setting off fire alarms, engaging fire-suppression systems, and engaging in humiliating acts. The group, whose members include two convicted child molestors, also engaged in threatening telephone harassment, placing fake Craigslist ads and shouting racial epithets and obscenities at people responding to them. The group members responded to Craigslist ads placed by young mothers selling household goods, and after gaining the seller&#x27;s address in an exchange, members would threaten the seller, saying that they would go to their house to rape them and murder their children.

In 2006, the site uncovered widespread fabrication in James Frey&#x27;s alleged memoir &quot;A Million Little Pieces.&quot; This investigation led to a public rebuke of Frey by talk show host Oprah Winfrey, who had previously endorsed Frey&#x27;s book as part of her Oprah&#x27;s Book Club. Frey&#x27;s book, describing his alleged years of drug and alcohol abuse and subsequent recovery, contained a number of descriptions of criminal or otherwise outrageous incidents.

In 2010, the site revealed financial irregularities in Yéle Haiti, a charitable foundation set up by rapper Wyclef Jean, soon after he publicized its successful fundraising for disaster relief following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. As reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the foundation had failed to file several years of tax returns. Later it was found to have illegally diverted funds to the personal use of Jean and some of his family. In 2019 Jean admitted irregularities at the charity.

<text>Jamaat Ansar al-Sunnah (), also known as Jaish Ansar al-Sunna (Army of the Helpers of Sunnah), [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] Battalion or simply as Ansar al-Sunnah was an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops and their local allies during the Iraq War. The group was primarily based in northern and central Iraq, and included mainly Iraqi (mostly Arab but also Kurdish) fighters. In 2007, it split into Jama&#x27;at Ansar al-Islam and Ansar al-Sunnah Shariah Committee, which changed its name to Ansar al-Ahlu Sunnah in 2011.

The group has been a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000 since 14 October 2005.

==History==
The group was founded in September 2003, as an umbrella organization for guerrillas, with former members of Ansar al-Islam who had fled to Iran after a 2003 joint operation by Iraqi and US forces. Their goal was to expel U.S. occupation forces from Iraq.

Following the twin Sunni and Shiite uprisings of the spring and summer of 2004, and the subsequent decrease in U.S patrols and the creation of &quot;no-go&quot; areas in the Sunni Triangle, Ansar al-Sunna was believed to be part of a loose coalition of insurgent groups (also including guerrillas from al-Tawhid wal Jihad) controlling the Sunni cities of Fallujah, Ramadi, Samarra, and Baquba (U.S. offensives later largely wrested control from Baquba, Fallujah, and Samarra, although underground guerrilla resistance forces still had a strong presence in those cities).

The United States and Iraqi Interim governments linked Ansar al-Sunna with Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s, Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (al-Qaeda in Iraq). In October 2004 Ansar al-Sunna released a video beheading of a Turkish truck driver on its website. The kidnappers on the video identified themselves as members of al-Tawhid wal Jihad (Source: MERIA). However a letter intercepted by the American military in January 2007 revealed the two groups had begun feuding.

In July 2007 representatives of the Jaish Ansar al-Sunna were instrumental in forming an alliance of Sunni militant groups to prepare for the withdrawal of American and allied forces. The new alliance was composed of seven groupings explicitly excluding al-Qaeda and the Baath-party. This delimitation revealed a split between al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sunna over tactics, alleged attacks on Iraqi Shia civilians being a main point of difference.

In December 2007, the leader of the Ansar al-Sunnah, Abu Abdullah al-Shafi, issued a communique acknowledging that the group was simply another name for Ansar al-Islam. The communique went on to state that from that point on, they would return to operating under the name of Ansar al-Islam.

A small group still using the name &quot;Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna&quot; has been active in the surge of militant activity in 2014.

==Suicide bombings==
Jaish Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for several suicide bombings in Iraq, including the devastating attacks on the offices of two main Kurdish political parties, KDP and PUK, in Irbil on February 1, 2004, that killed at least 109 people. The strikes were one of the bloodiest attacks launched by insurgents since the start of the war.

It produced tapes and CDs that marked the &quot;last testaments&quot; of six bombers from previous attacks, three of whom appeared non-Iraqi. Its name also appeared with eleven other insurgent groups on leaflets passed out in the Sunni Triangle cities of Ramadi and Fallujah from January 31, 2004 to February 1, 2004. The leaflets detailed the insurgency&#x27;s plan for seizing Iraqi cities following the departure of coalition forces.

It also had a strong presence in Mosul where it launched an offensive in November 2004 along with other foreign fighters and militant groups. After the Battle of Mosul (2004) the group maintained pockets of resistance in the western part of the city. It continued to clash with units such as the 1st Battalion, 25th Infantry Regiment and it claimed responsibility for a major suicide bombing of the dining hall at the US base in Mosul on December 21, 2004 that killed 22 people, including 14 American soldiers. The attacker was reportedly a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest under the uniform of an Iraqi security officer. The suicide bomber&#x27;s name was Abu Museli.
