<text>In mathematics, Sperner&#x27;s lemma is a combinatorial result on colorings of triangulations, analogous to the Brouwer fixed point theorem, which is equivalent to it. It states that every Sperner coloring (described below) of a triangulation of an simplex contains a cell whose vertices all have different colors.

The initial result of this kind was proved by Emanuel Sperner, in relation with proofs of invariance of domain. Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of fixed points and in root-finding algorithms, and are applied in fair division (cake cutting) algorithms. 

According to the Soviet &quot;Mathematical Encyclopaedia&quot; (ed. I.M. Vinogradov), a related 1929 theorem (of Knaster, Borsuk and Mazurkiewicz) had also become known as the &quot;Sperner lemma&quot; – this point is discussed in the English translation (ed. M. Hazewinkel). It is now commonly known as the Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma.

==Statement==
=== One-dimensional case ===

In one dimension, Sperner&#x27;s Lemma can be regarded as a discrete version of the intermediate value theorem. In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete function takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times.

=== Two-dimensional case ===
The two-dimensional case is the one referred to most frequently. It is stated as follows:

Subdivide a triangle arbitrarily into a triangulation consisting of smaller triangles meeting edge to edge. Then a Sperner coloring of the triangulation is defined as an assignment of three colors to the vertices of the triangulation such that
# Each of the three vertices , , and of the initial triangle has a distinct color
# The vertices that lie along any edge of triangle have only two colors, the two colors at the endpoints of the edge. For example, each vertex on must have the same color as or .
Then every Sperner coloring of every triangulation has at least one &quot;rainbow triangle&quot;, a smaller triangle in the triangulation that has its vertices colored with all three different colors. More precisely, there must be an odd number of rainbow triangles.

=== Multidimensional case ===
In the general case the lemma refers to a -dimensional simplex:
:formula_1

Consider any triangulation , a disjoint division of formula_2 into smaller -dimensional simplices, again meeting face-to-face. Denote the coloring function as:
:formula_3
where is the set of vertices of . A coloring function defines a Sperner coloring when:
# The vertices of the large simplex are colored with different colors, that is, without loss of generality, for .
# Vertices of located on any -dimensional subface of the large simplex formula_4are colored only with the colorsformula_5

Then every Sperner coloring of every triangulation of the -dimensional simplex has an odd number of instances of a &quot;rainbow simplex&quot;, meaning a simplex whose vertices are colored with all colors. In particular, there must be at least one rainbow simplex.

== Proofs ==

=== Proof by induction ===
We shall first address the two-dimensional case. Consider a graph built from the triangulation as follows:

:The vertices of are the members of plus the area outside the triangle. Two vertices are connected with an edge if their corresponding areas share a common border with one endpoint colored 1 and the other colored 2.

Note that on the interval there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and as we move along , there must be an odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). On the intervals BC and CA, there are no borders colored 1-2 at all. Therefore, the vertex of corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the handshaking lemma) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of .

It can be easily seen that the only possible degree of a triangle from is 0, 1, or 2, and that the degree 1 corresponds to a triangle colored with the three colors 1, 2, and 3.

Thus we have obtained a slightly stronger conclusion, which says that in a triangulation there is an odd number (and at least one) of full-colored triangles.

A multidimensional case can be proved by induction on the dimension of a simplex. We apply the same reasoning, as in the two-dimensional case, to conclude that in a -dimensional triangulation there is an odd number of full-colored simplices.

=== Commentary ===

Here is an elaboration of the proof given previously, for a reader new to graph theory.

This diagram numbers the colors of the vertices of the example given previously. The small triangles whose vertices all have different numbers are shaded in the graph. Each small triangle becomes a node in the new graph derived from the triangulation. The small letters identify the areas, eight inside the figure, and area designates the space outside of it.

As described previously, those nodes that share an edge whose endpoints are numbered 1 and 2 are joined in the derived graph. For example, node shares an edge with the outer area , and its vertices all have different numbers, so it is also shaded. Node is not shaded because two vertices have the same number, but it is joined to the outer area.

One could add a new full-numbered triangle, say by inserting a node numbered 3 into the edge between 1 and 1 of node , and joining that node to the other vertex of . Doing so would have to create a pair of new nodes, like the situation with nodes and .

=== Proof without induction ===
Andrew McLennan and Rabee Tourky presented a different proof, using the volume of a simplex. It proceeds in one step, with no induction.

== Computing a Sperner simplex ==
Suppose there is a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional simplex of side-length &quot;N&quot;, and it is triangulated into sub-simplices of side-length 1. There is a function that, given any vertex of the triangulation, returns its color. The coloring is guaranteed to satisfy Sperner&#x27;s boundary condition. How many times do we have to call the function in order to find a rainbow simplex? Obviously, we can go over all the triangulation vertices, whose number is O(&quot;Nd&quot;), which is polynomial in &quot;N&quot; when the dimension is fixed. But, can it be done in time O(poly(log &quot;N&quot;)), which is polynomial in the binary representation of N?

This problem was first studied by Christos Papadimitriou. He introduced a complexity class called PPAD, which contains this as well as related problems (such as finding a Brouwer fixed point). He proved that finding a Sperner simplex is PPAD-complete even for &quot;d&quot;=3. Some 15 years later, Chen and Deng proved PPAD-completeness even for &quot;d&quot;=2. It is believed that PPAD-hard problems cannot be solved in time O(poly(log &quot;N&quot;)).

== Generalizations ==
=== Subsets of labels ===
Suppose that each vertex of the triangulation may be labeled with multiple colors, so that the coloring function is .

For every sub-simplex, the set of labelings on its vertices is a set-family over the set of colors . This set-family can be seen as a hypergraph.

If, for every vertex on a face of the simplex, the colors in are a subset of the set of colors on the face endpoints, then there exists a sub-simplex with a &quot;balanced labeling&quot; – a labeling in which the corresponding hypergraph admits a perfect fractional matching. To illustrate, here are some balanced labeling examples for :

* - balanced by the weights .
* - balanced by the weights .
* - balanced by the weights .
This was proved by Shapley in 1973. It is a combinatorial analogue of the KKMS lemma.

=== Polytopal variants ===
Suppose that we have a -dimensional polytope with vertices. is triangulated, and each vertex of the triangulation is labeled with a label from Every main vertex is labeled . A sub-simplex is called &quot;fully-labeled&quot; if it is -dimensional, and each of its vertices has a different label. If every vertex in a face of is labeled with one of the labels on the endpoints of , then there are at least fully-labeled simplices. Some special cases are:

* . In this case, is a simplex. The polytopal Sperner lemma guarantees that there is at least 1 fully-labeled simplex. That is, it reduces to Sperner&#x27;s lemma.
* . Suppose a two-dimensional polygon with vertices is triangulated and labeled using the labels such that, on each face between vertex and vertex , only the labels and are used. Then, there are at least sub-triangles in which three different labels are used.

The general statement was conjectured by Atanassov in 1996, who proved it for the case . The proof of the general case was first given by de Loera, Peterson, and Su in 2002. They provide two proofs: the first is non-constructive and uses the notion of &quot;pebble sets&quot;; the second is constructive and is based on arguments of following paths in graphs.

Meunier extended the theorem from polytopes to &quot;polytopal bodies,&quot; which need not be convex or simply-connected. In particular, if is a polytope, then the set of its faces is a polytopal body. In every Sperner labeling of a polytopal body with vertices , there are at least:
:formula_6
fully-labeled simplices such that any pair of these simplices receives two different labelings. The degree is the number of edges of to which belongs. Since the degree is at least , the lower bound is at least . But it can be larger. For example, for the cyclic polytope in 4 dimensions with vertices, the lower bound is:
:formula_7

Musin further extended the theorem to -dimensional piecewise-linear manifolds, with or without a boundary.

Asada, Frick, Pisharody, Polevy, Stoner, Tsang and Wellner further extended the theorem to pseudomanifolds with boundary, and improved the lower bound on the number of facets with pairwise-distinct labels.

=== Cubic variants ===
Suppose that, instead of a simplex triangulated into sub-simplices, we have an -dimensional cube partitioned into smaller -dimensional cubes.

Harold W. Kuhn proved the following lemma. Suppose the cube , for some integer , is partitioned into unit cubes. Suppose each vertex of the partition is labeled with a label from such that for every vertex : (1) if then the label on is at most ; (2) if then the label on is not . Then there exists a unit cube with all the labels (some of them more than once). The special case is: suppose a square is partitioned into sub-squares, and each vertex is labeled with a label from The left edge is labeled with (= at most 1); the bottom edge is labeled with or (= at most 2); the top edge is labeled with or (= not 2); and the right edge is labeled with or (= not 1). Then there is a square labeled with 

Another variant, related to the Poincaré–Miranda theorem, is as follows. Suppose the cube is partitioned into unit cubes. Suppose each vertex is labeled with a binary vector of length , such that for every vertex : (1) if then the coordinate of label on is 0; (2) if then coordinate of the label on is 1; (3) if two vertices are neighbors, then their labels differ by at most one coordinate. Then there exists a unit cube in which all labels are different. In two dimensions, another way to formulate this theorem is: in any labeling that satisfies conditions (1) and (2), there is at least one cell in which the sum of labels is 0 [a 1-dimensional cell with and labels, or a 2-dimensional cells with all four different labels].

Wolsey strengthened these two results by proving that the number of completely-labeled cubes is odd.

Musin extended these results to general quadrangulations.

=== Rainbow variants ===
Suppose that, instead of a single labeling, we have different Sperner labelings. We consider pairs (simplex, permutation) such that, the label of each vertex of the simplex is chosen from a different labeling (so for each simplex, there are different pairs). Then there are at least fully labeled pairs. This was proved by Ravindra Bapat for any triangulation. A simpler proof, which only works for specific triangulations, was presented later by Su.

Another way to state this lemma is as follows. Suppose there are people, each of whom produces a different Sperner labeling of the same triangulation. Then, there exists a simplex, and a matching of the people to its vertices, such that each vertex is labeled by its owner differently (one person labels its vertex by 1, another person labels its vertex by 2, etc.). Moreover, there are at least such matchings. This can be used to find an envy-free cake-cutting with connected pieces.

Asada, Frick, Pisharody, Polevy, Stoner, Tsang and Wellner extended this theorem to pseudomanifolds with boundary.

More generally, suppose we have different Sperner labelings, where may be different than . Then:

# For any positive integers whose sum is , there exists a baby-simplex on which, for every labeling number uses at least (out of ) distinct labels. Moreover, each label is used by at least one (out of ) labeling.
# For any positive integers whose sum is , there exists a baby-simplex on which, for every , the label is used by at least (out of ) different labelings.

Both versions reduce to Sperner&#x27;s lemma when , or when all labelings are identical.

See for similar generalizations.

===Oriented variants===

Brown and Cairns strengthened Sperner&#x27;s lemma by considering the &quot;orientation&quot; of simplices. Each sub-simplex has an orientation that can be either +1 or -1 (if it is fully-labeled), or 0 (if it is not fully-labeled). They proved that the sum of all orientations of simplices is +1. In particular, this implies that there is an odd number of fully-labeled simplices.

As an example for , suppose a triangle is triangulated and labeled with Consider the cyclic sequence of labels on the boundary of the triangle. Define the &quot;degree&quot; of the labeling as the number of switches from 1 to 2, minus the number of switches from 2 to 1. See examples in the table at the right. Note that the degree is the same if we count switches from 2 to 3 minus 3 to 2, or from 3 to 1 minus 1 to 3.

Musin proved that &quot;the number of fully labeled triangles is at least the degree of the labeling&quot;. In particular, if the degree is nonzero, then there exists at least one fully labeled triangle.

If a labeling satisfies the Sperner condition, then its degree is exactly 1: there are 1-2 and 2-1 switches only in the side between vertices 1 and 2, and the number of 1-2 switches must be one more than the number of 2-1 switches (when walking from vertex 1 to vertex 2). Therefore, the original Sperner lemma follows from Musin&#x27;s theorem.

=== Trees and cycles ===
There is a similar lemma about finite and infinite trees and cycles.

== Related results ==
Mirzakhani and Vondrak study a weaker variant of a Sperner labeling, in which the only requirement is that label &quot;i&quot; is not used on the face opposite to vertex &quot;i&quot;. They call it &quot;Sperner-admissible labeling&quot;. They show that there are Sperner-admissible labelings in which every cell contains at most 4 labels. They also prove an optimal lower bound on the number of cells that must have at least two different labels in each Sperner-admissible labeling. They also prove that, for any Sperner-admissible partition of the regular simplex, the total area of the boundary between the parts is minimized by the Voronoi partition.

== Applications ==
Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of fixed points. A Sperner coloring can be constructed such that fully labeled simplices correspond to fixed points of a given function. By making a triangulation smaller and smaller, one can show that the limit of the fully labeled simplices is exactly the fixed point. Hence, the technique provides a way to approximate fixed points.
A related application is the numerical detection of periodic orbits and symbolic dynamics. Sperner&#x27;s lemma can also be used in root-finding algorithms and fair division algorithms; see Simmons–Su protocols. 

Sperner&#x27;s lemma is one of the key ingredients of the proof of Monsky&#x27;s theorem, that a square cannot be cut into an odd number of equal-area triangles.

Sperner&#x27;s lemma can be used to find a competitive equilibrium in an exchange economy, although there are more efficient ways to find it. 

Fifty years after first publishing it, Sperner presented a survey on the development, influence and applications of his combinatorial lemma.

<doc id="465078" wikidata="Q1936665" url="?curid=465078" title="Helical antenna">
<text>A helical antenna is an antenna consisting of one or more conducting wires wound in the form of a helix. A helical antenna made of one helical wire, the most common type, is called &quot;monofilar&quot;, while antennas with two or four wires in a helix are called &quot;bifilar&quot;, or &quot;quadrifilar&quot;, respectively.

In most cases, directional helical antennas are mounted over a ground plane, while omnidirectional designs may not be. The feed line is connected between the bottom of the helix and the ground plane. Helical antennas can operate in one of two principal modes: normal or axial.

In the &quot;normal mode&quot; or &quot;broadside&quot; helical antenna, the diameter and the pitch of the aerial are small compared with the wavelength. The antenna acts similarly to an electrically short dipole or monopole, equivalent to a wave vertical and the radiation pattern, similar to these antennas is omnidirectional, with maximum radiation at right angles to the helix axis. For monofilar designs the radiation is linearly polarized parallel to the helix axis. These are used for compact antennas for portable hand held as well as mobile vehicle mount two-way radios, and in larger scale for UHF television broadcasting antennas. In bifilar or quadrifilar implementations, broadside circularly polarized radiation can be realized.

In the &quot;axial mode&quot; or &quot;end-fire&quot; helical antenna, the diameter and pitch of the helix are comparable to a wavelength. The antenna functions as a directional antenna radiating a beam off the ends of the helix, along the antenna&#x27;s axis. It radiates circularly polarized radio waves. These are used for satellite communication. Axial mode operation was discovered by physicist John D. Kraus

==Normal-mode helical==
If the circumference of the helix is significantly less than a wavelength and its &quot;pitch&quot; (axial distance between successive turns) is significantly less than a quarter wavelength, the antenna is called a &quot;normal-mode&quot; helix. The antenna acts similar to a monopole antenna, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern, radiating equal power in all directions perpendicular to the antenna&#x27;s axis. However, because of the inductance added by the helical shape, the antenna acts like an &quot;inductively loaded&quot; monopole; at its resonant frequency it is shorter than a quarter-wavelength long. Therefore, normal-mode helices can be used as electrically short monopoles, an alternative to center- or base-loaded whip antennas, in applications where a full sized quarter-wave monopole would be too big. As with other electrically short antennas, the gain, and thus the communication range, of the helix will be less than that of a full sized antenna. Their compact size makes &quot;helicals&quot; useful as antennas for mobile and portable communications equipment on the HF, VHF, and UHF bands.

The loading provided by the helix allows the antenna to be physically shorter than its electrical length of a quarter-wavelength. This means that for example a wave antenna at 27 MHz is long and is physically quite unsuitable for mobile applications. The reduced size of a helical provides the same radiation pattern in a much more compact physical size with only a slight reduction in signal performance.

An effect of using a helical conductor rather than a straight one is that the matching impedance is changed from the nominal 50 Ω to between 25 and 35 Ω base impedance. This does not seem to be adverse to operation or matching with a normal 50 Ω transmission line, provided the connecting feed is the electrical equivalent of a  wavelength at the frequency of operation.

===Mobile HF helicals===
Another example of the type as used in mobile communications is &quot;spaced constant turn&quot; in which one or more different linear windings are wound on a single former and spaced so as to provide an efficient balance between capacitance and inductance for the radiating element at a particular resonant frequency. Many examples of this type have been used extensively for 27 MHz CB radio with a wide variety of designs originating in the US and Australia in the late 1960s. To date many millions of these ‘helical antennas’ have been mass-produced for mainly mobile vehicle use and reached peak production during the CB Radio boom-times during the 1970s to late 1980s and used worldwide.

Multi-frequency versions with manual plug-in taps have become the mainstay for multi-band single-sideband modulation (SSB) HF communications with frequency coverage over the whole HF spectrum from 1 MHz to 30 MHz with from 2 to 6 dedicated frequency tap points tuned at dedicated and allocated frequencies in the land mobile, marine, and aircraft bands. Recently these antennas have been superseded by electronically tuned antenna matching devices. Most examples were wound with copper wire using a fiberglass rod as a former. The usually flexible or ridged radiator is then covered with a PVC or polyolefin heat-shrink tubing which provides a resilient and rugged waterproof covering for the finished mobile antenna. The fibreglass rod was then usually glued and/or crimped to a brass fitting and screw mounted onto an insulated base affixed to a vehicle roof, guard or bull-bar mount. This mounting provided a ground plane or reflector (provided by the vehicle) for an effective vertical radiation pattern.

These popular designs are still in common use and the &quot;constant turn&quot; design originating in Australia have been universally adapted as standard FM receiving antennas for many factory produced motor vehicles as well as the existing basic style of aftermarket HF and VHF mobile helical. Another common use for broadside helixes is in the so-called &quot;rubber ducky antenna&quot; found on most portable VHF and UHF radios using a steel or copper conductor as the radiating element and usually terminated to a BNC/TNC style or screw on connector for quick removal.

===Helical broadcasting antennas===
Specialized normal-mode helical antennas &quot;(see photo)&quot; are used as transmitting antennas for television broadcasting stations on the VHF and UHF bands. These consist of a helical conductor around a tubular steel pole, mounted on standoff insulators. The element consists of two equal length helices, a right-hand and a left-hand, joined at the center. The rod and the surface of the pole under it act as a leaky transmission line, radiating radio waves perpendicular to the pole. The antenna is fed at the bottom, and unlike other normal-mode helicals functions as a traveling-wave antenna, with the amplitude of the current decreasing going up the shaft as the energy is radiated. At top the current is down by 40 dB, so there isn&#x27;t much reflection. To radiate perpendicularly, the length of each turn must be a multiple of the wavelength, in most antennas 2 wavelengths. The antenna has a bandwidth of only 6-7%, so to make it adjustable to different frequencies the element is divided into multiple vertical &quot;bays&quot;, with a phase-adjustment &quot;collar&quot; between each, to keep the phase constant along the length of the tower.

==Axial-mode helical==


When the helix circumference is near the wavelength of operation, the antenna operates in &quot;axial mode&quot;. This is a nonresonant traveling wave mode, in which instead of standing waves, the waves of current and voltage travel in one direction, up the helix from the feedpoint in a transmitting antenna and down the helix toward the feedpoint in a receiving antenna. Instead of radiating linearly polarized waves normal to the antenna&#x27;s axis, it radiates a beam of radio waves with circular polarisation along the axis, off the ends of the antenna. The main lobes of the radiation pattern are along the axis of the helix, off both ends. Since in a directional antenna only radiation in one direction is wanted, the other end of the helix is terminated in a flat metal sheet or screen reflector to reflect the waves forward.

In radio transmission, circular polarisation is often used where the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas cannot be easily controlled, such as in animal tracking and spacecraft communications, or where the polarisation of the signal may change, so end-fire helical antennas are frequently used for these applications. Since large helices are difficult to build and unwieldy to steer and aim, the design is commonly employed only at higher frequencies, ranging from VHF up to microwave.

The helix of the antenna can twist in two possible directions: right-handed or left-handed, the former having the same form as that of a common corkscrew. The 4-helix array in the first illustration uses left-handed helices, while all other illustrations show right-handed helices. In an axial-mode helical antenna the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the emitted wave. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarized radiation it emits is often described in ways that appear to be ambiguous. However, J.D. Kraus (the inventor of the helical antenna) states &quot;The left-handed helix responds to left-circular polarisation, and the right handed helix to right-circular polarisation (IEEE definition)&quot;. The IEEE defines the sense of polarisation as:
: &quot;the sense of polarization, or handedness ... is called right handed (left handed) if the direction of rotation is clockwise (anti-clockwise) for an observer looking in the direction of propagation&quot;
Thus a right-handed helix radiates a wave which is right-handed, the electric field vector rotating clockwise looking in the direction of propagation.

Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarized signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarized antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarized signals, and vice versa.

The dimensions of the helix are determined by the wavelength () of the radio waves used, which depends on the frequency. In order to operate in axial-mode, the circumference should be equal to the wavelength. The pitch angle should be 13°, which is a pitch distance (distance between each turn) of 0.23 times the circumference, which means the spacing between the coils should be approximately one-quarter of the wavelength (). The number of turns in the helix determines how directional the antenna is: more turns improves the gain in the direction of its axis at both ends (or at one end, when a ground plate is used), at a cost of gain in the other directions. When it operates more in normal mode where the gain direction is a donut shape to the sides instead of out the ends.

Terminal impedance in axial mode ranges between 100 and 200 Ω, approximately

:formula_1

where is the circumference of the helix, and is the wavelength. Impedance matching (when to standard 50 or 75 Ω coaxial cable is often done by a quarter wave stripline section acting as an impedance transformer between the helix and the ground plate.

The maximum directive gain is approximately:

:formula_2

where is the number of turns and S is the spacing between turns. Most designs use and so the gain is typically In decibels, the gain is formula_3

The half-power beamwidth is:

:formula_4

The beamwidth between nulls is:

:formula_5

The gain of the helical antenna strongly depends on the reflector. The above classical formulas assume that the reflector has the form of a circular resonator (a circular plate with a rim) and the pitch angle is optimal for this type of reflector. Nevertheless, these formulas overestimate the gain by several dB. The optimal pitch that maximizes the gain for a flat ground plane is in the range 3–10° and it depends on the wire radius and antenna length.

<doc id="465081" wikidata="Q545606" url="?curid=465081" title="Francisco de Bobadilla">
<text>Francisco de Bobadilla (c. 1448 – 11 July 1502) was an official under the Crown of Castile and a knight of the Order of Calatrava. He was also the nephew of Beatriz de Bobadilla, marchioness and of Peñalosa, a patron of Christopher Columbus and close friend to Queen Isabella. He was sent to the island of Hispaniola as a judge, where he arrested Columbus for official misconduct. He served as Viceroy from 1500 until 1502. He is often mistaken for his uncle with whom he shares a name, Francisco de Bobadilla y Maldonado.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Francisco de Bobadilla was born between 1445 and 1450 in Medina del Campo, Valladolid, Kingdom of Castile. In 1480 he was named knight commander of the Order of Calatrava in Auñón, Berninches, Castellanos y El Collado, which indicates that he was between 30 and 35 years old and possessed of some social standing, as this position would not have been given to someone young. In Auñón, residents revolted against his policies, including making attempts on his life.

=== Judge ===
On 21 May 1499, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain named him as a judge with orders to investigate reports from Hispaniola, namely numerous complaints about the policies of Christopher Columbus and his brothers which included accusations that they accepted bribes, enslaved the natives, under-paid the quinto real for pearls and gold, mishandled the rebellion of Francisco Roldán, and that they had committed treason.

=== Investigation of Columbus and his brothers ===

Bobadilla set sail for Hispaniola at the beginning of June, arriving on 23 August 1500. He brought with him 500 men and 14 Amerindians who had previously been Columbus&#x27; slaves, and who were now being returned to their home. Once in Santo Domingo he met with Giacomo Columbus, youngest brother of Christopher, who was governing the island at that time because of Christopher being in La Vega. Shortly after the meeting began, Bobadilla ordered Giacomo to leave the fortress in which he was living, but Giacomo refused to recognize Bobadilla&#x27;s authority, believing his brother Christopher&#x27;s to be superior. 

Francisco de Bobadilla began his investigation, basing it on the accusations that had made their way to the Spanish crown, and he gathered a large number of complaints against Bartholomew, Giacomo, and Christopher. He reputed that their governance had been disastrous, with serious abuses of authority, and was angry at them for hanging five Spaniards who had committed atrocities against the natives. Bobadilla then ordered the arrest of both brothers and that they be taken to Spain. He also seized all assets belonging to the two.

The neutrality and accuracy of the accusations and investigations of Bobadilla toward Columbus and his brothers have been disputed by historians, given the anti-Italian sentiment of the Spaniards and Bobadilla&#x27;s desire to take over Columbus&#x27; position.

=== Arrest of Columbus and his brothers ===

On Bobadilla&#x27;s order, Christopher Columbus appeared before him in Santo Domingo in September 1500. Columbus was then jailed in the fortress there together with his other brother Bartholomew Columbus, who had returned to Santo Domingo after a campaign against the natives in Jaragua. At the beginning of October, the pair was sent to Spain in the custody of Captain Alonso de Vallejo. They were then turned over to Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, who was becoming the informal head of Castile&#x27;s colonial administration and was a public critic of Christopher. Despite everything, the Monarchs treated Columbus cordially and ordered his release, saying that the accusations against him were insufficient to warrant his imprisonment. They did not exonerate him, however.

Ferdinand Columbus, Christopher&#x27;s illegitimate second son, was at that time a page to Queen Isabella. He would write in his father&#x27;s biography that the Catholic Monarchs, seeing various factions in court alleging that payments were not being made and letters sent to Spain from people who were unhappy on Hispaniola, decided to send a judge to investigate what was happening. For Ferdinand, the visit from this judge must have seemed like a great relief for his father, since &quot;the Admiral&quot; seemed to be facing rebellious factions. According to Ferdinand, Bobadilla &quot;recognized and favored the rebels&quot; upon arriving in Santo Domingo, and absolved the population from tribute for 20 years in order to curry their favor. 

=== Governor of Hispaniola ===
Francisco de Bobadilla took over the governorship of Hispaniola on 23 August 1500, shortly after his arrival. During his tenure, he incentivized private enterprise and set a policy whereby natives would primarily work in gold extraction in the existing mines in Haina and Cibao. According to Ferdinand Columbus, Bobadilla spent rents and royal tributes in order to win the population&#x27;s favor, alleging that the Monarchs only wanted to possess the land and were unconcerned about anything else. He further claimed that Bobadilla auctioned off land that Christopher had obtained for the Monarchs below market price and gave natives to various rich and powerful people on the condition that they share their slaves&#x27; earnings with him. Bobadilla did cancel mining taxes in a successful attempt to stimulate gold production. Bobadilla also pardoned Francisco Roldán, who had established a competing regime in western Hispaniola in 1497.

=== End of governorship and death ===

In 1502, Bobadilla was replaced as governor of the Indies by Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres. One possible motive for his removal despite a &quot;relatively peaceful&quot; two years was his elimination of the gold taxes.

Bobadilla died on during a hurricane that wrecked 20 vessels of the 31-ship convoy, including the flagship. Among the surviving ships was the &quot;Aguja&quot;, the weakest ship of the convoy and which carried the gold Columbus was owed—spurring accusations that Columbus magically invoked the storm out of vengeance.

<text>The nose flute is a musical instrument often played in Polynesia and the Pacific Rim countries. Other versions are found in Africa.

== Hawaii ==
In the North Pacific, in the Hawaiian Islands the nose flute was a common courting instrument. In Hawaiian, it is variously called &quot;hano&quot;, &quot;nose flute&quot;, by the more specific term &quot;ʻohe hano ihu&quot;, &quot;bamboo flute [for] nose,&quot; or &quot;ʻohe hanu ihu&quot;, &quot;bamboo [for] nose breath&quot;.

It is made from a single bamboo section. According to &quot;Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i&quot; by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the Bishop Museum collection have a hole at the nose area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from .

Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player. Though primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. Kumu hula (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.

== Africa ==

In the Congo, the nose flute is played by eight ethnic groups.

== Philippines ==

In the Philippines, the nose flute (&quot;pitung ilong&quot; in Tagalog), or the kalaleng of the northern Bontok people (&quot;tongali&quot; among the Kalinga people), is played with the extreme forward edge of the right or left nostril. Because the kalaleng is long and has a narrow internal diameter, it is possible to play different harmonics through overblowing—even with the rather weak airflow from one nostril. Thus, this nose flute can play notes in a range of two and a half octaves. Finger holes in the side of the bamboo tube change the operating length, giving various scales. Players plug the other nostril to increase the force of their breath through the flute.

==Taiwan==

In Southern Taiwan, the Paiwan people play a twin-pipes nose flute. They also play a twin-pipes mouth flute.

== Micronesia ==
The &quot;aangún&quot; is a nose flute made of bamboo or mangrove root. They range from 12 to 87 cm in length and typically have one to three fingerholes. The nose flutes originated in Chuuk but similar ones have been found in Pollap, Polowat, Houk, Satawal and the Nomoi Islands. Chuukese men used to play traditional love songs called &quot;engi&quot; on these flutes, but they are now considered obsolete.

== New Zealand ==

Historically in New Zealand, the Māori carved nguru from wood, the stem of a gourd and whale&#x27;s teeth. Nguru were often adorned with very elaborate carvings, befitting what is considered a sacred object. Although Nguru are commonly known as nose flutes, it is only the smaller instruments that can be played with the nose, more commonly Nguru are played with the mouth.

The Māori &quot;kōauau ponga ihu&quot;, a gourd nose flute, was also part of the nose flute tradition; note that a similarly constructed gourd nose flute, ipu ho kio kio was also used in Hawaii. The maker would form a nose hole in the neck (or stem) of the gourd, by cutting off the neck at a fairly small cross-section. This small hole is placed under the player&#x27;s nostril, in order to generate the flute-tone. The kōauau ponga ihu functions as an ocarina in its acoustic principles. Several notes of a scale can be obtained by drilling finger holes into the &quot;bowl&quot; of the gourd.

==Tonga==
A variation, the &#x27;Fangufangu&#x27; nose flute of the island of Tonga is made with intact node walls at both ends of the bamboo tube, with the nostril holes on the side in front of the nodes (along with side finger holes) and a hole in the middle of the tube, acting as a vent hole, and taking the place of the open distal end. Thus the &#x27;Fangufangu&#x27; can be played from either end, and the disposition of the fingerholes differ from node to vent hole so two alternating scales can be played, but only one scale at a time.

<doc id="465097" wikidata="Q16006784" url="?curid=465097" title="Helen Kinnear">
<text>Helen Alice Kinnear, (May 6, 1894 – April 25, 1970) was a Canadian lawyer and judge. She was the first woman in the British Commonwealth to be made a King&#x27;s Counsel, the first female lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court of Canada, and the first woman appointed as a judge by the Government of Canada.

==Early life==
Kinnear was born in Cayuga, Ontario, Canada. Her father, Louis Kinnear, was well-known lawyer who practiced in Port Colborne and Welland County. She graduated from the University of Toronto. Afterward she attended Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Ontario bar, to become a lawyer, in 1920.

==Career==

Kinnear practised law in Port Colborne, Ontario, where she initially practised with her father, who renamed the firm Kinnear &amp; Kinnear. When her father died in 1924, she opened her own practice.

In 1934, she became the first woman in the British Commonwealth to be created a King&#x27;s Counsel. In 1935, she became the first female lawyer in Canada to appear before the Supreme Court of Canada.

=== Politics ===
Kinnear was an active member of the Liberal Party of Canada. She was active in overcoming women&#x27;s inequality in society and in the Liberal party. In 1941, after two previous failed attempts, Kinnear was made the Liberal party&#x27;s nominee for the Welland Riding. It appeared that she would soon win election to Parliament of Canada. However, she later relinquished the role to Humphrey Mitchell, the newly appointed Minister of Labour who did not have a seat. Kinnear never ran again.

=== Judge ===
In 1943, Kinnear was appointed county-court judge for Haldimand County, becoming the first woman in Canadian history to be appointed a judge by the federal government. Kinnear saw the appointment as not just a personal victory, but a victory for women. In 1947 she was appointed judge of the Juvenile Court. She was the first woman in the Commonwealth appointed to a county-court bench. When she attended a Commonwealth and Empire Law conference in 1955, she was noted as the &quot;only woman in the Commonwealth to have been made a county court judge&quot;.

==== Royal Commissions ====
In 1954, Kinnear was appointed to two Royal Commissions: the Royal Commission for the Criminal Law Relating to Sexual Psychopaths and the Royal Commission Relating to the Defence of Insanity.

=== Retirement ===
Kinnear retired from her role as a judge in 1961 because of illness and moved back to Port Colborne. Kinnear, who never married, lived with her sister Jennie. Kinnear died on April 25, 1970, in Port Colborne.

== Legacy ==
In 1965, Kinnear was awarded a medallion from the John Howard Society of Ontario for &quot;Distinguished Humanitarian Service&quot;. The medallion was minted by INCO in her home town of Port Colborne.

In 1993 Canada Post issued a commemorative stamp to honour Kinnear&#x27;s achievements.

=== Kinnear House ===
Kinnear House was Helen Kinnear&#x27;s residence from 1904 to 1942. The house was built by lawyer Louis Kinnear in 1904.

In 1999, Kinnear House, situated at 232 Clarence Street, Port Colborne, was added to the database of Heritage Port Colborne&#x27;s Local Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee for the purpose of publicizing Kinnear&#x27;s residence as a noteworthy local property.

<doc id="465112" wikidata="Q2490600" url="?curid=465112" title="Longnor, Staffordshire">
<text>Longnor is a village in the Staffordshire Peak District, England. The settlement dates from early times, the first recorded church building being in the Middle Ages. The village was named Longenalre in the Domesday Book. Located on a major crossroads, Longnor was a significant market town in the 18th century. It lies on the north bank of the River Manifold, on a limestone ridge between the Manifold and the River Dove.

==Location and geography==
Longnor is on the B5053 main road from Cheadle to Buxton about south of Buxton. It is at a crossroads with routes to Leek and Macclesfield to the west and Bakewell to the east.

West of Longnor are the Staffordshire Moorlands, with a summit at Axe Edge Moor towards the north and Morridge further south. North and east of Longnor is the White Peak section of the Peak District, with the Dove flowing in a steep-sided limestone valley of which the famous Dovedale is a small part.

Longnor looks towards the Manifold but lies on the southern slope of a limestone ridge between the two rivers.

==Village description==
Longnor is one of the more significant villages in this corner of north Staffordshire, chiefly for the market.

Longnor is one of 13 parishes in the Deanery of Alstonefield, Lichfield Diocese.

==History==

Records of the village&#x27;s early history have been lost, but there is evidence of activity in the area from around 700AD. Longnor is listed in the Great Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Longenalre&quot;. It is distinguished from the other modern Longnor near Shrewsbury which is in the Domesday Book as &quot;Lege&quot;. According to local legend the village was burned during the reign of William II as a punishment for the poaching of deer from the forests around Leek.

The first written record cites the founding of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church in 1223 on the site of the present 18th century parish church, and over the next two centuries there were around 20 homes in the village.

The 1787 Cary map of Staffordshire shows the village on a major crossroads. Cary wrote the name &quot;LONGNOR&quot; rather than &quot;Longnor&quot;, a style shared only with Leek and Cheadle in Staffordshire north of Stafford and The Potteries. This implies that Longnor was then a market town of some significance.

===Methodist history===
Built in 1780, the Methodist Chapel is one of the oldest in the area. John Wesley once preached at Longnor while passing through on a journey from Sheffield. However Methodist preachers had established a Methodist society before this in 1769. The fuller story of early Methodism in Longnor is told by J. B. Dyson, along with a brief biography of Mrs Cecily Ferguson who later was hostess to John Wesley on his visit to Amsterdam. In 1784, Longnor Methodist Society had 42 members.

In 1870, a new Methodist Circuit was created, which was named the &quot;Wetton and Longnor Methodist Circuit&quot;. The manse was built at Wetton, along with a new chapel building. But the importance of Longnor was also recognised. The original Wetton and Longnor Circuit had been Wesleyan, and in 1932 it took in some of the Primitive Methodist chapels in the area. In 1969 the circuit was closed and its chapels assigned to neighbouring circuits.

The Methodist Chapel closed in the 1996, but some of the former members continued to meet for a while in a hired hall, because the journey to Buxton Methodist Church was not practical.

The village formed the basis of two paintings by L. S. Lowry, &quot;Longnor, Derbyshire&quot; (1940) and &quot;A Village Square&quot; (1943; now in Glasgow). He wrote of the latter work:

==Points of general interest==

Some of the TV series &quot;Peak Practice&quot; was filmed here.

In episode 5 of the BBC&#x27;s 1995 adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Longnor was used for shots of the fictitious village of Lambton, where Elizabeth Bennet and her aunt and uncle stay during their visit to Derbyshire.

The church of St Bartholomew, Longnor, has a modern sculpture of St Bertram by British Frink School sculptor Harry Everington.

The nearby Blakemere Pond is a body of water precariously perched upon a hilltop, with scenic views across the Peak District and beyond in two directions.

<doc id="465117" wikidata="Q4681731" url="?curid=465117" title="Adelaide Hoodless">
<text>Adelaide Sophia Hoodless (née Addie Hunter; February 27, 1858 – February 26, 1910) was a Canadian educational reformer who founded the international women&#x27;s organization known as the Women&#x27;s Institute. She was the second president of the Hamilton, Ontario Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA), holding the position from 1890 to 1902. She maintained important ties to the business community of Hamilton and achieved great political and public attention through her work.

==Early life and education==
Adelaide Hunter was born on a farm near St. George, Canada West (now Ontario), the youngest of twelve children. Her father died a few months after her birth on October 13, 1858. Her mother, Jane Hamilton Hunter, was left to manage the farm and a large household. Perhaps the hard work and isolation of her youth inspired Hoodless to take up the cause of domestic reform years later.

After her years in a one-room school, she stayed with her sister Lizzie while attending &#x27;Ladies College&#x27; in Brantford, Ontario. While there, she met John Hoodless who was also the close friend of her sister Lizzie&#x27;s future husband, Seth Charlton. John Hoodless was the only surviving son of a successful Hamilton furniture manufacturer (Joseph Hoodless). She married John Hoodless on September 14, 1881, and moved to Hamilton, Ontario.

==Career==
As she entered a more public life, she exchanged the name &#x27;Addie&#x27; for &#x27;Adelaide&#x27;. She also exchanged her life as a hard-working girl in a full and busy rural farmhouse for the life of a Victorian socialite. Adelaide and John had four children: Edna, Muriel, Bernard (Bernie) and John Harold.

Then personal tragedy struck: on August 10, 1889, her infant son John Harold died at the age of 14 months – from what has been attributed to as &quot;summer complaint&quot; but his death register states his cause of death as meningitis following an illness of 10 days duration.

Adelaide was devastated. Her mother, Jane Hamilton Hunter, who had managed the farm where Adelaide grew up after the death of Addie&#x27;s father David in 1857, had died only one year before on August 26, 1888—just after John Harold&#x27;s birth on June 23, 1888. It was after her son&#x27;s death that Adelaide&#x27;s public life began. She wanted to ensure that women had the knowledge to prevent deaths like those of her child and she devoted herself to the betterment of education for new mothers.

She became the second president of the Hamilton branch of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association (YWCA) in 1890, a role she used to work towards the establishment of domestic science education, and taught classes in domestic science (home economics). Hoodless is credited with being the founder of the Canadian National YWCA in 1895.

In January 1897, the Minister of Education asked Adelaide to write a textbook for Domestic Science courses. In 1898 she published a book &quot;Public School Domestic Science&quot;. This became known as the &#x27;Little Red Book&#x27;. It stressed the importance of hygiene, cleanliness and frugality.

In addition to these projects, Adelaide travelled all over the province, speaking on the subject of domestic science. She was a lively and engaging speaker and between 1894 and 1898 she gave 60 addresses.

Erland Lee, of Stoney Creek, heard Adelaide speak, and her message resonated with him. He asked Adelaide to speak at his Farmer&#x27;s Institute Ladies Night meeting, on Feb 12th, 1897. When she spoke that night, she suggested forming a group with a purpose to broaden the knowledge of domestic science and agriculture as well as to socialize. This group was to become the first branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute, with Adelaide as honorary president and Christina Ann Smith as president. Within a decade more than 500 branches been organized across Canada.

Adelaide had met Lady Aberdeen through her work with the National Council for Women. Now concerned about families living in isolated surroundings with little or no access to medical care, Lady Aberdeen sought Adelaide&#x27;s support. Her own campaign merged nicely with this goal. Adelaide worked with Lady Aberdeen to found the National Council of Women of Canada, the Victorian Order of Nurses and the National Association of the YWCA.

By Oct of 1902, the Ministry of Education was about to make domestic science a regular part of the curriculum in Ontario schools but Adelaide already had her sights on the next step. She wanted Domestic Science to be offered at the university level. She also knew she needed a wealthy patron to finance the project. She approached Sir William Christopher Macdonald, a wealthy Montreal non-smoker, who had made his money in tobacco. Her Ontario Normal School of Domestic Science and Art in Hamilton became the MacDonald Institute of Home Economics which became part of the University of Guelph. In 1907, the Women&#x27;s Institute marked its 10th anniversary by commissioning Toronto artist John Wycliffe Lowes Forster to paint her portrait. The painting was donated to the MacDonald Institute.

On February 26, 1910, Adelaide travelled by train to Toronto to speak at St. Margaret&#x27;s College on &quot;Women and Industrial Life&quot;. Adelaide Hunter Hoodless&#x27;s death was registered as the result of heart failure. She was buried in Hamilton, March 1, 1910. Having died one day before her 52nd birthday.

==Legacy==
Adelaide Hoodless is credited as a co-founder of the Women&#x27;s Institutes, the National Council of Women of Canada, the Victorian Order of Nurses and the YWCA in Canada. She was a major force behind the formation of three faculties of Household Science. All of these organizations are in existence today.

The Victorian Order of Nurses is a Canadian not-for-profit home-care organization operating in Ontario and Nova Scotia. With a staff of more than 6,400 and supported by more than 6,200 volunteers, it is a daily presence in the lives of many Canadians.

There are Councils of Women in 20 cities, in 5 provinces, along with 27 affiliate organizations. The National Council of Women has met formally with the members of the federal Cabinet since 1924 to advocate for policies developed through a grassroots process of consultation and debate.

The Women&#x27;s Institute, internationally organized through the Associated Country Women of the World, has a membership of over 9 million member societies in over 70 countries.

In 1911, the year after she died, one of Hamilton&#x27;s new schools was named after her. Her beloved husband, John, laid the cornerstone. There are also schools named after her in Bridgeworth, and Blaine, Ontario.

On October 27, 1937, a cairn dedicated to Hoodless&#x27; memory was unveiled by Lady Tweedsmuir in St. George, Ontario.

In 1975, Dr. Henry Heard Marshall at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada developed the &#x27;Adelaide Hoodless rose&#x27; named after her.

In 1993, Canada Post issued a postage stamp to commemorate Hoodless. It features a portrait of Hoodless drawn by artist Heather Cooper.

In 2003, the Hoodless Garden, was created as a part of numerous celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the MacDonald Institute in Guelph, Ontario. A sculpture by artist Jan Noestheden takes the form of a larger-than-life aluminum portrait, mounted 6&quot; away from the wall, so light will shine through the image and cast a shadow.

Hoodless&#x27; childhood home in St George, Ontario, was acquired by the Federated Women&#x27;s Institutes of Canada (FWIC) in 1959. It was renovated and styled to reflect the time period when Hoodless lived there. In 1995 it was designated a National Historic Site and now operates as a museum.

<text>In fluid dynamics, d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox (or the hydrodynamic paradox) is a paradox discovered in 1752 by French mathematician Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. D&#x27;Alembert proved that – for incompressible and inviscid potential flow – the drag force is zero on a body moving with constant velocity relative to (and simultaneously through) the fluid. Zero drag is in direct contradiction to the observation of substantial drag on bodies moving relative to and at the same time through a fluid, such as air and water; especially at high velocities corresponding with high Reynolds numbers. It is a particular example of the reversibility paradox.

D’Alembert, working on a 1749 Prize Problem of the Berlin Academy on flow drag, concluded: 
 A physical paradox indicates flaws in the theory.

Fluid mechanics was thus discredited by engineers from the start, which resulted in an unfortunate split – between the field of hydraulics, observing phenomena which could not be explained, and theoretical fluid mechanics explaining phenomena which could not be observed – in the words of the Chemistry Nobel Laureate Sir Cyril Hinshelwood.

According to scientific consensus, the occurrence of the paradox is due to the neglected effects of viscosity. In conjunction with scientific experiments, there were huge advances in the theory of viscous fluid friction during the 19th century. With respect to the paradox, this culminated in the discovery and description of thin boundary layers by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904. Even at very high Reynolds numbers, the thin boundary layers remain as a result of viscous forces. These viscous forces cause friction drag on streamlined objects, and for bluff bodies the additional result is flow separation and a low-pressure wake behind the object, leading to form drag.

The general view in the fluid mechanics community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the Navier–Stokes equations (which are used to describe viscous flow).

==Viscous friction: Saint-Venant, Navier and Stokes==

First steps towards solving the paradox were made by Saint-Venant, who modelled viscous fluid friction. Saint-Venant states in 1847:

Soon after, in 1851, Stokes calculated the drag on a sphere in Stokes flow, known as Stokes&#x27; law. Stokes flow is the low Reynolds-number limit of the Navier–Stokes equations describing the motion of a viscous liquid.

However, when the flow problem is put into a non-dimensional form, the viscous Navier–Stokes equations converge for increasing Reynolds numbers towards the inviscid Euler equations, suggesting that the flow should converge towards the inviscid solutions of potential flow theory – having the zero drag of the d&#x27;Alembert paradox. Of this, there is no evidence found in experimental measurements of drag and flow visualisations. In the second half of the 19th century this again raised questions concerning the applicability of fluid mechanics.

==Inviscid separated flow: Kirchhoff and Rayleigh==

In the second half of the 19th century, focus shifted again towards using inviscid flow theory for the description of fluid drag—assuming that viscosity becomes less important at high Reynolds numbers. The model proposed by Kirchhoff
and Rayleigh
was based on the free-streamline theory of Helmholtz and consists of a steady wake behind the body. Assumptions applied to the wake region include: flow velocities equal to the body velocity, and a constant pressure. This wake region is separated from the potential flow outside the body and wake by vortex sheets with discontinuous jumps in the tangential velocity across the interface.
In order to have a non-zero drag on the body, the wake region must extend to infinity. This condition is indeed fulfilled for the Kirchhoff flow perpendicular to a plate. The theory correctly states the drag force to be proportional to the square of the velocity.
In first instance, the theory could only be applied to flows separating at sharp edges. Later, in 1907, it was extended by Levi-Civita to flows separating from a smooth curved boundary.

It was readily known that such steady flows are not stable, since the vortex sheets develop so-called Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities. But this steady-flow model was studied further in the hope it still could give a reasonable estimate of drag. Rayleigh asks &quot;&quot;... whether the calculations of resistance are materially affected by this circumstance as the pressures experienced must be nearly independent of what happens at some distance in the rear of the obstacle, where the instability would first begin to manifest itself.&quot;

However, fundamental objections arose against this approach: Kelvin observed that if a plate is moving with constant velocity through the fluid (at rest far from the plate, except for the wake) the velocity in the wake is equal to that of the plate. The infinite extent of the wake—widening with the distance from the plate, as obtained from the theory—results in an infinite kinetic energy in the wake, which must be rejected on physical grounds.
Moreover, the observed pressure differences between front and back of the plate, and resulting drag forces, are much larger than predicted: for a flat plate perpendicular to the flow the predicted drag coefficient is &quot;C&quot;D=0.88, while in experiments &quot;C&quot;D=2.0 is found. This is mainly due to suction at the wake side of the plate, induced by the unsteady flow in the real wake (as opposed to the theory which assumes a constant flow velocity equal to the plate&#x27;s velocity).

So, this theory is found to be unsatisfactory as an explanation of drag on a body moving through a fluid. Although it can be applied to so-called cavity flows where, instead of a wake filled with fluid, a vacuum cavity is assumed to exist behind the body.

==Thin boundary layers: Prandtl==

The German physicist Ludwig Prandtl suggested in 1904 that the effects of a thin viscous boundary layer possibly could be the source of substantial drag. Prandtl put forward the idea that, at high velocities and high Reynolds numbers, a no-slip boundary condition causes a strong variation of the flow speeds over a thin layer near the wall of the body. This leads to the generation of vorticity and viscous dissipation of kinetic energy in the boundary layer. The energy dissipation, which is lacking in the inviscid theories, results for bluff bodies in separation of the flow. The low pressure in the wake region causes form drag, and this can be larger than the friction drag due to the viscous shear stress at the wall.

Evidence that Prandtl&#x27;s scenario occurs for bluff bodies in flows of high Reynolds numbers can be seen in impulsively started flows around a cylinder. Initially the flow resembles potential flow, after which the flow separates near the rear stagnation point. Thereafter, the separation points move upstream, resulting in a low-pressure region of separated flow.

Prandtl made the hypothesis that the viscous effects are important in thin layers – called boundary layers – adjacent to solid boundaries, and that viscosity has no role of importance outside. The boundary-layer thickness becomes smaller when the viscosity reduces. The full problem of viscous flow, described by the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations, is in general not mathematically solvable. However, using his hypothesis (and backed up by experiments) Prandtl was able to derive an approximate model for the flow inside the boundary layer, called &quot;boundary-layer theory&quot;; while the flow outside the boundary layer could be treated using inviscid flow theory. Boundary-layer theory is amenable to the method of matched asymptotic expansions for deriving approximate solutions. In the simplest case of a flat plate parallel to the incoming flow, boundary-layer theory results in (friction) drag, whereas all inviscid flow theories will predict zero drag. Importantly for aeronautics, Prandtl&#x27;s theory can be applied directly to streamlined bodies like airfoils where, in addition to surface-friction drag, there is also form drag. Form drag is due to the effect of the boundary layer and thin wake on the pressure distribution around the airfoil.

==Open questions==

To verify, as Prandtl suggested, that a vanishingly small cause (vanishingly small viscosity for increasing Reynolds number) has a large effect – substantial drag —
may be very difficult.

The mathematician Garrett Birkhoff in the opening chapter of his book &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; from 1950, addresses a number of paradoxes of fluid mechanics (including d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox) and expresses a clear doubt in their official resolutions:
:&quot;&quot;Moreover, I think that to attribute them all to the neglect of viscosity is an unwarranted oversimplification The root lies deeper, in lack of precisely that deductive rigor whose importance is so commonly minimized by physicists and engineers.&quot;
In particular, on d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox, he considers another possible route to the creation of drag: instability of the potential flow solutions to the Euler equations. Birkhoff states:
:&quot;In any case, the preceding paragraphs make it clear that the theory of non-viscous flows is incomplete. Indeed, the reasoning leading to the concept of a &quot;steady flow&quot; is inconclusive; there is no rigorous justification for the elimination of time as an independent variable. Thus though Dirichlet flows (potential solutions) and other steady flows are mathematically possible, there is no reason to suppose that any steady flow is stable.&quot;

In his 1951 review of Birkhoff&#x27;s book, the mathematician James J. Stoker sharply criticizes the first chapter of the book:
:&quot;The reviewer found it difficult to understand for what class of readers the first chapter was written. For readers that are acquainted with hydrodynamics the majority of the cases cited as paradoxes belong either to the category of mistakes long since rectified, or in the category of discrepancies between theory and experiments the reasons for which are also well understood. On the other hand, the uninitiated would be very likely to get the wrong ideas about some of the important and useful achievements in hydrodynamics from reading this chapter.&quot;

In the second and revised edition of Birkhoff&#x27;s &quot;Hydrodynamics&quot; in 1960, the above two statements no longer appear.

The importance and usefulness of the achievements, made on the subject of the d&#x27;Alembert paradox, are reviewed by Keith Stewartson thirty years later. His long 1981 survey article starts with:
:&quot;Since classical inviscid theory leads to the patently absurd conclusion that the resistance experienced by a rigid body moving through a fluid with uniform velocity is zero, great efforts have been made during the last hundred or so years to propose alternate theories and to explain how a vanishingly small frictional force in the fluid can nevertheless have a significant effect on the flow properties. The methods used are a combination of experimental observation, computation often on a very large scale, and analysis of the structure of the asymptotic form of the solution as the friction tends to zero. This three-pronged attack has achieved considerable success, especially during the last ten years, so that now the paradox may be regarded as largely resolved.&quot;

For many paradoxes in physics, their resolution often lies in transcending the available theory. In the case of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox, the essential mechanism for its resolution was provided by Prandtl through the discovery and modelling of thin viscous boundary layers – which are non-vanishing at high Reynolds numbers.

==Proof of zero drag in steady potential flow==
===Potential flow===

The three main assumptions in the derivation of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox is that the steady flow is incompressible, inviscid and irrotational.
An inviscid fluid is described by the Euler equations, which together with the other two conditions read
:formula_1
where u denotes the flow velocity of the fluid, &quot;p&quot; the pressure, &quot;ρ&quot; the density, and ∇ is the gradient operator.

We have the second term in the Euler equation as:
:formula_2
where the first equality is a vector calculus identity and the second equality uses that the flow is irrotational. Furthermore, for every irrotational flow, there exists a velocity potential &quot;φ&quot; such that u = ∇&quot;φ&quot;. Substituting this all in the equation for momentum conservation yields
:formula_3
Thus, the quantity between brackets must be constant (any &quot;t&quot;-dependence can be eliminated by redefining &quot;φ&quot;). Assuming that the fluid is at rest at infinity and that the pressure is defined to be zero there, this constant is zero, and thus
:formula_4
which is the Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow.

===Zero drag===

Now, suppose that a body moves with constant velocity v through the fluid, which is at rest infinitely far away. Then the velocity field of the fluid has to follow the body, so it is of the form , where x is the spatial coordinate vector, and thus:
formula_5
Since u = ∇φ&quot;, this can be integrated with respect to x&quot;:
formula_6

The force F that the fluid exerts on the body is given by the surface integral
formula_7
where &quot;A&quot; denotes the body surface and n the normal vector on the body surface. But it follows from (2) that
formula_8
thus
formula_9
with the contribution of &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) to the integral being equal to zero.

At this point, it becomes more convenient to work in the vector components. The &quot;k&quot;th component of this equation reads
formula_10

Let &quot;V&quot; be the volume occupied by the fluid. The divergence theorem says that
formula_11
The right-hand side is an integral over an infinite volume, so this needs some justification, which can be provided by appealing to potential theory to show that the velocity u must fall off as &quot;r&quot;−3 – corresponding to a dipole potential field in case of a three-dimensional body of finite extent – where &quot;r&quot; is the distance to the centre of the body. The integrand in the volume integral can be rewritten as follows:
formula_12
where first equality (1) and then the incompressibility of the flow are used. Substituting this back into the volume integral and another application of the divergence theorem again. This yields
formula_13
Substituting this in (3), we find that
formula_14
The fluid cannot penetrate the body and thus n · u = n · v on the body surface. So formula_15 and
formula_16
Finally, the drag is the force in the direction in which the body moves, so
formula_17
Hence the drag vanishes. This is d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s paradox.

<text>Zongzi (; ), rouzong (), or simply zong () is a traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves. Fillings can be either sweet, such as red bean paste, or savory, such as pork belly or Chinese sausage. The bamboo for wrapping the &quot;zongzi&quot; is generally of the species &quot;Indocalamus tessellatus&quot;, although sometimes reed or other large flat leaves may be used. &quot;Zongzi&quot; are cooked by steaming or boiling. People in the Eastern world often translate this dish into English as rice dumplings or sticky rice dumplings, although the Chinese government has registered &quot;Zongzi&quot; as the formal name in global use.

== Names ==

As it diffused to other regions of Asia over many centuries, &quot;zongzi&quot; became known by various names in different languages and cultures, including &quot;phet htoke&quot; () in Burmese-speaking areas (such as Myanmar), &quot;nom chang&quot; in Cambodia, &quot;machang&quot; in Philippines, &quot;bacang&quot; in Indonesia, &quot;khanom chang&quot; in Laos, and &quot;ba-chang&quot; in Thailand.

Vietnamese cuisine also has a variation on this dish known as &quot;bánh ú tro&quot; or &quot;bánh tro&quot;.

In Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan, &quot;zongzi&quot; is known as &quot;bakcang&quot;, &quot;bacang&quot;, or &quot;zang&quot; (from Hokkien , as Hokkien is commonly used among overseas Chinese); Straits Peranakans also know them as the derivative &quot;kueh chang&quot; in their Malay dialect. Similarly, &quot;zongzi&quot; is more popularly known as &quot;machang&quot; among Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines.

Japanese cuisine has leaf-wrapped glutinous rice flour dumplings called &quot;chimaki&quot;. They may be tetrahedral, square, rectangular, or long narrow conical in shape.

In some areas of the United States, particularly California and Texas, &quot;zongzi&quot; are often known as &quot;Chinese &quot;tamales&quot;&quot;.

In Mauritius, &quot;zongzi&quot; (typically called &quot;zong&quot;), is a traditional dish which continues to be eaten by the Sino-Mauritian and by the Overseas Chinese communities. It is especially eaten on the Dragon Boat Festival, a traditional festive event, to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan.

==Popular origin myths==

What has become established popular belief amongst the Chinese is that &quot;zongzi&quot; has since the days of yore been a food-offering to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a famous poet from the kingdom of Chu who lived during the Warring States period. Known for his patriotism, Qu Yuan tried to counsel his king to no avail, and drowned himself in the Miluo River in 278 BC. The Chinese people were grateful for Qu Yuan&#x27;s talent and loyalty to serve the country. They cast rice dumplings into the Miluo River on the day when Qu Yuan was thrown into the river every year, hoping that the fish in the river would eat the rice dumplings without harming Qu Yuan&#x27;s body.

Qu Yuan died in 278 BC, but the earliest known documented association between him and the &quot;zong&quot; dumplings occurs much later, in the mid 5th century (, or &quot;A New Account of the Tales of the World&quot;), And a widely observed popular cult around him did not develop until the 6th century AD, as far as can be substantiated by evidence. But by the 6th century, sources attest to the offering of &quot;zongzi&quot; on the Double Fifth Festival (5th day of the 5th month of the lunar calendar) being connected with the figure of Qu Yuan.

As for the origin myth, a fable recounts that the people commemorated the drowning death of Qu Yuan on the Double Fifth day by casting rice stuffed in bamboo tubes; but the practice changed in the early Eastern Han dynasty (1st century AD), when the ghost of Qu Yuan appeared in a dream to a man named Ou Hui () and instructed him to seal the rice packet with chinaberry (or &quot;Melia&quot;) leaves and bind it with colored string, to repel the dragons (&quot;jiaolong&quot;) that would otherwise consume them. However, this fable is not attested in contemporary (Han period) literature, and only known to be recorded centuries later in (, d. 520)&#x27;s &quot;Xu Qixieji&quot; ().

Also, Qu Yuan had (dubiously, by &quot;folklore&quot; or by common belief) become connected with the boat races held on the Double Fifth, datable by another 6th century source. 《荊楚歲時記》(6th c.), under the &quot;Fifth Day of the Fifth Month&quot; heading. Modern media has printed a version of the legend which says that the locals had rushed out in dragonboats to try retrieve his body and threw packets of rice into the river to distract the fish from eating the poet&#x27;s body.

== History ==

&quot;Zongzi&quot; (sticky rice dumplings) are traditionally eaten during the Duanwu Festival (Double Fifth Festival) which falls on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, and commonly known as the &quot;Dragon Boat Festival&quot; in English. The festival falls each year on a day in late-May to mid-June in the International calendar.

The practice of eating &quot;zongzi&quot; on the Double Fifth or summer solstice is concretely documented in literature from around the late Han (2nd–3rd centuries). At the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, people made &quot;zong&quot;, also called &quot;jiao shu&quot;, lit. &quot;horned/angled millet&quot;) by wrapping sticky rice with the leaves of the &quot;Zizania latifolia&quot; plant (, a sort of wild rice) and boiling them in lye (grass-and-wood ash water). The name &quot;jiao shu&quot; may imply &quot;ox-horn shape&quot;, or cone-shape. That the &quot;zong&quot; or &quot;ziao shu&quot; prepared in this way was eaten on the occasion of the Double Fifth (Duanwu) is documented in works as early as the &quot;Fengsu Tongyi&quot;, AD 195). These festive rice dumplings are also similarly described in General Zhou Chu (236–297)&#x27;s &quot;Fengtu Ji&quot;, &quot;Record of Local Folkways&quot; Various sources claim that this &quot;Fengtu Ji&quot; contains the first documented reference regarding &quot;zongzi&quot;, even though it dates somewhat later than the &quot;Fengsu Tongyi&quot;.

In the Jin dynasty (, AD 266–420), &quot;zongzi&quot; was officially a Dragon Boat Festival food. Anecdotally, an official called from the Jin dynasty once sent &quot;zongzi&quot; which used (, the fruit of &quot;Alpinia oxyphylla&quot; or sharp leaf galangal) as additional filling; this type of dumpling was then dubbed &quot;yizhi zong&quot; (, literally &quot;dumplings to increase wisdom&quot;). Later in the Northern and Southern dynasties, mixed &quot;zongzi&quot; appeared, the rice was filled with fillings such as meat, chestnuts, jujubes, red beans, and they were exchanged as gifts to relatives and friends.

In the 6th century (Sui to early Tang dynasty), the dumpling is also being referred to as &quot;tubular &quot;zong&quot;&quot; (), and they were being made by being packed inside &quot;young bamboo&quot; tubes. The 6th century source for this states that the dumplings were eaten on the Summer Solstice, (instead of the Double Fifth).

In the Tang dynasty, the shape of &quot;zongzi&quot; appeared conical and diamond-shaped, and the rice which was used to make &quot;zongzi&quot; was as white as jade. &quot;Datang zongzi&quot; (i.e. the &quot;zongzi&quot; eaten in Tang Imperial period) was also recorded in some classical-era Japanese literature, which was heavily influenced by Tang Chinese culture.

In the Northern Song dynasty period, the &quot;New augmentation to the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;&quot; () glossed &quot;zong&quot; as rice with reed leaves wrapped around it. &quot;Mijiian Zong&quot; (zongzi with glacé fruit) was also popular in the Song dynasty. Also during the Song dynasty, there were many preserved fruit &quot;zongzi&quot;. At this time also appeared a pavilion filled with &quot;zongzi&quot; for advertising, which showed that eating &quot;zongzi&quot; in the Song dynasty had been very fashionable.

In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the wrapping material had changed from &quot;gu&quot; (wild rice) leaf to &quot;ruo&quot; (; the &quot;Indocalamus tessellatus&quot; bamboo) leaf, and then to reed leaves,and filled with materials like bean paste, pine nut kernel, pork, walnut, jujube, and so on. The varieties of &quot;zongzi&quot; were more diverse.

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, &quot;zongzi&quot; became auspicious food. At that time, scholars who took the imperial examinations would eat &quot;pen &quot;zongzi&quot;&quot;, which was specially given to them at home, before going to the examination hall. Because it looked long and thin like a writing brush, the pronunciation of &quot;pen &quot;zongzi&quot;&quot; is similar to the Chinese word for &quot;pass&quot;, which was for good omen. Ham &quot;zongzi&quot; appeared in the Qing dynasty.

Every year in early May of the lunar calendar, the Chinese people still soak glutinous rice, wash the leaves and wrap up &quot;zongzi&quot;.

== Description ==
The shapes of &quot;zongzi&quot; vary, and range from being approximately tetrahedral in southern China to an elongated cone in northern China. In the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei, plastic mock-ups of rectangular &quot;zongzi&quot; are displayed as an example of the &quot;zongzi&quot; eaten by Chiang Kai-shek. Wrapping &quot;zongzi&quot; neatly is a skill that is passed down through families, as are the recipes. Making zongzi is traditionally a family event in which everyone helps out.

While traditional &quot;zongzi&quot; are wrapped in bamboo leaves, the leaves of lotus, reed, maize, banana, canna, shell ginger, and pandan sometimes are used as substitutes in other countries. Each kind of leaf imparts its own unique aroma and flavor to the rice.

The fillings used for &quot;zongzi&quot; vary from region to region, but the rice used is almost always glutinous rice (also called &quot;sticky rice&quot; or &quot;sweet rice&quot;). Depending on the region, the rice may be lightly precooked by stir-frying or soaked in water before using. In the north, fillings are mostly red bean paste and tapioca or taro. Northern style &quot;zongzi&quot; tend to be sweet and dessert-like. In the northern region of China, &quot;zongzi&quot; filled with jujubes are popular.

Southern-style &quot;zongzi&quot;, however, tend to be more savoury or salty. Fillings of Southern-style &quot;zongzi&quot; include ham, salted duck egg, pork belly, taro, shredded pork or chicken, Chinese sausage, pork fat, and shiitake mushrooms. However, as the variations of &quot;zongzi&quot; styles have traveled and become mixed, today one can find all kinds of them at traditional markets, and their types are not confined to which side of the Yellow River they originated from.

&quot;Zongzi&quot; need to be steamed or boiled for several hours depending on how the rice is prepared prior to being added, along with the fillings. With the advent of modern food processing, pre-cooked &quot;zongzi&quot; (usually in vacuum packs or frozen) are now available.

== Variations ==

===Mainland China===
*&quot;Jiaxing zongzi&quot; (嘉興粽子): This is a kind of &quot;zongzi&quot; famous in mainland China and named after the city Jiaxing, Zhejiang. Typically savory with the rice mixed with soy sauce and having pork, water chestnut and salted duck egg yolk as its filling, but sweet ones with mung bean or red bean filling also exist.
* &quot;Jia zong&quot; (假粽): Instead of glutinous rice, balls of glutinous rice flour (so no individual grains of rice are discernible) are used to enclose the fillings of the &quot;zongzi&quot;. These &quot;fake &quot;zong&quot;&quot; are typically smaller than most and are much stickier.
* &quot;Jianshui zong&quot; (碱水粽): These &quot;alkaline water &quot;zong&quot;&quot; are typically eaten as a dessert item rather than as part of the main meal. The glutinous rice is treated with &quot;jianzongshui&quot; (碱粽水, alkali[ne] &quot;zongzi&quot; water, aqueous sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate), giving them their distinctive yellow color. &quot;Jianshui zong&quot; typically contain either no filling or are filled with a sweet mixture, such as sweet bean paste. Sometimes, a certain redwood sliver (蘇木) is inserted for color and flavor. They are often eaten with sugar or light syrup.
* &quot;Cantonese jung&quot; (廣東糉): This is representative of the southern variety of &quot;zongzi&quot;, usually consisting of marinated meat, such as pork belly, and duck, with other ingredients like mung bean paste, mushrooms, dried scallops, and salted egg yolk. Cantonese &quot;jung&quot; are small, the front is square, back has a raised sharp angle, shaped like an awl.
*&quot;Chiu Chou jung&quot; (潮州粽): This is a variation of Cantonese &quot;jung&quot; with red bean paste, pork belly, chestnut, mushroom, and dried shrimp, in a triangular prism.
* &quot;Banlam zang&quot; (閩南粽): Xiamen, Quanzhou area is very famous for its pork rice dumplings, made with braised pork with pork belly, plus mushrooms, shrimp, and so on.
* &quot;Sichuan zong&quot; (四川粽): Sichuan people like to eat spicy and &quot;tingly-numbing&quot; (麻) sense food, so they make spicy rice dumplings. They add Sichuan peppercorns, chili powder, Sichuan salt, and a little preserved pork, wrapped into four-cornered dumplings. Cooked and then roasted, it tastes tender and flavorful.
* &quot;Beijing zong&quot; (北京粽): The Beijing &quot;zong&quot; are sweet and often eaten cold. Common fillings include red dates and bean paste, as well as preserved fruit.

===Taiwan===
* Taiwanese &quot;zongzi&quot; are regionally split by the process of cooking rather than filling.
** Northern Taiwanese &quot;zongzi&quot; (北部粽) are wrapped with husks of &quot;Phyllostachys makinoi&quot; bamboo (桂竹籜), then steamed.
** Southern Taiwanese &quot;zongzi&quot; (南部粽) are wrapped with leaves of &quot;Bambusa oldhamii&quot; (麻竹葉), then boiled.
* The filling is classified simply by eating habits:
** Vegetarian &quot;zongzi&quot; in Taiwan is made with dry peanut flakes.
** The meat-filled &quot;zongzi&quot; in Taiwan is made with fresh pork, chicken, duck, egg yolk, mushroom, dried shrimps, or fried scallions.

===Japan===
* Japanese &quot;chimaki&quot; are very similar to the Chinese versions using various species of the bamboo &quot;Sasa&quot; but possibly with different fillings, and are divided into savory and sweet types.
* A special sweet &quot;chimaki&quot; is eaten on Children&#x27;s Day (&quot;kodomo no hi&quot;, May 5), and is identifiable by its long narrow conical shape.

===Mauritius===
* Sweet &quot;zong&quot; is a &quot;zongzi&quot; made of a plain rice (i.e. without any fillings) which is eaten with crushed peanut in sugar.
* Salty &quot;zong&quot; contains meat, beans and other fillings in the rice.

===Malaysia and Singapore===
* &quot;Nyonya chang&quot; (娘惹粽): A specialty of Peranakan cuisine, these &quot;zongzi&quot; are made similarly to those from southern China. However, pandan leaves are often used, in addition to bamboo leaves, for the wrapping while minced pork with candied winter melon, a spice mix, and sometimes ground roasted peanuts are used as the fillings. As with a common practice found in Peranakan pastries, part of the rice on these &quot;zongzi&quot; are often dyed blue with the extract from blue pea flower to add to the aesthetic.

<text>(James) Hamish Scott Henderson (11 November 1919 – 9 March 2002) was a Scottish poet, songwriter, communist, intellectual and soldier.
He was a catalyst for the folk revival in Scotland. He was also an accomplished folk song collector and discovered such notable performers as Jeannie Robertson, Flora MacNeil and Calum Johnston. Born in Blairgowrie, Perthshire on the first Armistice Day 11 November 1919, to a single mother, Janet Henderson, a Queen&#x27;s Nurse who had served in France, and was then working in the war hospital at Blair Castle. 
His name was recorded at registration as James but he preferred the Scots form Hamish.

==Early life==
Henderson spent his early years in nearby Glen Shee and eventually moved to England with his mother. He won a scholarship to Dulwich College in London; however, his mother died shortly before he was due to take up his place and he had to live in an orphanage while studying there.

He studied Modern Languages at Downing College, Cambridge, in the years leading up to World War II, and as a visiting student in Germany ran messages for an organization run by the Society of Friends aiding the German resistance and helping to rescue Jews.

==World War II==
Although he argued strongly for peace, even well into the early years of the war, he became convinced that a satisfactory peace could not be reached and so he threw himself into the war effort. Joining as an enlisted soldier in the Pioneer Corps, he later applied for and received a commission in the Intelligence Corps. He was quite effective as an interrogator due to his command of six European languages and deep understanding of German culture.

He took part in the Desert War in Africa, during which he wrote his poem &quot;Elegies For the Dead in Cyrenaica&quot;, encompassing every aspect of a soldier&#x27;s experience of the sands of North Africa. On 2 May 1945, Henderson personally oversaw the drafting of the surrender order of Italy issued by Marshal Rodolfo Graziani.

Henderson collected the lyrics to &quot;D-Day Dodgers,&quot; a satirical song to the tune of &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;, attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn, who served in Italy. Henderson also wrote the lyrics to &quot;The 51st (Highland) Division&#x27;s Farewell to Sicily&quot;, set to a pipe tune called &quot;Farewell to the Creeks&quot;. The book in which these were collected, &quot;Ballads of World War II&quot;, was published &quot;privately&quot; to evade censorship, but earned Henderson a ten-year ban from BBC radio, preventing a series on ballad-making from being made. His 1948 war poetry book, &quot;Elegies for the Dead in Cyrenaica&quot;, received the Somerset Maugham Award.

==Folk song collector==
Henderson threw himself into the work of the folk revival after the war, discovering and bringing to public attention Jeannie Robertson, Flora MacNeil, Calum Johnston (see Annie and Calum Johnston of Barra ) and others. In the 1950s, he acted as a guide to the American folklorist, Alan Lomax, who collected many field recordings in Scotland. (See Alan Lomax, Collector of Songs).

==People&#x27;s Festival Ceilidhs==
Henderson was instrumental in bringing about the Edinburgh People&#x27;s Festival Ceilidh in 1951, which placed traditionally performed Scottish folk music on the public stage for the first time as &quot;A Night of Scottish Song&quot;. However, the People&#x27;s Festival, of which it was part, was planned as a left-wing competitor to the Edinburgh Festival and was deeply controversial. At the event, Henderson performed The John Maclean March, to the tune of Scotland the Brave, which honoured the life and work John Maclean, a communist and Scottish nationalist hero.

However, the event marked the first time that Scotland&#x27;s traditional folk music was performed on a public stage. The performers included Flora MacNeil, Calum Johnston, John Burgess, Jessie Murray, John Strachan, and Jimmy MacBeath. The event was extremely popular and was regarded as the beginning of the second folk revival.

Henderson continued to host the events every year until 1954, when the Communist ties of several members of the People&#x27;s Festival Committee led to the Labour Party declaring it a &quot;Proscribed Organisation&quot;. Losing the financial support of the local trades unions, the People&#x27;s Festival was permanently cancelled. Henderson&#x27;s own songs, particularly &quot;Freedom Come All Ye&quot;, have become part of the folk tradition themselves.

==Later life==
Dividing his time between Continental Europe and Scotland, he eventually settled in Edinburgh in 1959 with his German wife, Kätzel (Felizitas Schmidt).

Henderson collected widely in the Borders and the north-east of Scotland, creating links between the travellers, the bothy singers of Aberdeenshire, the Border shepherds, and the young men and women who frequented the folk clubs in Edinburgh.

From 1955 to 1987 he was on the staff of the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s School of Scottish Studies which he co-founded with Calum Maclean: there he contributed to the sound archives that are now available on-line. Henderson held several honorary degrees and after his retirement became an honorary fellow of the School of Scottish Studies. For many years he held court in Sandy Bell&#x27;s Bar, the meeting place for local and visiting folk musicians. In April 1979, he was &#x27; the prevailing spirit&#x27; at the first Edinburgh International Folk Festival conference &quot;&#x27;The People&#x27;s Past&quot;&#x27; both on ballads and in challenging traditional history telling. He also spoke at a Riddle&#x27;s Court meeting which had hosted in the past, the Workers&#x27; Educational Association when he said that Calvinism was repressive in the Scottish psyche and that &#x27;we had to divest ourselves of layers or preconception and misconception before we could come to grips with Scotland and its people.&#x27;

Henderson was a socialist, and beside his academic work for the University, he produced translations of the Prison Letters of Antonio Gramsci, whom he had first heard of among Communist Italian partisans during the war. The translation was published in the &quot;New Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1974 and as a book in 1988. He was involved in campaigns for Scottish home rule and in the foundation of the 1970s Scottish Labour Party. Henderson, who was openly bisexual, was vocal about gay rights and acceptance.

In 1983, Henderson was voted Scot of the Year by Radio Scotland listeners when he, in protest of the Thatcher government&#x27;s nuclear weapons policy, turned down an OBE.

==Death==
He died in Edinburgh on 8 March 2002 aged 82, survived by his wife Kätzel and their daughters, Janet and Christine Henderson.

==Legacy==

In 2005, Rounder Records released a recording of the 1951 Edinburgh People&#x27;s Festival Ceilidh as part of &quot;The Alan Lomax Collection&quot;. Henderson had collaborated with the preparations for the release.

In August 2013, Edinburgh University announced that it had acquired his personal archive of &quot;more than 10,000 letters from almost 3400 correspondents, plus 136 notebooks and diaries&quot;, dating from the 1930s to the end of his life. These will be kept in the Special Collections department of the main library.

Discussions around national identity and constitutional resettlement in Scotland, especially those surrounding the Scottish Independence Referendum of 2014, have often invoked Henderson&#x27;s legacy. Politicians and cultural commentators alike describe their admiration for his song &#x27;Freedom Come-All-Ye&#x27; and lend their voices to those touting it as an alternative national anthem. As a radical democrat whose political beliefs were closely bound up in the study of folk culture and high literature, Henderson&#x27;s work expresses a tension between romantic nationalism and socialist internationalism which has been reaffirmed in public life in Scotland since his death.

Debate on his parenting, and a possible link to the eighth Duke of Atholl or a &#x27;cousin&#x27; of that lineage, has continued into considering the &#x27;cultural context&#x27; of the eighth Duke&#x27;s role in designing the Scottish National War Memorial (opened 1927) bringing together the culture of &#x27;the people&#x27;, but also looking into Henderson possibly being of royal or aristocratic blood, &#x27;acknowledging a heritage that meant a lot to him, while still protecting his anonymity, and the power of his life&#x27;s work to identify with everyman and everywoman.&#x27; Paul Potts had called Henderson &quot;That guy? He&#x27;s one of the wandering kings of Scotland.&quot;

<text>The Chloroflexia are a class of bacteria in the phylum Chloroflexota. Chloroflexia are typically filamentous, and can move about through bacterial gliding. It is named after the order Chloroflexales.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Chloroflexi&quot; is a Neolatin plural of &quot;Chloroflexus&quot;, which is the name of the first genus described. The noun is a combination of the Greek &quot;chloros&quot; (χλωρός) meaning &quot;greenish-yellow&quot; and the Latin &quot;flexus&quot; (of &quot;flecto&quot;) meaning &quot;bent&quot; to mean &quot;a green bending&quot;. The name is not due to chlorine, an element confirmed as such in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy and named after its pale green colour.

==Taxonomy and molecular signatures==

The Chloroflexia class is a group of deep branching photosynthetic bacteria (with the exception of &quot;Herpetosiphon&quot; and &quot;Kallotenue&quot; species) that currently consist of three orders: Chloroflexales, Herpetosiphonales, and Kallotenuales. The Herpetosiphonales and Kallotenuales each consist of a single genus within its own family, Herpetosiphonaceae (&quot;Herpetosiphon&quot;) and Kallotenuaceae (&quot;Kallotenue&quot;), respectively, whereas the Chloroflexales are more phylogenetically diverse.

===Microscopic distinguishing characteristics===
Members of the phylum Chloroflexota are monoderms and stain mostly Gram negative, whereas most bacteria species are diderms and stain Gram negative, with the Gram positive exceptions of the Bacillota (low GC Gram positives), Actinomycetota (high GC, Gram positives), and the Deinococcota (Gram positive, diderms with thick peptidoglycan).

===Genetic distinguishing characteristics===
Comparative genomic analysis has recently refined the taxonomy of the class &quot;Chloroflexia&quot;, dividing the &quot;Chloroflexales&quot; into the suborder &quot;Chloroflexineae&quot; consisting of the families &quot;Oscillachloridaceae&quot; and &quot;Chloroflexaceae&quot;, and the suborder Roseiflexineae containing family &quot;Roseiflexaceae&quot;. The revised taxonomy was based on the identification of a number of conserved signature indels (CSIs) which serve as highly reliable molecular markers of shared ancestry.

===Physiological distinguishing characteristics===
Additional support for the division of the Chloroflexales into two suborders is the observed differences in physiological characteristics where each suborder is characterized by distinct carotenoids, quinones, and fatty acid profiles that are consistently absent in the other suborder.

In addition to demarcating taxonomic ranks, CSIs may play a role in the unique characteristics of members within the clade: In particular, a four-amino-acid insert in the protein pyruvate flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductase, a protein which plays important roles in photosynthetic organisms, has been found exclusively among all members in the genus &quot;Chloroflexus&quot;, and is thought to play an important functional role.

Additional work has been done using CSIs to demarcate the phylogenetic position of Chloroflexia relative to other photosynthetic groups such as the Cyanobacteria. Chloroflexia shares a number of CSIs with Chlorobiota in the chlorophyll-synthesizing proteins. As the two lineages are not otherwise closely related, the interpretation is that the CSIs are the result of a horizontal gene transfer event between the two. Chloroflexia in turn acquired these proteins by another HGT from a &quot;Clade C&quot; marine cyanobacteria.

<doc id="465156" wikidata="Q1126859" url="?curid=465156" title="Dipole antenna">
<text>In radio and telecommunications a dipole antenna or doublet
is one of the two simplest and most widely used types of antenna; the other is the monopole. The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each far end. A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements
such as metal wires or rods. The driving current from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between the two halves of the antenna. Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. A common example of a dipole is the rabbit ears television antenna found on broadcast television sets. All dipoles are electrically equivalent to two monopoles mounted end-to-end and fed with opposite phases, with the ground plane between them made &quot;virtual&quot; by the opposing monopole.

The dipole is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. Most commonly it consists of two conductors of equal length oriented end-to-end with the feedline connected between them.
Dipoles are frequently used as resonant antennas. If the feedpoint of such an antenna is shorted, then it will be able to resonate at a particular frequency, just like a guitar string that is plucked. Using the antenna at around that frequency is advantageous in terms of feedpoint impedance (and thus standing wave ratio), so its length is determined by the intended wavelength (or frequency) of operation. The most commonly used is the center-fed half-wave dipole which is just under a half-wavelength long. The radiation pattern of the half-wave dipole is maximum perpendicular to the conductor, falling to zero in the axial direction, thus implementing an omnidirectional antenna if installed vertically, or (more commonly) a weakly directional antenna if horizontal.

Although they may be used as standalone low-gain antennas, dipoles are also employed as driven elements in more complex antenna designs such as the Yagi antenna and driven arrays. Dipole antennas (or such designs derived from them, including the monopole) are used to feed more elaborate directional antennas such as a horn antenna, parabolic reflector, or corner reflector. Engineers analyze vertical (or other monopole) antennas on the basis of dipole antennas of which they are one half.

==History==
German physicist Heinrich Hertz first demonstrated the existence of radio waves in 1887 using what we now know as a dipole antenna (with capacitative end-loading). On the other hand, Guglielmo Marconi empirically found that he could just ground the transmitter (or one side of a transmission line, if used) dispensing with one half of the antenna, thus realizing the &quot;vertical&quot; or monopole antenna.
For the low frequencies Marconi employed to achieve long-distance communications, this form was more practical; when radio moved to higher frequencies (especially VHF transmissions for FM radio and TV) it was advantageous for these much smaller antennas to be entirely atop a tower thus requiring a dipole antenna or one of its variations.

In the early days of radio, the thus-named Marconi antenna (monopole) and the doublet (dipole) were seen as distinct inventions. Now, however, the monopole antenna is understood as a special case of a dipole which has a virtual element underground.

==Dipole variations==
===Short dipole===
A short dipole is a dipole formed by two conductors with a total length substantially less than a half wavelength Short dipoles are sometimes used in applications where a full half-wave dipole would be too large. They can be analyzed easily using the results obtained below for the Hertzian dipole, a fictitious entity. Being shorter than a resonant antenna (half wavelength long) its feedpoint impedance includes a large capacitive reactance requiring a loading coil or other matching network in order to be practical, especially as a transmitting antenna.

To find the far-field electric and magnetic fields generated by a short dipole we use the result shown below for the Hertzian dipole (an infinitesimal current element) at a distance from the current and at an angle &amp;hairsp; &amp;hairsp; to the direction of the current, as being:
:formula_1

where the radiator consists of a current of formula_2 over a short length and formula_3 in electronics replaces the customary mathematical symbol &amp;hairsp; &amp;hairsp; for the square root of . is the angular (radian) frequency and is the wavenumber   is the impedance of free space which is the ratio of a free space plane wave&#x27;s electric to magnetic field strength.

The feedpoint is usually at the center of the dipole as shown in the diagram. The current along dipole arms are approximately described as proportional to formula_4 where is the distance to the nearest end of the arm. In the case of a short dipole, that is essentially a linear drop from formula_5 at the feedpoint to zero at the end. Therefore, this is comparable to a Hertzian dipole with an &quot;effective&quot; current h equal to the average current over the conductor, so formula_6 With that substitution, the above equations closely approximate the fields generated by a short dipole fed by current formula_7

From the fields calculated above, one can find the radiated &quot;flux&quot; (power per unit area) at any point as the magnitude of the real part of the Poynting vector, &#x27;, which is given by formula_8 Because &#x27; and are at right angles and in phase, there is no imaginary part and the cross product is equal to formula_9 the phase factors (the exponentials) cancel out, leaving:
:formula_10

We have now expressed the flux in terms of the feedpoint current and the ratio of the short dipole&#x27;s length to the wavelength of radiation . The radiation pattern given by formula_11 is seen to be similar to and only slightly less directional than that of the half-wave dipole.

Using the above expression for the radiation in the far field for a given feedpoint current, we can integrate over all solid angle to obtain the total radiated power.
:formula_12

From that, it is possible to infer the radiation resistance, equal to the resistive (real) part of the feedpoint impedance, neglecting a component due to ohmic losses (presumed smaller). By setting to the power supplied at the feedpoint formula_13 we find:
:formula_14

Again, these approximations become quite accurate for Setting despite its use not quite being valid for so large a fraction of the wavelength, the formula would predict a radiation resistance of 49 Ω, instead of the actual value of 73 Ω produced by a half-wave dipole, when more correct quarter-wave sinusoidal currents are used.

===Dipole antennas of various lengths===
The fundamental resonance of a thin linear conductor occurs at a frequency whose free-space wavelength is &quot;twice&quot; the wire&#x27;s length; i.e. where the conductor is wavelength long. Dipole antennas are frequently used at around that frequency and thus termed &quot;half-wave dipole&quot; antennas. This important case is dealt with in the next section.

Thin linear conductors of length formula_15 are in fact resonant at any integer multiple of a half-wavelength:
:formula_16

where is an integer, formula_17 is the wavelength, and is the reduced speed of radio waves in the radiating conductor ( the speed of light). For a center-fed dipole, however, there is a great dissimilarity between being odd or being even. Dipoles which are an &quot;odd&quot; number of half-wavelengths in length have reasonably low driving point impedances (which are purely resistive at that resonant frequency). However ones which are an &quot;even&quot; number of half-wavelengths in length, that is, an integer number of wavelengths in length, have a &quot;high&quot; driving point impedance (albeit purely resistive at that resonant frequency).

For instance, a full-wave dipole antenna can be made with two half-wavelength conductors placed end to end for a total length of approximately formula_18 This results in an additional gain over a half-wave dipole of about 2 dB. Full wave dipoles can be used in short wave broadcasting only by making the effective diameter very large and feeding from a high impedance balanced line. Cage dipoles are often used to get the large diameter.

A -wave dipole antenna has a much lower but not purely resistive feedpoint impedance, which requires a matching network to the impedance of the transmission line. Its gain is about 3 dB greater than a half-wave dipole, the highest gain of any dipole of any similar length.

Other reasonable lengths of dipole do not offer advantages and are seldom used. However the overtone resonances of a half-wave dipole antenna at odd multiples of its fundamental frequency are sometimes exploited. For instance, amateur radio antennas designed as half-wave dipoles at 7 MHz can also be used as -wave dipoles at 21 MHz; likewise VHF television antennas resonant at the low VHF television band (centered around 65 MHz) are also resonant at the high VHF television band (around 195 MHz).

===Half-wave dipole===
A half-wave dipole antenna consists of two quarter-wavelength conductors placed end to end for a total length of approximately The current distribution is that of a standing wave, approximately sinusoidal along the length of the dipole, with a node at each end and an antinode (peak current) at the center (feedpoint):

:formula_19
where and runs from to .

In the far field, this produces a radiation pattern whose electric field is given by
:formula_20

The directional factor formula_21 is very nearly the same as applying to the short dipole, resulting in a very similar radiation pattern as noted above.

A numerical integration of the radiated power formula_22 over all solid angle, as we did for the short dipole, obtains a value for the total power radiated by the dipole with a current having a peak value of as in the form specified above. Dividing by formula_23 supplies the flux at a large distance, &quot;averaged&quot; over all directions. Dividing the flux in the direction (where it is at its peak) at that large distance by the average flux, we find the directive gain to be 1.64 . This can also be directly computed using the cosine integral:
:formula_24 (2.15 dBi)

: The form of the cosine integral is not the same as the form; they differ by a logarithm. Both MATLAB and Mathematica have inbuilt functions which compute , but not . See the Wikipedia page on cosine integral for the relationship between these functions. 

We can now also find the radiation resistance as we did for the short dipole by solving:
:formula_25

to obtain:
:formula_26

Using the induced EMF method, the real part of the driving point impedance can also be written in terms of the cosine integral, obtaining the same result:
:formula_27

If a half-wave dipole is driven at a point other the center, then the feed point resistance will be higher. The radiation resistance is &quot;usually&quot; expressed relative to the maximum current present along an antenna element, which for the half-wave dipole (and most other antennas) is also the current at the feedpoint. However, if the dipole is fed at a different point at a distance from a current maximum (the center in the case of a half-wave dipole), then the current there is not but only 

In order to supply the same power, the voltage at the feedpoint has to be similarly &quot;increased&quot; by the factor 
Consequently, the resistive part of the feedpoint impedance formula_28 is increased by the factor 
:formula_29

This equation can also be used for dipole antennas of any length, provided that has been computed relative to the current maximum, which is &quot;not&quot; generally the same as the feedpoint current for dipoles longer than half-wave. Note that this equation breaks down when feeding an antenna near a current node, where approaches zero. The driving point impedance does indeed rise greatly, but is nevertheless limited due to higher order components of the elements&#x27; not-quite-exactly-sinusoidal current, which have been ignored above in the model for the current distribution.

===Folded dipole ===

A folded dipole is a half-wave dipole with an additional parallel wire connecting its two ends. If the additional wire has the same diameter and cross-section as the dipole, two nearly identical radiating currents are generated. The resulting far-field emission pattern is nearly identical to the one for the single-wire dipole described above, but at resonance its feedpoint impedance formula_30 is four times the radiation resistance of a single-wire dipole.

A folded dipole is, technically, a folded full-wave loop antenna, where the loop has been bent at opposing ends and squashed into two parallel wires in a flat line. Although the broad bandwidth, high feedpoint impedance, and high efficiency are characteristics more similar to a full loop antenna, the folded dipole&#x27;s radiation pattern is more like an ordinary dipole. Since the operation of a single halfwave dipole is easier to understand, both full loops and folded dipoles are often described as two halfwave dipoles in parallel, connected at the ends.

The high feedpoint impedance formula_30 at resonance is because for a fixed amount of power, the total radiating current formula_32 is equal to twice the current in each wire separately and thus equal to twice the current at the feed point. We equate the average radiated power to the average power delivered at the feedpoint, we may write
:formula_33

where formula_34 is the lower feedpoint impedance of the resonant halfwave dipole. It follows that
:formula_35

Half-wave folded dipoles are often used for FM radio antennas; versions made with twin lead which can be hung on an inside wall often come with FM tuners. They are also widely used as driven elements for rooftop Yagi television antennas. The T²FD antenna is a folded dipole with a resistor added on the second wire, opposite the feedpoint.

The folded dipole is therefore well matched to 300 Ω balanced transmission lines, such as twin-feed ribbon cable. The folded dipole has a wider bandwidth than a single dipole. They can be used for transforming the value of input impedance of the dipole over a broad range of step-up ratios by changing the thicknesses of the wire conductors for the fed- and folded-sides.

Instead of altering thickness or spacing, one can add a third parallel wire to increase the antenna impedance to 9 times that of a single-wire dipole, raising the impedance to 658 Ω, making a good match for open wire feed cable, and further broadening the resonant frequency band of the antenna. More extra parallel wires can be added: Any number of extra parallel wires can be joined onto the antenna, with the radiation resistance (and feedpoint impedance) given by
: formula_36
where formula_37 is the number of parallel halfwave-long wires laid side-by-side in the antenna, and connected at their ends. It is also possible to modify the so-called flattened-loop design, and get nearly as good performance, by making each the parallel wires too short by the same amount, but connecting a single capacitive loading wire (going off in nearly any direction, most often dangling) on each of the antenna ends. The loading wire length is equal to the single missing length of one of the parallel wires.

===Other variants===
There are numerous modifications to the shape of a dipole antenna which are useful in one way or another but result in similar radiation characteristics (low gain). This is not to mention the many directional antennas which include one or more dipole elements in their design as driven elements, many of which are linked to in the information box at the bottom of this page.
* The &quot;bow-tie antenna&quot; is a dipole with flaring, triangular shaped arms. The shape gives it a much wider bandwidth than an ordinary dipole. It is widely used in UHF television antennas.

* The &quot;cage dipole&quot; is a similar modification in which the bandwidth is increased by using fat cylindrical dipole elements made of a cage of wires (see photo). These are used in a few broadband array antennas in the medium wave and shortwave bands for applications such as over-the-horizon radar and radio telescopes.
* A &quot;halo antenna&quot; is a half-wave dipole bent into a circle for a nearly uniform radiation pattern in the plane of the circle. When the halo&#x27;s circle is horizontal, it produces horizontally polarized radiation in a nearly omnidirectional pattern with only a little power wasted toward the zenith, compared to a straight horizontal dipole. In practice, it is categorized either as a bent dipole or as a loop antenna, depending on author preference.
* A &quot;turnstile antenna&quot; comprises two dipoles crossed at a right angle and feed system which introduces a quarter-wave phase difference between the currents along the two. With that geometry, the two dipoles do not interact electrically but their fields add in the far-field producing a net radiation pattern that is rather close to isotropic, with horizontal polarization in the plane of the elements and circular or elliptical polarization at other angles. Turnstile antennas can be stacked and fed in phase to realize an omnidirectional broadside array or phased for an end-fire array with circular polarization.
* The &quot;batwing antenna&quot; is a turnstile antenna with its linear elements widened as in a bow-tie antenna, again for the purpose of widening its resonant frequency and thus usable over a larger bandwidth, without re-tuning. When stacked to form an array the radiation is omnidirectional, horizontally polarized, and with increased gain at low elevations, making it ideal for television broadcasting.
* A V antenna is a dipole with a bend in the middle so its arms are at an angle instead of co-linear.
* A &quot;quadrant&quot; antenna is a &#x27;V&#x27; antenna with an unusual overall length of a &quot;full&quot; wavelength, with two half-wave horizontal elements meeting at a right angle where it is fed. Quadrant antennas produce mostly horizontal polarization at low to intermediate elevation angles and have nearly omnidirectional radiation patterns.
One implementation uses cage elements (see above); the thickness of the resulting elements lowers the high driving point impedance of a full-wave dipole to a value that accommodates a reasonable match to open wire lines and increases the bandwidth (in terms of SWR) to a full octave. They are used for HF band transmissions.
* The &quot;antenna&quot; is a dipole antenna fed indirectly, through a carefully chosen length of 300 Ω or 450 Ω twin lead, which acts as an impedance matching network to connect (through a balun) to a standard 50 Ω coaxial transmission line.
* The &quot;sloper antenna&quot; is a slanted vertical dipole antenna attached to the top of a single tower. The element can be center-fed or can be end-fed as an unbalanced monopole antenna from a transmission line at the top of the tower, in which case the monopole&#x27;s ground connection can better be viewed as a second element comprising the tower or transmission line shield.
* The &quot;inverted &#x27;V&#x27; antenna&quot; is likewise supported using a single tower but is a balanced antenna with two symmetric elements angled toward the ground. It is thus a half-wave dipole with a bend in the middle. Like the sloper, this has the practical advantage of elevating the antenna but requiring only a &quot;single&quot; tower.
* The &quot;AS-2259 antenna&quot; is an inverted-‘V’ dipole antenna used for local communications via Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS).

===Vertical (monopole) antennas===

The &quot;vertical&quot;, &quot;Marconi&quot;, or monopole antenna is a single-element antenna usually fed at the bottom (with the shield side of its unbalanced transmission line connected to ground). It behaves essentially the same as half of a dipole antenna. The ground (or ground plane) is considered to be a conductive surface that works as a reflector (see effect of ground). Vertical currents in the reflected image have the same direction (thus are &quot;not&quot; reflected about the ground) and phase as the current in the real antenna. The conductor and its image together act as a dipole in the upper half of space. Like a dipole, in order to achieve resonance (resistive feedpoint impedance) the conductor must be close to a quarter wavelength in height (like each conductor in a half-wave dipole).

In this upper side of space, the emitted field has the same amplitude of the field radiated by a similar dipole fed with the same current. Therefore, the total emitted power is half the emitted power of a dipole fed with the same current. As the current is the same, the radiation resistance (real part of series impedance) will be half of the series impedance of the comparable dipole. A quarter-wave monopole, then, has an impedance of formula_38 Another way of seeing this, is that a true dipole receiving a current has voltages on its terminals of and , for an impedance across the terminals of , whereas the comparable vertical antenna has the current but an applied voltage of only .

Since the fields above ground are the same as for the dipole, but only half the power is applied, the gain is doubled to This is not an actual performance advantage &quot;per se&quot;, since in practice a dipole also reflects half of its power off the ground which (depending on the antenna height and sky angle) can augment (or cancel!) the direct signal. The vertical polarization of the monopole (as for a vertically oriented dipole) is advantageous at low elevation angles where the ground reflection combines with the direct wave approximately in phase.

The earth acts as a ground plane, but it can be a poor conductor leading to losses. Its conductivity can be improved (at cost) by laying a copper mesh. When an actual ground is not available (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces can serve as a ground plane (typically the vehicle&#x27;s roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed at the base of the antenna can form a ground plane. For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and ground plane elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. Using such an artificial ground plane allows for the entire antenna and ground to be mounted at an arbitrary height. One common modification has the radials forming the ground plane sloped down, which has the effect of raising the feedpoint impedance to around 50 Ω, matching common coaxial cable. No longer being a true ground, a balun (such as a simple choke balun) is then recommended.

==Dipole characteristics==
===Impedance of dipoles of various lengths===
The feedpoint impedance of a dipole antenna is sensitive to its electrical length and feedpoint position. Therefore, a dipole will generally only perform optimally over a rather narrow bandwidth, beyond which its impedance will become a poor match for the transmitter or receiver (and transmission line). The real (resistive) and imaginary (reactive) components of that impedance, as a function of electrical length, are shown in the accompanying graph. The detailed calculation of these numbers are described below. Note that the value of the reactance is highly dependent on the diameter of the conductors; this plot is for conductors with a diameter of 0.001 wavelengths.

Dipoles that are much smaller than one half the wavelength of the signal are called &quot;short dipoles&quot;. These have a very low radiation resistance (and a high capacitive reactance) making them inefficient antennas. More of a transmitter&#x27;s current is dissipated as heat due to the finite resistance of the conductors which is greater than the radiation resistance. However they can nevertheless be practical receiving antennas for longer wavelengths.

Dipoles whose length is approximately half the wavelength of the signal are called &quot;half-wave dipoles&quot; and are widely used as such or as the basis for derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%. In general radio engineering, the term &quot;dipole&quot;, if not further qualified, is taken to mean a center-fed half-wave dipole.
A true half-wave dipole is one half of the wavelength in length, where in free space. Such a dipole has a feedpoint impedance consisting of 73 Ω resistance and +43 Ω reactance, thus presenting a slightly inductive reactance. To cancel that reactance, and present a pure resistance to the feedline, the element is shortened by the factor for a net length formula_15 of:
:formula_40

where is the free-space wavelength, is the speed of light in free space, and is the frequency. The adjustment factor which causes feedpoint reactance to be eliminated, depends on the diameter of the conductor,
as is plotted in the accompanying graph. The relative scale-size ranges from about 0.98 for thin wires (diameter, 0.00001 wave) to about 0.94 for thick conductors (diameter, 0.008 wave). This is because the effect of antenna length on reactance (upper graph) is much greater for thinner conductors so that a smaller deviation from the exact half wavelength is required in order to cancel the 43 Ω inductive reactance it has when exactly For the same reason, antennas with thicker conductors have a wider operating bandwidth over which they attain a practical standing wave ratio which is degraded by any remaining reactance.
For a typical of about 0.95, the above formula for the corrected antenna length can be written, for a length in meters as , or a length in feet as where is the frequency in megahertz.

Dipole antennas of lengths approximately equal to any &quot;odd&quot; multiple of are also resonant, presenting little or no reactance (which can be removed by making a small length adjustment). However, these are rarely used. One size that is a much more efficient radiator both in terms of Watts out and in direction radiated is a dipole with a length of Not being close to this antenna&#x27;s impedance has a large (negative) reactance and can only be used with an inductive impedance matching network (a tapped loading coil or a so-called antenna tuner). It is a desirable length because such an antenna has the highest gain for any dipole which isn&#x27;t a great deal longer.

===Radiation pattern and gain===
A dipole is omnidirectional in the plane perpendicular to the wire axis, with the radiation falling to zero on the axis (off the ends of the antenna). In a half-wave dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the antenna, declining as formula_41 to zero on the axis. Its radiation pattern in three dimensions (see figure) would be plotted approximately as a toroid (doughnut shape) symmetric about the conductor. When mounted vertically this results in maximum radiation in horizontal directions. When mounted horizontally, the radiation peaks at right angles (90°) to the conductor, with nulls in the direction of the dipole.

Neglecting electrical inefficiency, the antenna gain is equal to the directive gain, which is 1.50 (1.76 dBi or -0.39 dBd) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi or 0 dBd) for a half-wave dipole. For a dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are &quot;much&quot; longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.

===Feeding a dipole antenna===
Ideally, a half-wave dipole should be fed using a balanced transmission line matching its typical 65–70 Ω input impedance. Twin lead with a similar impedance is available but seldom used and does not match the balanced antenna terminals of most radio and television receivers. Much more common is the use of common 300 Ω twin lead in conjunction with a &quot;folded dipole&quot;. The driving point impedance of a half-wave folded dipole is 4 times that of a simple half-wave dipole, thus closely matching that 300 Ω characteristic impedance. Most FM broadcast band tuners and older analog televisions include balanced 300 Ω antenna input terminals. However twin lead has the drawback that it is electrically disturbed by any other nearby conductor (including earth); when used for transmitting, care must be taken not to place it near other conductors.

Many types of coaxial cable (or coax) have a characteristic impedance of 75 Ω, which would otherwise be a good match for a half-wave dipole. However, coax is a single-ended line whereas a center-fed dipole expects a balanced line (such as twin lead). By symmetry, one can see that the dipole&#x27;s terminals have an equal but opposite voltage, whereas coax has one conductor grounded. Using coax regardless results in an unbalanced line, in which the currents along the two conductors of the transmission line are no longer equal and opposite. Since you then have a &quot;net current&quot; along the transmission line, the transmission line becomes an antenna itself, with unpredictable results (since it depends on the path of the transmission line). This will generally alter the antenna&#x27;s intended radiation pattern, and change the impedance seen at the transmitter or receiver.

A balun is required to use coaxial cable with a dipole antenna. The balun transfers power between the single-ended coax and the balanced antenna, sometimes with an additional change in impedance. A balun can be implemented as a transformer which also allows for an impedance transformation. This is usually wound on a ferrite toroidal core. The toroid core material must be suitable for the frequency of use, and in a transmitting antenna it must be of sufficient size to avoid saturation. Other balun designs are mentioned below.


====Current balun====
A current balun uses a transformer wound on a toroid or rod of magnetic material such as ferrite. All of the current seen at the input goes into one terminal of the balanced antenna. It forms a balun by choking common-mode current. The material isn&#x27;t critical for 1:1 because there is no transformer action applied to the desired differential current.
A related design involves &quot;two&quot; transformers and includes a 1:4 impedance transformation.

====Coax balun====
A coax balun is a cost-effective method of eliminating feeder radiation but is limited to a narrow set of operating frequencies.

One easy way to make a balun is to use a length of coaxial cable equal to half a wavelength. The inner core of the cable is linked at each end to one of the balanced connections for a feeder or dipole. One of these terminals should be connected to the inner core of the coaxial feeder. All three braids should be connected together. This then forms a 4:1 balun, which works correctly at only a narrow band of frequencies.

====Sleeve balun====
At VHF frequencies, a sleeve balun can also be built to remove feeder radiation.

Another narrow-band design is to use a length of metal pipe. The coaxial cable is placed inside the pipe; at one end the braid is wired to the pipe while at the other end no connection is made to the pipe. The balanced end of this balun is at the end where no connection is made to the pipe. The conductor acts as a transformer, converting the zero impedance at the short to the braid into an infinite impedance at the open end. This infinite impedance at the open end of the pipe prevents current flowing into the outer coax formed by the outside of the inner coax shield and the pipe, forcing the current to remain in the inside coax. This balun design is impractical for low frequencies because of the long length of pipe that will be needed.

==Common applications==

===&quot;Rabbit ears&quot; TV antenna===

One of the most common applications of the dipole antenna is the &quot;rabbit ears&quot; or &quot;bunny ears&quot; television antenna, found atop broadcast television receivers. It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 54–88 MHz (band I) and 174–216 MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5–1.4 m. Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed dipole antenna can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment. It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can each be extended out to about 1 m length (one-quarter wavelength at 75 MHz). With control over the segments&#x27; length, angle with respect to vertical, and compass angle, one has much more flexibility in optimizing reception than available with a rooftop antenna even if equipped with an antenna rotor.

===FM-broadcast-receiving antennas===
In contrast to the wide television frequency bands, the FM broadcast band (88-108 MHz) is narrow enough that a dipole antenna can cover it. For fixed use in homes, hi-fi tuners are typically supplied with simple folded dipoles resonant near the center of that band. The feedpoint impedance of a folded dipole, which is quadruple the impedance of a simple dipole, is a good match for 300 Ω twin lead, so that is usually used for the transmission line to the tuner. A common construction is to make the arms of the folded dipole out of twin lead also, shorted at their ends. This flexible antenna can be conveniently taped or nailed to walls, following the contours of moldings.

===Shortwave antenna===
Horizontal wire dipole antennas are popular for use on the HF shortwave bands, both for transmitting and shortwave listening. They are usually constructed of two lengths of wire joined by a strain insulator in the center, which is the feedpoint. The ends can be attached to existing buildings, structures, or trees, taking advantage of their heights. If used for transmitting, it is essential that the ends of the antenna be attached to supports through strain insulators with a sufficiently high flashover voltage, since the antenna&#x27;s high-voltage antinodes occur there. Being a balanced antenna, they are best fed with a balun between the (coax) transmission line and the feedpoint.

These are simple to put up for temporary or field use. But they are also widely used by radio amateurs and short wave listeners in fixed locations due to their simple (and inexpensive) construction, while still realizing a resonant antenna at frequencies where resonant antenna elements need to be of quite some size. They are an attractive solution for these frequencies, when significant directionality is not desired, and the cost of several such resonant antennas for different frequency bands, built at home, may still be much less than a single commercially produced antenna.

===Dipole towers===
Antennas for MF and LF radio stations are usually constructed as mast radiators, in which the vertical mast itself forms the antenna. Although mast radiators are most commonly monopoles, some are dipoles. The metal structure of the mast is divided at its midpoint into two insulated sections to make a vertical dipole, which is driven at the midpoint.

===Dipole arrays===
Many types of array antennas are constructed using multiple dipoles, usually half-wave dipoles. The purpose of using multiple dipoles is to increase the directional gain of the antenna over the gain of a single dipole; the radiation of the separate dipoles interferes to enhance power radiated in desired directions. In arrays with multiple dipole driven elements, the feedline is split using an electrical network in order to provide power to the elements, with careful attention paid to the relative phase delays due to transmission between the common point and each element.

In order to increase antenna gain in horizontal directions (at the expense of radiation towards the sky or towards the ground) one can stack antennas in the vertical direction in a broadside array where the antennas are fed in phase. Doing so with horizontal dipole antennas retains those dipoles&#x27; directionality and null in the direction of their elements. However, if each dipole is vertically oriented, in a so-called collinear antenna array (see graphic), that null direction becomes vertical and the array acquires an omnidirectional radiation pattern (in the horizontal plane) as is typically desired. Vertical collinear arrays are used in the VHF and UHF frequency bands at which wavelengths the size of the elements are small enough to practically stack several on a mast. They are a higher-gain alternative to quarter-wave ground plane antennas used in fixed base stations for mobile two-way radios, such as police, fire, and taxi dispatchers.
On the other hand, for a rotating antenna (or one used only towards a particular direction) one may desire increased gain and directivity in a particular horizontal direction. If the broadside array discussed above (whether collinear or not) is turned horizontal, then the one obtains a greater gain in the horizontal direction perpendicular to the antennas, at the expense of most other directions. Unfortunately, that also means that the direction &quot;opposite&quot; the desired direction also has a high gain, whereas high gain is usually desired in one single direction. The power that is wasted in the reverse direction, however, can be redirected, for instance by using a large planar reflector, as is accomplished in the reflective array antenna, increasing the gain in the desired direction by another 3 dB

An alternative realization of a uni-directional antenna is the &quot;end-fire array&quot;. In this case the dipoles are again side by side (but not collinear), but fed in progressing phases, arranged so that their waves add coherently in one direction but cancel in the opposite direction. So now, rather than being perpendicular to the array direction as in a broadside array, the directivity is &quot;in&quot; the array direction (i.e. the direction of the line connecting their feedpoints) but with one of the opposite directions suppressed.

===Yagi antennas===

The above-described antennas with multiple driven elements require a complex feed system of signal splitting, phasing, distribution to the elements, and impedance matching. A different sort of end-fire array which is much more often used is based on the use of so-called &quot;parasitic elements&quot;. In the popular high-gain Yagi antenna, only one of the dipoles is actually connected electrically, but the others receive and reradiate power supplied by the driven element. This time, the phasing is accomplished by careful choice of the lengths as well as positions of the parasitic elements, in order to concentrate gain in one direction and largely cancel radiation in the opposite direction (as well as all other directions). Although the realized gain is less than a driven array with the same number of elements, the simplicity of the electrical connections makes the Yagi more practical for consumer applications.

===Dipole as a reference standard===
Antenna gain is frequently measured as decibels relative to a half-wave dipole. One reason is that practical antenna measurements need a reference strength to compare the field strength of an antenna under test at a particular distance to. While there is no such thing as an isotropic radiator, the half-wave dipole is well understood and behaved, and can be constructed to be nearly 100% efficient. It is also a fairer comparison, since the gain obtained by the dipole itself is essentially &quot;free,&quot; given that almost no antenna design has a smaller directive gain.

For a gain measured relative to a dipole, one says the antenna has a gain of (see Decibel). More often, gains are expressed relative to an isotropic radiator, making the gain seem higher. In consideration of the known gain of a half-wave dipole, 0 dBd is defined as 2.15 dBi; all gains in &quot;dBi&quot; are shifted 2.15 higher than gains in &quot;dBd&quot;.

==Hertzian dipole==

The &quot;Hertzian dipole&quot; or &quot;elementary doublet&quot; refers to a theoretical construction, rather than a physical antenna design: It is an idealized tiny segment of conductor carrying a RF current with constant amplitude and direction along its entire (short) length; a real antenna can be modeled as the combination of many Hertzian dipoles laid end-to-end.

The Hertzian dipole may be defined as a finite oscillating current (in a specified direction) of formula_42 over a tiny or infinitesimal length formula_43 at a specified position. The solution of the fields from a Hertzian dipole can be used as the basis for analytical or numerical calculation of the radiation from more complex antenna geometries (such as practical dipoles) by forming the superposition of fields from a large number of Hertzian dipoles comprising the current pattern of the actual antenna. As a function of position, taking the elementary current elements formula_44 multiplied by infinitesimal lengths formula_45 the resulting field pattern then reduces to an integral over the path of an antenna conductor (modeled as a thin wire).

For the following derivation, we shall take the current to be in the formula_46 direction, centered at the origin where formula_47 with the sinusoidal time dependence formula_48 for all quantities being understood. The simplest approach is to use the calculation of the vector potential formula_49 using the formula for the retarded potential. Although the value of formula_50 is not unique, we shall constrain it by adopting the Lorenz gauge, and assuming sinusoidal current at radian frequency formula_51 the retardation of the field is converted just into a phase factor formula_52 where the wave number formula_53 in free space and formula_54 is the linear distance between the point being considered to the origin (where we assumed the current source to be), so formula_55 This results
in a vector potential formula_50 at position formula_57 due to that current element only, which we find is purely in the formula_46 direction (the direction of the current):
:formula_59

where formula_60 is the permeability of free space. Then using
:formula_61

we can solve for the magnetic field formula_62 and from that (dependent on us having chosen the Lorenz gauge) the electric field formula_63 using
:formula_64
In spherical coordinates we find that the magnetic field formula_65 has only a component in the formula_66 direction:
:formula_67
where
:formula_68

while the electric field has components both in the formula_69 and formula_54 directions:
:formula_71
where
:formula_72

with formula_73 is the impedance of free space.
This solution includes near field terms that are very strong near the source but which are not radiated. As seen in the accompanying animation, the formula_63 and formula_65 fields very close to the source are almost 90° out of phase, thus contributing very little to the Poynting vector by which radiated flux is computed. The near field solution for an antenna element (from the integral using this formula over the length of that element) is the field that can be used to compute the mutual impedance between it and another nearby element.

For computation of the far field radiation pattern, the above equations are simplified as only the formula_76 terms remain significant:
:formula_77
The far-field pattern is thus seen to consist of a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave, with electric and magnetic fields at right angles to each other and at right angles to the direction of propagation (the direction of formula_57, as we assumed the source to be at the origin). The electric polarization, in the formula_79 direction, is coplanar with the source current (in the formula_46 direction), while the magnetic field is at right angles to that, in the formula_66 direction. It can be seen from these equations, and also in the animation, that the fields at these distances are exactly &quot;in phase&quot;. Both fields fall according to formula_82 with the power thus falling according to formula_83 as dictated by the inverse square law.

===Radiation resistance===
If one knows the far field radiation pattern due to a given antenna current, then it is possible to compute the radiation resistance directly. For the above fields due to the Hertzian dipole, we can compute the power flux according to the Poynting vector, resulting in a power (as averaged over one cycle) of:
:formula_84

With increasing formula_54 the formula_86 becomes insignificantly small compared to the formula_87 component. Although not required, it is easiest to only work with the asymptotic value that formula_88 approaches at a large formula_54 using the simpler far-field expressions for formula_63 and formula_91 Consider a large sphere surrounding the source with a radius formula_92 We find the power per unit area crossing the surface of that sphere in the formula_93 direction is:
:formula_94

Integration of this flux over the complete sphere results in:
:formula_95

where formula_96 is the free space wavelength corresponding to the radian frequency formula_97 By definition, the radiation resistance formula_98 times the average of the square of the current formula_99 is the net power radiated due to that current, so equating the above to formula_100 we find:

:formula_101

This method can be used to compute the radiation resistance for any antenna whose far-field radiation pattern has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If ohmic losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance. Unfortunately, this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of feedpoint impedance, whose calculation is considered below.

===Directive gain===
Using the above expression for the radiated flux given by the Poynting vector, it is also possible to compute the directive gain of the Hertzian dipole. Dividing the total power computed above by formula_102 we can find the flux averaged over all directions formula_103 as
:formula_104

Dividing the flux radiated in a &quot;particular&quot; direction by formula_103 we obtain the directive gain formula_106
:formula_107

The commonly quoted antenna &quot;gain&quot;, meaning the peak value of the gain pattern (radiation pattern), is found to be 1.5~1.76 dBi, lower than practically any other antenna configuration.

===Comparison with the short dipole===
The Hertzian dipole is &quot;similar to&quot; but differs from the short dipole, discussed above. In both cases the conductor is very short compared to a wavelength, so the standing wave pattern present on a half-wave dipole (for instance) is absent. However, with the Hertzian dipole we specified that the current along that conductor is &quot;constant&quot; over its short length. This makes the Hertzian dipole useful for analysis of more complex antenna configurations, where every infinitesimal section of that &quot;real&quot; antenna&#x27;s conductor can be modeled as a Hertzian dipole with the current found to be flowing in that real antenna.

However a short conductor fed with a RF voltage will not have a uniform current even along that short range. Rather, a short dipole in real life has a current equal to the feedpoint current at the feedpoint but falling linearly to zero over the length of that short conductor. By placing a &quot;capacitive hat&quot;, such as a metallic ball, at the end of the conductor, it is possible for its self capacitance to absorb the current from the conductor and better approximate the constant current assumed for the Hertzian dipole. But again, the Hertzian dipole is meant only as a theoretical construct for antenna analysis.

The short dipole, with a feedpoint current of formula_108 has an &quot;average&quot; current over each conductor of only formula_109 The above field equations for the Hertzian dipole of length formula_43 would then predict the &quot;actual&quot; fields for a short dipole using that effective current formula_111 This would result in a power measured in the far field of &quot;one quarter&quot; that given by the above equation for the magnitude of the Poynting vector formula_87 if we had assumed an element current of formula_113 Consequently, it can be seen that the radiation resistance computed for the short dipole is one quarter of that computed above for the Hertzian dipole. But their radiation patterns (and gains) are otherwise identical.

==Detailed calculation of dipole feedpoint impedance==
The impedance seen at the feedpoint of a dipole of various lengths has been plotted above, in terms of the real (resistive) component dipole and the imaginary (reactive) component dipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no Ohmic loss), dipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of dipole is more difficult.

===Induced EMF method===

Using the &quot;induced EMF method&quot; closed form expressions are obtained for both components of the feedpoint impedance; such results are plotted above. The solution depends on an assumption for the form of the current distribution along the antenna conductors. For wavelength-to-element diameter ratios greater than about 60, the current distribution along each antenna element of length is very well approximated as having the form of the sine function at points along the antenna , with the current reaching zero at the elements&#x27; ends, where as follows:
:formula_114
where is the wavenumber given by and the amplitude is set to match a specified driving point current at 

In cases where an approximately sinusoidal current distribution can be assumed, this method solves for the driving point impedance in closed form using the cosine and sine integral functions and . For a dipole of total length , the resistive and reactive components of the driving point impedance can be expressed as:
:formula_115

where is the radius of the conductors, is again the wavenumber as defined above, is the impedance of empty space, which very nearly the same as impedance of air: and formula_116 is Euler&#x27;s constant. There is an equivalent alternate form favored by some authors that uses a different function,  .

===Integral methods===
The induced EMF method is dependent on the assumption of a sinusoidal current distribution, delivering an accuracy better than about 10% as long as the wavelength-to-element diameter ratio is greater than about 60. However, for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor&#x27;s current distribution (rather than &quot;assuming&quot; a sinusoidal pattern). This can be based on approximating solutions for either &quot;Pocklington&#x27;s integrodifferential equation&quot; or the &quot;Hallén integral equation&quot;. These approaches also have greater generality, not being limited to linear conductors.

Numerical solution of either is performed using the &quot;moment method solution&quot; which requires expansion of that current into a set of basis functions; one simple (but not the best) choice, for instance, is to break up the conductor into segments with a constant current assumed along each. After setting an appropriate weighting function the cost may be minimized through the inversion of a matrix. Determination of each matrix element requires at least one double integration involving the weighting functions, which may become computationally intensive. These are simplified if the weighting functions are simply delta functions, which corresponds to fitting the boundary conditions for the current along the conductor at only discrete points. Then the matrix must be inverted, which is also computationally intensive as increases. In one simple example, performs this computation to find the antenna impedance with different using Pocklington&#x27;s method, and finds that with the solutions approach their limiting values to within a few percent.

<text>Lord Torphichen or Baron Torphichen (pronounced ) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created by Queen Mary in 1564 for Sir James Sandilands (to whom she was related).

Some Scottish titles (another title that can choose the heir is Lord Kinloss but there are others) are a rare exception to the typical rule that peerages cannot be transferred and must be inherited. One of the few peerage titles that might be alienated from the bloodline, enabling it to be transferred or passed on to heirs who are not direct descendants.

, the title is held by the 15th Lord, who succeeded his father in 1975. He is Chief of Clan Sandilands and also holds the title of Baron of Calder, granted in 1386.

The family seat is Calder House, near Mid Calder, West Lothian.

== History ==
Sir James Sandilands had served as Preceptor to the Knights Hospitaller in Scotland. On 24 January 1564, he received a charter from Queen Mary that erected his military benefice into a temporal lordship, with remainder to his heirs and assigns whatsoever, after he resigned the entire Torphichen Preceptory in West Lothian to the Crown. This marks him as the inaugural Lord Torphichen.

The newly established lordship encompassed several baronies, including Torphichen, Liston, Balintrode, Tankerton, Denny, Marycoulter, Stenhope, Galtna, and others. These lands were situated across various shires, such as Edinburgh, Peebles, Linlithgow, Stirling, Lanark, and Kincardine, among others. The lordship was officially designated as the Barony and Lordship of Torphichen, complete with the dignities and privileges associated with being a Lord of Parliament.

Following him, all subsequent lords were descendants of the second Lord Torphichen. Notably, the second Lord&#x27;s great-grandson, who became the seventh Lord, was a fervent advocate for the union with England. His lineage continued to play a significant role in Scottish politics, with his grandson, the ninth Lord, and great-great-grandson, the twelfth Lord, both serving as Scottish representative peers in the House of Lords.

=== Barony of Calder ===
The first Lord was succeeded by his great-nephew, James Sandilands, who held the title of Baron of Calder, making James Sandilands the second Lord. Following this succession, the Lordship of Parliament of Torphichen was officially conjoined with the Barony of Calder, and both titles were descended down the line.

<doc id="465162" wikidata="Q1423087" url="?curid=465162" title="Retinopathy of prematurity">
<text>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), also called retrolental fibroplasia (RLF) and Terry syndrome, is a disease of the eye affecting prematurely born babies generally having received neonatal intensive care, in which oxygen therapy is used because of the premature development of their lungs. It is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels and may result in scarring and retinal detachment. ROP can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Both oxygen toxicity and relative hypoxia can contribute to the development of ROP.

==Causes==

By the fourth month of pregnancy, the fetal retina has begun to develop vascularization. Such formation of blood vessels appears to be very sensitive to the amount of oxygen supplied, either naturally or artificially. In rare cases ROP has been found in some patients with a mutation in the NDP gene, which is normally associated with the more damaging Norrie disease.

===Risk factors===

Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are:
* Prematurity
* High exposure to oxygen
* Low birth weight
* Various types of infections
* Cardiac defects
* Anaemia 
* Low vitamin E level

==Pathophysiology==

During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies, the process has yet to be completed. If the vessels grow and branch abnormally, the baby becomes susceptible to developing ROP. These abnormal blood vessels may grow up from the plane of the retina and bleed inside the eye. When the blood and abnormal vessels are reabsorbed, it may give rise to multiple band-like membranes which can pull up the retina, causing detachment of the retina and eventually blindness before six months.

Normally, maturation of the retina proceeds &quot;in utero&quot;, and at term, the medial portion (nasal retina) of the retina is fully vascularized, while the lateral portion (temporal retina) is only incompletely vascularized. The normal growth of the blood vessels is directed to relatively low-oxygen areas of the retina, but the vessels remain in the plane of the retina and do not grow into the vitreous humor. If excess oxygen is given, normal blood vessels degrade and cease to develop. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina.

The key disease element in ROP is fibrovascular proliferation. This is growth of abnormal new vessels; this may regress, but frequently progresses. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of &quot;plus disease&quot;. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use reduces the rate of ROP, but may raise the risk of other hypoxia-related systemic complications, including death.

Patients with ROP, particularly those who have developed severe disease needing treatment are at greater risk for strabismus, glaucoma, cataracts and shortsightedness (myopia) later in life and should be examined yearly to help prevent or detect and treat these conditions.

Retinopathy of Prematurity or ROP is a retinal vascular disease that affects premature and low birth weight infants. The lower the birth weight the greater the risk of developing ROP. Supplemental oxygenation and the lighting in neonatal units have also been linked to the development of ROP. In addition to retinal manifestations, children tend to have amblyopia, strabismus, cataracts, glaucoma, nystagmus and corneal problems.

==Diagnosis==

The stages of ROP disease have been defined by the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP).

In older patients, the appearance of the disease is less well described but includes the residua of the ICROP stages as well as secondary retinal responses.

===International classification===

The system used for describing the findings of active ROP is entitled &quot;The International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity&quot; (ICROP). ICROP uses a number of parameters to describe the disease. They are location (zone) of the disease, the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours, the severity (stage) of the disease and the presence or absence of &quot;Plus Disease&quot;. Each aspect of the classification has a technical definition. This classification was used for the major clinical trials. It was revised in 2005.
The zones are centered on the optic nerve. ZoneI is the posterior zone of the retina, defined as the circle with a radius extending from the optic nerve to double the distance to the macula. ZoneII is an annulus with the inner border defined by zoneI and the outer border defined by the radius defined as the distance from the optic nerve to the nasal ora serrata. ZoneIII is the residual temporal crescent of the retina.

The circumferential extent of the disease is described in segments as if the top of the eye were 12 on the face of an analog clock, e.g. stage1 from 4:00 to 7:00. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.)

The Stages describe the ophthalmoscopic findings at the junction between the vascularized and avascular retina.

* Stage 1 is a faint demarcation line.
* Stage 2 is an elevated ridge. 
* Stage 3 is extraretinal fibrovascular tissue. 
* Stage 4 is sub-total retinal detachment.
* Stage 5 is total retinal detachment.

===Plus disease===

Plus disease can be present as a major complicating factor at any stage. It is characterised by:
* Significant level of vascular dilation and tortuosity observed at the posterior retinal arterioles. This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina.
* Vitreous haze and anterior chamber haze
* Iris vascular engorgement
* Persistent tunica vasculosa lentis or immature blood vessels growing over the lens which also restrict the dilatation of the pupils.

===Differential diagnosis===

The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis may arise from the similarity of two other diseases:
* Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy which is a genetic disorder that also disrupts the retinal vascularization in full-term infants.
* Persistent fetal vasculature that can cause a traction retinal detachment difficult to differentiate but typically unilateral.

==Screening==

Almost all infants with ROP have a gestational age of 31 weeks or less (regardless of birth weight) or a birth weight of 1250 g (2.76 lbs) or less; these indications are generally used to decide whether a baby should be screened for ROP, but some centres, especially in developing countries, extend birth weight screening criteria to 1500 g (3.3 lbs).

Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, intraventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening.

===Timing===

Retinal examination with scleral depression is generally recommended for patients born before 30–32 weeks gestation, or 4–6 weeks of life, whichever is later. It is then repeated every 1–3 weeks until vascularization is complete (or until disease progression mandates treatment).

===Procedure===

Following pupillary dilation using eye drops, the retina is examined using a special lighted instrument (an indirect ophthalmoscope). The peripheral portions of the retina are sometimes pushed into view using scleral depression. Examination of the retina of a premature infant is performed to determine how far the retinal blood vessels have grown (the zone), and whether or not the vessels are growing flat along the wall of the eye (the stage). This eye examination has been shown to be painful and the use of adequate analgesia during the procedure is advised. Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. The stage of ROP refers to the character of the leading edge of growing retinal blood vessels (at the vascular-avascular border).

===Monitoring===

In order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. These monitoring protocols differ geographically because the definition of high-risk is not uniform or perfectly defined. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006. They included infants with birthweights under 1500 grams or under 30 weeks gestation in most cases. The first examination should take place within the first 4 weeks of birth, and regular, weekly examination is required until it is clear that the eyes are not going to develop disease needing treatment, or one or both eyes develop disease requiring treatment. Treatment should be administered within a 48 hours, as the condition can progress rapidly.

==Management==
===Treatment===


* Peripheral retinal ablation is the mainstay of ROP treatment. The destruction of the avascular retina is performed with a solid state laser photocoagulation device, as these are easily portable to the operating room or neonatal ICU. Cryotherapy, an earlier technique in which regional retinal destruction was done using a probe to freeze the desired areas, has also been evaluated in multi-center clinical trials as an effective modality for prevention and treatment of ROP. However, when laser treatment is available, cryotherapy is no longer preferred for routine avascular retinal ablation in premature babies, due to the side effects of inflammation and lid swelling. Furthermore, recent trials have shown that treatment at an earlier stage of the disease gives better results.
* Scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy surgery may be considered for severe ROP (stages4 and5) for eyes that progress to retinal detachment. Few centers in the world specialize in this surgery, because of its attendant surgical risks and generally poor outcomes.
* Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (Avastin) has been reported as a supportive measure in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity. In a 2011 clinical trial comparing bevacizumab with conventional laser therapy, intravitreal bevacizumab monotherapy showed a significant benefit for zoneI but not zoneII disease when used to treat infants with stage3+ retinopathy of prematurity. Potential benefits of intravitreal Avastin injection over laser therapy include: reduction in level of anesthesia required, preservation of viable peripheral retina, and, possibly, reduced incidence of subsequent high refractive error. However, the safety of this new treatment has not yet been established in terms of ocular complications as well as systemic complications. The latter are theoretically possible, as the active ingredient of bevacizumab not only blocks the development of abnormal blood vessels in the eye but may also prevent the normal development ofother tissues such as the lung and kidney. A 2018 Cochrane review also examined the effectiveness of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and their use for ROP.
* Oral propranolol is being evaluated for counteracting the progression of ROP, but safety is a concern. A prospective randomized trial in which pre-term newborns were randomized to receiving oral propranolol with standard treatment or standard treatment alone found that oral propranolol showed a 48% relative risk reduction for progression to stage3, 58% reduction for progression to stage3 plus, and 100% reduction for progression to stage4. Furthermore, there was a 52% relative risk reduction for the need for laser treatment or intravitreal bevacizumab. However 19% of the newborns experienced serious adverse effects including hypotension and bradycardia. A study in a mouse model of human ROP has shown that beta-blockade is protective against retinal angiogenesis and ameliorate blood-retinal barrier dysfunction.

===Follow-up===

* Once diagnosed with ROP lifelong follow-up (yearly) is performed in some centers. In others, only children treated for ROP are followed yearly.
* Follow-up after laser or anti-VEGF treatment is individualized.
* Follow-up of premature children (with or without ROP) is varying among centers and countries, mirroring the diverse states of health care system in different countries.

==Prognosis==

Stages 1 and 2 do not lead to blindness. However, they can progress to the more severe stages. Threshold disease is defined as disease that has a 50% likelihood of progressing to retinal detachment. Threshold disease is considered to be present when stage3 ROP is present in either zoneI or zoneII, with at least five continuous or eight total clock hours of disease, and the presence of &quot;plus&quot; disease. Progression to stage4 (partial retinal detachment), or to stage5 (total retinal detachment), will result in substantial or total loss of vision for the infant.

* Refractive errors including myopia (most common)
* Strabismus
* Amblyopia
* Retinal detachment, traction of the retina and blindness
* Glaucoma
*Impairments in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, visual field, convergence, and accommodation

==Epidemiology==

ROP prevalence varies, from 5 to 8% in developed countries with adequate neonatological facilities, to up to 30% in middle-income developing countries.

There is increasing evidence that ROP and blindness due to ROP are now public health problems in the middle income countries of Latin America, Eastern Europe and the more advanced economies in South East Asia and the Middle east region. In these countries ROP is often the most common cause of blindness in children. ROP is highly likely to become an increasing problem in India, China and other countries in Asia as these countries expand the provision of services for premature infants.

There is also evidence that the population of premature infants at risk of severe ROP varies depending on the level of neonatal intensive care being provided. In countries with high development indices and very low neonatal mortality rates (e.g. North America, Western Europe), severe ROP is generally limited to extremely preterm infants i.e. those weighing less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) at birth. At the other end of the development spectrum, countries with very low development indices and very high neonatal mortality rates (e.g. much of subSaharan Africa) ROP is rare as most premature babies do not have access to neonatal intensive care and so do not survive. Countries with moderate development indices are improving access to neonatal intensive care, and in these settings bigger, more mature babies are also at risk of severe ROP as neonatal care may be suboptimal. These findings have two main implications: firstly, much can be done in countries with moderate development indices to improve neonatal care, to reduce the risk of severe ROP in bigger babies and increase survival of extremely preterm infants, and secondly, in these settings bigger more mature babies need to be included in ROP programs and examined regularly so as to detect those babies developing ROP requiring treatment.

In 2012, the World Health Organization published data on rates of preterm birth and the number of premature babies born in different regions of the world. This report contained three main findings: 
* Premature birth has many different causes, and prevention is challenging,
* Prematurity is the most common cause of neonatal death in many countries, totaling as many as 1 million infants annually due to complications of preterm birth, and
* the number of preterm births is currently estimated to be 15 million, and increasing.

==History==

This disease was first described in a premature baby in 1942 as reported by Theodore L. Terry. Between 1941 and 1953, over 12,000 babies worldwide were affected by it. However, Kate Isabel Campbell (1889–1986), a specialist in children&#x27;s diseases, was responsible in 1951 for proving the link between retrolental fibroplasia (a blindness in premature babies) and oxygen levels in humidicribs.

Notable people diagnosed with the disease include soul musician Stevie Wonder, actor Tom Sullivan, pianist Derek Paravicini, jazz singer Diane Schuur, and singer Gilbert Montagné. The first case of the epidemic was seen on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1941 when a premature baby in Boston was diagnosed. Cases were then seen all over the world and the cause was, at that point, unknown. By 1951 a clear link between incidence and affluence became clear: many cases were seen in developed countries with organized and well-funded health care. Two British scientists suggested that it was oxygen toxicity that caused the disease. Babies born prematurely in such affluent areas were treated in incubators which had artificially high levels of oxygen. Studies on rats made this cause seem more likely, but the link was eventually confirmed by a controversial study undertaken by American pediatricians. The study involved two groups of babies. Some were given the usual oxygen concentrations in their incubators, while the other group had &quot;curtailed&quot; oxygen levels. The latter group was shown to have a lower incidence of the disease. As a result, oxygen levels in incubators were lowered and consequently, the epidemic was halted.

<text>Lord Fairfax of Cameron is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. Despite holding a Scottish peerage, the Lords Fairfax of Cameron are members of an ancient Yorkshire family, of which the Fairfax baronets of The Holmes are members of another branch. From 1515 to about 1700 the family lived at Denton Hall.

==History==
Charles I created the title in 1627 for Sir Thomas Fairfax. He had represented Queen Elizabeth I on several diplomatic missions to James VI of Scotland and also sat as a Member of Parliament for several constituencies in the English Parliament.

Both his son Ferdinando, the second Lord, and grandson, Thomas, the third Lord, served as prominent military commanders in the cause of Parliament during the Civil War. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1671 the title passed to his first cousin, the fourth Lord. He was the son of Reverend Henry Fairfax, second son of the first Lord, and notably represented Yorkshire in the House of Commons. His son, the fifth Lord, sat as a Member of Parliament for Malton and Yorkshire.

He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Lord. He inherited substantial estates in Virginia through his mother, the daughter of Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper, Governor of Virginia. On his death the title and American estates passed to his younger brother, the seventh Lord. He represented Maidstone and Kent in Parliament. The immense American estates were confiscated during the American War of Independence. He was awarded £13,758 in 1792, by Act of Parliament for the relief of American Loyalists. He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the eighth Lord, Rev. Bryan Fairfax who also lived in Virginia. He was the grandson of Reverend Henry Fairfax, second son of the fourth Lord. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1800 that he was confirmed in the title by the House of Lords.

His great-great-grandson was Albert Kirby Fairfax, the twelfth Lord, who lived in Maryland in the United States. His branch of the family had lived in America for several generations and had essentially forgotten about the title. However, it was then discovered that Albert was the rightful heir to the lordship and in 1908 he was confirmed in the title by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. In 1917 he was elected a Scottish representative peer, which he remained until his death in 1939.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the thirteenth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1945 to 1963 and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) between 1954 and 1957 in the Conservative administrations of Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden. the title is held by his son, the fourteenth Lord, who succeeded in 1964.

<doc id="465176" wikidata="Q92892" url="?curid=465176" title="Chris McKinstry">
<text>Kenneth Christopher McKinstry (February 12, 1967 – January 23, 2006) was a Canadian researcher in artificial intelligence. He led the development of the MISTIC project which was launched in May 1996. He founded the Mindpixel project in July 2000, and closed it in December 2005. McKinstry&#x27;s AI work and similar early death dovetailed with another contemporary AI researcher, Push Singh and his MIT Open Mind Common Sense Project.

==Life==
McKinstry was a Canadian citizen. Born in Winnipeg, he resided several years in Chile. From 1999, he lived in Antofagasta as a VLT operator for the European Southern Observatory. At the end of 2004, he moved back to Santiago, Chile. Suffering from bipolar disorder, McKinstry had an armed standoff with police in Toronto in 1990, with it lasting 7 1/2 hours. It ultimately concluded with McKinstry being hit with tear gas, but ending with no casualties 

In February 1997, Chris McKinstry started an online soap opera, &quot;CR6&quot;. According to journalist Bartley Kives, around 700 people auditioned for the show, which only lasted for two months, before McKinstry left Winnipeg with &quot;estimated debts in excess of $100,000&quot;. McKinstry later claimed to have lost $1 million in the CR6 failure, and the many people he recruited to build the soap opera, including photographers, writers, a director, and several prominent businesses, never received any of the money owed to them for their work.

Before his death, McKinstry designed an experiment with two cognitive scientists to study the dynamics of thought processes using data from his Mindpixel project. This work was later published in &quot;Psychological Science&quot; in its January 2008 issue, with McKinstry as posthumous first author.
=== Mental health ===
Chris McKinstry had a long struggle with his mental health, with him admitting to being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. McKinstry, as a result, suffered from frequent suicidal thoughts and a long-standing depression, discussing it in his suicide note. In his teen years, McKinstry had attempted suicide, intentionally overdosing on drugs, another issue McKinstry struggled with. His bipolar disorder is often attributed to the reason for his standoff in 1990.

==Death==
Chris McKinstry was found dead in his apartment on January 23, 2006, with a plastic bag over his head, connected to the stove gas line with a hose. He was found to have posted a suicide note online. McKinstry wrote, &quot;I am tired of feeling the same feelings and experiencing the same experiences. It is time to move on and see what is next if anything...This Louis Vuitton, Prada, Montblanc commercial universe is not for me. If only I was loved as much a Montblanc pen...&quot;&#x27;

There was some public note of the similarity between the suicide of Chris McKinstry and that of Push Singh, another AI researcher, a little over a month later. Both of their AI projects, McKinstry&#x27;s Mindpixel project and Singh&#x27;s MIT-backed Open Mind Common Sense, had similar trajectories over the last six years.

==In media==
McKinstry is the subject of a 2010 documentary called &quot;The Man Behind the Curtain&quot; directed by Michael Beach Nichols and Joshua Woltermann which recounts his innovative work and his struggle with mental health issues.

<text>Lord Polwarth, of Polwarth in the County of Berwick, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1690 for Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth, 2nd Baronet, Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1696 to 1702 (the baronetcy had been created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1637 for his father and namesake Patrick Hume). In 1697 he was further created Lord Polwarth, of Polwarth, Redbraes and Greenlaw, Viscount of Blasonberrie and Earl of Marchmont, also in the Peerage of Scotland. Upon the death of his grandson, the third Earl, the creations of 1697 became dormant (unclaimed).

The claim to the lordship of 1690 was vested in his granddaughter, Anne Anstruther-Paterson (&quot;de jure&quot; 4th Lady Polwarth), daughter of Lady Anne Hume-Campbell, eldest daughter of the third Earl. However, she died before any decision on her claim to the peerage had been reached. On her death the claim to the title passed to her aunt Diana Scott (&quot;de jure&quot; 5th Lady Polwarth), youngest daughter of the third Earl, and then to her son Hugh Hepburne-Scott. In 1835, Hugh&#x27;s claim to the peerage was allowed by the House of Lords. His son, the seventh Lord, was a Scottish representative peer from 1843 to 1867, and like his son, the eighth Lord, served as Lord Lieutenant of Selkirkshire. The latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the tenth Lord, was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1945 to 1963, Governor of the Bank of Scotland from 1966 to 1972, and served in the Conservative administration of Edward Heath, as a Minister of State at the Scottish Office, from 1972 to 1974. , the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the eleventh Lord, who succeeded in 2005.

The heirs apparent to the Earls of Marchmont used the courtesy title Lord Polwarth.

The family seat now is Harden House, near Hawick, Roxburghshire. The former seat was Marchmont House, near Polwarth, Berwickshire. The other titles associated with the earldom derive from Greenlaw, four miles southwest of Polwarth, Redbraes Castle, the remains of which are immediately to the east of Marchmont House, and Blasonberry, which was located on the farm of Broomhill on the west bank of the Blackadder Water, quarter of a mile north of Greenlaw.

<doc id="465178" wikidata="Q313229" url="?curid=465178" title="Jehoash of Judah">
<text>Jehoash (; ; ), also known as Joash (in King James Version), Joas (in Douay–Rheims) or Joás (), was the eighth king of Judah, and the sole surviving son of Ahaziah after the massacre of the royal family ordered by his grandmother, Athaliah. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba. Jehoash was 7 years old when he ascended to the throne, reigning for 40 years. (2 Kings 12:1, 2 Chronicles 24:1) He was succeeded by his son, Amaziah of Judah. He is said to have been righteous &quot;all the days of Jehoiada the priest&quot; () but to have deviated from fidelity to Yahweh after Jehoiada&#x27;s death ().

William F. Albright has dated his reign to 837–800 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 835–796 BCE.

==Early life==

According to the Hebrew Bible, following the death of his father, Ahaziah, Jehoash was spared from the rampages of Ahaziah&#x27;s mother, Athaliah, by Jehoash&#x27;s paternal aunt, Jehosheba, who was married to the high priest, Jehoiada. After hiding him in the Temple for seven years, Jehoiada had Jehoash crowned and anointed king in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Athaliah, who had usurped the Throne of David. Athaliah was killed during the coup.

After Jehoash was crowned, the covenant was renewed between God, the king, and the nation. The Tyrian cult of Baal, which was introduced under Jehoram and strengthened under Athaliah, was suppressed. Mattan, the priest of Baal, was killed as altars to Baal were destroyed. For the first time in Judah&#x27;s history, the Temple in Jerusalem and its priesthood achieved national importance.
==Achievements==
According to the accounts in 2 Kings 12, Jehoash directed that the money paid by worshippers at the Temple should be used to fund its repair. By the 23rd year of his reign, he was aware that the priests had failed to implement a restoration program, and so he made his own arrangements, funded by popular contributions, to restore the temple to its original condition and further strengthen it. The account in 2 Chronicles 24 follows the account in 2 Kings 12, but adds the detail that it was &quot;as a form of taxation, similar to the tax collected in the desert in connection with the tabernacle&quot;. At the instigation of Jehoiada, King Joash undertook the restoration of the Temple. The Work was completed so expeditiously that one living at the time the Temple was erected by Solomon was permitted to see the new structure shortly before his death. This good fortune befell Jehoiada himself, the son of Beniah, commander-in-chief of the army Under Solomon.

==Later life and death==
So long as Jehoash continued under the tutelage of Jehoiada, he was a pious king; Jehoash listened to the princes of Judah instead of the priests. This led him to abandon worshipping Yahweh and turning instead to idols and the Asherim as previous kings of Israel did. 2 Chronicles 24 narrates how Jehoash son-in-law the prophet Zechariah, Jehoiada&#x27;s son and successor, rebuked them for forsaking God, which resulted in Jehoash ordering his execution by stoning. The author of the Books of Chronicles criticizes this cruel act strongly. &quot;Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The look upon it, and require it&quot;. The author also attributes Jehoash&#x27;s deeds to the oppression suffered at the hands of Aramean invaders as God&#x27;s judgment.

According to the account in 2 Kings 12, when King Hazael of Syria marched on Jerusalem, Jehoash surrendered all the gold of the royal and sacred treasuries, thereby persuading him to call off his attack, but according to the account in 2 Chronicles, the Syrian army &quot;destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus&quot;, &quot;execut[ing] judgment against Joash&quot; and leaving him severely wounded.

Jehoash was eventually assassinated by his own servants at Beth Millo, and his assassination is portrayed as an act of revenge for the blood of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada. Jehoash was buried together with his fathers in the City of David, although he was &quot;not (buried) in the sepulchres of the kings&quot;. He was succeeded as king by his son Amaziah (אמציה),

The rabbis of the Talmud declared, based upon a rabbinic tradition, that Prophet Amoz was the brother of Amaziah, the king of Judah at that time (and, as a result, that Prophet Isaiah himself was a member of the royal family).

==In rabbinic literature==

The extermination of the male descendants of David was considered divine retribution for his responsibility in the extermination of the priests by Saul, who had commanded his servant Doeg the Edomite to perform this task (comp. ). Jehoash escaped death because in the latter case one priest, Abiathar, survived (Sanh. 95b). The hiding-place of Jehoash was, according to R. Eleazar, one of the chambers behind the Holy of Holies; according to R. Samuel b. Naḥman, it was one of the upper chambers of the Temple (Cant. R. i. 66).

Although a king who is the son of a king need not be anointed, an exception was made in the case of Jehoash, as well as of Solomon and Jeoahaz, the succession of each of whom was contested. (Lev. R. x. 8) Particular mention is made of the crown placed on Joash&#x27;s head (), because it fitted exactly, signifying that he was qualified for kingship. (Ab. Zarah 44a)

==Jehoash Tablet==
In 2001, an unprovenanced inscription was published, known as the Jehoash Inscription or Temple Inscription, which appears to be a record of repairs made to Solomon&#x27;s Temple during Jehoash&#x27;s reign. The tablet consists of 15 lines of Hebrew text inscribed on a piece of tabular black stone. Following extensive scientific tests, the Israeli archaeological authorities declared it to be a forgery and attempted but failed to prosecute the perpetrator; a number of experts maintain that it is not a forgery.

==Chronological notes==
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jehoash, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of his accession to some time between Nisan 1 of 835 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same year. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 of 796 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of that same year. During his reign, the Judean court recorders were still using the non-accession system of measuring years that was adopted in the days of Jehoshaphat from the practice of the northern kingdom, whereby the king&#x27;s first partial year in office was counted as his first year of reign.

== Christian texts ==
The Gospel of Matthew does not list Jehoash of Judah in the genealogy of Jesus, Jehoash being one of four kings of Judah so omitted, the other three being Ahaziah, Amaziah, and Jehoiakim.

<doc id="465179" wikidata="Q495423" url="?curid=465179" title="Lapilli">
<text>Lapilli (: lapillus) is a size classification of tephra, which is material that falls out of the air during a volcanic eruption or during some meteorite impacts. &quot;Lapilli&quot; is Latin for &quot;little stones&quot;.

By definition lapilli range from in diameter. A pyroclastic particle greater than 64 mm in diameter is known as a volcanic bomb when molten, or a volcanic block when solid. Pyroclastic material with particles less than 2 mm in diameter is referred to as volcanic ash.

==Formation==
Lapilli are spheroid-, teardrop-, dumbbell- or button-shaped droplets of molten or semi-molten lava ejected from a volcanic eruption that fall to earth while still at least partially molten. These granules are the direct result of liquid rock cooling as it travels through the air.

Lapilli tuffs are a very common form of volcanic rock typical of rhyolite, andesite and dacite pyroclastic eruptions, where thick layers of lapilli can be deposited during a basal surge eruption. Most lapilli tuffs which remain in ancient terrains are formed by the accumulation and &quot;welding&quot; of semi-molten lapilli into what is known as a welded tuff.

The heat of the newly deposited volcanic pile tends to cause the semi-molten material to flatten out and then become welded. Welded tuff textures are distinctive (termed &quot;eutaxitic&quot;), with flattened lapilli, fiamme, blocks and bombs forming oblate to discus-shaped forms within layers. These rocks are quite indurated and tough, as opposed to non-welded lapilli tuffs, which are unconsolidated and easily eroded.

===Accretionary lapilli===

Rounded balls of tephra are called &quot;accretionary lapilli&quot; if they consist of layered volcanic ash particles. Accretionary lapilli are formed by a process of wet ash aggregation due to moisture in volcanic clouds that sticks the particles together, with the volcanic ash nucleating on some object and then accreting to it in layers before the accretionary lapillus falls from the cloud. Accretionary lapilli are like volcanic hailstones that form by the addition of concentric layers of moist ash around a central nucleus.

This texture can be confused with spherulitic and axiolitic texture.

====Armoured (or cored) lapilli====
These lapilli are a variety of accretionary lapilli, though they contain lithic or crystal cores coated by rinds of coarse to fine ash. Armoured lapilli only form in hydroclastic eruptions, where significant moisture is present. The vapour column contains cohesive ash which sticks to particles within it.

<text>The 2004 election to the post of Mayor of London took place on 10 June 2004. It was being held on the same day as other local elections and the UK part of the 2004 European Parliament elections, so Londoners had a total of five votes on three ballot papers. Polling opened at 07:00 local time, and closed at 22:00. See: 2004 UK elections. The Supplementary Vote system was used.

Ken Livingstone gained the Labour party&#x27;s nomination on 2 January 2004, three weeks after being re-admitted to the Labour Party, after deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron, the previous candidate-elect, stepped down in favour of Livingstone.

==Candidate selection==
===Labour===
===Conservatives===

===Liberal Democrats===
On 5 March 2003, Simon Hughes, MP for North Southwark and Bermondsey and Frontbench Spokesman for Home Affairs was selected as the Liberal Democrats candidate over Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrats 2000 candidate for the mayorship and the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Richmond Park, and environmentalist Donnachadh McCarthy.

==Potential candidates==
London-born comedian Lee Hurst seriously considered standing as a candidate in the election. His comedy club had been under threat of redevelopment, and this had re-ignited a spark of political ambition. His manifesto would probably have included policies such as scrapping bus lanes and the congestion charge, improving public transport (including the re-introduction of bus conductors and AEC Routemaster buses), and tackling crime and abandoned cars.

== Results ==









*Turnout: 1,920,560 (36.95% - 2.55%)
*Electorate: 5,197,792
*As the ballot papers are counted electronically, totals for all second preferences are available, even though most did not contribute to the final result.

<doc id="465181" wikidata="Q5227893" url="?curid=465181" title="Daugherty Report">
<text>Learning pathways through statutory assessment: Key Stages 2 and 3, also known as the Daugherty Report is a government review of the educational assessment system for Key Stages 2 and 3 (11- and 14-year-olds) in Wales. The review was commissioned by Jane Davidson of the National Assembly for Wales in June 2003 and undertaken by a group led by Professor Richard Daugherty from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.

The group were given the task of reviewing the nature and suitability of the national statutory assessments, looking in particular at the timing of the tests, and what uses the resulting data are put to. The impact of the tests on the primary to secondary transition was also investigated.

The interim report, released on 22 January 2004, was perceived by the media as supporting a complete abolishment of the statutory tests at both Key Stages 2 and 3. The report suggested that 10-year-old pupils (year 5) should take aptitude tests. The aim of these should be to inform teaching in year 6, and later in secondary school, whilst noting that the results of these could be collected for monitoring purposes. It also recommended that teacher assessments at the end of year 6 remain compulsory.

At Key Stage 3, the interim report suggested that the current assessment system be phased out after three years, and replaced with assessments at the end of year 8 or beginning of year 9. Over this three years, a system for moderation of teacher assessments would be developed. It would be up to secondary schools to ensure that consistent teacher assessments had occurred in their feeder schools.

Inter-country monitoring would be achieved by using a sample of attainments linked to the OECD&#x27;s Programme for International Student Assessment. The report also noted the importance of developing formative assessment practices.

The review group has worked closely with ACCAC, who are also undertaking an assessment review due for release in April 2004, the same time as the final Daugherty Report is published.

<doc id="465183" wikidata="Q2585724" url="?curid=465183" title="Educational assessment">
<text>Educational assessment or educational evaluation is the systematic process of documenting and using empirical data on the knowledge, skill, attitudes, aptitude and beliefs to refine programs and improve student learning. Assessment data can be obtained by examining student work directly to assess the achievement of learning outcomes or it is based on data from which one can make inferences about learning. Assessment is often used interchangeably with test but is not limited to tests. Assessment can focus on the individual learner, the learning community (class, workshop, or other organized group of learners), a course, an academic program, the institution, or the educational system as a whole (also known as granularity). The word &quot;assessment&quot; came into use in an educational context after the Second World War.

As a continuous process, assessment establishes measurable student learning outcomes, provides a sufficient amount of learning opportunities to achieve these outcomes, implements a systematic way of gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student learning matches expectations, and uses the collected information to give feedback on the improvement of students&#x27; learning. Assessment is an important aspect of educational process which determines the level of accomplishments of students.

The final purpose of assessment practices in education depends on the &quot;theoretical framework&quot; of the practitioners and researchers, their assumptions and beliefs about the nature of human mind, the origin of knowledge, and the process of learning.

==Types==
The term &quot;assessment&quot; is generally used to refer to all activities teachers use to help students learn and to gauge student progress. Assessment can be divided for the sake of convenience using the following categorizations:
# Placement, formative, summative and diagnostic assessment
# Objective and subjective
# Referencing (criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, and ipsative (forced-choice))
# Informal and formal
# Internal and external

===Placement, formative, summative and diagnostic===
Assessment is often divided into initial, formative, and summative categories for the purpose of considering different objectives for assessment practices.

(1) Placement assessment – Placement evaluation may be used to place students according to prior achievement or level of knowledge, or personal characteristics, at the most appropriate point in an instructional sequence, in a unique instructional strategy, or with a suitable teacher conducted through placement testing, i.e. the tests that colleges and universities use to assess college readiness and place students into their initial classes. Placement evaluation, also referred to as pre-assessment, initial assessment, or threshold knowledge test (TKT), is conducted before instruction or intervention to establish a baseline from which individual student growth can be measured. This type of assessment is used to know what the student&#x27;s skill level is about the subject, it can also help the teacher to explain the material more efficiently. These assessments are generally not graded.

(2) Formative assessment – This is generally carried out throughout a course or project. It is also referred to as &quot;educative assessment,&quot; which is used to help learning. In an educational setting, a formative assessment might be a teacher (or peer) or the learner (e.g., through a self-assessment), providing feedback on a student&#x27;s work and would not necessarily be used for grading purposes. Formative assessments can take the form of diagnostic, standardized tests, quizzes, oral questions, or draft work. Formative assessments are carried out concurrently with instructions and the results may count. The formative assessments aim is to see if the students understand the instruction before doing a summative assessment.

(3) Summative assessment – This is generally carried out at the end of a course or project. In an educational setting, summative assessments are typically used to assign students a course grade, and are evaluative. Summative assessments are made to summarize what the students have learned in order to know whether they understand the subject matter well. This type of assessment is typically graded (e.g. pass/fail, 0–100) and can take the form of tests, exams or projects. Summative assessments are basically used to determine whether a student has passed or failed a class. A criticism of summative assessments is that they are reductive, and learners discover how well they have acquired knowledge too late for it to be of use.

(4) Diagnostic assessment – At the end, diagnostic assessment focuses on the whole difficulties that occurred during the learning process.

Jay McTighe and Ken O&#x27;Connor proposed seven practices to effective learning. One of them is about showing the criteria of the evaluation before the test and another the importance of pre-assessment to know what the skill levels of a student are before giving instructions. Giving a lot of feedback and encouragements are other practices.

Educational researcher Robert Stake explains the difference between formative and summative assessment with the following analogy: 

Summative and formative assessment are often referred to in a learning context as &quot;assessment of learning&quot; and &quot;assessment for learning&quot; respectively. Assessment of learning is generally summative in nature and intended to measure learning outcomes and report those outcomes to students, parents and administrators. Assessment of learning mostly occurs at the conclusion of a class, course, semester or academic year while assessment for learning is generally formative in nature and is used by teachers to consider approaches to teaching and next steps for individual learners and the class.

A common form of formative assessment is &quot;diagnostic assessment&quot;. Diagnostic assessment measures a student&#x27;s current knowledge and skills for the purpose of identifying a suitable program of learning. &quot;Self-assessment&quot; is a form of diagnostic assessment which involves students assessing themselves.

&quot;Forward-looking assessment&quot; asks those being assessed to consider themselves in hypothetical future situations.

&quot;Performance-based assessment&quot; is similar to summative assessment, as it focuses on achievement. It is often aligned with the standards-based education reform and outcomes-based education movement. Though ideally, they are significantly different from a traditional multiple choice test, they are most commonly associated with standards-based assessment which use free-form responses to standard questions scored by human scorers on a standards-based scale, meeting, falling below or exceeding a performance standard rather than being ranked on a curve. A well-defined task is identified and students are asked to create, produce or do something often in settings that involve real-world application of knowledge and skills. Proficiency is demonstrated by providing an extended response. Performance formats are further classified into products and performances. The performance may result in a product, such as a painting, portfolio, paper or exhibition, or it may consist of a performance, such as a speech, athletic skill, musical recital or reading.

===Objective and subjective===
Assessment (either summative or formative) is often categorized as either objective or subjective. Objective assessment is a form of questioning which has a single correct answer. Subjective assessment is a form of questioning which may have more than one correct answer (or more than one way of expressing the correct answer). There are various types of objective and subjective questions. Objective question types include true/false answers, multiple choice, multiple-response and matching questions while Subjective questions include extended-response questions and essays. Objective assessment is well suited to the increasingly popular computerized or online assessment format.

Some have argued that the distinction between objective and subjective assessments is neither useful nor accurate because, in reality, there is no such thing as &quot;objective&quot; assessment. In fact, all assessments are created with inherent biases built into decisions about relevant subject matter and content, as well as cultural (class, ethnic, and gender) biases.

===Basis of comparison===
Test results can be compared against an established criterion, or against the performance of other students, or against previous performance:

(5)&quot;Criterion-referenced assessment&quot;, typically using a criterion-referenced test, as the name implies, occurs when candidates are measured against defined (and objective) criteria. Criterion-referenced assessment is often but not always used to establish a person&#x27;s competence (whether he/she can do something). The best-known example of criterion-referenced assessment is the driving test when learner drivers are measured against a range of explicit criteria (such as &quot;Not endangering other road users&quot;).

(6)&quot;Norm-referenced assessment&quot; (colloquially known as &quot;grading on the curve&quot;), typically using a norm-referenced test, is not measured against defined criteria. This type of assessment is relative to the student body undertaking the assessment, It is effectively a way of comparing students. The IQ test is the best-known example of norm-referenced assessment. Many entrance tests (to prestigious schools or universities) are norm-referenced, permitting a fixed proportion of students to pass (&quot;passing&quot; in this context means being accepted into the school or university rather than an explicit level of ability). This means that standards may vary from year to year depending on the quality of the cohort; criterion-referenced assessment does not vary from year to year (unless the criteria change).

(7)&quot;Ipsative assessment&quot; is self-comparison either in the same domain over time, or comparative to other domains within the same student.

===Informal and formal===
Assessment can be either &quot;formal&quot; or &quot;informal&quot;. Formal assessment usually implies a written document, such as a test, quiz, or paper. A formal assessment is given a numerical score or grade based on student performance, whereas an informal assessment does not contribute to a student&#x27;s final grade. An informal assessment usually occurs in a more casual manner and may include observation, inventories, checklists, rating scales, rubrics, performance and portfolio assessments, participation, peer and self-evaluation, and discussion.

===Internal and external===
Internal assessment is set and marked by the school (i.e. teachers), students get the mark and feedback regarding the assessment. External assessment is set by the governing body, and is marked by non-biased personnel, some external assessments give much more limited feedback in their marking. However, in tests such as Australia&#x27;s NAPLAN, the criterion addressed by students is given detailed feedback in order for their teachers to address and compare the student&#x27;s learning achievements and also to plan for the future.

==Standards of quality==
In general, high-quality assessments are considered those with a high level of reliability and validity. Other general principles are practicality, authenticity and washback.

===Reliability===
Reliability relates to the consistency of an assessment. A reliable assessment is one that consistently achieves the same results with the same (or similar) cohort of students. Various factors affect reliability—including ambiguous questions, too many options within a question paper, vague marking instructions and poorly trained markers. Traditionally, the reliability of an assessment is based on the following:
# Temporal stability: Performance on a test is comparable on two or more separate occasions.
# Form equivalence: Performance among examinees is equivalent on different forms of a test based on the same content.
# Internal consistency: Responses on a test are consistent across questions. For example: In a survey that asks respondents to rate attitudes toward technology, consistency would be expected in responses to the following questions:
#* &quot;I feel very negative about computers in general.&quot;
#* &quot;I enjoy using computers.&quot;

The reliability of a measurement x can also be defined quantitatively as:
formula_1 where formula_2 is the reliability in the observed (test) score, x; 
formula_3 and formula_4 are the variability in &#x27;true&#x27; (i.e., candidate&#x27;s innate performance) and measured test scores respectively. formula_2 can range from 0 (completely unreliable), to 1 (completely reliable).

There are four types of reliability: student-related which can be personal problems, sickness, or fatigue, rater-related which includes bias and subjectivity, test administration-related which is the conditions of test taking process, test-related which is basically related to the nature of a test.

===Validity===
Valid assessment is one that measures what it is intended to measure. For example, it would not be valid to assess driving skills through a written test alone. A more valid way of assessing driving skills would be through a combination of tests that help determine what a driver knows, such as through a written test of driving knowledge, and what a driver is able to do, such as through a performance assessment of actual driving. Teachers frequently complain that some examinations do not properly assess the syllabus upon which the examination is based; they are, effectively, questioning the validity of the exam.
Validity of an assessment is generally gauged through examination of evidence in the following categories:
# Content validity – Does the content of the test measure stated objectives?
# Criterion validity – Do scores correlate to an outside reference? (ex: Do high scores on a 4th grade reading test accurately predict reading skill in future grades?)
# Construct validity – Does the assessment correspond to other significant variables? (ex: Do ESL students consistently perform differently on a writing exam than native English speakers?)

Others are:
* consequential validity
* face validity

A good assessment has both validity and reliability, plus the other quality attributes noted above for a specific context and purpose. In practice, an assessment is rarely totally valid or totally reliable. A ruler which is marked wrongly will always give the same (wrong) measurements. It is very reliable, but not very valid. Asking random individuals to tell the time without looking at a clock or watch is sometimes used as an example of an assessment which is valid, but not reliable. The answers will vary between individuals, but the average answer is probably close to the actual time. In many fields, such as medical research, educational testing, and psychology, there will often be a trade-off between reliability and validity. A history test written for high validity will have many essay and fill-in-the-blank questions. It will be a good measure of mastery of the subject, but difficult to score completely accurately. A history test written for high reliability will be entirely multiple choice. It isn&#x27;t as good at measuring knowledge of history, but can easily be scored with great precision. We may generalize from this. The more reliable our estimate is of what we purport to measure, the less certain we are that we are actually measuring that aspect of attainment.

It is well to distinguish between &quot;subject-matter&quot; validity and &quot;predictive&quot; validity. The former, used widely in education, predicts the score a student would get on a similar test but with different questions. The latter, used widely in the workplace, predicts performance. Thus, a subject-matter-valid test of knowledge of driving rules is appropriate while a predictively valid test would assess whether the potential driver could follow those rules.

=== Practicality ===
This principle refers to the time and cost constraints during the construction and administration of an assessment instrument. Meaning that the test should be economical to provide. The format of the test should be simple to understand. Moreover, solving a test should remain within suitable time. It is generally simple to administer. Its assessment procedure should be particular and time-efficient.

=== Authenticity ===
The assessment instrument is authentic when it is contextualized, contains natural language and meaningful, relevant, and interesting topic, and replicates real world experiences.

=== Washback ===
This principle refers to the consequence of an assessment on teaching and learning within classrooms. Washback can be positive and negative. Positive washback refers to the desired effects of a test, while negative washback refers to the negative consequences of a test. In order to have positive washback, instructional planning can be used.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of evaluation, and in particular educational evaluation in North America, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has published three sets of standards for evaluations. The &quot;Personnel Evaluation Standards&quot; were published in 1988, &quot;The Program Evaluation Standards&quot; (2nd edition) were published in 1994, and &quot;The Student Evaluation Standards&quot; were published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

In the UK, an award in Training, Assessment and Quality Assurance (TAQA) is available to assist staff learn and develop good practice in relation to educational assessment in adult, further and work-based education and training contexts.

====Grade inflation====

Due to grade inflation, standardized tests can have higher validity than unstandardized exam scores. Recently increasing graduation rates can be partially attributed to grade inflation.

==Summary table of the main theoretical frameworks==

The following table summarizes the main &quot;theoretical frameworks&quot; behind almost all the theoretical and research work, and the instructional practices in education (one of them being, of course, the practice of assessment). These different frameworks have given rise to interesting debates among scholars.

==Controversy==
Concerns over how best to apply assessment practices across public school systems have largely focused on questions about the use of high-stakes testing and standardized tests, often used to gauge student progress, teacher quality, and school-, district-, or statewide educational success.

===No Child Left Behind===
For most researchers and practitioners, the question is not whether tests should be administered at all—there is a general consensus that, when administered in useful ways, tests can offer useful information about student progress and curriculum implementation, as well as offering formative uses for learners. The real issue, then, is whether testing practices as currently implemented can provide these services for educators and students.

President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) on January 8, 2002. The NCLB Act reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. President Johnson signed the ESEA to help fight the War on Poverty and helped fund elementary and secondary schools. President Johnson&#x27;s goal was to emphasize equal access to education and establish high standards and accountability. The NCLB Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade level.

In the U.S., the No Child Left Behind Act mandates standardized testing nationwide. These tests align with state curriculum and link teacher, student, district, and state accountability to the results of these tests. Proponents of NCLB argue that it offers a tangible method of gauging educational success, holding teachers and schools accountable for failing scores, and closing the achievement gap across class and ethnicity.

Opponents of standardized testing dispute these claims, arguing that holding educators accountable for test results leads to the practice of &quot;teaching to the test.&quot; Additionally, many argue that the focus on standardized testing encourages teachers to equip students with a narrow set of skills that enhance test performance without actually fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter or key principles within a knowledge domain.

===High-stakes testing===

The assessments which have caused much controversy in the U.S. are the use of high school graduation examinations, which are used to deny diplomas to students who have attended high school for four years, but cannot demonstrate that they have learned the required material when writing exams. Opponents say that no student who has put in four years of seat time should be denied a high school diploma merely for repeatedly failing a test, or even for not knowing the required material.

High-stakes tests have been blamed for causing sickness and test anxiety in students and teachers, and for teachers choosing to narrow the curriculum towards what the teacher believes will be tested. In an exercise designed to make children comfortable about testing, a Spokane, Washington newspaper published a picture of a monster that feeds on fear. The published image is purportedly the response of a student who was asked to draw a picture of what she thought of the state assessment.

Other critics, such as Washington State University&#x27;s Don Orlich, question the use of test items far beyond standard cognitive levels for students&#x27; age.

Compared to portfolio assessments, simple multiple-choice tests are much less expensive, less prone to disagreement between scorers, and can be scored quickly enough to be returned before the end of the school year. Standardized tests (all students take the same test under the same conditions) often use multiple-choice tests for these reasons. Orlich criticizes the use of expensive, holistically graded tests, rather than inexpensive multiple-choice &quot;bubble tests&quot;, to measure the quality of both the system and individuals for very large numbers of students. Other prominent critics of high-stakes testing include Fairtest and Alfie Kohn.

The use of IQ tests has been banned in some states for educational decisions, and norm-referenced tests, which rank students from &quot;best&quot; to &quot;worst&quot;, have been criticized for bias against minorities. Most education officials support criterion-referenced tests (each individual student&#x27;s score depends solely on whether he answered the questions correctly, regardless of whether his neighbors did better or worse) for making high-stakes decisions.

===21st century assessment===
It has been widely noted that with the emergence of social media and Web 2.0 technologies and mindsets, learning is increasingly collaborative and knowledge increasingly distributed across many members of a learning community. Traditional assessment practices, however, focus in large part on the individual and fail to account for knowledge-building and learning in context. As researchers in the field of assessment consider the cultural shifts that arise from the emergence of a more participatory culture, they will need to find new methods of applying assessments to learners.

=== Large-scale learning assessment ===
Large-scale learning assessments (LSLAs) are system-level assessments that provide a snapshot of learning achievement for a group of learners in a given year, and in a limited number of domains. They are often categorized as national or cross-national assessments and draw attention to issues related to levels of learning and determinants of learning, including teacher qualification; the quality of school environments; parental support and guidance; and social and emotional health in and outside schools.

===Assessment in a democratic school===
The Sudbury model of democratic education schools do not perform and do not offer assessments, evaluations, transcripts, or recommendations. They assert that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student&#x27;s right to privacy and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational assessment for the 21st century, they allege.

According to Sudbury schools, this policy does not cause harm to their students as they move on to life outside the school. However, they admit it makes the process more difficult, but that such hardship is part of the students learning to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their own goals.

The no-grading and no-rating policy helps to create an atmosphere free of competition among students or battles for adult approval, and encourages a positive cooperative environment amongst the student body.

The final stage of a Sudbury education, should the student choose to take it, is the graduation thesis. Each student writes on the topic of how they have prepared themselves for adulthood and entering the community at large. This thesis is submitted to the Assembly, who reviews it. The final stage of the thesis process is an oral defense given by the student in which they open the floor for questions, challenges and comments from all Assembly members. At the end, the Assembly votes by secret ballot on whether or not to award a diploma.

===Assessing ELL students===
A major concern with the use of educational assessments is the overall validity, accuracy, and fairness when it comes to assessing English language learners (ELL). The majority of assessments within the United States have normative standards based on the English-speaking culture, which does not adequately represent ELL populations. Consequently, it would in many cases be inaccurate and inappropriate to draw conclusions from ELL students&#x27; normative scores. Research shows that the majority of schools do not appropriately modify assessments in order to accommodate students from unique cultural backgrounds. This has resulted in the over-referral of ELL students to special education, causing them to be disproportionately represented in special education programs. Although some may see this inappropriate placement in special education as supportive and helpful, research has shown that inappropriately placed students actually regressed in progress.

It is often necessary to utilize the services of a translator in order to administer the assessment in an ELL student&#x27;s native language; however, there are several issues when translating assessment items. One issue is that translations can frequently suggest a correct or expected response, changing the difficulty of the assessment item. Additionally, the translation of assessment items can sometimes distort the original meaning of the item. Finally, many translators are not qualified or properly trained to work with ELL students in an assessment situation. All of these factors compromise the validity and fairness of assessments, making the results not reliable. Nonverbal assessments have shown to be less discriminatory for ELL students, however, some still present cultural biases within the assessment items.

When considering an ELL student for special education the assessment team should integrate and interpret all of the information collected in order to ensure a non biased conclusion. The decision should be based on multidimensional sources of data including teacher and parent interviews, as well as classroom observations. Decisions should take the students unique cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds into consideration, and should not be strictly based on assessment results.

===Universal screening===
Assessment can be associated with disparity when students from traditionally underrepresented groups are excluded from testing needed for access to certain programs or opportunities, as is the case for gifted programs. One way to combat this disparity is universal screening, which involves testing all students (such as for giftedness) instead of testing only some students based on teachers&#x27; or parents&#x27; recommendations. Universal screening results in large increases in traditionally underserved groups (such as Black, Hispanic, poor, female, and ELLs) identified for gifted programs, without the standards for identification being modified in any way.

<doc id="465186" wikidata="Q5326357" url="?curid=465186" title="Earl of Portarlington">
<text>Earl of Portarlington is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1785 for John Dawson, 2nd Viscount Carlow, who had earlier represented Portarlington in the Irish House of Commons. He was the son of William Dawson, 1st Viscount Carlow, who had represented Portarlington and Queen&#x27;s County in the Irish House of Commons, and had been created Baron Dawson, of Dawson&#x27;s Court in the Queen&#x27;s County, in 1770, and Viscount Carlow, in the County of Carlow, in 1776. These titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a Colonel in the 23rd Light Dragoons but disappeared the night before the Battle of Waterloo and thus missed the start of the battle. He then attached himself to the 18th Hussars, but after the battle was forced to resign his commission in disgrace, fell into dissipation and &#x27;died in an obscure London slum&#x27;.

He never married and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of Captain the Hon. Henry Dawson, second son of the first Earl, who had assumed by Sign Manual the additional surname of Damer on inheriting the large Milton Abbey estate in Dorset from his aunt Lady Caroline Damer. Lord Portarlington sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1855 to 1889.

On his death the titles passed to his cousin, the fourth Earl. He was the son of Colonel the Hon. George Dawson-Damer, third son of the first Earl. Lord Portarlington represented Portarlington in the House of Commons as a Conservative. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer from 1896 to 1900. the titles are held by his great-grandson, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his grandfather in 1959. He is the son of George Lionel Seymour Dawson-Damer, Viscount Carlow, proprietor of the Corvinus Press, who was killed in action in 1944.

The family seat is Gledswood House, near Melrose, Roxburghshire. The former family seat was Emo Court, near Emo, County Laois.

<doc id="465189" wikidata="Q2852702" url="?curid=465189" title="Whip antenna">
<text>A whip antenna is an antenna consisting of a straight flexible wire or rod. The bottom end of the whip is connected to the radio receiver or transmitter. A whip antenna is a form of monopole antenna. The antenna is designed to be flexible so that it does not break easily, and the name is derived from the whip-like motion that it exhibits when disturbed. Whip antennas for portable radios are often made of a series of interlocking telescoping metal tubes, so they can be retracted when not in use. Longer whips, made for mounting on vehicles and structures, are made of a flexible fiberglass rod around a wire core and can be up to long.

The length of a whip antenna is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with. Their length varies from compact electrically short antennas  wavelength long, up to   wavelength to improve directivity. The most common type is the &quot;quarter-wave whip&quot;, which is approximately long. 

Whips are the most common type of monopole antenna, and are used in the higher frequency HF, VHF and UHF radio bands. They are widely used as the antennas for hand-held radios, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, FM radios, boom boxes, and Wi-Fi enabled devices, and are attached to vehicles as the antennas for car radios and two-way radios for wheeled vehicles and for aircraft. Larger versions mounted on roofs, balconies and radio masts are used as base station antennas for amateur radio and police, fire, ambulance, taxi, and other vehicle dispatchers.

==Radiation pattern==

The whip antenna is a monopole antenna, and like a vertical dipole has an omnidirectional radiation pattern, radiating equal radio power in all azimuthal directions (perpendicular to the antenna&#x27;s axis), with the radiated power falling off with elevation angle to zero on the antenna&#x27;s axis. Whip antennas less than one-half wavelength long, including the common quarter wave whip, have a single main lobe, and with a perfectly conducting ground plane under it maximum field strength is in horizontal directions, falling monotonically to zero on the axis. With a small or imperfectly conducting ground plane or no ground plane under it, the general result is to tilt the main lobe up so maximum power is no longer radiated horizontally but at an angle into the sky.

Antennas longer than a half-wavelength have patterns consisting of several conical &quot;lobes&quot;; with radiation maxima at several elevation angles; the longer the electrical length of the antenna, the more lobes the pattern has.

A vertical whip radiates vertically polarized radio waves, with the electric field vertical and the magnetic field horizontal.

Vertical whip antennas are widely used for nondirectional radio communication on the surface of the Earth, where the direction to the transmitter (or the receiver) is unknown or constantly changing, for example in portable FM radio receivers, walkie-talkies, and two-way radios in vehicles. This is because they transmit (or receive) equally well in all horizontal directions, while radiating little radio energy up into the sky where it is wasted.

==Length==
Whip antennas are normally designed as resonant antennas; the rod acts as a resonator for radio waves, with standing waves of voltage and current reflected back and forth from its ends. Therefore, the length of the antenna rod is determined by the wavelength (formula_1) of the radio waves used. The most common length is approximately one-quarter of the wavelength (formula_2), called a &quot;quarter-wave whip&quot; (although often shortened by the use of a loading coil; see Electrically short whips below). For example, the common quarter-wave whip antennas used on FM radios in the USA are approximately long, which is roughly one-quarter the length of radio waves in the FM radio band, which are long.

Half-wave whips (formula_3 long) which have greater gain, and five-eighth wave whips (formula_4 long) which have the maximum horizontal gain achievable by a monopole, are also common lengths.

==Gain and radiation resistance==
The gain and input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the length of the whip element, compared to a wavelength, but also on the size and shape of the ground plane used (if any). A quarter wave vertical antenna working against a perfectly conducting, infinite ground will have a gain of 5.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of about 36.8 ohms. However this gain is never approached in actual antennas unless the ground plane is many wavelengths in diameter. 2 dBi is more typical for a whip with a ground plane of formula_5 Whips mounted on vehicles use the metal skin of the vehicle as a ground plane. In hand-held devices usually no explicit ground plane is provided, and the ground side of the antenna&#x27;s feed line is just connected to the ground (common) on the device&#x27;s circuit board. Therefore, the radio itself serves as a rudimentary ground plane. If the radio chassis is not a good deal larger than the antenna itself, the combination of whip and radio functions more as an asymmetrical dipole antenna than as a monopole antenna. The gain will be somewhat lower than a dipole, or a quarter-wave whip with an adequate size ground plane.

Whips not mounted on the radio itself are usually fed with coaxial cable feedline of 50 ohm or 75 ohm impedance. In transmitting antennas the impedance of the antenna must be matched to the feedline for maximum power transfer.

A half wave whip antenna (length of formula_3) has somewhat higher gain than a quarter wave whip, but it has a current node at its feedpoint at the base of the rod so it has very high input impedance. If it was infinitely thin the antenna would have an infinite input impedance, but the finite width gives typical, practical half wave whips an impedance of 800–1,500 ohms. These are usually fed through an impedance matching transformer or a quarter wave stub matching section (e.g. the J-pole antenna). An advantage is that because it acts as a dipole it does not need a ground plane.

The maximum horizontal gain of a monopole antenna is achieved at a length of five eighths of a wavelength formula_4 so this is also a popular length for whips. However at this length the radiation pattern is split into a horizontal lobe and a small second lobe at a 60° angle, so high angle radiation is poor. The input impedance is around 40 ohms.

== Ground plane antenna == 
In a whip antenna not mounted on a conductive surface, such as one mounted on a mast, the lack of reflected radio waves from the ground plane causes the lobe of the radiation pattern to be tilted up toward the sky so less power is radiated in horizontal directions, undesirable for terrestrial communication. Also the unbalanced impedance of the monopole element causes RF currents in the supporting mast and on the outside of the ground shield conductor of the coaxial feedline, causing these structures to radiate radio waves, which usually has a deleterious effect on the radiation pattern.

To prevent this, with stationary whips mounted on structures, an artificial &quot;ground plane&quot; consisting of three or four rods a quarter-wavelength long connected to the opposite side of the feedline, extending horizontally from the base of the whip, is often used. This is called a &quot;ground plane antenna&quot;. These few short wire elements serve to receive the displacement current from the driven element and return it to the ground conductor of the transmission line, making the antenna behave somewhat as if it has a continuous conducting plane under it.

The radiation resistance of a quarter wave ground plane antenna with horizontal ground wires is around 22 ohms, a poor match to coaxial cable feedline, and the main lobe of the radiation pattern is still tilted up toward the sky. Often &quot;(see pictures)&quot; the ground plane rods are sloped downward at a 45-degree angle, which has the effect of lowering the main lobe of the radiation pattern so more of the power is radiated in horizontal directions, and increases the input impedance for a good match to standard 50-ohm coaxial cable. To match 75-ohm coaxial cable, the ends of the ground plane can be turned downward or a folded monopole driven element can be used.
==Electrically short whips==
To reduce the length of a whip antenna to make it less cumbersome, an inductor (loading coil) is often added in series with it. This allows the antenna to be made much shorter than the normal length of a quarter-wavelength, and still be resonant, by cancelling out the capacitive reactance of the short antenna. This is called an electrically short whip. The coil is added at the base of the whip (called a base-loaded whip) or occasionally in the middle (center-loaded whip). In the most widely used form, the rubber ducky antenna, the loading coil is integrated with the antenna itself by making the whip out of a narrow helix of springy wire. The helix distributes the inductance along the antenna&#x27;s length, improving the radiation pattern, and also makes it more flexible. Another alternative occasionally used to shorten the antenna is to add a &quot;capacity hat&quot;, a metal screen or radiating wires, at the end. However all these electrically short whips have lower gain than a full-length quarter-wave whip.

Multi-band operation is possible with coils at about one-half or one-third and two-thirds that do not affect the aerial much at the lowest band, but it creates the effect of stacked dipoles at a higher band (usually ×2 or ×3 frequency).

At higher frequencies
the feed coax can go up the centre of a tube. The insulated junction of the tube and whip is fed from the coax and the lower tube end where coax cable enters has an insulated mount. This kind of vertical whip is a full dipole and thus needs no ground plane. It generally works better several wavelengths above ground, hence the limitation normally to microwave bands.

<doc id="465190" wikidata="Q3836780" url="?curid=465190" title="Lord Reay">
<text>Lord Reay, of Reay in the County of Caithness, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. Lord Reay (pronounced &quot;ray&quot;) is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Mackay, whose lands in Strathnaver and northwest Sutherland were known as the Reay Country. The land was sold to the Earls of Sutherland in the 18th century. Lord Reay also refers to a legendary magician in Caithness folklore.

The title was created in 1628 for the soldier Sir Donald Mackay, 1st Baronet. He had already the year before been created a baronet, of Far, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. He was succeeded by his son, the second Lord, who fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. On the death of his great-grandson, the ninth Lord, the line of the eldest son of the second Lord failed. The late Lord was succeeded by his kinsman, the tenth Lord. He was the son of Barthold John Christian Mackay (who had been created &quot;Baron Mackay of Ophemert and Zennewijnen&quot; in the Netherlands in 1822), great-grandson of Hon. Aeneas Mackay, a Brigadier-General in the Dutch army and the second son of the second Lord. Lord Reay was a Dutch citizen and served as a government minister in the Netherlands. His son, the eleventh Lord, became a British citizen in 1877 and four years later he was created Baron Reay, of Durness in the County of Sutherland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Reay was later Governor of Bombay, Under-Secretary of State for India in the Liberal administration of Lord Rosebery and Lord Lieutenant of Roxburghshire.

On his death the UK Barony became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his cousin, the twelfth Lord. He was the son of Baron Aeneas Mackay (1838–1909) (a Dutch politician who had been created &quot;Baron Mackay&quot; in the Netherlands in 1858 and who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1888 until 1891), son of Johan Francois Hendrik Jakob Ernestus Mackay, brother of the tenth Lord Reay. He was also a Dutch citizen. However, his son, the thirteenth Lord (and at 6&#x27;9&quot; was nicknamed &quot;the tallest peer&quot;), became a British citizen in 1938 and later sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. His only son, the fourteenth Lord, was a Member of the European Parliament and also served in junior positions in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He was one of the ninety-two elected hereditary peers allowed to remain after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999. the titles are held by his son, the fifteenth Lord, who in that year was also elected to serve in the House.

The family seat now is Ophemert Castle, near Tiel, Gelderland, in Netherlands.

==Lord Reay in Caithness folklore==
In the folklore of Caithness, in the Highland area of Scotland, &quot;Lord Reay&quot; is a magician who believed he had come off best in an encounter with a witch in Smoo Cave. His prize was a gang of fairies who liked nothing better than to work. The construction of various earthworks in the parish of Reay are attributed to these fairies, working under direction from Lord Reay.

However, the fairies&#x27; appetite for work was insatiable and, eventually, their demands became intolerable. So Lord Reay put them to work building a causeway of sand across the Pentland Firth where, of course, the fierce currents wash away the sand just as fast as the fairies can build.

<doc id="465194" wikidata="Q581138" url="?curid=465194" title="Guy Montag">
<text>Guy Montag is a fictional character and the protagonist in Ray Bradbury&#x27;s dystopia novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953). He is depicted living in a futuristic town where he works as a &quot;fireman&quot; whose job is to burn books and the buildings they are found in.

==Role in plot==
At the opening of the novel, he is happy in his work destroying books and never wonders about his role as a tool of thought suppression. Several events cause him to question his own existence: 
* First, he meets Clarisse McClellan, a 17-year-old, while walking home from work. His talks with her are thought-provoking and assuage Montag&#x27;s loneliness. Her death spurs him into becoming a radical.
* Second, he discovers that his wife, who prefers watching &quot;The Family&quot;, her favorite program on television or the parlor walls, and radio on &quot;seashell earbuds&quot; to human interaction, has overdosed on sleeping pills. The callous behavior of the paramedics makes him feel very alienated, while his wife&#x27;s emptiness disturbs and angers him.
* Third, he has a call to go to a house owned by an old woman who hid away a library of books. Rather than be led out of the house before it is burned, she decides to set the fire herself, and burns alive with her books.
* Fourth, he remembers a chance meeting he had one year previously with an old man in the park, who is later identified as an English professor. Montag, who has secretly been hiding books in his own house, eventually makes contact with this man, named Faber.

Over the course of the novel, Montag becomes increasingly disillusioned with the hedonistic, anti-intellectual society around him. Bradbury emphasizes that the U.S. government, in burning books, is merely expressing the will of a people whose short attention spans, indifference, and hedonism have gradually eroded any semblance of intellectualism from public life. Schools no longer teach the humanities, children are casually violent, and adults are constantly distracted by &quot;seashells&quot; (small audio devices resembling earbuds) and insipid television programs displayed on wall-sized screens. Authors and readers are regarded as pretentious and dangerous to the well-being of society. He meets many characters that change his outlook on life such as Clarisse and Faber.

After an incident where Montag tries to read a poem to his wife&#x27;s friends when they are visiting, his wife denounces their house as book-possessing. Montag&#x27;s fire chief, Beatty, tries to persuade him that books are evil, and urges him to return to the unthinking fireman mentality, but Montag refuses.

After the firehouse receives an alert, Beatty drives the fire truck to the location, which is Montag&#x27;s house. Beatty forces Montag to set fire to his own house. After Montag is finished, Beatty confronts Montag and discovers the device he uses to communicate with Faber. After Beatty vows to track down who was on the other line, Montag turns the fire hose on Beatty and burns him to death.

He flees through the city streets to Faber&#x27;s house, with another firehouse&#x27;s mechanical hound and television network helicopters in hot pursuit. When he arrives at Faber&#x27;s home, the old man tells Montag of vagabond book-lovers in the countryside. Montag then escapes to a local river, floats downstream and meets a group of older men who, to Montag&#x27;s astonishment, have memorized entire books, preserving them orally until the law against books is overturned. The war begins. Montag watches helplessly as jet bombers fly overhead and attack the city with nuclear weapons.

==In other media==
Montag&#x27;s fate is expanded on in the semi-canonical 1984 video game &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, which acts as a sequel to the novel. In the game, Montag has continued to evade and resist the Firemen for over five years after the end of the novel and is sent on a mission to break into New York Library and transmit its microcassette archive to the Underground. He succeeds and reunites with Clarisse (who is alive in this version) during the process; however, the Firemen storm the building and immolate them both.

In the 1995 Strategy game StarCraft, a firebat hero is named Gui Montag.

==Historical notes==
* Montag is portrayed by Oskar Werner in the 1966 film version.
* Montag is portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in the 2018 television film version.
* In the afterword of the 2003 fiftieth anniversary edition of the book, Bradbury states that only upon later reflection of his work did he realize he had subconsciously named Montag after a paper company, making him the counterpart to Faber, which is also the name of a pencil manufacturer.

He was the 12th king of Israel and reigned for 16 years. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 801–786 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 798–782 BC. When he ascended the throne, the Kingdom of Israel was suffering from the predations of the Arameans, whose king Hazael was conquering land controlled by Israel.

==Biblical account of his reign==
According to the second book of Kings, Jehoash was sinful and did evil in the eyes of Yahweh for tolerating the worship of the golden calves, yet outwardly at least he worshiped Yahweh. He reigned as king of Israel for 16 years and led the Israelites through some decisive battles, including a war with the kingdom of Judah.

Jehoash went to visit the prophet Elisha, who was sick with the illness that would eventually lead to his death. He held the prophet Elisha in honor, and wept by his bedside while he was dying. Jehoash pleased Elisha, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: &quot;O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof.&quot; When Jehoash failed to completely obey Elisha&#x27;s instructions, Elisha predicted that Jehoash would only defeat the Arameans three times rather than five or six times, which may have been enough to end the Syrian threat. In three signal and successive victories Jehoash overcame the Syrians, and retook from them the towns which Hazael had captured from Israel.

===War with Judah===

Later in his reign, Jehoash led the men of the Kingdom of Israel in the defeat of king Amaziah of Judah. Amaziah had begun to worship some of the idols he had taken from the Edomites, which the author of Chronicles believes led to his ruin and his defeat by Jehoash, whom he had challenged to battle.

Jehoash had warned Amaziah, saying: &quot;A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, &#x27;Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&#x27; Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?&quot;

Jehoash utterly defeated Amaziah at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia. Jehoash then advanced on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the Temple and the palace. Jehoash took Amaziah as a prisoner. Amaziah&#x27;s defeat was followed by a conspiracy that took his life. Jehoash also took hostages to assure good conduct.

After the battle he soon died and was buried in Samaria.

==Archaeology==

The excavation at Tell al-Rimah yields a stele of Adad-nirari III which mentioned &quot;Jehoash the Samarian&quot; and contains the first cuneiform mention of Samaria by that name.

A postulated image of Jehoash is reconstructed from plaster remains recovered at Kuntillet Ajrud. The ruins were from a temple built by the northern Israel kingdom when Jehoash of Israel gained control over the kingdom of Judah during the reign of Amaziah of Judah.

<text>Sidney George Francis Guy Skinner (191211 October 1941) was a friend, collaborator, and lover of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.

== Biography ==
Francis Skinner was born in 1912 in Kensington, London, England. Both his father and mother were academically distinguished: his father Sidney Skinner, was a Cambridge chemist and later Director of the South-Western Polytechnic Institute, and his mother, Marion Field Michaelis, a mathematician at Harvard College Observatory.

Skinner was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School in London. He studied the Mathematics Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, following in the footsteps of his older sister Priscilla, herself a talented mathematician and an undergraduate at Newnham College.

in 1930, Skinner, then a student, met Wittgenstein, fell under his influence and &quot;became utterly, uncritically, and almost obsessively devoted&quot; to him. Their relationship was seen by others as being characterized by Skinner&#x27;s eagerness to please Wittgenstein and conform to his opinions.

Skinner graduated with a first-class degree in mathematics from Cambridge in 1933 and was awarded a postgraduate fellowship. He used this fellowship to work with Wittgenstein on a book on philosophy and mathematics (unpublished, possibly the &quot;Pink Book&quot; archive discovered in 2011). While it has been assumed that Skinner was merely a student taking dictation, the discovery of the original archives indicates that Skinner played a significant role in shaping and editing the work.

With Wittgenstein he took Russian classes from Fania Pascal, wife of Roy Pascal. In 1934, the two made plans to emigrate to the Soviet Union and become manual labourers, but Wittgenstein visited the country briefly and realised the plan was not feasible; the Soviet Union might have allowed Wittgenstein to immigrate as a teacher, but not as a manual labourer.

During the academic year 1934–1935, Wittgenstein dictated to Skinner and Alice Ambrose the text of the &quot;Brown Book&quot;.

Wittgenstein&#x27;s hostility toward academia resulted in Skinner&#x27;s withdrawal from university, first to become a gardener, and later a mechanic (much to the dismay of Skinner&#x27;s family). Meanwhile, his sister Priscilla continued her mathematical career, winning a Fellowship and, during the Second World War, working as a mathematician at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. (Priscilla&#x27;s daughter is chemist Ruth Lynden-Bell)

He attempted to join the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War but was rejected on medical grounds. As a teenager he had osteomyelitis which resulted in a limp in one of his legs.

In the late 1930s, Wittgenstein grew increasingly distant from Skinner.

Skinner died from polio, following an air raid in Cambridge in October 1941, having been neglected during the rush to treat victims of the bombing.

Despite the weakening of their relationship, Wittgenstein was apparently traumatised by Skinner&#x27;s death, resulting in the loss for 7 years of the work they were engaged in together, the &#x27;Pink Book&#x27;.

== Pink Book ==
In 2011, an extensive archive came to light, consisting of 170,000 words of handwriting, text and mathematics. This apparently had mostly been dictated by Wittgenstein to Skinner, with annotations by both. The archive includes a long-lost, so-called &quot;Pink Book&quot;. Wittgenstein had posted them to a friend of Skinner days after his death.

In 2020 Arthur Gibson and Niamh O&#x27;Mahony released as editors a book of the manuscripts which are in the hand of Skinner with later amendments in Wittgenstein own hand.

His movie debut was 1960s &quot;Tooi Hitotsu No Michi&quot;, but his starring role as Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1965 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Taikōki&quot; catapulted him to fame. Ken went on to many prominent roles in subsequent programs. The following year, he portrayed Benkei in &quot;Minamoto no Yoshitsune&quot;. The network tapped him again for the role of Fujiwara no Sumitomo in the 1976 &quot;Kaze to Kumo to Niji to&quot;. He returned to playing Hideyoshi in the 1978 &quot;Ōgon no Hibi&quot;, and returned to the lead as Ōishi Kuranosuke in &quot;Tōge no Gunzō,&quot; the 1982 &quot;Chūshingura.&quot; Another featured appearance in a Taiga drama was in &quot;Taiheiki&quot; (1991, as Ashikaga Sadauji, father of Takauji). His final appearance in the taiga drama was Fūrin Kazan in 2007. Besides the taiga drama series, Ogata portrayed Fujieda Baian in the Hissatsu series Hissatsu Shikakenin, he reprised the character twice in the film series later. 

His last lead role was in &quot;A Long Walk&quot; (2006). Mr. Ogata died of liver cancer on October 5, 2008, just days after finishing his role in the production of the Fuji TV drama &quot;Kaze no Garden&quot; (Garden of the Winds).

<text>Earl of Rosse is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland, both times for the Parsons family. &quot;Rosse&quot; refers to New Ross in County Wexford.

== History ==
The Parsons were originally an English family from Dishworth (Diseworth) Grange in Leicestershire; there having been five brothers who settled in Ireland during the late 16th century. One of the brothers, William Parsons, was created a Baronet in the Baronetage of Ireland of Bellamont in the County of Dublin in 1620 by James VI &amp; I. The third Baronet was created Viscount Rosse in the Peerage of Ireland in 1681, and the second Viscount was created Earl of Rosse in the Peerage of Ireland in 1718; these titles of the first creation became extinct on the death of the second Earl in 1764.

Sir Lawrence Parsons, the younger brother of Sir William Parsons, 1st Baronet, settled in Birr, King&#x27;s County, later known as Parsonstown, and was the ancestor of the younger (Birr) branch of the family. His grandson Laurence Parsons was created a Baronet, of Birr Castle in King&#x27;s County, in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1677, but was attainted by King James II&#x27;s Parliament in 1689 and sentenced to death. The sentence was never carried out, however. His great-grandson, the third Baronet, and great-great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, both represented King&#x27;s County in the Irish House of Commons. The latter&#x27;s half-brother Laurence Harman Parsons was in 1792 raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Oxmantown, with remainder to his nephew Sir Lawrence Parsons, 5th Baronet, who had succeeded his father the fourth Baronet in 1791.

In 1795 he was made Viscount Oxmantown in the Peerage of Ireland, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body, and in 1806 he was even further honoured when he was created Earl of Rosse in the Peerage of Ireland, with similar remainder as for the barony. Lord Rosse sat from 1800 to 1807 as one of the original Irish representative peer in the British House of Lords. On his death in 1807 the viscountcy became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony and earldom according to the special remainders by his aforementioned nephew, the 5th Baronet. The latter represented King&#x27;s County in the British House of Commons and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer between 1809 and 1841.

The 2nd Earl&#x27;s son, the 3rd Earl, was a well-known astronomer and famous for his construction of the giant telescope the Leviathan of Parsonstown at his seat Birr Castle. Lord Rosse also sat as Member of Parliament for King&#x27;s County, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1845 to 1867 – years during which millions of the Irish population died from starvation or emigrated. He was one of the very few who foresaw the consequences of the potato blight and tried to alert the British authorities. He was Lord Lieutenant of King&#x27;s County from 1831 to 1867 and President of the Royal Society from 1849 to 1854. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was an Irish Representative Peer between 1868 and 1908 and Lord Lieutenant of King&#x27;s County between 1892 and 1908. His son, the fifth Earl, was an Irish Representative Peer from 1911 to 1918 and Lord-Lieutenant of King&#x27;s County from 1908 to 1918. Lord Rosse fought in the First World War and died from wounds received in action in 1918. the titles are held by his grandson, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his father in 1979.

When the present Earl worked for the United Nations Development Programme, he did not use his title, preferring to be known by his family surname of Parsons.

The family seat is Birr Castle, near Birr, County Offaly.

<text>Seiner Majestät &quot;UB-4&quot; was a German Type UB I submarine (U-boat) in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I. She was sunk by a British Q-ship disguised as a fishing smack in August 1915.

&quot;UB-4&quot; was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November. &quot;UB-4&quot; was a little more than in length and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck-mounted machine gun. &quot;UB-4&quot; was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly. She was launched and commissioned as SM &quot;UB-4&quot; in March 1915.

&quot;UB-4&quot; conducted the first sortie of the Flanders Flotilla in April, during which she sank the Belgian Relief ship , the first ship credited to the flotilla. She sank three more ships from mid-April to mid-August. On 15 August, &quot;UB-4&quot; surfaced near the British Q-ship and was sunk by gunfire from the sailing vessel. None of &quot;UB-4&quot;″s 14 crewmen survived the attack.

== Design and construction ==
After the German Army&#x27;s rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I, the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders. Project 34, a design effort begun in mid-August 1914, produced the Type UB I design: a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled. Constrained by railroad size limitations, the UB I design called for a boat about long and displacing about with two torpedo tubes. &quot;UB-4&quot; was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines—numbered to —ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel, just shy of two months after planning for the class began.

&quot;UB-4&quot; was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 3 November. As built, &quot;UB-4&quot; was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a single Daimler 4-cylinder diesel engine for surface travel, and a single Siemens-Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel, both attached to a single propeller shaft. Her top speeds were , surfaced, and , submerged. At more moderate speeds, she could sail up to on the surface before refueling, and up to submerged before recharging her batteries. Like all boats of the class, &quot;UB-4&quot; was rated to a diving depth of , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds.

&quot;UB-4&quot; was armed with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was also outfitted for a single machine gun on deck. &quot;UB-4&quot;″s standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men.

After work on &quot;UB-4&quot; was complete at the Germaniwerft yard, &quot;UB-4&quot; was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of &quot;UB-4&quot; were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After &quot;UB-4&quot; was assembled and launched sometime in March, she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.

== Service career ==
The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM &quot;UB-4&quot; on 23 March under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Karl Gross, a 29-year-old first-time U-boat commander. &quot;UB-4&quot; soon joined the other UB I boats then comprising the Flanders Flotilla (), which had been organized on 29 March. When &quot;UB-4&quot; joined the flotilla, Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive, begun in February. During this campaign, enemy vessels in the German-defined war zone (), which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom (including the English Channel), were to be sunk. Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag.

&quot;UB-4&quot; kicked off operations for the new flotilla when she departed on her first patrol on 9 April. The following day, she sank the first ship credited to the Flanders Flotilla. The 5,940 GRT British-flagged , which had been chartered by the American Commission for Relief in Belgium, was headed for Norfolk, Virginia, United States, in ballast after delivering relief supplies to Rotterdam. &quot;UB-4&quot; came upon the steamer between Harwich and the Hook of Holland and pulled to within about . Despite the fact that the ship had a pass of safe-conduct from Germany, was marked with the words &quot;Belgian Relief&quot; on her side, and was flying a white flag with the same wording, Gross torpedoed the vessel without warning. &quot;Harpalyce&quot; sank in about five minutes, which allowed no time to launch any of the lifeboats. The Dutch steamers &quot;Elisabeth&quot; and &quot;Constance&quot;, and the American steamer &quot;Ruby&quot; picked up survivors. Herbert Hoover, head of the relief committee, reported that his organization&#x27;s charter of the ship ended after delivery of the cargo in Rotterdam, but expressed disbelief that the ship could have been the victim of a torpedo attack, given the &quot;distinct assurance&quot; that ships engaged in the relief effort &quot;would not be molested&quot;. &quot;Harpalyce&quot;″s master and 14 others from the 44-man crew died in the attack. &quot;Harpalyce&quot; was the largest ship sunk by &quot;UB-4&quot; during her career.

&quot;UB-4&quot;″s followed up the sinking of &quot;Harpalyce&quot; by sinking the Greek ship &quot;Ellispontos&quot;, a steamer of . &quot;Ellispontos&quot; was en route to Montevideo from Amsterdam when sunk by Gross and &quot;UB-4&quot; on 17 April. Although German U-boats sank over 100,000 tons of shipping in each of May and June, &quot;UB-4&quot; did not contribute to those totals. She did add one ship to the 98,000-ton tally for July when she sank the Belgian ship &quot;Princesse Marie Jose&quot; and her load of coal on 29 July. The 1,954 GRT steamer had sailed from Dunston and was headed to Bordeaux when sunk from the Shipwash Lightship off Harwich.

=== Sinking ===
On 14 August, the 59 GRT British fishing smack &quot;Bona Fide&quot; was stopped by a U-boat, boarded, and sunk with explosives east-northeast of Lowestoft. According to the website Uboat.net, this attack was likely by &quot;UB-4&quot;, because she was operating in the area on her fourteenth patrol. Regardless of the identity of &quot;Bona Fide&quot;″s attacker, &quot;UB-4&quot; did approach a group of smacks in the vicinity the next day, but unbeknownst to &quot;UB-4&quot;″s commander, Gross, one of the fishing vessels was actually a British decoy ship.

The decoy or Q-ship was His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Smack , a smack that had been outfitted with a concealed 3-pounder (47 mm) gun. Around 20:20, &quot;UB-4&quot; drew within of &quot;Inverlyon&quot; and Gross, on the conning tower of &quot;UB-4&quot;, shouted out commands to &quot;Inverlyon&quot;″s crew in German. After waiting until the right moment, Ernest Jehan, a Royal Navy gunner in command of &quot;Inverlyon&quot;, ordered the White Ensign raised and gave the command to open fire. A burst of three rounds from the 3-pounder scored hits on the conning tower, the second destroying part of the bridge and sending Gross into the water. &quot;UB-4&quot;, with no one at the helm, drifted behind &quot;Inverlyon&quot;, and when clear, the 3-pounder fired another six shots into the hull of &quot;UB-4&quot; at point blank range. All the while small arms fire from &quot;Inverlyon&quot;″s crew peppered the submarine. The U-boat began going down by the bow, becoming nearly vertical before disappearing below the surface. A member of &quot;Inverlyon&quot;″s crew attempted the rescue of one crewman from &quot;UB-4&quot;, but was unable to reach him before he went under, meeting the same fate as the other thirteen crewmen.

As &quot;UB-4&quot; went down, her hulk fouled the &quot;Inverlyon&quot;″s nets—which had been deployed to keep up the appearance of a real fishing boat—essentially anchoring &quot;Inverlyon&quot; in place. The Q-ship&#x27;s crew, not having a wireless set on board, sent word of the encounter with another smack, and followed up by releasing messenger pigeons the following morning, requesting instructions on what to do with &quot;UB-4&quot;. The thought of salvaging the snagged U-boat was rejected, so the nets were cut, freeing &quot;UB-4&quot; to sink to the bottom. &quot;UB-4&quot;″s wreck lies at position . Jehan was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for the sinking of &quot;UB-4&quot;, and the crewmen of &quot;Inverlyon&quot; split the submarine bounty paid by the Admiralty.

<text>Earl of Ranfurly, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, a title in the Peerage of Ireland, was created in 1831 for Thomas Knox, 2nd Viscount Northland. He had earlier represented County Tyrone in the House of Commons, and had already been created Baron Ranfurly, of Ramphorlie in the County of Renfrew, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1826. Knox was the eldest son of Thomas Knox, who represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons. He was created Baron Welles, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, in 1781, and Viscount Northland, of Dungannon in the County of Tyrone, in 1791.
Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Northland also sat in the British House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish representative peers.

The first Earl was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for County Tyrone and Dungannon. His son, the third Earl, also represented Dungannon in Parliament. On his early death in 1858, having held the titles for only two months, the peerages passed to his eight-year-old son, the fourth Earl. He also died young and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He served as a Lord-in-Waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the third Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury and became Governor of New Zealand between 1897 and 1904. He also was a member of The Apprentice Boys of Derry Parent Club in Derry.

His grandson, the sixth Earl, mainly known as Dan Ranfurly, became well known for his exploits in the Second World War, and also served as Governor of the Bahamas from 1953 to 1956. His wife Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, also became well known for her memoirs of her and her husband&#x27;s lives during the Second World War, and for establishing the organisation which is now known as Book Aid International. They had one daughter but no sons. After his death, the titles passed to his fifth cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the great-great-great-grandson of the Hon. John Knox, third son of the first Earl. As of 2018, the title is held by his son, the eighth earl, who succeeded in that year.

The Hon. William Knox, younger son of the second Earl, served as Member of Parliament for Dungannon.

The earldom of Ranfurly, pronounced &quot;&quot;Ran&quot;-fully&quot;, is the last earldom created in the Peerage of Ireland. Despite its territorial designation and the fact that it is in the Peerage of Ireland, the name of the earldom (like that of the UK barony) references the village of Ranfurly (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Rann Feòirling&quot;) in Renfrewshire in the south-west of Scotland.

The Earls of Ranfurly owned a large country estate centred on Dungannon in the south-east of County Tyrone in Ulster, Ireland, from 1692 until the very early twentieth-century.

The family seat is Maltings Chase, a house designed by Ted Cullinan and built in the late 1960s, near Nayland, Suffolk.

<text>The Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) is a distinctively coloured dolphin found in the cool to temperate waters of the North Atlantic Ocean.

==Description==

The Atlantic white-sided dolphin is a small delphinid. At birth, calves measure just over a meter long; adult males grow to about , and females to about , weighing between 180–230 kg (400- 510 lb) once fully grown. Females reach sexual maturity between the ages of 6 and 12 years, and males between 7 and 11 years old. The gestation period is 11 months and lactation lasts for about 18 months — both typical figures for dolphins. Atlantic white-sided dolphins are known to live for at least 17 years.

The key distinguishing feature is the dolphin&#x27;s coloration—a white to pale-yellow patch is found behind the dorsal fin on both sides of the body. The white-sided dolphin&#x27;s color variations are unique amongst the standard hues of white, grey, black and blue seen on other pelagic cetaceans. Their body&#x27;s coloration is well-demarcated, with the chin, throat and belly being white; the flippers, dorsal fin and back are dark-grey to black (with the exception of the yellow patch), and there is a further white patch below the dorsal fin (lying above a lighter, grayish stripe running from the beak, above the eye, down to the tail stock).

Dolphin pod sizes vary by location, with groups averaging 60 in number having been seen close to the Newfoundland coastline, but somewhat smaller east of Iceland. From the analysis of the stomach contents of stranded animals, fishes, such as herring and mackerel, and squid appear to be the species&#x27; main prey. The Atlantic white-sided dolphin is fairly acrobatic, and keen to interact with boats; however, it is not as wildly gregarious as the white-beaked, bottlenose or common dolphins.

== Geographic range and distribution ==
The species is endemic to the northern Atlantic Ocean. The distribution limits are the Norwegian Sea in the northeast, the Davis Strait in the northwest, coastal North Carolina in the southwest and the Celtic Sea in the southeast (with possible range extension south to the Azores). Areas of particularly high population density include the shores of Newfoundland and Cape Cod, the triangular area of sea between the United Kingdom, Iceland and Greenland and the northern North Sea. In 2008, sightings of Atlantic white-sided dolphins, as well as the melon-headed whale, were documented off South Carolina after a few strandings had taken place in the area at the time. Along the North American east coast the species tends to occur in continental shelf waters, around 100m in depth, and seem to show a preference toward areas of steep slopes and canyons. They are associated with the colder, slightly less saline waters in the northern Atlantic, compared to for example common dolphins that are found in warmer, slightly more saline waters of the North Atlantic, though it is unclear whether this is due to preferences or if these factors influence prey supply.

==Behaviour==

=== Foraging ===
The diet of Atlantic white-sided dolphins mainly consists of herring, hake and squid. However, as opportunistic carnivores, they consume a large variety of prey, including smaller mackerel and various bottom-dwelling fish. They have been observed cooperatively hunting at the surface. It has been suggested that larger groups split while feeding.

=== Social behaviour ===
Like all species of the dolphin family, Atlantic white-sided dolphins are very social animals, often traveling in large pods and displaying aerial behaviors as they travel. The pod&#x27;s size can vary, from several dozen to several hundred individuals, though the average size is around 50. However, studies have shown there to be little familial relation between members of a group, appearing more as a social pod traveling for &quot;safety in numbers&quot;. Researchers in different parts of their range have found that individuals were, mostly, unrelated to one another. Juveniles spend at least some time in separate social groups, away from their parents, prior to weaning. Atlantic white-sided dolphins jump and breach more frequently when in larger groups, as this behaviour might have a social context. They have a wide vocal repertoire which includes squeals, whistles, clicks and buzzes. It is suggested that vocalisation is used for communication as noise production increases during socialising.

Despite being docile creatures, even known to interact with various species of cetacean in a nonviolent manner, most notably with the long-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala melas&quot;), they have also been known to display violent behavior towards harbor porpoises, attacking them until they eventually succumb to their wounds (a similar behavior as observed in bottlenose dolphins).

=== Migration ===
Atlantic white-sided dolphins do not undertake specific seasonal migration. However, they do move within their home range following prey distribution. For example, in the waters off eastern North America this species moves southwards in winter and spring.

=== Reproduction ===
Most of the calves are born around June and July. The gestation period is 11 months and lactation around 18 months. The birth interval varies between 1–3 years.

Females reach sexual maturity around the age of 6–12 years. Males reach sexual maturity around 7–11 years. The reproduction is most likely seasonal, beginning in February, as some studies have identified dormant testes in some males.

== Taxonomy ==

The Atlantic white-sided dolphin was named by John Edward Gray in 1828. The specific name &quot;acutus&quot; comes from the Latin for &#x27;pointed&#x27; and refers to the sharply pointed dorsal fin. It is traditionally placed in the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, but there is consistent molecular evidence that supports the Atlantic white-sided dolphin and the white-beaked dolphin as basal members of the family Delphinidae and not closely related. It has therefore been proposed to move the Atlantic white-sided dolphin to its own genus, &quot;Leucopleurus&quot;.

==Population status==
The estimations for the U.S. shelf and shelf-edge water suggest that the population size is about 300,000. Additional 120,000 individuals have been estimated to spend summer in the Gulf of St.Lawrence. In the eastern North America waters the numbers increase southwards in winter and spring in association with cold waters from the Gulf of Maine. Two projects attempted to estimate the population trends - multinational Small Cetacean Abundance in the North Sea and Adjacent Waters (SCANS) survey project and the North Atlantic Sightings Survey (NASS). SCANS surveys, however, failed to produce species specific estimation as it combined both white-sided and white-beaked dolphins. NASS surveys did not indicate any population trends.

==Threats==
=== Whaling ===
Historically, Atlantic white-sided dolphins were killed in drives conducted from Norway and Newfoundland. These have ceased in recent years, although they still occur to a lesser extent from the Faroe Islands, where the meat and blubber are in high regard as food. Reported catches in the years vary, though individual years suddenly stand out, such as in 2002, where the number reported killed was 773, and in 2017, when 488 were killed. In September 2021, a large pod of 1,428 animals was herded in Skálafjördur and killed.

=== Entanglement and by catch ===
Atlantic white-sided dolphins have also been killed in incidental catch situations in the fishing industry. Such occurrences have been reported in Canada, United States, United Kingdom and Ireland. Between 1977 and 1988, 13 Atlantic white-sided dolphins were reported as being incidentally caught in the Northeastern United States by U.S fisheries observers, 11 of these in Mackerel fisheries. They have also been reported to get caught in pelagic or near surface trawl or drift nets.

=== Noise ===
Anthropogenic underwater noise is a potential disturbance to Atlantic white-sided dolphins as they use sounds to communicate and catch prey. A survey done in the UK showed that the sighting rate of Atlantic white-sided dolphins declines when airguns were firing compared to when they were not.

=== Pollution ===
Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (e.g. DDT, DDE) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants have been identified in body tissues of Atlantic white-sided dolphins throughout their range. Males had higher levels of PCBs suggesting that females pass some of the contamination to offspring during lactation[30]. Similarly to other species, studies have identified heavy metals in Atlantic white-sided dolphins including cadmium levels higher than in other dolphin species in southern latitudes. The full effect of this contamination is currently unknown.

==Conservation status==
The International Union of the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently classifies Atlantic white-sided dolphins as Least Concern.

The North and Baltic Sea populations of the Atlantic white-sided dolphin are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). They are listed on Appendix II as they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. These species of dolphin are known to fall victims to in a polluted environment, a study from 1997 confirmed that the British and Irish populations of Atlantic white-sided dolphins to succumb to these effects. 

In addition, the Atlantic white-sided dolphin is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS).

<text>USS &quot;Atule&quot; (SS/AGSS-403), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the atule.

==Construction and commissioning==

&quot;Atule&quot;′s keel was laid down on 25 November 1943 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. &quot;Atule&quot; was launched on 6 March 1944 sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Louise Kauffman, the daughter of Rear Admiral James L. Kauffman, and commissioned on 21 June 1944.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

====World War II====
Following a month of shakedown training along the east coast, the submarine departed New London, Connecticut, and headed south to join the action in the Pacific. During a 15-day stopover at the Fleet Sound School in Key West, Florida, she sharpened her diving skills and fighting techniques. After transiting the Panama Canal, &quot;Atule&quot; steamed to Pearl Harbor with , training intensively en route to reach a peak of combat readiness. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Atule&quot; underwent voyage repairs and torpedo training into October.

On 9 October, &quot;Atule&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol in company with and &quot;Jallao&quot;. Under the command of Commander Bernard Clarey in &quot;Pintado&quot;, the three boats formed a wolf pack known as &quot;Clarey&#x27;s Crushers&quot;. &quot;Atule&quot; trained with &quot;Jallao&quot; and &quot;Pintado&quot; as they traveled westward. On 11 October, &quot;Atule&quot; picked up two radar contacts, tracked them, and maneuvered around them before identifying the contacts as and . The pack arrived at Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, on 21 October, refueled, made minor repairs, and departed early the next day. On 25 October, the wolf pack made its first score when &quot;Jallao&quot; hit light cruiser &quot;Tama&quot; and sent her to the bottom. That Japanese warship already had been damaged in the Battle off Cape Engaño and was part of the broken Japanese carrier-centered fleet retiring to the north. The wolf pack then spent two more days vainly searching for enemy vessels crippled during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The boats then set course for their patrol sectors in Luzon Strait and the South China Sea.

Over the next few days, &quot;Atule&quot; made but lost several ship contacts. Shortly after midnight on 1 November, she established surface radar contact on a fast-moving escorted transport and moved in for the kill. Despite rain squalls and heavy seas, &quot;Atule&quot; was able to close the transport and fire six torpedoes. The first hit caused a terrific explosion which threw flaming material high in the air. When one of the transport&#x27;s escorts began to close the submarine, she began a crash dive but still managed to hear a second explosion as she submerged. Nine depth charges exploded in the vicinity, but none was close enough to damage &quot;Atule&quot;. The crew in the submarine heard loud breaking up noises and upon surfacing, found a large oil slick and much debris. &quot;Atule&quot; was later credited with sinking the &quot;Asama Maru&quot;.

&quot;Atule&quot; continued her patrol, covering the Hong Kong-Manila traffic lane in the South China Sea and occasionally breaking off to investigate a contact report or to take special scouting dispositions by order of the pack commander. On 3 November, &quot;Jallao&quot; reported a five-ship force heading south, and the wolf pack moved to intercept. The contacts were moving at , and &quot;Atule&quot; was never able to come within range for attack. However &quot;Pintado&quot; had better luck. That submarine&#x27;s target was thought to be a large escorted oiler (actually the aircraft carrier Jun&#x27;yō), but before her torpedoes could strike the oiler crossed their path and disintegrated in a tremendous explosion which was seen and heard on board &quot;Atule&quot;. The smoke screen provided by the ensuing fires protected the target, and &quot;Pintado&quot; was forced to withdraw.

During the next ten days, the wolf pack occasionally sighted ships or aircraft, but was unable to attack. On 13 November, &quot;Jallao&quot; reported an enemy ship. &quot;Pintado&quot; and &quot;Atule&quot; altered course to intercept the contact, and at 0850, &quot;Atule&quot; sighted what appeared to be the foretop of a battleship. At 1000, the enemy contact was established as an aircraft carrier, a heavy cruiser, and one destroyer. &quot;Atule&quot; maneuvered to approach the force as closely as possible, hoping that the enemy ships would initiate a &quot;zig-zag&quot; course which would bring them within range of her torpedoes. The Japanese force indeed did begin to &quot;zig-zag&quot;, but, instead of making them vulnerable, the maneuver took the force out of range. At 1115, contact was lost.

Later that day and throughout the next, the submarine played a game of hide and seek with Japanese planes equipped with radar and magnetic detection devices. During this hunt, the Japanese covered all of the wolf pack&#x27;s radio frequencies and intruded in Japanese as well as English, asking the Americans to &quot;come in, please&quot; in their best imitations of American aviators. &quot;Atule&quot; was forced to dive, zigzag, and run to evade these planes which dropped 14 depth charges. None came close to &quot;Atule&quot;, but was severely damaged. After a circuitous route to avoid Japanese planes, &quot;Atule&quot; began patrolling her assigned scouting station west of Formosa.

There, until after midnight on 20 November, she made only aircraft contacts. The submarine then sighted a slow moving surface vessel and moved in to attack. The night was dark, and the sky, clear. The enemy, identified later as &quot;Minesweeper Number 88&quot;, was protected by a squall during the early phase of &quot;Atule&quot; approach, but was perfectly silhouetted against a clear horizon when the submarine fired four torpedoes. The third torpedo hit at the forward stack with a terrific explosion. The target was down by the bow, and, less than three minutes after the hit its stern reared up as the ship slid under, depth charges exploding as she went down.

On 24 November, &quot;Atule&quot; sighted by periscope one transport with three escorts heading northeast toward Sabtang Island. The submarine surfaced at dark and set course to intercept the transport shortly after midnight. As she set her sights on the target, one of the escorts also moved into view. &quot;Atule&quot; fired six bow tubes and two stern tubes at the overlapping targets, scoring two hits on each. The escort, later identified as &quot;Patrol Boat Number 88&quot;, was claimed destroyed but survived the attack; and the transport, a 7,266-ton cargo ship named &quot;Santos Maru&quot;, went dead in the water. &quot;Atule&quot; moved out of range of the other two escorts which were wildly searching the area. The transport disappeared from view and from radar and the submarine returned to patrol.

On 27 November, a radar contact and subsequent visual sighting of a ship at anchor between Dequey Island and Ibuhos Island gave &quot;Atule&quot; another chance for action. Approaching from the north of Dequey Island, &quot;Atule&quot; closed the transport to and fired four torpedoes. The four hits spread the length of the ship; and, in the ensuing fire, the port side was seen to be blown almost completely away. The ship was racked by violent oil and ammunition explosions, and the flames were visible 15 miles away. One hour and eight minutes after the first hit, the ship blew apart. However, &quot;Atule&quot; was never officially credited with this sinking, because a postwar study of Japanese records did not substantiate the loss.

On 28 November, the submarine left her patrol station and headed for Majuro Atoll for refit alongside . Arriving on 11 December, &quot;Atule&quot; ended a highly productive first patrol in which she accounted for almost 27,000 tons of enemy shipping destroyed.

&quot;Atule&quot; spent December in upkeep and training, including a six-day coordinated convoy exercise with , , and &quot;Jallao&quot;. On 6 January 1945, she departed Majuro in company with these same ships, Commander Gordon W. Underwood in &quot;Spadefish&quot; as group commander. En route to Saipan, &quot;Underwood&#x27;s Urchins&quot; conducted training dives, emergency drills, and radar tracking exercises.

After a brief stop in Tanapag Harbor alongside , &quot;Atule&quot; headed for her patrol area in the Yellow Sea. Since &quot;Pompon&quot; and &quot;Jallao&quot; were delayed she sailed in company with &quot;Spadefish&quot;, , and . Prior to her arrival in the patrol area, &quot;Atule&quot; took part in a fruitless search for downed aviators. Reports of sightings of the survivors were not in agreement, and the approximate location could not be determined. The search was abandoned on 17 January. &quot;Pompon&quot; joined the pack on 20 January, and, the next day, they entered the Yellow Sea.

While on patrol, &quot;Atule&quot; sighted many sampans and fishing boats, but could not strike a blow at the Japanese fleet until 24 January. On that afternoon, she commenced tracking a merchant ship. At periscope depth, the target was lost in a snow squall, so &quot;Atule&quot; came to radar depth to regain contact, closed for a stern shot, and fired four torpedoes. Two hit their marks, one abreast the stack, the second near the aftermast. The ship settled rapidly by the stern. The crew hastily abandoned the ship in time to see the stern break off and disappear. The forward section of the ship bobbed like a cork, so &quot;Atule&quot; surfaced to finish off the freighter with gunfire. The freighter returned fire, and the submarine fired another torpedo which missed the target. &quot;Atule&quot; retired to await nightfall, when she again failed to sink the hulk with gunfire. She loosed another torpedo, which hit amidships, and the freighter began settling by the bow. &quot;Atule&quot; left the empty hulk in a vertical position with the midship section high in the air. After the war her victim was identified as &quot;Taiman Maru Number 1&quot;.

&quot;Atule&quot; was assigned to patrol in the northern part of the Yellow Sea. The seas were heavy, and the snow and wind combined to create blizzard conditions. After four days, she shifted to the southwest corner of the sea between Korea and China. On 27 January, &quot;Pompon&quot; reported a convoy contact and, together with &quot;Spadefish&quot;, attacked. &quot;Atule&quot; was too distant to join in, but heard several explosions. Early the next day, she gained contact on a medium transport trying to escape the area of the attack of the previous day, and she gave chase until shoal water and the presence of an enemy escort forced her to veer off.

Floating naval mines became &quot;Atule&quot; new targets. During the rest of her patrol, she sighted 29 mines, 23 of which she sank by gunfire, and one which bounced harmlessly down the submarine&#x27;s side. &quot;Atule&quot; patrolled the Chinese and Korean coastlines and traffic lanes until 22 February, when she headed for Saipan where she once again moored alongside &quot;Fulton&quot;. On 28 February she left Tanapag Harbor bound for Midway Island, where she moored on 7 March.

After refit alongside , &quot;Atule&quot; conducted extensive drills in multiple fire torpedo attacks, gunfire, sound training and evasion exercises. On 2 April, she departed Midway, bound for Guam. After one day alongside in Apra Harbor, the submarine departed on 12 April for her patrol area off Bungo Suido. covered the east entrance and &quot;Atule&quot; the west. The patrol consisted almost entirely of lifeguard duty and mine destruction. On 4 May, she sighted an enemy submarine but it escaped before &quot;Atule&quot; could close for attack. On 5 May, &quot;Atule&quot; and a B-29 Superfortress &quot;Dumbo&quot; plane—which carried an airborne lifeboat for air-sea rescue operations—conducted a coordinated attack on two Japanese planes. &quot;Atule&quot; acted as &quot;fighter&quot; director and vectored the Superfortress to the Japanese planes. She then submerged and watched as one plane fled and one was shot down in a very unusual dogfight. &quot;Atule&quot; rescued one badly burned Japanese flier from the wreckage. The war patrol ended on 30 May when &quot;Atule&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor for a three-week refit by .

After a week of drills, &quot;Atule&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 3 July bound for a lifeguard station in the Nanpō Islands. After nine days with little action, the submarine proceeded to her patrol area in Empire waters east of Honshū as part of an attack group which also included &quot;Gato&quot; and . On 12 August, &quot;Atule&quot; gained contact on two ships, later identified as &quot;Coast Defense Vessel Number 6&quot; and &quot;Coast Defense Vessel Number 16&quot;, steaming along the coast. Shallow waters and poor visibility caused &quot;Atule&quot; to set a course to intercept in the vicinity of Urakawa Ko rather than to attack the contacts under such adverse conditions. With the targets overlapping, &quot;Atule&quot; fired six torpedoes. The closer of the two ships – &quot;Coast Defense Vessel Number 6&quot; – exploded with an orange flame and much flying debris. The second target disappeared from radar, but it is not known whether she sank or escaped. On 15 August, &quot;Atule&quot; heard the news of the Japanese capitulation and headed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 25 August. On 30 August, she departed Pearl Harbor via the Panama Canal, bound for New London, Connecticut.

While in New London, &quot;Atule&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 2 (SubRon 2) and engaged in training operations for the Submarine School and the Prospective Commanding Officer&#x27;s School located there. Following Navy Day ceremonies in Washington, D.C., she proceeded to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine for an overhaul which was completed on 3 February 1946.

====Post-War====
On 4 July 1946, &quot;Atule&quot; headed for the frozen north as a member of Operation Nanook. The purpose of this mission was to assist in the establishment of advanced weather stations in the Arctic regions and to aid in the planning and execution of more extensive naval operations in polar and sub-polar regions. In company with , , , , and &quot;Northwind&quot;, &quot;Atule&quot; was to transport supplies and passengers, conduct reconnaissance of proposed weather station sites, train personnel, and collect data on Arctic conditions.

&quot;Atule&quot; rendezvoused with &quot;Northwind&quot; and &quot;Whitewood&quot; off the southwestern coast of Greenland on 11 July 1946 and put into Melville Bight, Baffin Bay, on 20 July, while a PBY Catalina reconnoitered Thule Harbor and the approaches to the harbor. Following engine trouble, the Catalina made an emergency landing, and &quot;Atule&quot; was dispatched to recover the plane, becoming the first ship of the operation to enter the harbor. &quot;Atule&quot; then conducted tests and exercises in Smith South-Kane Basin with &quot;Whitewood&quot;. During one such exercise, she reached latitude 79 degrees 11 minutes north in the Kane Basin, at the time a record for the United States Navy. &quot;Atule&quot; had been equipped with the first upward-beamed fathometer for measuring ice thickness overhead. On 29 July, &quot;Atule&quot; departed Thule, having completed all of her scheduled projects, stopped at Halifax, Nova Scotia and reached New London late in August to resume her former duties.

On 27 February 1947, &quot;Atule&quot; arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul and inactivation. On 8 September 1947, she was placed out of commission, in reserve, with the New London Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. After three years in &quot;mothballs,&quot; &quot;Atule&quot; was towed to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for reactivation and conversion to a GUPPY IA type submarine. Outfitted with a snorkel to permit use of her engines while submerged and a smooth streamlined superstructure for added speed, &quot;Atule&quot; rejoined the fleet a stronger, more versatile warship. On 8 March 1951, the submarine was recommissioned.

Assigned to SubRon 8 in New London, &quot;Atule&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise in the Caribbean Sea and then participated in Fleet and NATO training exercises in the Atlantic and the Caribbean. On 9 February 1952, she departed New London for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean and participation in NATO Exercise Grand Slam. During the deployment, she visited Gibraltar, Malta, and Marseille, before arriving back in the United States on 29 March.

After several months of extensive training and preparations &quot;Atule&quot; participated in LANTSUBEX I from 15 September-11 October. During this operation, she found herself battling the high seas and winds of Hurricane Charlie which at one point rolled her more than 60 degrees to port, washing the officer of the deck and the lookout off the bridge. With safety belts attaching them to the bridge, they were able to climb safely back on board.

On 19 November, &quot;Atule&quot; entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. After the yard work had been completed she got underway on 4 April 1953 to resume normal operations. During LANTSUBEX II in October, she suffered a serious fire and lost propulsion for approximately six hours in very heavy seas. The submarine arrived in New London on 27 October for repairs, leave and upkeep. She recommenced operations late in January 1954, by sailing to Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, for the annual Operation Springboard exercise. Late in February &quot;Atule&quot; departed St. Thomas for the return trip.

But for a two-week visit to the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area to provide services to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory Test Facility, she remained in New London for five months. Upon her return to New London &quot;Atule&quot; operated in the local area until February 1955, when she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul which was completed in August. The submarine then resumed training and operations in the New London area. In July 1957, &quot;Atule&quot; cruised to the Mediterranean Sea and operated with the 6th Fleet until October. She entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in January 1958 and departed in July, sailing to Key West, Florida, where she was assigned to SubRon 12.

During the fall of 1958, &quot;Atule&quot; became familiar with her new operating area by working with the Operational Development Force assisting in the development and evaluation of new submarine techniques and equipment. She also acted as a target in surface and air antisubmarine exercises. After a Christmas leave period, &quot;Atule&quot; conducted local operations until April 1959, when she participated in an Atlantic Fleet exercise and then resumed local drills.

In July 1960, &quot;Atule&quot; again cruised to the Mediterranean Sea for surface-subsurface training with NATO forces which lasted until October, when she returned to the United States and entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for a six-month overhaul. After completion of the yard work in April 1961, &quot;Atule&quot; spent 18 months alternating duty at Key West, Florida, with service at Guantanamo Bay supporting training for the destroyer force in antisubmarine warfare.

In October 1963, the submarine entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which ended in February 1964. She returned to Key West, Florida, and operated from her home port until July when she sailed for the Mediterranean Sea to operate with the 6th Fleet. She returned to her home port in November for routine operations.

In August 1965, &quot;Atule&quot; departed Port of Spain, Trinidad, in company with other United States warships for a goodwill cruise during which she circumnavigated the South American continent. Known as Operation Unitas VI, this operation promoted cooperation between naval forces of the United States and the participating South American countries. &quot;Atule&quot; drilled with ships of the navies of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile as she transited the Panama Canal and headed south along the coast. On 16 October, the submarine entered the Strait of Magellan and arrived at Punta Arenas, Chile, the southernmost city of South America. As she headed north, &quot;Atule&quot;″s crew became ambassadors of good will in port calls to Puerto Belgrano, Mar del Plata, Rio de Janeiro, and San Salvador before disbanding the UNITAS VI task unit in Trinidad on 1 December. The submarine then sailed for home and arrived there on 6 December for a leave and upkeep period that lasted into 1966. She remained in nearby waters for training and routine operations until 5 July when she moved to Charleston, South Carolina, for another overhaul.

&quot;Atule&quot; left the shipyard on 26 January 1967 and during the year was assigned to duties at the Prospective Commanding Officers School and Fleet Training Group at Guantanamo Bay as well as continuing local training. In February 1968, she headed for the Gulf of Mexico and New Orleans, Louisiana, to train naval reservists and to celebrate Mardi Gras. The submarine returned via St. Petersburg, Florida, to her home port, where she continued general operations until 1 October when she got underway for her last Mediterranean Sea deployment. After almost four months of exercises with the 6th Fleet, &quot;Atule&quot; returned to the United States on 3 February 1969 and resumed her duties in the local area. On 29 August, &quot;Atule&quot; departed Key West for Philadelphia where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 15 September. Redesignated with the hull classification symbol AGSS-403 on 1 October, &quot;Atule&quot; was decommissioned on 6 April 1970 and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1973. She was sold to Peru in July 1974.

===Peruvian Navy===

Renamed BAP &quot;Pacocha&quot; (SS-48), the submarine served in the &quot;Marina de Guerra Peruana&quot; (the Peruvian Navy) until 26 August 1988, when she was rammed and sunk by a Japanese fishing trawler. The loss of &quot;Pacocha&quot; was instrumental in the beatification of Marija Petkovic, as one of the survivors (a Peruvian Navy lieutenant) said that he had been praying to her before he performed several impossible display of physical strength to save the lives of himself and several of his companions.

<text>BAP &quot;Pacocha&quot; (SS-48) was a submarine of the &quot;Marina de Guerra del Perú&quot; (Peruvian Navy) named for the 1877 Battle of Pacocha, in which the Peruvian ironclad &quot;Huascar&quot; clashed with the Royal Navy. Formerly , a with a GUPPY IA upgrade, she had been sold to Peru and commissioned on 28 May 1974. She was rammed and sunk by a fishing trawler on 26 August 1988.

==Sinking and rescue operation==
At 18:50 in the evening of 26 August 1988, &quot;Pacocha&quot; was transiting on the surface with the forward torpedo room and bridge hatches as well as the main induction valve open. Forty-nine men were aboard, including the squadron commander, to conduct an operational readiness inspection. About half an hour after sunset, ten minutes from &quot;Pacocha&quot;&#x27;s expected arrival at the port of Callao, the 412-ton Japanese fishing trawler &quot;Kiowa Maru&quot; (also spelled &quot;Kyowa Maru&quot; and &quot;Hyowa Maru&quot;) rammed her in the aft port quarter. &quot;Kiowa Maru&quot; was equipped with an ice-breaker bow, with a sub-surface protrusion designed to penetrate and break apart what it struck. &quot;Pacocha&quot; sank quickly.

Four men died immediately in the collision and sinking: her commanding officer, &quot;Capitán de Fragata&quot; (Ship Captain) Daniel Nieva Rodríguez, died securing the bridge access hatch; &quot;Teniente Segundo&quot; (Second Lieutenant) Luis Roca Sara and two enlisted men were trapped in flooded compartments and drowned. Twenty-three of her crew succeeded in abandoning ship.

In the sinking submarine, &quot;Teniente&quot; (First Lieutenant) Roger Cotrina Alvarado secured the watertight forward torpedo room door and attempted to pressurize the compartment. He then tried to secure the forward torpedo room hatch. Instead, however, he had to force the hatch open to free a sailor whose leg was caught in the hatch due to the 40-degree up angle the &quot;Pacocha&quot; assumed before sinking. As the &quot;Pacocha&quot; began to capsize water rushed into the compartment, washing Lieutenant Cotrina down the ladder, and, fortunately, forcing the hatch door closed shortly afterwards.

Less than five minutes after the collision, &quot;Pacocha&quot; settled on the bottom at a depth of with a 9-degree up angle.

At 20:02, with &quot;Pacocha&quot; an hour overdue, the Peruvian Navy declared an emergency. Boats were dispatched to search along &quot;Pacocha&quot;&#x27;s route. The tug &quot;Jennifer II&quot; was sent to rendezvous with &quot;Kiowa Maru&quot; and investigate. Some twenty minutes later, &quot;Contralmirante&quot; Guillermo Tirado, commander of the Submarine Flotilla, arrived at the Callao Naval Base, assumed command, and dispatched the submarine BAP &quot;Dos de Mayo&quot; (SS-41) to search.

At 20:30, the survivors trapped in &quot;Pacocha&quot; released their messenger buoy and attempted to call aft compartments on the sound-powered telephone. There was no response.

By 21:00, the crew of &quot;Jennifer II&quot; had confirmed that &quot;Kiowa Maru&quot; had collided with something, and radioed their report to the base. While that report was in progress, the survivors in &quot;Pacocha&quot; fired a red distress flare. The Navy immediately issued a call for rescue and salvage divers to report for duty. Rescue of the survivors on the surface began at once, and within an hour and a half, twenty survivors and three bodies were drawn from the water. Three enlisted men had died of hypothermia during the four hours they had spent in the water.

Meanwhile, 22 survivors mustered in &quot;Pacocha&quot;&#x27;s forward torpedo room: four officers, four chiefs, and fourteen junior enlisted personnel. The senior officer transpired to be Cotrina. At 21:20 they fired another flare that led searchers to the messenger buoy at 21:31. Messenger buoys on &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarines do not have telephones, so communication could not be established, but those on the surface did realize that the buoy and flares probably meant that someone was still alive. The survivors held training in the use of the Steinke hood, with which most crewmen were unfamiliar. (The Peruvian Navy, like the United States Navy, had stopped in-water escape training from depth several years previously.)

At 22:50, the smell of chlorine gas in main control prompted another assessment of the boat&#x27;s condition. A vent valve was found that had not been tightly shut, and more water had seeped into the aft battery compartment. All lithium hydroxide canisters were brought forward, and the survivors sealed themselves in the forward torpedo room. By 23:30, two canisters of lithium hydroxide were opened and spread. The crew was put to bed.

By midnight on Saturday, 27 August 1988, all twenty survivors and three bodies had been brought ashore. Survivors were taken to the nearby Naval Hospital. Although all suffered from hypothermia, none had significant injuries. At the scene, an assortment of vessels were on the surface, including the submarine, &quot;Dos de Mayo&quot;, a torpedo retriever, a floating crane, and several small craft.

Locating divers during their off-duty hours was hampered by the lack of telephones in many of their homes, but by midnight, eight were at the scene in SCUBA gear. Depth to the deck of the ship was between aft and forward, with the ship variably reported as having between a nine- and fifteen-degree up-angle. The first team of divers followed the messenger buoy&#x27;s line, which had played out to a significant distance. Since it was not located directly over &quot;Pacocha&quot;, a second line was tended straight down to the sail. The divers tapped on the hull and received a response from the forward compartment of the boat. However, they were unfamiliar with the code used, so were unable to interpret the tapping.

At 00:40, &quot;Contralmirante&quot; Tirado called Captain Schillingsburg, the United States Defense Attaché, to request rescue assistance from the United States Navy.

By 01:00 the survivors had sent messages to the rescuers that they should be able to hold out for 48 hours. By 02:00, three volunteers in &quot;Pacocha&quot; had donned oxygen breathing apparatuses (OBAs) and walked through compartments as far aft as main control. The aft battery compartment had water over the deck, so it was not entered. Meanwhile, personnel ashore including several divers studied the salvage air connections on (the former , also a GUPPY IA &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine) and discovered that they did not have appropriate salvage air hoses or fittings. Ultimately, Mark V diving system umbilicals were used with fittings manufactured during the night on two frigates. (Mark V diving hoses are negatively buoyant, inner diameter, 600 psig (4.2 MPa) pressure rated hoses, MIL-H-2815.)

After two frustrating hours, improved communications with &quot;Pacocha&quot; were finally established at 02:27, using the signal ejector to pass written notes to the divers. Word was received at 03:50 and passed to the survivors that the United States Navy was sending its rescue system. However, over the next few hours the estimated time of arrival of the rescue system shifted steadily later.

Having had no communication from the surface for nearly two hours and unaware that there were currently no divers available, &quot;Pacocha&quot; fired another flare at 04:20. Yellow was picked so as not to give the impression that something new was seriously wrong—they only wanted to express concern that they had not heard anything in a couple of hours. However, at 04:40 a small electrical short and fire broke out in main control. It was brief and self-extinguishing, but renewed concern for the survivors&#x27; atmosphere. Only carbon dioxide extinguishers were available for fire-fighting.

A new group of divers arrived on scene at about 05:00 after reviewing salvage connections, escape trunk configuration, and other details on &quot;La Pedrera&quot;. Shortly after the divers went to work, they recovered the body of &quot;Pacocha&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer, &quot;Capitán de Fragata&quot; Nieva, just inside the deck access door to the sail.

At 06:00 the survivors held reveille and prepared breakfast. Utilizing the signal ejector, communication was passed that the crew was in good spirits with enough air to last for seventy-eight hours based on calculations of available oxygen and lithium hydroxide. They also had adequate supplies of water, but no food after eating what little they had, including cake, for breakfast. While inspecting the submarine, the survivors noted a heavy black cloud rising from below the deck in the forward battery compartment. No one entered this compartment again. Two more canisters of lithium hydroxide were opened and spread on the upper bunks. Later in the morning another four canisters were opened. Approximately twenty canisters were unopened. One eight-cubic-foot (230 L) oxygen cylinder was bled into the compartment; three oxygen cylinders were left unused.

Information on the use of the escape trunk and the Steinke hood was passed from the surface. The crew was divided into five groups and one member from each group trained in the operation of the escape trunk. Groups were arranged by seniority, with one officer in four of the five groups, and by other factors such as swimming ability and self-confidence. Via message, &quot;Pacocha&quot; informed those on the surface that there were twenty-two survivors.

At 07:30 a message was sent to &quot;Pacocha&quot; informing them that the fly-away rescue system was on the way from the United States. This provided a visible boost to morale among the crewmen, and all involved in the casualty planned to wait for that equipment.

However, by 09:50, the crew was becoming listless, agitated, and hyperventilating. The boat&#x27;s only atmosphere monitoring equipment was aft in the flooded compartments, but the lithium hydroxide did not seem to be working as well as expected. Cotrina was becoming concerned about the submarine&#x27;s atmosphere. He spread four additional lithium hydroxide canisters. To exacerbate the situation, their only light, the emergency light located at the bottom of the forward ladder, was periodically flickering on and off, and the beam from their only battle lantern was steadily growing weaker. Cotrina passed a message to the surface requesting guidance. &quot;Contralmirante&quot; Tirado instructed Cotrina to use his best judgment in deciding when to escape. Cotrina consulted his crew; their recommendations to escape were unanimous with one exception. &quot;Teniente&quot; Lindley offered various reasons to wait, and if he had to escape, he wanted the divers to provide SCUBA tanks since he had been trained in their use. Cotrina ordered him to join the first group of escapees.

At 11:30, divers completed connecting high and low salvage using Mark V diving umbilicals for hoses and the manufactured fittings. The high salvage was connected to air banks on the submarine , named after the Battle of Abtao. These banks were charged by thirty-five-year-old, oil-lubricated compressors. There were no filters on the system, and air samples of the air banks had never been taken.

During escape training, crew members decided to inflate their Steinke hoods in the compartment before entering the escape trunk, and to use them as flotation devices, but not to enclose their heads in the hoods. One member of the first group, Chief Monzon, did wear the hood. He was to be the third most seriously injured of the twenty-two escapees. After inflating the escape devices, four men entered the escape trunk and controlled flooding and pressurizing from inside the trunk. After the side access hatch was opened, the four men spent at least ten minutes arguing over who would exit first. Finally &quot;Teniente&quot; Gomez, the senior man, ducked under and began his ascent, followed in turn by Chief Monzon and Petty Officer Reyes. All three men reached the surface and were promptly rescued. However, within minutes of reaching the surface, they began suffering great pain in their joints, became disoriented and unsteady, experienced shortness of breath, and displayed symptoms of crepitus.

The rescuers on the surface had been told to expect four men in the first group. Finding only three, they began to search for the missing &quot;Teniente&quot; Lindley. While they searched, the survivors drained and opened the escape trunk, where they found the &quot;teniente&quot;, alive and well, still in the escape trunk. Lindley reentered the submarine, and was added to the last escape group.

The second group, led by &quot;Teniente&quot; Augusto Ivan Aranguren Nieri, completed their escape by 12:25 without incident, and were flown by helicopter to the recompression chamber. The helicopter flew low over the water, to keep the air pressure as high as possible.

Immediately after the second group surfaced, air was supplied through the high salvage connection. When the connection was opened aboard &quot;Pacocha&quot;, high-pressure seawater came from the line since it had not yet been blown dry. The survivors immediately shut the high salvage connection valve and never reopened it. The low salvage line was open to atmosphere on the surface, not pressurized, but was connected to the submarine below the level of water in the bilge. Thus, that line was filled with seawater to a depth equivalent to the pressure in the boat, and did not allow air flow.

All five of the survivors in the third escape group completed an uneventful escape by 12:40. However, after they left, the outer escape hatch could not be shut from inside the submarine, so when the crew attempted to drain the trunk, seawater continued to flood into the submarine until the valves were secured. After the problem was communicated to the surface, divers investigated, discovered that the hatch&#x27;s dogs were obstructing closure, and freed the obstruction with a large wrench.

The fourth escape group made an uneventful escape by 15:15. On reaching the surface at least one of them was transported to the shore recompression facility by helicopter. The fifth group then made an uneventful escape by 16:25. By this time, a recompression chamber was on scene on the floating crane along with two medical officers. All three in this escape group were recompressed within five minutes of surfacing.

After the fifth group left the escape trunk, divers placed a set of scuba tanks in the trunk. The final three escapees spent between one-half and one hour breathing from the tanks before escaping at 18:05, by which time personnel topside were again becoming apprehensive. Divers were sent to investigate the delay and were present when all three escapees simultaneously emerged from the escape trunk.

Since the chamber at the scene was occupied, these individuals were transported by boat to the shore facility. About an hour and a half lapsed between surfacing and recompression, apparently because no chamber was available. &quot;Oficial de Mar 2o.&quot; Carlos Grande Rengifo developed such severe decompression sickness (the &quot;bends&quot;), possibly combined with gas embolus, that he died during recompression treatment.

== Aftermath ==
The Peruvian Navy&#x27;s efforts to salvage &quot;Pacocha&quot; began on 30 August 1988, immediately after the crew escaped, and continued for eleven months. One hundred fifty men, seventy of them divers from the Salvage Service, worked eight hundred hours, two hundred of preliminary inspection and six hundred diving. The submarine broke the surface again on 23 July 1989, eleven months after she was sunk. After being studied for the effects of the ramming and sinking, her hulk was cannibalized for spare parts for other Peruvian submarines.

Lieutenant Cotrina credited the sequence of events leading to the closing of the forward torpedo room hatch to a miracle coming from the intercession of then Venerable Marija Petković, whom he was praying to while fighting for his and his crewmate&#x27;s survival. He testified, &quot;I saw a light and I experienced an ineffable power that allowed me to shut the hatch&quot;. There is little doubt that if that hatch had not been shut, no one inside the submarine would have survived. Two commissions, one conducted by the Peruvian military, the other by the Vatican came to the conclusion that with the water pressure, it would have been technically impossible for anyone to close the hatch. As such the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Congregation for the Causes of the Saints authenticated the miracle. This is unusual, as normally miracles in the causes of saints, are those for cures believed by the Church to be through the saint&#x27;s intercession, but in this case the declaration of a miracle was the obtaining of superhuman strength by someone in a disaster situation. On 6 June 2003, Pope John Paul II celebrated Marija&#x27;s beatification Mass in the Croatian port city of Dubrovnik. Cotrina Alvarado received Holy Communion from the pope on this occasion, and afterwards gave the pope a small replica of the Pacocha as a memento.

<text>Marija Petković, also known as The Blessed Mary of Jesus Crucified Petković; (, ), (10 December 1892 - 9 July 1966) was the founder of the Catholic Congregation of the Daughters of Mercy. She was recognized by the Catholic Church as Venerable on 8 May 1998, and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 6 June 2003.

==Biography==
Petković was born in the small town of Blato on the Croatian island of Korčula (at that time part of Austria-Hungary), the sixth of eleven children born to mother Marija Marinović and father Antun Petković-Kovač. 

After elementary school, Petković enrolled in 1904 in Blato&#x27;s municipal school, which had been recently founded by the Servants of Charity, a Catholic order newly arrived from Italy. After successfully completing the three-year program, she continued her studies at the School of Domestic Science, also directed by the Servants of Charity. In 1906 she joined the association of the Daughters of Mary. About this time she revealed to Bishop Josip Marcelić of Dubrovnik that she wanted to enter the convent, which marked the beginning of Marija&#x27;s spiritual direction under the Bishop&#x27;s care. On 21 November 1906, she made a private vow of chastity to the Lord.

From 1909 to 1919 Petković was president of the Daughters of Mary. Although frail and frequently ill, in addition to her obligations in her parents&#x27; home, she provided catechesis and instruction in general subjects to the children of the families whose parents worked on her father&#x27;s estate. In 1911 her father died, leaving her to help her mother care for the family and provide for the education of the other children. That labor, amid the destruction wreaked in Croatia by World War I, was very influential in Petković&#x27;s vocational discernment. She became involved in a number of Catholic organizations, and, in 1915, under the guidance of Bishop Josip, began her first new association, the Society of Catholic Mothers. In 1917 she assumed the responsibility of guiding the Third Order Franciscans. That same year, she began helping the Servants of Charity in the &quot;soup kitchen&quot; that they directed.

In 1918, Petković made a formal promise to the Bishop to remain in Blato to help and live with the poor. On 25 March 1919, Petković and her friend, Marija Telenta, entered the convent of the Servants of Charity. Two months later, however, the Mother Superior died and the other sisters, for political reasons, returned to Italy. Petković, her companion, and two other nuns were all that remained of the convent. Bishop Josip watched over and advised the four Sisters, especially Petković, whom he counseled in humility and service. She requested from him the Rule of the Third Order Franciscans, and, in the winter of 1919, opened three institutions in Blato: a day-recovery centre, a child-care facility, and an orphanage.

On 25 August 1920, in Prižba (on the island of Korčula), Petković wrote the first Constitutions of the Order of Daughters of Mercy, the Third Independent Order of St. Francis, setting forth their mission of spreading knowledge of divine love and mercy through charitable acts. Bishop Josip inaugurated the Order on 4 October, the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi. On that day, Petković received the name of Marija od Propetoga Isusa (Mary of Jesus Crucified) and was chosen as the Mother Superior of the Order. When the nuns in Blato had exhausted their own funds for helping poor and hungry children, she went to fertile plains of Slavonia and Bačka to solicit help for the orphans and widows, receiving, among other contributions, a donation from Pope Pius XI. In return, Bishop of Bačka Apostolic Administration, Ljudevit Lajčo Budanović, asked Petković to found monasteries of her Order in Subotica and surrounding areas, so the locals could get the spiritual gain that nuns of her Order could provide them. Noticing that Bačka also had problems of numerous poor and abandoned children, in 1923, Petković acted quickly and opened &quot;Kolijevka&quot; Children&#x27;s Home in Subotica, Home for sick and neglected children, after which she opened numerous centers for children in Croatia (in Slavonia particularly), Serbia, and Vardar Macedonia.

From 1920 to 1952, Petković was elected five times as the Superior General of the Daughters of Mercy. She traveled throughout Croatia, Latin America, and Italy, opening 46 communities. The growing number of Sisters served in various social ministries, such as in nursing homes, kindergartens, hospitals, nursery schools, parish work, and work in the seminaries.
Beginning in 1936, the Order was prominent in Latin and South America. Petković lived in Argentina from 1940 to 1952, promoting charity work in many countries in Latin America. In addition to catechesis, she organized instruction in hygiene, economics, homemaking, sewing and tailoring, knitting, nursing, and typing. In 1952, she went to Rome to purchase and set up the Congregation&#x27;s headquarters. While there in 1954 she suffered a stroke which left her permanently paralyzed. In 1961, she concluded that her duty to the Congregation was no longer one of leadership but of sacrifice and suffering, prayer and offering herself to the Lord, and relinquished the office of Mother Superior that she had held for 40 years.

She continued to follow the events in the Catholic Church and her Congregation, especially those changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council, until age 74, when she died. She was buried in the Roman cemetery of Campo Verano. Three years later, her remains were translated to the house chapel of the Congregation headquarters, where they remained until 1998 when they were translated to her native Blato and buried in the crypt of the monastery chapel of Christ the King.

== Beatification ==
On 26 August 1988, the Peruvian submarine BAP &quot;Pacocha&quot; was rammed and sunk by a Japanese fishing trawler. &quot;Teniente&quot; (lieutenant) Roger Cotrina Alvarado, a Peruvian naval officer, distinguished himself during the disaster – praying for Petković&#x27;s aid, Cotrina displayed superhuman strength in opening a hatch against several thousands of pounds of water. That action prevented the immediate deaths of 22 crewmen, and Cotrina&#x27;s subsequent actions brought about their rescue.

On 28 February 1989, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints began an investigation into the reports of the miracle. On 8 May 1998, Pope John Paul II confirmed the Congregation&#x27;s initial report and decreed that Petković&#x27;s heroic virtues be publicly declared, formally recognizing her as &quot;Venerable.&quot;

The Congregation issued their ruling on Petković&#x27;s heroic virtues on 5 July 2002, and on the following 20 December issued a ruling recognizing the miraculous nature of the submarine rescue. On 6 June 2003, Pope John Paul II celebrated her beatification Mass in Dubrovnik, formally recognizing her as &quot;Blessed.&quot;

Today, her Congregation has its branches, besides other countries, in Italy, Romania (by Greek Catholic community), Paraguay, Chile, Peru and Argentina.

The Sanctuary of Blessed Marija Petković is in her town of birth, Blato on the Dalmatian island of Korčula.

<text>The Peruvian Navy (, abbreviated MGP) is the branch of the Peruvian Armed Forces tasked with surveillance, patrol and defense on lakes, rivers and the Pacific Ocean up to from the Peruvian littoral. Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting disaster relief operations and participating in international peacekeeping operations.

The &quot;Marina de Guerra del Perú&quot; celebrates the anniversary of its creation in 1821 on October 8 and also commemorates the decisive Battle of Angamos, the final part of the naval campaign of the War of the Pacific between Peru and Chile at the end of 1879.

==History==
===19th century===

The &quot;Marina de Guerra del Perú&quot; was established on 8 October 1821 by the government of general José de San Martín. Its first actions were undertaken during the War of Independence (1821–1824) using captured Spanish warships. The Peruvian Naval Infantry was also formed during the war with Spain, performing successfully in their first battle where they seized Arica from the Spanish.

Shortly afterwards it was engaged in the war against the Gran Colombia (1828–1829) during which it conducted a blockade against the seaport of Guayaquil and then assisted in the subsequent Peruvian occupation. The Navy saw further action during the war of the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy (1836–1839) and during the Chincha Islands War with Spain (1866).

The outbreak of the War of the Pacific (1879–1883) caught the Peruvian Navy unprepared and with inferior forces in comparison to the Chilean Navy. Even so, hit-and-run tactics carried out by Peruvian Admiral Miguel Grau, commander of the ironclad , famously delayed the Chilean advance by six months until his death and defeat at the Battle of Angamos.

===20th century===
Following the War of the Pacific, the Peruvian Navy had to be completely rebuilt. In 1900 the force consisted of only one cruiser of 1,700 tons displacement, a screw-driven steamer, and ten smaller ships – the latter described by a contemporary British publication as &quot;of no real value&quot;. The lengthy process of expansion and rebuilding started in 1907 with the acquisition from the United Kingdom of the scout cruisers and &quot;Coronel Bolognesi&quot;, followed by the arrival of two submarines, &quot;Ferré&quot; and &quot;Palacios&quot;, from France in 1911. During the Presidency of Augusto B. Leguía (1919–1930) a Navy Ministry was established as well as a Navy Aviation Corps, both in 1920.

Border conflicts with Colombia in 1911 and 1932 and a war with Ecuador in 1941 saw Peruvian warships involved in some skirmishes in support of the Army. The attack on Pearl Harbor brought World War II to the Pacific and even though Peru did not declare war on the Axis until 1945, its Navy was involved in patrol missions against possible threats by the Imperial Japanese Navy from early 1942 up to mid-1945.

During the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s the Peruvian Navy carried out a major buildup programme which allowed it to take advantage over its traditional rival, the Chilean Navy. The navy purchased one cruiser the BAP &quot;Almirante Grau&quot; (CLM-81) from the Netherlands, eight &quot;Carvajal&quot;-class frigates from Italy – four newly purchased and four ex-&quot;Lupo&quot;-class frigates – as well as six PR-72P-class corvettes from France. The buildup proved to be temporary due to the economic crisis of the second half of the 1980s, forcing the decommissioning of several warships and resulting in a general lack of funds for maintenance.

The economic upturn of the 1990s and into the 2000s would later permit some improvement, although at a reduced force level compared to the early 1980s.

=== 21st century ===
Into the 21st century, the Peruvian Navy began to modernize their ships. In 2008, the Type 209/1100 submarines were modernized while the &quot;Carvajal&quot;-class frigates began to be modernized in 2011. The Type 209/1200 submarines began to be modernized in late-2017 beginning with the BAP &quot;Chipana&quot; (SS-34).

SIMA has continued to construct ships for the Navy. In 2013, SIMA partnered with Posco Daewoo Corporation and Daesun Shipbuilding of South Korea to construct two &quot;Makassar&quot;-class landing platform docks. The , recently launched on 25 April 2017, as well as the BAP Paita which is currently under construction will provide Peru with increased expeditionary warfare capabilities, with the ability to accommodate multiple Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel, newly purchased LAV IIs and helicopters.

In 2018, a modernization program was initiated to upgrade Peru&#x27;s Type 209/1200 submarines, the BAP &quot;Chipana&quot;&quot;,&quot; BAP &quot;Angamos&quot;, BAP &quot;Antofagasta&quot; and BAP &quot;Pisagua&quot;, with a contract with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems being made for further assistance with SIMA&quot;.&quot;

During the 2017–present Peruvian political crisis, the Navy of Peru was involved in political scandals. During the first impeachment process against president Martín Vizcarra, the next in the order of succession to the presidency, President of the Congress Manuel Merino, had been in contact with the Commanding General of the Navy saying that he was attempting to remove Vizcarra from office. While the 2021 Peruvian general election was underway, the imprisoned former head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) Vladimiro Montesinos was able to make phone calls from a landline telephone at the Centro de Reclusión de Máxima Seguridad (CEREC) at the Callao Naval Base to organize projects and campaign support for Keiko Fujimori in the &quot;Vladi-audios&quot; scandal.

== Organization ==

The current Commander-in-Chief of the Peruvian Navy is Admiral Luis José Polar Figari. Naval Forces are subordinated to the Ministry of Defense and ultimately to the President as Chief Supreme of the Peruvian Armed Forces. They are organized as follows:

Although most of the fleet is based at Callao, this has not been considered an ideal location since it is also the main outlet for Peruvian trade, causing space and security problems. In the 1980s the building of a new naval base at Chimbote was considered though high costs and a poor economic situation made the project unfeasible.

==Peacekeeping operations==
The Peruvian Navy has been actively involved in several United Nations Peacekeeping Operations. As of June 2006 Naval Infantry and Special Operations troops have been deployed to United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) (embedded in the Argentine forces ) and United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Peruvian naval officers have also been deployed to United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), United Nations Operation in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UNOCI), United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) as United Nations Militar Observers (UNMOs). By 2012 the Peruvian Navy sent its first officer to serve in United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei.

<text>Mount Mazama (Klamath: &quot;Tum-sum-ne&quot;) is a complex volcano in the western U.S. state of Oregon, in a segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and Cascade Range. The volcano is in Klamath County, in the southern Cascades, north of the Oregon–California border. Its collapse, due to the eruption of magma emptying the underlying magma chamber, formed a caldera that holds Crater Lake (&quot;Giiwas&quot; in the Native American language Klamath). Mount Mazama originally had an elevation of , but following its climactic eruption this was reduced to . Crater Lake is deep, the deepest freshwater body in the U.S. and the second deepest in North America after Great Slave Lake in Canada.

Mount Mazama formed as a group of overlapping volcanic edifices such as shield volcanoes and small composite cones, becoming active intermittently until its climactic eruption 7,700 years ago. This eruption, the largest known within the Cascade Volcanic Arc in a million years, destroyed Mazama&#x27;s summit, reducing its approximate height by about . Much of the edifice fell into the volcano&#x27;s partially emptied neck and magma chamber, creating a caldera. The region&#x27;s volcanic activity results from the subduction of the offshore oceanic plate, and is influenced by local extensional faulting. Mazama is dormant, but the U.S. Geological Survey says eruptions on a smaller scale are likely, which would pose a threat to its surroundings.

Native Americans have inhabited the area around Mazama and Crater Lake for at least 10,000 years and the volcano plays an important role in local folklore. European-American settlers first reached the region in the mid-19th century. Since the late 19th century, the area has been extensively studied by scientists for its geological phenomena and more recently for its potential sources of geothermal energy. Crater Lake and Mazama&#x27;s remnants sustain diverse ecosystems, which are closely monitored by the National Park Service because of their remoteness and ecological importance. Recreational activities including hiking, biking, snowshoeing, fishing, as well as cross-country skiing are available; during the summer, campgrounds and lodges at Crater Lake are open to visitors.

== Geography ==
Mount Mazama is in Klamath County, within the U.S. state of Oregon, north of the border with California. It lies in the southern portion of the Cascade Range. Crater Lake sits partly inside the volcano&#x27;s caldera, with a depth of ; it is the deepest body of freshwater in the United States and the second deepest in North America after Great Slave Lake in Canada. Before its caldera-forming eruption, Mazama stood at an elevation between , placing it about above the lake; this would have made it Oregon&#x27;s highest peak. The Global Volcanism Program currently lists its elevation at .

=== Crater Lake National Park ===
Crater Lake National Park covers an area of , including forest areas, alpine terrain, the Crater Lake, and the vast majority of Mount Mazama. A wilderness area, it was dedicated in 1902 and is overseen by the National Park Service. It receives about 500,000 visitors each year, and these tourists can go hiking, take bike, ranger-guided, and trolley tours, swim, fish, camp, and participate in other recreational activities. While the park area remains open throughout the year, certain roads and facilities close in the winter season.

=== Physical geography ===
There was frequent glacier formation on the mountain as Mazama developed. They carved trenches in the flanks of the volcano in addition to U-shaped valleys under the base of the volcanic cone. These can be seen at three large glacial canyons on its southern slopes: Kerr Notch, Munson Valley, and Sun Notch. Whenever eruptions took place in the presence of ice, lava was chilled by glaciers, creating glassy talus deposits. Sometimes, the lava coursed into areas previously carved by glaciers like at Sentinel Rock, filling canyons with volcanic rock. Moraines occur up to from the rim of Mazama&#x27;s caldera, and there are glacial striations visible at several sites in the area. When the climactic eruption occurred, the climate was warm and dry, and the most recent period of glacial advance ceased about 27,000 years ago, so by the time Mazama collapsed, ice was likely only present at higher elevations. Using argon geochronology and paleoclimatic records, scientists have identified that the Sand Creek, Sun Creek, and Annie Creek canyons were carved by the advance of ice over lava flows, pushing debris towards Klamath Marsh and Klamath Graben or nearby rivers. A glacial cirque can be seen on Mount Scott&#x27;s northwestern flank, and glacial till occurs on Mazama&#x27;s slopes, especially on the western slopes and at lower elevations. Till and fluvial sediments occur in the caldera walls, forming particularly thick deposits under Roundtop and Wineglass. Many lava flows that were glaciated have since been covered by more recent lava flows.

Crater Lake formed from a network of lakes and ponds, eventually reaching a depth of . Lake levels rose while the Wizard Island landform inside the crater was forming. Water interacted with lava flows to form pillow lava. Because of climate change patterns over time, Crater Lake&#x27;s surface level has changed, dropping as much as for example at the beginning of the 20th century. The water from precipitation nearly equals water lost to evaporation and drainage, most leakage taking place at the Wineglass deposit at the northern side of the crater, without which the lake would likely have overflowed at the northern side.

Average snowfall in the Crater Lake area has been decreasing since the 1930s. Crater Lake&#x27;s mean surface water temperatures have increased about since the 1960s. Though this may eventually cause algae to grow and obscure the water, Crater Lake remains one of the cleanest bodies of water in the world.

Produced by the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone, which moves slowly in a northeastward direction with the Gorda tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate, Mazama is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc that stretches from northern California to southern British Columbia. It sits within a region of crustal extension marked by fault zones, including north–south-trending normal faults such as the Annie Spring fault within the West Klamath Lake fault zone, which might produce damaging earthquakes. Likewise, the Red Cone Spring fault cuts through basaltic andesite deposits at Red Cone from 35,000 years ago; together, the two faults move at an average rate of each year. There do not appear to be faults present in the Crater Lake caldera wall, but the volcano induced a stress field in the upper crust nearby.

Mazama is underlain by the Quaternary High Cascade basalt and mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) andesite to the west and southwest, with high-volume rhyodacite lava flows from 600,000 to 700,000 years old underlying Mazama deposits to the south, southeast, east, and northeast. It is a major Cascade volcano, and is at the intersection of the Cascade Range and Klamath graben, the north–northwest trending basin also surrounded by fault zones. The Basin and Range Province lies to the east. Mazama lies within the broad segment of the Cascades arc, where smaller volcanoes are common because of melting patterns of the Earth&#x27;s mantle within the region. Erupting magma that ranged from high-alumina olivine tholeiite to magnesian basaltic andesite, these volcanoes show increased contents of subduction-produced or melted fluids that mixed with another magma chamber in the mantle. These magmas vary from 47.6 percent to 73.2 percent silicon dioxide.

Mazama and Crater Lake form part of the Mazama reach (section) of the Oregon Cascades, which stretches for from Timber Crater to the Big Bunchgrass shield volcano. This includes 175 Quaternary volcanic vents within a belt that ranges from in width, which has a high vent density with many shields and monogenetic volcanic centers. After Newberry Volcano, Mazama is the second largest Quaternary volcanic edifice in Oregon, and the most voluminous, with an overall volume of . Mazama is the newest of the Quaternary calderas in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which also include the Newberry calderas and the caldera at the Medicine Lake Volcano. Quaternary monogenetic volcanism throughout Oregon&#x27;s High Cascades includes cinder cones, lava fields, and small shield volcanoes, which have produced lava ranging from low-potassium, high-alumina olivine tholeiite to medium-potassium calc-alkaline basalt, basaltic andesite to shoshonitic basaltic andesite.

The Mazama volcanic complex originally formed as a cluster of overlapping edifices. Made up of shield volcanoes and small stratocones, it had an irregular shape. Mount Scott, at a height of , marks the oldest visible remnant of this original cluster. Scott was the first of the composite volcanoes that created the Mazama complex, formed by a quick and active cone-building phase and becoming inactive long before the most recent eruption at Mazama. With time, eruptive activity moved to the west, creating the Applegate Peak and Garfield Peak cones on the southern flanks of the volcanic center. Hawaiian eruptions from neighboring shield volcanoes also built up Mazama, producing basaltic andesite lava flows that ranged from on average in thickness. These flows, present on the southern, western, and eastern walls of Mazama&#x27;s caldera, also contained lava bombs. Viscous eruptions of andesitic lava that reached thicknesses of several hundred feet further built up Mazama&#x27;s cones, creating a solid, dense interior rich with angular lava blocks.

Research by Howel Williams superimposed the Crater Lake caldera on other Cascade stratovolcanoes including Mount Shasta in California and Mount Rainier in Washington state, and concluded that Mazama stood at pre-collapse, which has been accepted as the standard estimate by geologists. By the Holocene, the Mazama volcano was made up of several, clustered peaks with Mount Scott on the eastern end and Hillman Peak on the far west side. The volcanoes likely rose in elevation from east to west, and they also featured volcanic cones and lava domes on their southern flanks. Glacial horns like the Watchman lava flow were also present, and the mountain may or may not have sustained glaciers close to the summit. At the time of its collapse, Mount Mazama encompassed an area of and represented one of the major volcanoes in the High Cascades branch of the greater Cascade Range. It was the largest volcanic edifice between Mount Shasta in California and the Three Sisters complex in Oregon. Before the eruption, it had been significantly altered by glacial erosion, which carved U-shaped valleys on its southern and southeastern slopes. The northern and western sides of the caldera do not show prominent evidence of glacial erosion, since they feature lava flows that only underwent alteration by late Pleistocene epoch glacial motion. Outside of the caldera, most hills show evidence of glacial alteration except those from the Holocene epoch and low elevation landforms including Pleistocene lava domes and cinder cones. Mount Scott has also been heavily eroded by ice, and the Union Peak volcano now consists only of a pyramidal horn.

Though it now has dimensions of and a width of , scientists think the original collapse diameter was . It now includes several small lava domes and cinder cones, including Wizard Island and the underwater volcano Merriam Cone. The highest elevation in the Mazama Complex is now Mount Scott, at an elevation of , with a relief of above Crater Lake&#x27;s surface waters. Except for the tallest slopes of the complex, all cones have been covered with deposits from the climactic eruption at Mazama 7,700 years ago. Scientists now use the exposed contents of the caldera rim wall to investigate eruptions and mapping the eruptive history of the region. Throughout its known eruptions, Mazama has produced 43 percent rhyodacite, 42 percent andesite, 15 percent dacite, and less than 1 percent basaltic andesite. All of the rhyodacite has been produced within the past 30,000 years of activity, suggesting that regional and local distribution of compositions were not uniform over time. Andesite and dacite lava flows from the volcano usually have plagioclase as their major phenocryst, though augite and hypersthene are also present, the latter more abundant. Olivine form minor phenocrysts, which are found throughout lava flows from Mazama, and hornblende can be found in some andesite lava flows. Basalt and mafic andesite lava flows from Mazama and nearby eruptive vents have relatively higher amounts of olivine and lack hypersthene, and the mafic andesite deposits display textures that indicate they underwent greater mixing than andesite and dacite deposits.

=== Subfeatures ===

Formed of a complex of stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes, there are about 35 known satellite vents in the Mazama complex. Mazama is surrounded by monogenetic cinder cones, lava fields, and shield volcanoes made up of calc-alkaline basalt and andesite, tholeiite, and shoshonitic andesite. Varying in age from 600,000 to 40,000 years old, these edifices closely resemble other monogenetic volcanoes in the High Cascades. Extending from the eastern half of Mazama and to the southeast lies a volcanic field consisting of rhyodacitic lava domes and lava flows between 700,000 and 600,000 years old, which encompasses an area of more than . This large field is underlain by rhyodacite in its southeastern segment, and is cut by north–south trending normal faults.

Moving from west to northwest, Mazama stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes grow progressively younger. The oldest, at 400,000 years old, occur at Phantom Ship and Mount Scott, while the youngest can be found at the Hillman Peak stratovolcano, dated to 70,000 years old. There are also andesite flows at the northern rim of Mazama dated to between 50,000 and 40,000 years old. Shield volcanoes near Mazama feature lava flows made of agglutinated mafic andesite, which form sheets about thick, as well as more deposits from more viscous andesite and dacite magma that reach thicknesses up to . Many of these deposits (both dacitic and andesitic) contain undercooled, crystal-poor segments of andesite, including at Mount Scott and Phantom Cone. Lava and ice interactions are suggested by exposures of glassy breccia in Mazama&#x27;s caldera, as well as lava flows covering glaciated lava deposits.

About 70,000 years ago, several silicic (rich in silicon dioxide), explosive eruptions occurred, including a significant event at Pumice Castle on the eastern wall of Mazama. This formed welded deposits near the vent, also forming non-welded deposits to the south and on the northern part of Mazama. Between 40,000 years ago and Mazama&#x27;s major eruption, no andesitic or dacitic volcanism took place. However, rhyodacitic magma was erupted at Grouse Hill, Steel Bay, and Redcloud Cliff in the form of pumice and lava flows made of hornblende-phyric, or chemically evolved, rhyodacite. During this period of the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, lava domes such as those at Sharp Peak, Grouse Hill, and Merriam Point formed, sharing chemical compositions, with silica contents at about 70%.

Pyroclastic cones at Mazama include Wizard Island, Bald Crater, Maklaks Crater (also known as Diller Cone) and Forgotten Cone. In addition to its crater, referred to as Williams Crater or the Forgotten Crater, Mazama&#x27;s various volcanic vents occur at Cleetwood, Llao Rock, and Redcloud, which are at elevations of , , and , respectively. Nearby cinder cones include Bear Butte, Crater Peak, Desert Cone, Lookout Butte, Pothole Butte, Red Cone, Scout Hill, and Union Peak. There are at least 13 cinder cones within Crater Lake National Park, and at least eleven more in the nearby area. They were fed by a different magma chamber than Mazama, though they likely received magma from basaltic andesite reservoirs in the vicinity. The exception is Williams crater, which erupted basalt and dacite and got silicic lava from the western part of Mazama&#x27;s magma chamber. Stratovolcanoes in Mazama&#x27;s vicinity consist of Sentinel Rock, Mount Scott, Phantom Cone, Dutton Cliff, and Danger Bay.

Mazama has a few composite cones in the vicinity of the caldera. At about 420,000 years old, Mount Scott has a conical shape, but has been extensively altered by Pleistocene glacial erosion, which carved a large cirque on its western flank and smaller ones on its eastern and northeastern sides. Scott lacks a summit crater. Hillman Peak was the youngest composite cone in the Mazama eruptive center, forming about 70,000 years ago. It lies on the southwestern side of the caldera, and it represents the highest point on the Mazama rim, rising above Crater Lake. The cone was cut down the middle during Mazama&#x27;s collapse post-eruption, creating a cross-section of its interior composition.

Shield volcanoes that contributed to Mazama&#x27;s growth only erupted for several hundred to several thousand years. They erupted rapidly, spraying fluid lava that included lava bombs and incandescent fragments. Llao shield on the northwestern side of the Mazama complex shows a representative structure for the shields that helped form Mazama.

== Eruptive history ==
=== Early activity ===

The Mazama vicinity formed gradually, its earliest deposits consisting of dacite from up to 1.28 million years ago. Between 725,000 and 500,000 years ago, rhyodacite was erupted, eventually forming a lava dome field with a volume of and dimensions of . This featured up to 40 rhyodacitic domes and lava flows, produced between 470,000 and 410,000 years ago before stratocone formation began.

Mazama formed as a group of overlapping volcanic edifices, which included shield volcanoes and small composite cones.
Cone-building eruptions took place within short periods of time. Shield volcanoes fed Mazama&#x27;s expansion with basaltic andesite lava flows that covered large expanses on the slopes of the mountain. Forming lava fountains similar to those observed in Hawaiian eruptions, the shield volcanoes erupted incandescent lava bombs and were deposited on the southern, western, and eastern flanks of the complex. They have average thicknesses of . Roughly 215,000 years ago, another flank vent erupted dacitic lava that coursed to the west for at least , with volcanic dikes that trend toward the vent still present in the Mazama caldera wall. The complex remained inactive for about 40,000 years before it resumed activity, erupting andesitic lava from another flank vent, building a large shield volcano from 170,000 to 120,000 years ago. Other andesitic lava deposits can be observed in the caldera wall&#x27;s northern side. The Mazama complex was inactive between 100,000 and 75,000 years ago. About 75,000 years ago, the volcano erupted effusive lava flows of andesite that formed thick deposits below Hillman Peak that extended at least from the caldera rim.

Many of the major cone-creating eruptions at Mazama were effusive rather than violently explosive, but explosive eruptions about 70,000 years ago yielded silicic lava that created thick pyroclastic deposits. These deposits include Pumice Castle, an orange edifice at the eastern wall of the caldera, which formed by the fusion of glassy pumice fragments. Similar activity on the northern side of Cloudcap and the eastern segment of Llao Rock that ejected dacitic tephra and pyroclastic rock also formed fused edifices. About 50,000 years ago, a vent at Mazama erupted the Watchman flow, which filled a canyon at the southwestern wall of the complex. From 50,000 to 40,000 years ago, Mazama vents continued to erupt andesite lava flows onto the northern and southwestern slopes and create dacite lava domes on the southern flanks. These domes often collapsed and produced pyroclastic flows that coursed down the southern slope of the volcano, forming deposits up to Devil&#x27;s Backbone, a craggy volcanic dike that was exhumed when the volcano collapsed.

Throughout its eruptive history, Mazama has produced basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite lava. About 40,000 years ago, it underwent a dramatic shift to solely rhyodacite lava, which was highly viscous and had a silica content at about 70 percent. Between 30,000 and 25,000 years ago, rhyodacitic eruptions occurred at the complex, yielding pumiceous tephra and lava flows from Grouse Hill, Steel Bay, and Redcloud Cliff. At Redcloud Cliff, a lava flow formed with glassy columns that touched glaciers, creating a large, inverted stone triangle on the eastern rim of Mazama. These same eruptions formed a nearly vertical-walled crater, producing pumice and creating a dome over the Redcloud vent. Grouse Hill&#x27;s lava flow deposit and lava dome formed at about the same time, about 27,000 years ago. At the end of this eruptive sequence, rhyodacite lava domes formed on the northeastern slopes of the volcano.

Between 100 and 200 years before the climactic eruption, Llao Rock, a thick block of dark lava with a volume of , was produced from a rhyodacite flow erupted from Mazama. It has a round center and extensions on the sides, resembling a bird of prey. The formation of Llao Rock was preceded by explosive eruptions of rhyodacite, creating pumice and ash that were ejected high into the atmosphere and carried for several hundred miles into northern and eastern Washington state, eastern Oregon, and western Nevada. A large crater formed but was filled by subsequent lava flows. Shortly before the major, caldera-forming eruption at Mazama, the Cleetwood flow was produced. Also composed of rhyodacite lava, it originated from a vent on the northern side of the complex eastward of Llao Rock. It likely only occurred weeks or months before the major eruption, as Mazama&#x27;s collapse formed a backward flow of lava when it cut through the Cleetwood lava, suggesting that the Cleetwood lava was still hot enough to flow and move. Tephra from the last major eruption that was emplaced atop Cleetwood deposits has been altered by heat and gas from the Cleetwood lava. Both these eruptive periods took place on the northern flank of the Mazama complex, not far from the magma chamber that produced the climactic eruption shortly after.

=== Climactic eruption ===
Mazama&#x27;s climactic eruption has been dated to about 6,845 ± 50 years ago via radiocarbon dating, or about 7,700 years ago via dendrochronology. Other scientists have determined ages of 6,730 ± 40 years ago or roughly 7,470–7,620 calendar years ago, as well as 7,627 ± 150 calendar years ago. Fallout from the eruption continued for roughly three years, though the major eruption only occurred for a few days. The eruption is thought to have occurred during autumn, as inferred from pollen data.

The eruptive activity that led to Mazama&#x27;s collapse proceeded in two phases. During the first phase, shortly after the eruption of the &quot;Cleetwood flow&quot;, a vent at a higher elevation on the northern side of the Mazama complex (but still below the summit) produced a high ash column into the stratosphere and ejecting over half the eruption&#x27;s total magma. The second stage erupted material from a ring of vents. Ash extended to eight states in the west and three Canadian provinces. As a result, Mazama Ash has become a commonly used benchmark for measuring the relative age of objects, compared to its orange colored deposits. Pumice deposits reached depths of adjacent to Mazama&#x27;s base, still reaching thicknesses more than as far as to the northeast. The ejecta featured blocks of medium-grain granodiorite, as well as inclusions of diabase, quartz diorite, granite, aplite, and granophyre. Ashfall layers have been eroded by pyroclastic flows and with time, but they are still visible at Hillman Peak and along the Cleetwood Trail. The Plinian column from the eruption devastated the area hundreds of miles north and northeast of Mazama, but to the southwest and west, little pumice or ash were deposited.

The eruption&#x27;s character changed dramatically as the column of pumice and ash collapsed. The exact cause is not well understood; it may have been the result of the enormous weight of the tephra or the expansion of the eruptive vent. The sudden deposition of so much pumice generated pyroclastic flows that moved down the northern side of the volcano, coursing west–east from Llao Rock to Redcloud Cliff. The first of these pyroclastic flows were deposited at superheated temperatures, welding fragments and creating the Wineglass welded tuff, which consists of big blocks of orange-brown and gray rock. These emplacements can only be observed on the northern slopes; they are absent from the southern slopes of the volcano.

Mazama was covered with incandescent pumice. The extreme weight of eruptive material began to push down on the volcano&#x27;s summit, similar to a piston. Eventually, the top of Mazama&#x27;s magma chamber subsided, and concentric openings formed by the summit, producing smaller vents surrounding the main eruptive cone. Pumice ejected from these new fractures created rapid pyroclastic flows that coursed down all the sides of Mazama, traveling over tall ridges and summits of subfeatures and extending tens of miles from their vents. These flows altered the surfaces surrounding Mazama, removing ashfall and then depositing their contents in nearby valleys. Some of the flows traveled more than from their source, destroying timber in their paths, while others deposited their rock into river valleys to the north and west of Mazama, leaving layers of pumice between in thickness. Ash clouds also rose up from the pyroclastic flows. Pyroclastic flows also moved to the east, reaching more than from the base of Mazama. These deposits have diameters between , though they are punctuated by pumice blocks with diameters of that extend as far as from Mazama&#x27;s summit. Flows containing pumice coursed into the Annie Creek and Sun Creek canyons southward of Mazama, depositing of material, which have still not been fully eroded after almost 8,000 years. To the southeast, pyroclastic flows coursed into Sand Creek and extended more than in that direction, some reaching Klamath Marsh, the Williamson River, and the Klamath Lakes.

Mazama&#x27;s eruptive activity drew from deeper layers of the magma chamber that fed its climactic eruption, with denser layers of andesite and basaltic andesite lying beneath lighter layers of rhyodacite. The last of the pyroclastic flows erupted contained andesitic, gray scoria that was deposited above the pale orange and yellow rhyodacite pumice from earlier phases of the eruption. The final eruptions formed the Pumice Desert, a treeless plain on the northern and northeastern side of Mazama, as well as filling the Pumice Creek valley and parts of the Klamath Marsh. Reaching thicknesses between , the emplacements from these flows yielded fumarolic activity, still detectable in the Annie Creek and Sand Creek canyons. Erosion from rain and stream flow has left pipes from the andesitic lava flows as columns and spires.

Before collapse due to eruption of magma emptying the underlying magma chamber, the Mazama edifice had an estimated volume of , though it may have exceeded taking glacial erosion into account. After the climactic eruption, Mazama&#x27;s peak was completely destroyed, replaced by a depression with a depth of surrounded by cliffs. The volume of magma erupted from Mazama during this eruption was 14 cubic miles (61 km3). The lava produced was zoned vertically according to arrangement within the source magma chamber, and was calc-alkaline in composition. It consisted of roughly 90 percent uniform rhyodacitic pumice, which contained about 10 percent phenocrysts, the rest made up of crystalline andesite scoria and mafic crystals. The total eruptive volume adds up to 42 cubic miles (176 km3) of pumice, ignimbrite, and tephra. The eruption released aerosols that lowered temperatures globally in the Northern Hemisphere, with estimates of for one to three years after the eruption. The temperature changes were possibly greater than the effects of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora. Mazama&#x27;s climactic eruption produced stratospheric mass loadings of of sulfuric acid, with an estimated minimum sulfate degassing of during its eruption. Aerosol from the eruption traveled as far as Greenland, falling for as long as six years.

The United States Geological Survey has referred to the 7,700 years ago Mazama eruption as the largest explosive eruption within the Cascades in the past million years, however recent studies say that the volume of the Rockland ash, which erupted from the Lassen Volcanic Center about 600,000 years ago could be up to 326.7 km3, which would make it over twice the size of the Mazama ash. Mazama&#x27;s climactic eruption was one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene epoch. Considering Mazama&#x27;s eruptive output within the past 420,000 years, it may have produced more than of eruptive volume, making it either the third or fourth most productive Quaternary volcanic center in the Cascade Range. The eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7, as determined from eruption cloud height, eruptive volume, and qualitative observations.

==== Mazama Ash ====
In the western United States and Canada, volcanic ash often forms distinct layers among recent geological deposits, which can be used for stratigraphy among geologists and archaeologists. Given the large distribution of the historic eruption of Mount Mazama, Mazama Ash serves as a common geological marker. Mazama Ash had a minimum fallout area of , while ash from northwestern Washington&#x27;s Glacier Peak volcano, known as Glacier Peak Ash, encompassed an area of more than . Mazama Ash is found at a higher layer than the Glacier Peak ash, estimated to have deposited over 13,000 years ago. Mazama Ash is the most widely distributed tephra layer from the late Quaternary in the United States and southwestern Canada, extending to eight states to the west and three Canadian provinces. It forms orange colored deposits.

Like the Glacier Peak Ash deposits, Mazama Ash is well preserved in the Pacific Northwest. It is distinguishable from the lump pumice deposits ejected from the Glacier Peak volcano, which contain more phenocrysts. Mazama Ash also has more soda, yttrium, ytterbium, and zirconium, and less silica and lime than eruptive products from Glacier Peak, and it forms finer deposits than Glacier Peak Ash.

With an age between 6,000 and 7,000 years, Mazama Ash corresponds to the estimated time for Mazama&#x27;s climactic eruption 6,600 years ago, identified by radiocarbon dating of wood charred by ashflows. Some of the Glacier Peak ash has been found in strata beneath Mazama Ash in Washington state and in eastern Idaho, to the southeast of Glacier Peak. Studies of Glacier Peak Ash deposits suggest that they are older than Mazama Ash, at about 12,000 years old. Glacier Peak Ash has not been found in deposits less than 10,000 years old, and nearly all human artifacts have been found above its deposits, except for a site at Birch Creek where non-diagnostic artifacts were discovered beneath Glacier Peak Ash.

=== Recent activity and potential hazards ===
Since the climactic eruption 7,700 years ago, all eruptive activity at Mazama has occurred within the caldera. After the caldera formed, the original crater was widened by avalanches from the walls. These gave a scalloped profile to the caldera, such as the coves at Llao Bay, Steel Bay, and Grotto Cove. The Chaski slide, for example, the most prominent landslide detectable on the caldera wall, occurred long after the formation of the crater. Located on the southern side, it contains lava blocks between in length, many of which now reside underwater on the floor of Crater Lake. As the crater filled with landslides, lava, and water, the caldera&#x27;s appearance changed over time. New cones and lava fields have formed inside the caldera, all of which have been submerged except for Wizard Island. Mapping the caldera floor with high-resolution multibeam echo sounders, vehicle-motion sounders and navigators, and a dual-differential global positioning system (DGPS), scientists from the US government and universities detected volcanoes and landslide deposits under the water. Between 7,700 and 7,200 years ago, the central lava platform, the Merriam Cone, and Wizard Island were produced, as well as lava flows. These eruptions produced of andesitic lava, half of that in the Wizard Island cone. Wizard Island lava interacted with water to form breccia piles, and as the water levels rose, only the top of the Wizard Island edifice stayed above the water. The edifice has a lavaberg shape, as it sits above a larger, ovular pedestal rising above the floor of Crater Lake; just two percent of Wizard Island sits above the water surface. At the summit of the above-water cone, a small lava flow from a lava fountain appears, on the southwestern flank. There is also a volcanic plug poking out of the crater floor as a body of dark lava. Lava blocks with diameters of can be seen along the rim of the crater, possibly produced from later stages of cone-building eruptions that created Wizard Island. The central platform was created by a similar vent eastward of Wizard Island, made up of effusive lava that created lava fields northward and eastward of its vent. Merriam Cone does not have a summit crater, but rises to above the northern lake floor. Merriam Cone was produced underwater, and was probably formed at the same or similar time as Wizard Island and the central platform.

Mazama was last active about 4,800 years ago, when an eruption took place near Wizard Island&#x27;s eastern base. This eruption took place underwater, and it produced viscous lava that created a rhyodacite lava dome, about 2,400 years after the first period of postcaldera activity. Given that Mazama has had periods of sporadic eruptions for 420,000 years, the United States Geological Survey thinks that it is &quot;virtually certain&quot; that Mazama will erupt again in the future. Mazama is considered dormant, but it remains monitored by the United States Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory. Future eruptions would likely take place near the western side of the complex and within the caldera rim; they could occur underwater. The ejection of lava rich in gas from shallow water could produce huge ash columns, but submarine eruptions at deeper depths may decrease the explosiveness of the event. Nonetheless, the rapid mixing of water and lava could produce dangerous pyroclastic surges, which are more gaseous and less solid than pyroclastic flows. Such flows could pass over topographic barriers, move rock fragments at , and travel several miles from their vent. Mazama is unlikely to produce mudflows far from the caldera, though a nearby vent outside the caldera could erupt and mix with snow. Eruptions are unlikely to produce waves that extend beyond Crater Lake, but powerful explosions could produce tall waves in the caldera. An eruption as explosive as the one 7,700 years ago is unlikely given that it would require larger volumes of magma than are known to be available within the Mazama vicinity. Landslides could flood adjacent shoreline regions, but they are not likely to induce failure of the caldera&#x27;s walls, as they rise more than above the lake&#x27;s surface. Earthquakes from the nearby West Klamath Lake fault zone could reach magnitudes up to 7.0 on the Richter scale, but these only occur every 3,000 to 10,000 years; they could generate tall waves by creating landslides. Though local earthquakes from volcanic activity would create motion in the lake, they would likely only reach maximum magnitudes of 5.0 on the Richter scale. Crater Lake is poorly monitored, and not highly active seismically among the Cascade volcanoes. The largest earthquake threat originates from the Cascadia subduction zone, which could produce earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 or 9 that could lead to huge waves in Crater Lake.

Though the population within of Mount Mazama is only about 50 people, more than 270,000 live within of the volcano. Even so, highly consequential eruptions at Mazama seem unlikely in the near future. Large, pyroclastic eruptions like the climactic eruption are unlikely for thousands of years. Similarly, the release of lethal gases like carbon dioxide from Crater Lake, similar to the eruption from Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986, is unlikely as a result of the natural mixing of deep and surface water within the lake. There is no known mechanism by which Crater Lake&#x27;s water could be catastrophically drained or by which the caldera walls would fail suddenly. Minor hydrothermal explosions could still potentially be dangerous, as the ejection of ballistic blocks or tall waves could threaten people standing near the lake, traveling at speeds from . Landslides could threaten visitors to the national park or researchers by creating tsunami-sized waves, also potentially damaging infrastructure surrounding the lake.

== Geothermal energy ==
Studies of heat flow and the water chemistry in Crater Lake and the alteration of rocks older than 120,000 years ago suggest that hydrothermal areas exist in the Mazama vicinity. Most springs show similar chemistry, from the weathering of volcanic glass and clinopyroxene. These features probably formed due to processes related to residual heat from the magma chamber that produced the climactic Mazama eruption 7,700 years ago. The lake shows convective mixing that cycles every three years as thermal fluid moves into the lake through its floor, creating thermal springs that formed silica spires with heights up to . As a result, the California Energy Company drilled two geothermal exploration wells: the MZI-11A with a depth of to the east of the national park barrier at the Scott Creek Drainage, and the MZII-1 with a depth of to the south of the same boundary and to the east of Annie Creek. The maximum temperature they have observed at the southern well is , while the maximum temperature was at the eastern well. The convective heat discharge in Crater Lake marks the third largest in the Cascades, after the Austin Hot Springs and at Lassen Volcanic National Park. Scientists from the United States Geological Survey think that sources for geothermal energy use exist at Mazama and Crater Lake.

== Ecology ==
Crater Lake National Park and the area surrounding Mount Mazama range in elevation from , providing diverse habitats. In the Cascades, the topography and elevation have influenced local climate patterns, also shaping global climate when volcanic gas and dust have been released into the atmosphere. The southern region of the park supports ponderosa pine forests, and for elevations from , mixed coniferous, fir, and hemlock forests are common. Subalpine zones occur above , often featuring whitebark pine.

Ecological disturbances tend to cause decreasing damage with increasing distance from the source, but volcanic eruptions can lead to more uniform patterns of disruption for their surrounding landscapes. The immediate surroundings of Mazama continue to recover from the eruption.

There are more than 50 mammal species in Crater Lake National Park. Opossum species such as the Virginia opossum can be found infrequently, while shrew and mole species in the park area include marsh shrews, Pacific shrews, American water shrews, fog shrews, Trowbridge&#x27;s shrews, vagrant shrews, American shrew moles, and broad-footed moles. Bats frequently sighted within the park area include the little brown bat, hoary bat, and big brown bat, while the California myotis, silver-haired bat, Yuma myotis, long-eared myotis, long-legged myotis, and pallid bat are more rare. There are populations of American pikas, snowshoe hares, and white-tailed jackrabbits in the region, as well as many rodent species. Chipmunks like yellow-pine chipmunks, least chipmunks, Siskiyou chipmunks, and Townsend&#x27;s chipmunks can be seen, along with various beaver species including mountain beavers and North American beavers. The mammals of the National Park area also include various species of squirrel, mice, vole, and gophers, as well as yellow-bellied marmots and North American porcupines. Carnivorous mammals consist of coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, American black bears, raccoons, martens, fishers, ermines, long-tailed weasels, minks, wolverines, American badgers, western spotted skunks, striped skunks, North American river otters, cougars, and lynxes such as bobcats. Elk, mule deer, and pronghorns can also be found, though more frequently during the summer season.

Bird species in the Crater Lake National Park area include various biological families. Common bird species include hairy woodpeckers, great horned owls, blue grouse, common ravens, dark-eyed juncos, mountain chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, brown creepers, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, and Canada jays, which are visible throughout the year; American kestrels, northern flickers, golden-crowned kinglets, Cordilleran flycatchers, Steller&#x27;s jays, western tanagers, Swainson&#x27;s thrushes, hermit thrushes, American robins, and rufous hummingbirds that frequent the area in the summer season; and mountain and western bluebirds in the fall and summer. Olive-sided flycatchers and chipping sparrows are common during the spring and summer seasons, while yellow-rumped warblers, pine siskins, and Cassin&#x27;s finches can frequently be seen during spring, summer, and fall.

In the early 20th century, Bull trout were present in many streams and rivers throughout the National Park area, particularly the Sun Creek and lower Annie Creek areas. Locals began stocking streams with non-native trout populations, forcing Brook trout to compete for resources and leading to their local extinction in Annie Creek, along with a significant decline in Sun Creek by the end of the 1980s. By 1992, Crater Lake National Park initiated a bull trout conservation project, removing invasive fish populations with electrofishing, snorkeling, and introduction of the toxin and inhibitor of cellular respiration antimycin A. They also created small barriers to keep new trout from reaching Sun Creek. In 1999, Bull trout were considered a &quot;threatened&quot; species by the Endangered Species Act, though locally, there are now about 2,000 Bull trout in the stream, almost ten times as many as the low point for Bull trout abundance at just 200 fish. The project now works with the state government to expand Bull trout distributions from Sun Creek into neighboring forests with fish barriers and removal of invasive fish species.

Climate change threatens the American pika populations in the Crater Lake area, as they cannot tolerate warm weather because their fur does not release heat efficiently. Climate change might be diminishing their food supply via disturbances of vegetation growth patterns. At least three pika populations in Oregon have disappeared within the past few decades. Likewise, as a result of climate change, mountain pine beetle infestations have become more frequent among Whitebark pines on the rim of Crater Lake and present on nearby peaks. The National Park Service estimates that roughly half of the whitebark pines in Crater Lake National Park have died or are dying. Because the ecosystem in Crater Lake is isolated from the regional area, it holds particular interest from ecologists, so the United States National Park Service closely monitors human and natural changes to the lake environment.

== Human history ==
The Klamath Native Americans of the area believed that Mount Mazama was inhabited by Llao, their &quot;Chief of the Below World.&quot; After the mountain destroyed itself the Klamaths recounted the events as a great battle between Llao and his rival Skell, their sky god, or &quot;Chief of the Above World.&quot; The narrative has several slightly different iterations. A common variant of the legend recounts that Llao saw a beautiful Klamath woman, the daughter of a chief, and became angry when she refused his offer of immortality if she would be his consort. Furious, Llao emerged from Mazama and threw fire upon the people beneath the mountain, and Skell stood on Mount Shasta, trying to defend the people against Llao&#x27;s fury. As the earth shook and volcanic rock fell from the sky, two holy men sacrificed themselves to Mount Mazama&#x27;s crater, and Skell was able to force Llao back into the volcano, which then collapsed on top of him; other accounts tell that Skell smashed the peak on top of Llao. Torrential rain followed, filling in the hole left by Mazama&#x27;s collapse to form Crater Lake.

Native American people have lived in the area near Mazama for at least 10,000 years. At least part of the surrounding vicinity was occupied by indigenous populations when Mazama resumed activity about 8,000 years ago, following about 20,000 years of dormancy. Most evidence suggests that Mazama served as a camp site, but not a permanent place of habitation. Sagebrush sandals have been discovered to the east of the mountain. These populations faced an increasingly dry climate and the hazards associated with volcanic activity. In civilizations south of Mazama, stories about the volcano&#x27;s eruption have been transmitted for many generations. Native populations did not tell settlers about the area because it held sacred importance among tribes throughout Oregon and northern California. Shamans did not allow local Native Americans to look towards Crater Lake, and the Klamath people believed that just looking at Mazama would cause death. Some Native Americans still refuse to look at the water.

During the 19th century, one Klamath leader named Lalek predicted scientific discoveries that described Mount Mazama&#x27;s destruction, claiming that it had collapsed as a result of a particularly violent eruption. Geologists had not discovered this mechanism for caldera formation yet, but the hypothesis was recorded by the soldier William M. Colvig in 1865, and then reprinted in Ella Clark&#x27;s &quot;Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest&quot;.

The last major volcanic landform in the Cascade Range identified by white settlers, Mazama was first visited by non-indigenous people in the spring of 1853. Eleven miners from Yreka, California, stopped at a mercantile store in Jacksonville, Oregon, owned by Isaac Skeeters, boasting that they knew where to find a gold mine called &quot;Lost Cabin.&quot; Financed by a successful gold miner named John Wesley Hillman, Skeeters led a team with ten other Oregonians to find the mine. On June 12, they reached Crater Lake, which Skeeters noted had the bluest water he had ever seen, suggesting they name it &quot;Deep Blue Lake.&quot; The trip failed to procure gold before running low on provisions. With the absence of gold in that region, their discovery was quickly forgotten.

By 1862, a separate group of Oregon prospectors led by Chauncey Nye reached the Crater Lake area. Nye authored an article for the Jacksonville &quot;Oregon Sentinel&quot; in which he wrote that he had named the depression Blue Lake for its color, the first published description of the lake. Fort Klamath was established in 1863, to the southeast of the current boundaries of the National Park area. A wagon road was built to the Fort from the Rogue River Valley as a result. On August 1, 1865, the lake was encountered by hunters on the road, and a party of soldiers and civilians went to see the lake after hearing of their observations. Sergeant Orsen Stearns climbed down into the caldera, followed shortly after by Captain F. B. Sprague, who thought they should name the lake &quot;Lake Majesty&quot;. Newspaper editor Jim Sutton and a group of people visited Crater Lake in August 1869, using a boat to reach Wizard Island and publishing an article about their experience in the Jacksonville newspaper. Sutton suggested the new name of &quot;Crater Lake&quot;.

Mount Mazama received its English name in 1896 from William G. Steel, the founder of the climbing club The Mazamas, which formed at Mount Hood in 1894. The word comes from a Native American word meaning &quot;mountain goat&quot;, derived from an Aztec term to refer to &quot;small deer&quot;. Steel gave United States Geological Survey geologist Joseph S. Diller the idea for Mazama&#x27;s name to help promote national park status for the vicinity by using his organization as the inspiration for the mountain&#x27;s name. Crater Lake is called &quot;Giiwas&quot; in the Klamath language. Steel had helped map Crater Lake in 1886 with Clarence Dutton of the United States Geological Survey. The conservation movement in the United States was gaining traction, so Steel&#x27;s efforts to preserve the Mazama area were achieved on two scales, first with the creation of the local Cascade Range Forest Reserve in 1893, and then on May 22, 1902, with the recognition of Crater Lake National Park.

A few decades after its discovery, Mazama began attracting geological interest. After conducting research at Mazama during the 1880s, in 1902, Joseph S. Diller published a major report with the United States Geological Survey concerning Crater Lake National Park. In the study, he and co-author Horace B. Patton made the claim that Mazama had collapsed instead of being blown apart, the first American geologists to do so. Their work was followed by research led by Howel Williams of the University of California, Berkeley, which was published in 1942. In the paper, Williams mapped the volcano&#x27;s dacite and andesite lava flow deposits. During the 1980s, Charles Bacon and other United States Geological Survey geologists expanded on Williams&#x27;s work, determining more specific details about its caldera formation.

== Recreation ==
Located north of the city of Klamath Falls and northeast of Medford, Crater Lake can be reached from U.S. Route 97 on the east, on the southwest by Highway 62, and on the northwest by Highway 138. Crater Lake and the remnants of Mount Mazama can be seen from Rim Drive, a road that surrounds the caldera, which is the only part within the Crater Lake National Park where vehicles are permitted. The Garfield Peak Trail, which runs east from the Crater Lake Lodge, offers views from above the lake&#x27;s surface, with Mount Shasta visible southward. Another trail runs for from Rim Drive&#x27;s eastern edge to Mount Scott, which offers views of central and southern Oregon such as the Three Sisters north of Mazama and Mount Thielsen, also to the north. The Cleetwood trail leads for down the northern flank of the caldera rim, eventually reaching Cleetwood Cove where boat trips run from late June or early July throughout the summer season to Wizard Island. Wizard Island can be climbed, offering views of Crater Lake.

Because Mount Mazama lies within a national park area, collecting rocks within the vicinity is prohibited unless a permit is obtained. The park&#x27;s facilities lie at Rim Village, at the southern edge of the caldera. Lodging and camping facilities open during the summer season between May and October. No lodges, gas stations, or camping areas remain open from October through late May. Popular activities within Crater Lake National Park include biking, fishing, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing.

<text>Herbert Arthur Wiglev Clamor Grönemeyer (born 12 April 1956) is a German singer, musician, producer, composer and actor, popular in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Grönemeyer starred as war correspondent Lieutenant Werner in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Das Boot&quot;, but later focused on his musical career. His fifth album &quot;4630 Bochum&quot; (1984) and his 11th album &quot;Mensch&quot; (2002) are the fourth and second best-selling records in Germany respectively, making Grönemeyer the most successful artist in Germany with combined album sales over 13 million.

== Early life ==
Grönemeyer was born on 12 April 1956 in Göttingen. He often refers to his personal roots as living in Bochum though, where he spent most of his childhood, youth and early adulthood. The medical professor Dietrich Grönemeyer is his brother. Grönemeyer&#x27;s interest in music was sparked at the age of 8, when he started to take piano lessons.

==Career==

Piano classes formed the basis for his work as a pianist and composer at the local theatre Schauspielhaus Bochum. In 1979, at the City of Cologne Theatre (Schauspielhaus Köln), he performed as Lorenzo in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. Although never having attended an acting school he soon appeared in several TV productions. During one of the shootings he met his later wife, the actress . Additionally, Grönemeyer published an album he had recorded with the jazz formation Ocean Orchestra in 1978, a year in which he also composed the music for the film &quot;&quot; by Jürgen Flimm, together with Jens-Peter Ostendorf. His first solo album &quot;Grönemeyer&quot;, which was published in 1979, was awarded the Golden Lemon for the ugliest album cover of the year. His second album &quot;Zwo&quot; was released in 1981. Neither managed to chart. In the same year he starred in Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s successful movie &quot;Das Boot&quot; as Lieutenant Werner. For the role of composer Robert Schumann in the German-German coproduction &quot;Spring Symphony&quot; (co-starring Nastassja Kinski and Rolf Hoppe), for which he also composed the film score, Grönemeyer spent six months in East Germany. During the early 1980s Grönemeyer put his main focus on his music; the next two albums &quot;Total egal&quot; (1982) and &quot;Gemischte Gefühle&quot; (1983) flopped and most concerts of the planned tour had to be cancelled.

In 1984, Grönemeyer first met success as a musician with the release of &quot;4630 Bochum&quot; which became the best-selling album in Germany that year, particularly supported by the singles &quot;Männer&quot; and &quot;Flugzeuge im Bauch&quot;. A year later Grönemeyer appeared in the TV-movie &quot;Väter und Söhne&quot;, co-starring Julie Christie, Burt Lancaster and Bruno Ganz. Grönemeyer took part in Germany&#x27;s first major AIDS charity organized by the famous gay rights activist Rosa von Praunheim. In his next albums &quot;Sprünge&quot; (1986), he increasingly expressed his political opinion, criticising the government under German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. In 1986, Grönemeyer performed at the Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival against nuclear power and he composed the film score for the TV film &quot;Sommer in Lesmona&quot;, for which he received the Adolf Grimme Award in gold. 
Grönemeyer&#x27;s next album &quot;Ö&quot; (1988) saw also the release of an English version, titled &quot;What&#x27;s all this&quot;, followed by a tour through Canada, where it had success in the charts. After the Berlin Wall had fallen Grönemeyer released the album &quot;Luxus&quot; in which he addressed the feelings in East and West Germany.

More than people saw the following tour. In 1994, Grönemeyer was the first non-English-speaking artist who was invited by MTV to do an unplugged concert. Four years later, Grönemeyer moved to London and released &quot;Bleibt alles anders&quot; (Everything Remains Different). He also founded his own record label, Grönland Records. In the same year, his brother Wilhelm and his wife Anna died of cancer (both dying within four days of each other); it took Grönemeyer a year to resume his work. In 2000, he recorded a concert with a philharmonic orchestra and released the DVD &quot;Stand der Dinge&quot; (State of Affairs).

In August 2002, he released his album &quot;Mensch&quot; (Human) which was awarded Platinum even before release due to advance orders. The single &quot;Mensch&quot; became Grönemeyer&#x27;s first number one hit in Germany and 1.5 million people saw the 2-year tour. In 2004 and 2006 Grönemeyer recorded songs for the Olympic Games in Athens (&quot;Everlasting&quot;) and the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany (&quot;Celebrate the Day&quot;), respectively.

In March 2007, he released his 12th studio album &quot;12&quot; which was followed by a stadium tour across German-speaking countries. Smaller concerts took place in September in Amsterdam, Munich, Dresden, and London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

The three re-recorded albums &quot;What&#x27;s all this&quot;, &quot;Luxus&quot; and &quot;Chaos&quot; for the English-speaking market were met with limited sales success. Grönemeyer was scheduled to make his American debut on 17 September 2007 at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, but the performance was cancelled.

In January 2010, Grönemeyer performed the anthem &quot;Komm zur Ruhr&quot; as part of the opening ceremony of the &quot;RUHR.2010&quot; – The city of Essen being the &quot;European Capital of Culture 2010&quot; on behalf of the entire Ruhr area.

In March 2011, Grönemeyer released his next studio album &quot;Schiffsverkehr&quot;, which became a number-one-album in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The following 2011 tour of the same name had an audience of 550,000.

&quot;I Walk&quot;, the English-language debut in the U.S. for Grönemeyer, was released in February 2013 on Grönland Deutschland/EMI Label Services. In early 2013, he played his first American concerts at the Chicago Theatre on 23 February and New York&#x27;s Irving Plaza on 26 February. His U.S. website later announced 12 tour dates in the U.S. and Canada for September 2013. The album, which includes guest performances from Bono of U2, Anohni Hegarty of Anohni and The Johnsons, and guitarist James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers, was released in the UK in October 2012.

The magazine &quot;TIME&quot; awarded him the title of &quot;European Hero&quot; in 2005 for his humanitarian work.

Grönemeyer&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Dauernd jetzt&quot; won the Goldene Kamera award for the best German language album of 2014 and 2015, while Grönemeyer himself received the Best National Music award. In March 2015, Grönemeyer also won an Echo award with this album.

On 25 November 2016, his new Album &quot;Live aus Bochum&quot; was released. The album contains live recordings of the concerts Grönemeyer gave in Bochum&#x27;s Ruhrstadion in July 2015.

<doc id="465238" wikidata="Q1585316" url="?curid=465238" title="The Cathedral (2002 film)">
<text>The Cathedral () is a 2002 animated science fiction short film directed by Tomasz Bagiński. It is based on the short story of the same name by Jacek Dukaj, winner of the Janusz A. Zajdel Award in 2000. The film was nominated in 2002 for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the 75th Academy Awards. The film also won the title of Best Animated Short at SIGGRAPH 2002 in San Antonio.

==Plot==
The film focuses on a man who visits a mystical, organic building that looks like a medieval cathedral. As he walks through the immense structure, the light from his torch falls upon the pillars, revealing human faces. The viewer later realizes that the faces are still alive, as several smile and open their eyes as the man walks past them. The building&#x27;s nature is partially unveiled at sunrise as the blinding light enchants the visitor and causes organic branch-like structures to burst from his chest. These protrusions then become another set of pillars in the building.

==Reception==
The film was nominated in 2002 for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the 75th Academy Awards. The movie won the title of Best Animated Short at SIGGRAPH 2002 in San Antonio as well as several other awards.

In May 2011, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk gave several gifts to American President Barack Obama for his tour in Europe, as is the custom. One of those gifts was an iPad loaded with &quot;The Cathedral&quot;.

<doc id="465248" wikidata="Q1082380" url="?curid=465248" title="Culture of Turkey">
<text>The culture of Turkey () or the Turkish culture () includes both the national culture and local cultures. Currently, Turkey has various local cultures. Things such as music, folk dance, or kebap variety may be used to identify a local area. Turkey also has a national culture, such as national sports leagues, music bands, film stars, and trends in fashion.

During the early years of the Republic of Turkey, established after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the government invested large sums of resources into fine arts such as architecture and sculpture, and other artistic fields around the country in-line with the newly implemented reformist and West-leaning policies. This was done as part of a process of modernization, westernization, and of creating and outlining a new Turkish cultural identity, rather than the previously established and depicted Ottoman identity.

==Literature==

Turkish literature is the collection of written and oral texts composed in the Turkish language, either in its Ottoman form or in less exclusively literary forms, such as that spoken in the Republic of Turkey today. Traditional examples for Turkish folk literature include stories of Karagöz and Hacivat, Keloğlan, İncili Çavuş and Nasreddin Hoca, as well as the works of folk poets such as Yunus Emre and Aşık Veysel. The &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot; and the Epic of Köroğlu have been the main elements of the Turkish epic tradition in Anatolia for several centuries.

The two primary streams of Ottoman literature were poetry and prose. Of the two, the Ottoman Divan poetry, a highly ritualized and symbolic art form, was the dominant stream. The vast majority of Divan poetry was lyric in nature: either ghazals or qasidas. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the mathnawi (also known as &quot;mesnevî&quot;), a kind of verse romance and thus a variety of narrative poetry. The tradition of Ottoman prose was exclusively non-fictional in nature; as the fiction tradition was limited to narrative poetry.
The Tanzimat reforms of 1839–1876 brought changes to the language of Ottoman written literature and introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several different genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet Namık Kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel &quot;İntibâh&quot; (Awakening), while the journalist İbrahim Şinasi is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the one-act comedy &quot;Şair Evlenmesi&quot; (The Poet&#x27;s Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; (New Literature) movement; the &quot;Fecr-i Âtî&quot; (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the &quot;Millî Edebiyyât&quot; (National Literature) movement. The &quot;Edebiyyât-ı Cedîde&quot; (New Literature) movement began with the founding in 1891 of the magazine &quot;Servet-i Fünûn&quot; (&quot;Scientific Wealth&quot;), which was largely devoted to progress (both intellectual and scientific) along the Western model. Accordingly, the magazine&#x27;s literary ventures, under the direction of the poet Tevfik Fikret, were geared towards creating a Western-style &quot;high art&quot; in Turkey.

===Poetry===

Poetry is the most dominant form of literature in modern Turkey.

The &#x27;folk poetry&#x27; as indicated above, was strongly influenced by the Islamic Sunni and Shi&#x27;a traditions. Furthermore, as partly evidenced by the prevalence of the still-existent ashik (&quot;aşık&quot; or &quot;ozan&quot;) tradition, the dominant element in Turkish folk poetry has always been song. The development of folk poetry in Turkish—which began to emerge in the 13th century with such important writers as Yunus Emre, Sultan Veled, and Şeyyâd Hamza—was given a great boost when, on 13 May 1277, Karamanoğlu Mehmed Bey declared Turkish the official state language of Anatolia&#x27;s powerful Karamanid state; subsequently, many of the tradition&#x27;s greatest poets would continue to emerge from this region.
There are, broadly speaking, two traditions of Turkish folk poetries;

* the aşık/ozan tradition, which—although much influenced by religion, as mentioned above—was, for the most part, a secular tradition; 
* the explicitly religious tradition, which emerged from the gathering places (tekkes) of the Sufi religious orders and Shi&#x27;a groups. 
Much of the poetry and song of the aşık/ozan tradition, being almost exclusively oral until the 19th century, remains anonymous. There are, however, a few well-known aşıks from before that time whose names have survived together with their works: the aforementioned Köroğlu (16th century); Karacaoğlan (1606?–1689?), who may be the best-known of the pre-19th century aşıks; Dadaloğlu (1785?–1868?), who was one of the last of the great aşıks before the tradition began to dwindle somewhat in the late 19th century; and several others. The aşıks were essentially minstrels who traveled through Anatolia performing their songs on the bağlama, a mandolin-like instrument whose paired strings are considered to have a symbolic religious significance in Alevi/Bektashi culture. Despite the decline of the aşık/ozan tradition in the 19th century, it experienced a significant revival in the 20th century thanks to such outstanding figures as Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu (1894–1973), Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1938–2002), Neşet Ertaş (1938–2012), and many others.

Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly ritualized and symbolic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of symbols whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير mura&#x27;ât-i nazîr / تناسب tenâsüb) and opposition (تضاد tezâd)—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:

the nightingale (بلبل bülbül) — the rose (ﮔل gül) 
the world (جهان cihan; عالم &#x27;âlem) — the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن gülistan; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ gülşen) 
the ascetic (زاهد zâhid) — the dervish (درويش derviş)

In the early years of the Republic of Turkey, there were a number of poetic trends. Authors such as Ahmed Hâşim and Yahyâ Kemâl Beyatlı (1884–1958) continued to write important formal verse whose language was, to a great extent, a continuation of the late Ottoman tradition. By far the majority of the poetry of the time, however, was in the tradition of the folk-inspired &quot;syllabist&quot; movement (Five Syllabists or &quot;Beş Hececiler&quot;), which had emerged from the National Literature movement and which tended to express patriotic themes couched in the syllabic meter associated with Turkish folk poetry.

The first radical step away from this trend was taken by Nâzım Hikmet, who—during his time as a student in the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1924—was exposed to the modernist poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and others, which inspired him to start writing verse in a less formal style.
Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled Garip (meaning both &quot;miserable&quot; and &quot;strange&quot;). The authors were Orhan Veli Kanık (1914–1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915–2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914–1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, &quot;to explore the people&#x27;s tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art&quot;.[21] To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like Jacques Prévert, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by Nâzım Hikmet, but also highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly.

Just as the Garip movement was a reaction against earlier poetry, so—in the 1950s and afterwards—was there a reaction against the Garip movement. The poets of this movement, soon known as İkinci Yeni (&quot;Second New&quot;[22]), opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of Nâzım Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead—partly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism—sought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. To some extent, the movement can be seen as bearing some of the characteristics of postmodern literature. The best-known poets writing in the &quot;Second New&quot; vein were Turgut Uyar (1927–1985), Edip Cansever (1928–1986), Cemal Süreya (1931–1990), Ece Ayhan (1931–2002), and İlhan Berk (1918–2008).

Outside of the Garip and &quot;Second New&quot; movements also, a number of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca (1914–2008), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts like life, death, God, time, and the cosmos; Behçet Necatigil (1916–1979), whose somewhat allegorical poems explore the significance of middle-class daily life; Can Yücel (1926–1999), who—in addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry—was also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature; and İsmet Özel (1944– ), whose early poetry was highly leftist but whose poetry since the 1970s has shown a strong mystical and even Islamist influence.

===Prose===

The style of the current novelists can be traced back to the &quot;Genç Kalemler&quot; journal in the Ottoman period. Young Pens was published in Selanik under Ömer Seyfettin, Ziya Gökalp and Ali Canip Yöntem. They covered the social and political concepts of their time with the nationalistic perspective. They were the core of a movement which became known as the &quot;national literature.&quot;

With the declaration of the Turkish Republic in 1923, Turkish literature became interested in folkloric styles. This was also the first time since the 19th century that Turkish literature was escaping from Western influence and began to mix Western forms with other forms. During the 1930s, Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu and Vedat Nedim Tor published &quot;Kadro&quot;, which was revolutionary in its view of life.
Stylistically, the early prose of the Republic of Turkey was essentially a continuation of the National Literature movement, with Realism and Naturalism predominating. This trend culminated in the 1932 novel &quot;Yaban&quot; (&quot;The Wilds&quot;) by Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoğlu. This novel can be seen as the precursor to two trends that would soon develop: social realism, and the &quot;village novel&quot; (&quot;köy romanı&quot;). The social realist movement was led by the short-story writer Sait Faik Abasıyanık. The major writers of the &quot;village novel&quot; tradition were Kemal Tahir, Orhan Kemal, and Yaşar Kemal. In a very different tradition, but evincing a similar strong political viewpoint, was the satirical short-story writer Aziz Nesin. Other important novelists of this period were Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar and Oğuz Atay. Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, is among the innovative novelists, whose works show the influence of postmodernism and magic realism. Important poets of the Republic of Turkey period include Ahmet Haşim, Yahya Kemal Beyatlı and Nâzım Hikmet (who introduced the free verse style). Orhan Veli Kanık, Melih Cevdet Anday and Oktay Rifat led the Garip movement; while Turgut Uyar, Edip Cansever and Cemal Süreya led the &quot;İkinci Yeni&quot; movement. Outside of the &quot;Garip&quot; and &quot;İkinci Yeni&quot; movements, a number of other significant poets such as Fazıl Hüsnü Dağlarca, Behçet Necatigil and Can Yücel also flourished.

The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatized, for example, in the form of the &quot;new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures&quot; enacted in the novels of Orhan Pamuk, recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Architecture==
=== Seljuk era ===
Architecture under the Anatolian Seljuks incorporated an eclectic mix of influences, adopting local Byzantine, Armenian, and Georgian elements and combining them with designs from Islamic Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Central Asia. Their monuments were largely built in dressed stone, with brick used for minarets. Decoration was concentrated around certain elements like entrance portals and took the form of elaborate stone carving (e.g. the Ince Minareli Medrese and the Divriği complex), occasional &quot;ablaq&quot; stonework (e.g. Alâeddin Mosque in Konya), and large surfaces covered in tilework (e.g. Karatay Medrese). As Anatolia fragmented into Beyliks during the later 13th and 14th centuries, architecture became even more diverse, particularly in western Anatolia, where proximity to the Byzantine and Mediterranean worlds encouraged further experimentation and syncretism.

=== Ottoman era ===
The architecture of the early Ottomans experimented with different building types, including single-domed mosques, multi-domed buildings, and religious buildings with T-shaped floor plans. This eventually evolved into the Classical Ottoman style that was consolidated during the 16th and 17th centuries. This style, drawing strong influence from the Hagia Sophia, produced grand imperial mosques designed around a central dome and a varying number of semi-domes. This period is also associated with the most famous Ottoman architect, Mimar Sinan (d. 1588). Among his over 300 designs across the empire, his most important works include the Şehzade Mosque in Istanbul, the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul, and the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. In decorative arts, Iznik tiles reached their artistic peak and were used in many buildings.

After the 17th century, Ottoman architecture was increasingly open to outside influences. Shifts during the Tulip Period were followed by the appearance of the Ottoman Baroque style in the 1740s. In the 19th century, Western European influences increased and architects such as the Balyans produced eclectic works like the luxurious Dolmabaçe Palace. In the early 20th-century, a kind of Ottoman revivalism known as the First National Architectural Movement was led by architects like Mimar Kemaleddin and Vedat Tek.

===Republican era===

In the first years of the Turkish Republic, founded in 1923, Turkish architecture was influenced by Ottoman architecture, in particular during the First National Architectural Movement. However, from the 1930s, architectural styles started to differ from traditional architecture, also as a result of an increasing number of foreign architects being invited to work in the country, mostly from Germany and Austria. The Second World War was a period of isolation, during which the Second National Architectural Movement emerged. Similar to Fascist architecture, the movement aimed to create modern but nationalistic architecture.

Starting from the 1950s, isolation from the rest of the world started to diminish, leading to Turkish architects being increasingly inspired by their counterparts in the rest of the world. However they were constrained by the lack of technological infrastructure or insufficient financial resources till the 1980s. Thereafter, the liberalization of the economy and the shift towards export-led growth, paved the way for the private sector to become the leading influence on architecture.

==Visual arts==

Ottoman miniature is linked to the Persian miniature tradition and is likewise influenced by Chinese painting styles and techniques. The words &quot;tasvir&quot; or &quot;nakış&quot; were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called &quot;nakkaşhane&quot;. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, more illustrations than standalone works of art. Sixteenth-century artists Nakkaş Osman and Matrakçı Nasuh are among the most prominent artists of this era.

Turkish painting, in the Western sense, developed actively starting from the mid 19th century. The first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the Istanbul Technical University (then the &quot;Imperial Military Engineering School&quot;) in 1793, mostly for technical purposes. In the late 19th century, human figure in the Western sense was being established in Turkish painting, especially with Osman Hamdi Bey. Impressionism, among the contemporary trends, appeared later on with Halil Pasha. Other important Turkish painters in the 19th century were Ferik İbrahim Paşa, Osman Nuri Paşa, Şeker Ahmet Paşa, and Hoca Ali Riza.

Carpet (&quot;halı&quot;) and tapestry (&quot;kilim&quot;) weaving is a traditional Turkish art form with roots in pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of weaving carpets and tapestries in Turkey has integrated numerous cultural traditions. Apart from the Turkic design patterns that are prevalent, traces of Persian and Byzantine patterns can also be detected. There are also similarities with the patterns used in Armenian, Caucasian and Kurdish carpet designs. The arrival of Islam in Central Asia and the development of Islamic art also influenced Turkic patterns in the medieval period. The history of the designs, motifs and ornaments used in Turkish carpets and tapestries thus reflects the political and ethnic history of the Turks and the cultural diversity of Anatolia. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.

==Cinema==
Turkish film directors have won numerous prestigious awards in the recent years. Nuri Bilge Ceylan won the Best Director Award at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival with the film &quot;Üç Maymun&quot;. This was the fourth time that Ceylan received an award at Cannes, following the awards for the film &quot;Uzak&quot; (which was also nominated for the Golden Palm) at the festival of 2003 and 2004, and the film &quot;İklimler&quot; (also nominated for the Golden Palm) at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. These three films, along with the other important works of Ceylan such as &quot;Kasaba&quot; (1997) and &quot;Mayıs sıkıntısı&quot; (1999) have also won awards at the other major international film festivals; including the Angers European First Film Festival (1997 and 1999), Ankara Film Festival (2000), Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival (1999, 2002 and 2006), Bergamo Film Meeting (2001), Berlin Film Festival (1998), Brothers Manaki Film Festival (2003), Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema (2001), Cannes Film Festival (2003, 2004 and 2006), Chicago Film Festival (2003), Cinemanila Film Festival (2003), European Film Awards (2000), Istanbul Film Festival (1998, 2000, 2003 and 2007), Mexico City Film Festival (2004), Montpellier Mediterranean Film Festival (2003), San Sebastián Film Festival (2003), Singapore Film Festival (2001), Sofia Film Festival (2004), Tokyo Film Festival (1998) and the Trieste Film Festival (2004).

More recently, Semih Kaplanoğlu won the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival with his Honey (2010 film); the third and final installment of the &quot;Yusuf Trilogy&quot;, which includes Egg and Milk. This was the second time a Turkish film wins the award; first one being Susuz Yaz by Metin Erksan in 1964.

Turkish film director Fatih Akın, who lives in Germany and has dual Turkish-German citizenship, won the Golden Bear Award at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival with the film &quot;Head-On&quot;. The film won numerous other awards in many international film festivals. Fatih Akın was nominated for the Golden Palm and won the Best Screenplay Award at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival; as well as the Golden Orange at the 2007 Antalya Film Festival; the Lino Brocka Award at the 2007 Cinemanila Film Festival; the Best Screenwriter award at the 2007 European Film Awards; the Best Direction, Best Screenplay and Outstanding Feature Film awards at the 2008 German Film Awards; the Best Feature Film and Best Screenplay awards at the 2008 RiverRun Film Festival; the 2008 Bavarian Film Award; and the Lux Prize by the European Parliament, with the film &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;. Other important films of Akın, such as &quot;Kurz und schmerzlos&quot; (1998), &quot;In July&quot; (2000), &quot;Solino&quot; (2002), and &quot;Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul&quot; (2005) won numerous awards.

Another famous Turkish film director is Ferzan Özpetek, whose films like &quot;Hamam&quot; (1997), &quot;Harem Suare&quot; (1999), &quot;The Ignorant Fairies&quot; (2001), &quot;Facing Windows&quot; (2003), &quot;&#x27;Sacred Heart&quot; (2005) and &quot;Saturn in Opposition&quot; (2007) won him international fame and awards. The film &quot;Facing Windows&quot; (2003) was particularly successful, winning the Best Film and Scholars Jury awards at the 2003 David di Donatello Awards, the Crystal Globe and Best Director awards at the 2003 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the 2003 Silver Ribbon for Best Original Story from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, the Festival Prize at the 2004 Foyle Film Festival, the Audience Award at the 2004 Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, and the Canvas Audience Award at the 2004 Flanders International Film Festival.

==Sports==

The traditional Turkish national sport has been the Yağlı güreş (&quot;Oiled Wrestling&quot;) since Ottoman times. The annual international yağlı güreş (oiled wrestling) tournament that&#x27;s held in Kırkpınar near Edirne is the oldest continuously running, sanctioned sporting competition in the world, having taken place every year since 1362.

The most popular sport in Turkey is football. Turkey&#x27;s top teams include Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş. In 2000, Galatasaray cemented its role as a major European club by winning the UEFA Cup and UEFA Super Cup. Two years later the Turkey national team finished third in the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, while in 2008 the national team reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 2008 competition.
Other mainstream sports such as basketball and volleyball are also popular. Turkey hosted the 2010 FIBA World Championship international basketball tournament and reached the final. The men&#x27;s national basketball team finished second in Eurobasket 2001; while Efes Pilsen S.K. won the Korać Cup in 1996, finished second in the Saporta Cup of 1993, and made it to the Final Four of Euroleague and Suproleague in 2000 and 2001. Turkish basketball players have also been successful in the NBA. In June 2004, Mehmet Okur won the 2004 NBA Championship with the Detroit Pistons, becoming the first Turkish player to win an NBA title. Okur was selected to the Western Conference All-Star Team for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, also becoming the first Turkish player to participate in this event. Another successful Turkish player in the NBA is Hidayet Türkoğlu, who was given the NBA&#x27;s Most Improved Player Award for the 2007–2008 season, on April 28, 2008. Basketball has received further attention and media coverage in 2010s with Fenerbahce Basketball and Anadolu Efes S.K. making 6 straight Euroleague Final Four appearances combined, along with winning the Euroleague title in 2017 and 2021 respectively. Women&#x27;s volleyball teams such as Eczacıbaşı, Vakıfbank, and Fenerbahçe have been the most successful by far in any team sport, winning numerous European championship titles and medals.

Motorsports have become popular recently, especially following the inclusion of the Rally of Turkey to the FIA World Rally Championship calendar in 2003, and the inclusion of the Turkish Grand Prix to the Formula One racing calendar in 2005. Other important annual motorsports events which are held at the Istanbul Park racing circuit include the MotoGP Grand Prix of Turkey, the FIA World Touring Car Championship, the GP2 Series and the Le Mans Series. From time to time Istanbul and Antalya also host the Turkish leg of the F1 Powerboat Racing championship; while the Turkish leg of the Red Bull Air Race World Series, an air racing competition, takes place above the Golden Horn in Istanbul. Surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, paragliding, and other extreme sports are becoming more popular every year.

International wrestling styles governed by FILA such as Freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling are also popular, with many European, World and Olympic championship titles won by Turkish wrestlers both individually and as a national team. Another major sport in which the Turks have been internationally successful is weightlifting; as Turkish weightlifters, both male and female, have broken numerous world records and won several European, World and Olympic championship titles. Naim Süleymanoğlu and Halil Mutlu have achieved legendary status as one of the few weightlifters to have won three gold medals in three Olympics.

Turkey hosted the 2005 Summer Universiade in İzmir and the 2011 Winter Universiade in Erzurum.

==Cuisine==


Turkish cuisine inherited its Ottoman heritage which could be described as a fusion and refinement of Turkic and Persian cuisines. Turkish cuisine also influenced Greek, Armenian, Arabic, Persian, Balkan and Middle East cuisines and other neighbouring cuisines, as well as western European cuisines. Ottomans fused various culinary traditions of their realm with influences from Middle Eastern cuisines, along with traditional Turkic elements from Central Asia such as yogurt. The Ottoman Empire indeed created a vast array of technical specialities. It can be observed that various regions of the Ottoman Empire contain bits and pieces of the vast Ottoman dishes. 
Taken as a whole, Turkish cuisine is not homogenous. Aside from common Turkish specialities which can be found throughout the country, there are also region-specific specialities. The Black Sea region&#x27;s cuisine (northern Turkey) is based on corn and anchovies. The southeast—Urfa, Gaziantep and Adana—is famous for its kebabs, &quot;mezes&quot; and dough-based desserts such as &quot;baklava&quot;, &quot;kadayıf&quot; and &quot;künefe&quot;. Especially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees are grown abundantly, olive oil is the major type of oil used for cooking. The cuisines of the Aegean, Marmara and Mediterranean regions display basic characteristics of Mediterranean cuisine as they are rich in vegetables, herbs and fish. Central Anatolia is famous for its pastry specialities such as &quot;keşkek&quot; (kashkak), &quot;mantı&quot; (especially of Kayseri) and &quot;gözleme&quot;.

The name of specialities sometimes includes the name of a city or a region (either in Turkey or outside). This suggests that a dish is a speciality of that area, or may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between Urfa kebab and Adana kebab is the use of garlic instead of onion and the larger amount of hot pepper that kebab contains.

==Festivals==
Christmas is known in Turkish as Noel, although the majority of the Turks do not celebrate it as such, the idea is not thoroughly an alien one. The festivity traces its roots where Santa Claus was born in Turkey and is known as Noel Baba. It has for a long time been a tradition that Noel Baba would bring gifts to children on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

One of the other common celebrations in Turkey is Nowruz. This celebration is done on the pretext of the beginning of spring and the beginning of the new year. The establishment of Nowruz has a long history, so much so that it has been celebrated in different parts of Asia for the past three thousand years, especially in the Middle East. In different parts of Turkey, especially the Kurdish regions of this country, Nowruz is considered one of the most important cultural and historical traditions of these regions. Lighting a fire, wearing new clothes, holding a dance ceremony, and giving gifts to each other are some of the activities that are done in this celebration.

<doc id="465255" wikidata="Q987901" url="?curid=465255" title="Northern and Southern dynasties (Vietnam)">
<text>The Northern and Southern dynasties (; Chữ Hán: ) in the history of Vietnam, spanning from 1533 to 1592, was a political period in the 16th century during which the Mạc dynasty (Northern dynasty), established by Mạc Đăng Dung in Đông Đô, and the Revival Lê dynasty (Southern dynasty) based in Tây Đô were in contention. For most of the period, these two dynasties fought a lengthy war known as the Lê–Mạc War.

Initially, the domain of the Southern court was confined within Thanh Hoa province. After the expedition of Nguyễn Hoàng to reclaim Lê territory in the South from Mạc garrison force, Northern dynasty only controlled the provinces from Thanh Hoa up North. Both dynasties claimed to be the sole legitimate dynasty of Vietnam. The nobles and their clansmen switched side frequently to the extent that loyal retainers such as Prince Mạc Kính Điển were praised even by their foes as rare virtuous men. As lords without land, these nobles and their armies behaved a little or no better than petty thieves, raiding and looting the farmers to feed themselves. This state of chaos brought along the destruction of the countryside and reduced many formerly prosperous cities such as Đông Kinh to poverty.

The two dynasties fought for nearly sixty years, ended in 1592 when the Southern dynasty defeated the North and recaptured Đông Kinh. However, Mac family members
had maintained an autonomous rule in Cao Bằng under the protectorate of Chinese dynasties until 1677.

== Mạc Đăng Dung usurps the throne ==
In the early 16th century, the Later Lê dynasty started weakening. The degenerated Lê dynasty, which endured under six rulers between 1497 and 1527, in the end was no longer able to maintain control over the northern part of the country, much less the new territories to the south. The weakening of the monarchy created a vacuum that the various noble families of the aristocracy were eager to fill. Soon after Lê Chiêu Tông fled south with the Trịnh and the Nguyễn in 1522, Mạc Đăng Dung proclaimed the emperor&#x27;s younger brother, Le Xuan, as the new emperor under the name Lê Cung Hoàng. In reality, the new emperor had no power. Three years after Mạc&#x27;s forces killed his older brother, Lê Chiêu Tông, Mạc Đăng Dung ended the fiction that Lê Cung Hoàng actually ruled by killing him in 1527. Mạc Đăng Dung, being a scholar-official who had effectively controlled the Le for a decade, then proclaimed himself the new emperor of Vietnam in 1527, and established the Mac dynasty.

<doc id="465261" wikidata="Q1511199" url="?curid=465261" title="Queen Elizabeth-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships were a group of five super-dreadnoughts built for the Royal Navy during the 1910s. These battleships were superior in firepower, protection and speed to their Royal Navy predecessors of the as well as preceding German classes such as the . The corresponding ships were generally considered competitive, although the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class were faster and outnumbered the German class 5:2. The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s are generally considered the first fast battleships of their day.

The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s were the first battleships to be armed with guns, and were described in the 1919 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as &quot;the most successful type of capital ship yet designed.&quot; They saw much service in both world wars. &quot;Barham&quot; was lost to a U-boat attack in 1941, but the others survived the wars and were scrapped in the late 1940s.

==Background and design==

The early design history of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class is not well known because not many records have survived in the files of the Admiralty. When Winston Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty in October 1911, the ships of the 1911–1912 Naval Programme, the four s and the battlecruiser were being ordered and preliminary design work had begun on the new class of battleships scheduled for the 1912–1913 Naval Programme. Each class received its own alphabetical designation with the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s being MIV, the fourth major iteration of Design M. Presumably the improved 1912–1913 ships were Design N, but no details of it have been found in Admiralty records. The letter O was not used during this time. Naval historian Norman Friedman believes that Design P was a slow ship armed with ten guns based on a passing reference in the official history of naval construction during the First World War that such a ship was a precursor to the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s.

Churchill and the retired First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher corresponded at length during this time with Fisher advocating for a fast (probably ) ship armed with eight guns and nearly as well armoured as a battleship, something that he sometimes called a &quot;super-Lion&quot;, referring to the battlecruiser . Friedman believes that the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Philip Watts, designated Fisher&#x27;s concept as Design Q with a slower version being the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class as Design R. &quot;The destruction of papers may thus have concealed the reality that instead of being a spectacular advance on previous battleships, the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s were a slow version of a ship which Fisher and probably Churchill badly wanted. Much of the fragmentary evidence for the fast ship is to be found in Fisher&#x27;s letters to Churchill.&quot;

The tactical mission of these ships is portrayed as being fast enough to manoeuvre to catch the head of the enemy&#x27;s battleline and concentrate fire against it, but they were actually intended to prevent the German battlecruisers, which were more heavily armoured than their British equivalents, from doing the same to the British fleet. A memo from Churchill to Rear-Admiral Gordon Moore, Third Sea Lord, on 27 October 1912, stated &quot;the speed and power of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s...is sufficient to protect the battle fleet against any turning movement by German battlecruisers.

Influenced by Fisher, Churchill ordered development of the 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I gun using the codename &quot;14inch Experimental&quot; in January 1912. This was a risky decision as development of new heavy guns and their turrets was normally a multi-year project, and a failure would seriously delay the completion of the ships. The first gun turret was successfully tested on 6 May 1914, likely much to the relief of the Admiralty.

The Admiralty decided on the design of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s on 15 June 1912, with the decision on whether they would solely use fuel oil deferred to a subsequent meeting. That meeting must have happened very shortly afterwards because the design that received the Board&#x27;s stamp the following day was oil-fueled. The design had not been optimised to burn oil instead of coal and the fuel tanks had different requirements than the coal bunkers previously planned. Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, the DNC who followed Watts, estimated that the change so late in the design process cost some that could have been put to better use. To guarantee a supply of oil in wartime, Churchill negotiated the Anglo-Persian Oil Convention.

Fisher also believed that the 1912–1913 ships should all be battlecruisers instead of the usual mix of three battleships and a battlecruiser. Churchill initially agreed with him, but was persuaded to go back to the original plan, much to Fisher&#x27;s fury. Given the speed of the new ships, envisaged as , it was decided that the battlecruiser would not be needed and a fourth battleship would be built instead. When the Federation of Malay States offered to fund a further capital ship, the Admiralty decided to add a fifth unit to the class, .

In some respects, the ships did not quite fulfil their extremely demanding requirement. They were seriously overweight, as a result of which the draught was excessive and they were unable to reach the planned top speed of 25 knots. In the event, the combination of oil fuel and more boilers provided for a service speed of about , still a useful improvement on the traditional battle line speed of and just fast enough to be thought of as the first fast battleships. After Jutland Admiral John Jellicoe was persuaded that the slowest ship of this class was good only for about , he concluded that, since this should be considered as the speed of the squadron, it would not be safe to risk them in operations away from the main battlefleet.

==Description==
The ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class were long between perpendiculars, long at the waterline, and had a length overall of , excluding the sternwalk fitted on several ships. They had a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They had a normal displacement of approximately and at deep load. The ships had a metacentric height of at deep load. Their crew numbered between 923 and 951 officers and ratings as completed; by 1920, the number of crew had grown to 1,016 then to 1,025. Service as a flagship increased these numbers from 1,249 to 1,262 that same year.

They were powered by two sets of direct-drive steam turbines, Parsons units were fitted in , and &quot;Malaya&quot; while and had Brown-Curtis turbines. The latter pair were not equipped with the cruising turbines to improve fuel economy at slow speeds used in the first three ships. Each turbine set drove two shafts with , three-bladed propellers, using steam provided by 24 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers at a working pressure of in all but &quot;Warspite&quot; and &quot;Barham&quot;, which received boilers manufactured by Yarrow. The boilers were ducted into a pair of funnels. The turbines were divided into three watertight compartments arranged side by side; the low-pressure turbines driving the inner pair of shafts were in the centre engine room together, while the high-pressure outboard turbines were in the rooms on either side.

The turbines were rated at at overload and were intended to give the ships a maximum speed of , although they fell short of that. Due to the war only &quot;Barham&quot; ran her sea trials on a measured course; in August 1916 she reached a top speed of from at deep load. Fuel storage amounted to of fuel oil which enabled the ships to steam for at a cruising speed of , which fell to at full speed.

===Armament and fire control===
The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) 15-inch Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns were initially supplied with 80 shells per gun, but the magazines were later modified to allow for up to one hundred shells per gun. The ships carried the guns in Mk I mounts that allowed for elevation to 20 degrees and depression to -5 degrees. The mounts had a weight of 782 t and a train of- 150 to + 150 degrees. The guns themselves had a weight of 101 t. They could be loaded at any angle, but the crews typically returned to +5 degrees, since the guns could be cleared faster that way. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . Their designed rate of fire was one shot every 36 seconds.

The gun even remained competitive in the Second World War after receiving further shell upgrades and mountings with greater elevation, and HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; would eventually record a hit during the Battle of Calabria which to this day is one of the longest-range naval gunnery hits in history - 24,000 metres (26,000 yd).

The guns could elevate to 20° and depress to −5°, but the turret sights could only elevate 15°, effectively limiting the range that could be achieved unless firing under director control. The sights were equipped to permit the guns to fire at full charge or with charge.


The ships&#x27; secondary battery consisted of sixteen 45-calibre BL Mk XII guns. The guns had a muzzle velocity of from their projectiles. At their maximum elevation of 15 degrees, they had a range of . As designed twelve of these were mounted in casemates on the upper deck, six of each on the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining four guns were on the main deck aft abreast &#x27;Y&#x27; turret. In an effort to ameliorate the flooding problems that the casemated guns in the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;-class ships had in heavy seas, the guns in the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s were moved back from abreast &#x27;A&#x27; turret to &#x27;B&#x27; turret, but this made little difference in service. The aft guns were more prone to flood and were virtually useless even in moderate seas. Only &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was completed with them; one pair was removed and the other was repositioned on the forecastle and protected by gun shields in May 1915. The casemates were plated over to improve their seaworthiness. The other ships were similarly modified while fitting-out.

Each gun was provided with 130 rounds. Stowage was provided for 30 rounds at each gun as the only ammunition hoists for them were located at the forward end of the battery. Captain Morgan Singer, commander of the RN&#x27;s gunnery school HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;, criticized this arrangement, saying that it had been proven inefficient in the pre-dreadnought battleships and he recommended using dredger hoists as they were much faster. His comments were rejected as the Admiralty believed that the guns would only intermittently be in use as destroyers attempted to close to torpedo range and they desired to maintain a break in the cordite supply between the magazines and the battery. In service this led to the gun crews keeping additional rounds immediately available at the guns in case they were needed. This resulted in an ammunition fire aboard &quot;Malaya&quot; during the Battle of Jutland that nearly resulted in the loss of the ship.

The ships also mounted four 3-pounder () saluting guns. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. They were fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. Each ship was supplied with a total of 20 Mk II or Mk IV torpedoes.

The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships were completed with two fire-control directors. The one that was mounted above the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood and was fitted with a rangefinder. The other director was on top of the tripod mast and was equipped with a . The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret as well and each turret was fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. A torpedo-control director with a 9-foot rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they began to be fitted in March 1917. The rangefinders in &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets were replaced by models between 1919 and 1922.

Flying-off platforms were fitted on all the ships on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918. Between them the ships carried three fighters and seven reconnaissance aircraft.

===Armour===
Armour protection was modified from the previous , with a thicker belt and improved underwater protection. The scale of deck armour was less generous, though typical of contemporary practice.

==Ships==
A further ship was authorised in 1914 and would have been named &quot;Agincourt&quot; (a name later applied to a dreadnought expropriated from Ottoman Turkey). Although most sources and several official papers in the class&#x27;s Ships Cover describe her as a further repeat of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; design, one historian - Nicholas Lambert - has suggested that &quot;Agincourt&quot; would have been built on battlecruiser lines. This design would have kept the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; armament, but substituted thinner armour down to instead of , for example] in order to gain a top speed.

Whatever the case, &quot;Agincourt&quot; was cancelled at the outbreak of war in 1914. The cancellation, proposed by Churchill in memoranda of 1 and 14 June 1914, was intended to shave around £900,000 off that year&#x27;s naval estimates, which had met with resistance from leading members of the ruling Liberal Party. It had been proposed to build a new type of semi-submersible torpedo cruiser, the &quot;Polyphemus&quot; class, in place of &quot;Agincourt&quot;, and submarines in place of another planned battleship, , and in place of all but two or three of that year&#x27;s planned destroyers.

==Service==
===First World War===
In the First World War, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was detached from the squadron and took part in the Dardanelles Campaign, but missed Jutland as she was undergoing dock maintenance.

At the Battle of Jutland, four of the ships formed Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas&#x27;s 5th Battle Squadron, and in the clash with the German 1st Scouting Group under Admiral Franz von Hipper they &quot;fired with extraordinary rapidity and accuracy&quot; (according to Admiral Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet), damaging and and a number of other German warships. These battleships were able to engage German battlecruisers at a range of 19,000 yards (17,400 m), which was beyond the maximum range of the Germans&#x27; guns. Three of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s received hits from German warships during the engagement, yet they all returned home. &quot;Warspite&quot; was the most heavily damaged, with her rudder jammed and taking fifteen hits, coming close to foundering.

===Between the wars===
Between the wars, the ships received considerable upgrades, including new machinery, small-tube boilers, deck armour upgrades, torpedo belt armour, trunked funnels, new secondary armament and anti-aircraft armament, and many improvements in gunlaying and electronics. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, and &quot;Warspite&quot; were the most modernised, with all three receiving the new &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions&quot; block superstructure for the bridge, whilst twenty 4.5&quot; dual-purpose guns in 10 turret mountings replaced the 6&quot; casemate secondary weapons on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot;. &quot;Warspite&quot; kept her 6&quot; secondary guns, now reduced to just four per battery.

===Second World War===
By the Second World War, the class were showing their age. &quot;Barham&quot; and &quot;Malaya&quot;, the least-modernized of the class, were at a disadvantage compared to modern battleships. In spite of this, &quot;Malaya&quot; prevented an attack on a transatlantic convoy by the modern German battlecruisers and by her presence. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, &quot;Warspite&quot;, and &quot;Valiant&quot;, the more modernised of the class, fared better. With her modern fire control equipment, &quot;Warspite&quot; scored a hit on an Italian battleship during the Battle of Calabria at a range of more than 26,000 yards, one of the longest range naval artillery hits in history.

Modern torpedoes outclassed their torpedo belt protection: in November 1941, &quot;Barham&quot; was torpedoed by a U-boat and sank in five minutes, with the loss of over 800 of her crew, when her magazines detonated. &quot;Warspite&quot; survived a direct hit and two near-misses by German glider bombs, while &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Valiant&quot; were repaired and returned to service after being badly damaged by limpet mines placed by Italian frogmen during a raid at Alexandria Harbour in 1941.

===HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;===
 took part in the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915 bombarding forts, but missed Jutland in 1916. She became Admiral Beatty&#x27;s flagship in 1917 after he assumed command of the Grand Fleet. In the Second World War she was mined by Italian frogmen and badly damaged, but did not ground in the shallow water of Alexandria Harbour in 1941. She was subsequently repaired, and served in the Far East until 1945.

===HMS &quot;Warspite&quot;===
 suffered severe damage at Jutland, being hit by at least 15 heavy shells. She lost 14 men, with 32 wounded, firing a total of 259 shells. In the Second World War, she took part in many battles, including Narvik, Cape Matapan, Crete, and Salerno, where she was hit by a glider bomb. She was never fully repaired, and became a coastal bombardment ship, covering the Normandy landings, further operations in other parts of France, and the Walcheren landings. She holds the most battle honours for an individual ship in the Royal Navy&#x27;s history, with 15.

===HMS &quot;Valiant&quot;===
 received no hits at Jutland but suffered one wounded and fired 288 shells. In the Second World War, she took part in the attack on the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, and was mined and damaged at Alexandria in 1941. She was repaired, and served in the Far East until 1944. On 8 August 1944 whilst in the floating dock at Trincomalee, Ceylon, she was severely damaged when the dock collapsed with the result that repairs were stopped.

===HMS &quot;Barham&quot;===
 was named after Lord Barham, First Lord of the Admiralty. The &quot;Barham&quot; received five hits at Jutland, suffering 26 dead and 46 wounded and fired 337 shells. In the Second World War, she fought at Cape Matapan. On 25 November 1941 she was struck by three torpedoes from , commanded by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen, and went down with 850 of her crew.

===HMS &quot;Malaya&quot;===
 was hit eight times at Jutland, suffering 63 dead and 68 wounded, and fired 215 shells. In the Second World War, she escorted convoys and was damaged by a torpedo from in 1941. Subsequently, she escorted several convoys and supported various operations following the Normandy invasion until she was decommissioned in 1945.

===HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot;===
HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; was to be the sixth member of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class. She was authorized in 1913, and intended for completion in late 1916, but was cancelled after the outbreak of the First World War. She is not to be confused with that was ordered by Brazil, sold to the Ottoman Empire while under construction, and seized for use by the Royal Navy before the beginning of the first World War.

===Other ships===
The Canadian Naval Aid Bill of 1913 intended to provide the funds for three modern battleships, which most likely would have been three more members of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class, potentially named as &quot;Acadia&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot; and &quot;Ontario&quot;, in much the same way as &quot;Malaya&quot; had been funded. The bill met with stiff opposition in Parliament, and was not passed. It is unclear if these ships would have served in the Royal Navy (as with outright gifts like &quot;Malaya&quot; or the battlecruiser ), or if they would have served in the Royal Canadian Navy (, an , served with the Royal Australian Navy).

<text>The Taunton River, historically also called the Taunton Great River, is a river in southeastern Massachusetts in the United States. It arises from the confluence of the Town River and Matfield River, in the town of Bridgewater. From there it meanders through the towns of Halifax, Middleborough and Raynham, through the city of Taunton for which it is named, the towns of Berkley, Dighton, Somerset, and the Assonet section of Freetown, to Fall River where it joins Mount Hope Bay, an arm of Narragansett Bay.

==Description==

The total length of the river is 37.0 miles (59.5 km) from the junction of the Town and Matfield Rivers in Bridgewater to the mouth of the Quequechan River in Fall River. It has a watershed of 562 square miles (1,456 km2). The river&#x27;s watershed includes the Hockomock Swamp, the largest freshwater wetland in the state. The Taunton River is one of the flattest rivers in New England, dropping only about twenty feet (6 m) in elevation over its length. The river is tidal as far north as Taunton.

The Taunton River is the longest coastal river in New England without dams, and is the principal river that makes up the Taunton River Watershed.

Battleship Cove, the world&#x27;s largest museum of warships, is located on the Fall River side of the river at its confluence with Mount Hope Bay, beneath the Braga Bridge.

==Ecology==
The river is home to much biodiversity, including some animals found nowhere else in the state.
Over 154 bird species (including bald eagles) have been documented along the Taunton River, primarily during breeding season. The watershed supports 28 species of reptiles and amphibians, and 29 species of fish, including native brook trout and Atlantic sturgeon, which can be found in the lower part of the watershed. Some comprehensive surveys along the entire length of the river identified over 70 distinct species of fish. The Mystic Valley amphipod, which is native only to eastern New England, has been found in various wetlands throughout the watershed. River otters are common throughout the river, and harbor seals have been sighted in the watershed, as well as in some of the smaller tributaries, such as the Nemasket River. The watershed also is home to seven species of freshwater mussels, as well the largest herring run in New England. Other common wildlife within the watershed include river otter, mink, foxes and deer.

Due to its direct connection with the Atlantic ocean, the Taunton River and its tributaries are occasionally visited by marine species not normally found in rivers. In 2005, a young harp seal was found in the Nemasket. In early summer 2014, a young male beluga whale was sighted in the lower Taunton River, and in late August 2014, a basking shark was also spotted in the lower Taunton.

Over 360 plant species were sampled from the floodplain wetlands and the immediate river corridors, and various vegetative communities can be found along the river. These include Atlantic white cedar swamps, forested bogs, and coastal plain pondshores, among many others.

==History==
Since the development of industry beginning with the iron works of the mid-17th century, the Taunton River has played an important role in the economy of the Greater Taunton Area. The shipbuilding industry was very active in the Taunton area during the 19th century.

After over five years of study for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System, such designation was obtained in April 2009.

<text>WIZO () is a German punk rock band from Sindelfingen, that formed in 1985. 
WIZO&#x27;s music is characterized by a combination of humorous and political lyrics with a fast, melodic punk rock sound. They are considered to be part of the German movement known as &quot;Fun-Punk&quot; (also punk pathetique or &#x27;pret-punk&#x27;). Their lyrics are written in German, and Axel Kurth has spoken about how German lyrics are important so that the music and lyrics go together. They have named three bands as important influences: Normahl, Hass, and The Exploited. Axel Kurth has spoken out about how difficult it is for musicians to make a living with streaming services.

The band espouses left-wing politics and describes themselves as &quot;against Nazis, racists, sexists, and other assholes!&quot; They have also said that the most important themes for them are equality for women, queer people, and other marginalized groups. 
Axel Kurth has stated &quot;We are all Antifa. Everyone, who does not like it when people are treated differently on the basis of some obscure characteristics, is in my opinion an anti-fascist.&quot;

==History==
===1986–2005===
Jörn Genserowski (bass), Axel Kurth (guitar), and Jochen Bix (vocals) founded the band &quot;Wieso&quot; (English translation: &quot;why?&quot;) in Sindelfingen, a town in the vicinity of Stuttgart, in 1986. Until Ralf &quot;Ratz&quot; Plapp joined the band as a drummer, the group practiced with a drumcomputer. Later in 1986, they altered their band name to &quot;WIZO&quot;.

In 1987 the band made their first public appearances in Sindelfingen and the surrounding area. In 1988, WIZO recorded their first demo tape &quot;Keiner ist kleiner&quot; in the Nebringer Hammer-Sound-Studio. This was followed by a second demo tape in 1990. Jochen Bix sang a few songs, including the Judas Priest cover, &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;. Ralf &quot;Ratz&quot; Plapp was replaced by Charly Zasko on drums. Jochen Bix left the band to move to Berlin-Friedrichshain. Axel Kurth took over as singer. Axel Kurth is also the main songwriter for the band, and he has jokingly said that he writes many of his songs on the toilet.

Later that year, together with Andreas &quot;Fratz&quot; Thum, WIZO founded their own label, and released the EP &quot;Klebstoff&quot; (&quot;Glue&quot;), their first vinyl record, which was recorded in 1989 in a basement studio in Stuttgart.
In 1991, WIZO released their first full-length album &quot;für&#x27;n Arsch&quot; (&quot;In vain&quot;, literally &quot;for an ass&quot;). This was recorded in the studio of a friend of WIZO in Stuttgart. The band also gained attention for an illegal public performance outside of a courthouse during the road-rage trial of Manfred Krug, a TV celebrity. The band played from the bed of a delivery truck while the case was going on.

In 1992, WIZO&#x27;s album, &quot;Bleib Tapfer&quot; (English translation: &quot;Stay Brave&quot;) was released. On the first anniversary of German pop-star Roy Black&#x27;s death, WIZO released the single &quot;Roy Black ist tot&quot; (English translation: &quot;Roy Black Is Dead&quot;) as a dubious tribute. The tribute in question was a punk cover of a children&#x27;s song with the lyrics altered to a German version of &quot;Roy Black is dead, Roy Black is dead.&quot; It was named the worst CD of the year by the &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;, a major German tabloid.

In 1993, WIZO covered the pop-song &quot;All that she wants&quot; from the Swedish group Ace of Base. Their self-produced music video was played on MTV. The single of their cover gained the band recognition across Germany.
In 1994, their next album, &quot;Uuaarrgh!&quot; (onomatopoeic, like a big &quot;ouch&quot;, as in comics) was released, which sold 100,000 copies. 
For the American market, &quot;UUAARRGH!&quot; (as well as the later compilation album &quot;Kraut &amp; Rüben&quot;) was distributed by Fat Wreck Chords, one of the most successful and influential punk labels in the world. 
The version of this album produced by Fat Wreck was cut from 25 songs to 13 songs, which were also different versions than the German ones.

Later that year, due to the &quot;glorification of violence&quot; and &quot;illegal anti-state statements&quot; present in the song &quot;Kein Gerede&quot; (&quot;No idle talk&quot;), the album &quot;Bleib Tapfer&quot; was indexed by the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons and was only available to be sold to adults through very restricted channels.

In 1994, WIZO performed at the Chaos Days in Hannover. This also made headlines, among other places in the Tagesschau. The band later wrote a song about this experience, titled &quot;Chaostage 94&quot;.

In 1995, WIZO released &quot;Herrenhandtasche&quot; (&quot;Man purse&quot;) and performed on the Warped Tour. Later that year, the band opened for Die Ärzte. In the summer of 1995, WIZO toured the USA on their Vans Warped Tour. Among other things, during this tour they moderated the VIVA-program &quot;Wah Wah&quot;. After this tour they opened for Die Ärzte on their tour &quot;Eine Frage der Ehre&quot;.

In 1996 WIZO gave a concert at the Bizarre-Festivals in Cologne in front of 35,000 people. This concert was broadcast by MTV and the WDR. When the band asked the producer and cameramen not to block the view of the audience, as they had done for NOFX, filming was stopped. Kurth and Genserowski damaged some of the cameras. Axel has said that the band was sued over this incident, and this is the reason that they no longer play large festival shows. In 1996, WIZO&#x27;s lineup also changed; Ingo Hahn replaced their long-standing drummer, Charly Zasko, and he and Axel &quot;are fortunately no longer in contact.&quot; The single &quot;Doof wie Scheiße&quot; (English translation: &quot;Dumb as Shit&quot;) was recorded with Ingo before he left the band.
In 1997, the band released &quot;Weihnachten stinkt!&quot; (&quot;Christmas stinks!&quot;), a split EP with the Japanese punk band Hi-Standard. The band also received a criminal complaint from Wilhelm Gegenfurtner, the Vicar General of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Regensburg over their depiction of a crucified pig on their album &quot;Uuaarrgh!&quot; and on t-shirts, which he claimed violated Germany&#x27;s blasphemy law, §166 StGB for &quot;Defamation of religious denominations, religious societies and World view associations&quot;. The band offered to stop selling the T-shirt if the Catholic Church put a sign on the &quot;Judensau&quot;, an anti-semitic carving on the Regensburg Cathedral dating to 1330. The artwork is censored from later pressings of the album with a reference to a court decision.

In 1998, WIZO released &quot;Kraut &amp; Rüben EP&quot; (&quot;Cabbage and Carrots&quot;, also &quot;higgledy piggledy&quot;) on the label Fat Wreck Chords, containing songs that were already popular in Germany, but unknown to the rest of the world. That year, Herr Guhl replaced Ingo as drummer.
In September 2004, WIZO made a first in the music industry by releasing a single on USB flash drive, titled as the &quot;Stick EP&quot;. In addition to five high bitrate MP3s, it also included a video, pictures, lyrics, and tabs.

In November 2004, coinciding with the release of their album &quot;Anderster&quot; (English translation: &quot;differenter&quot;), WIZO announced their intent to dissolve in March 2005, upon the conclusion of a farewell tour.

===Reunion===
After the band dissolved in 2005, Axel Kurth released several solo songs under the pseudonym XLQ, including a song for the Soccer team VfB Stuttgart at the German Soccer Championships. This song used the melody of the WIZO song &quot;Kadett B&quot;. He also released covers of &quot;Als ich fortging&quot;, written by and &quot;Pour Un Flirt&quot; by Michel Delpech. At the end of 2008, XLQ played guitar for a German boy-band, was involved in writing music for the film , and other projects.

In November 2009, WIZO announced a new album and a reunion tour for 2010 on their official Homepage. In the new line-up, bassist Jörn Genserowski was replaced by Thorsten Schwämmle.

In May 2010, the band performed at the punk festival with this new line-up. In August 2010, they played seven festivals with from the band as a guest guitarrist; these festivals included the in Konstanz. On 18 October 2010 a cut from the AREA4-Festival (21 August 2010 in Lüdinghausen) played on the WDR3 TV program Rockpalast; in this program the controversial song &quot;Kein Gerede&quot; was broadcast in uncensored form. On 13 December 2013 bass-player Thorsten &quot;Karachoo&quot; Schwämmle announced on his Facebook-page that he had left the band.

WIZO released the album &quot;Punk gibt&#x27;s nicht umsonst (Teil III)&quot; (&quot;Punk Isn&#x27;t Free (Part III)&quot;) on 13 June 2014, and announced a fall tout to support the album. Ralf Dietel replaced Schwämmle on bass; although Dietel is credited as band-member in the album booklet, the bass parts were written by Axel Kurth or Thorsten Schwämmle. One song on the album, &quot;Unpoliddisch&quot;, which Axel sings in a Saxon dialect, had already been released in 2012 under the pseudonym &quot;Total Verboilt&quot;. In December 2015 Guhl left the band for family reasons, and was replaced by Alex Stinson, the drummer from the band &quot;Start A Fire&quot;.

On 21 June 2016 the single &quot;Verwesung&quot; was released. On 25 June 2016 during the Amnesia Rockfest in Québec, the band released the new single &quot;Adagio&quot;. On 12 August 2016 WIZO released the new album &quot;Der&quot;.

<text>Steve Dillon (22 March 1962 – 22 October 2016) was a British comic book artist, best known for his work with writer Garth Ennis on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

== Early life ==
Dillon was born in London in 1962 and raised in Luton, Bedfordshire. He was the oldest of three siblings, a sister younger by three years, Julie, and a brother younger by nine years who is cartoonist/costume designer Glyn Dillon.

While attending Icknield High School, Dillon first realised his potential as a serious comic book artist during the production of a school comic book called &quot;Ultimate Sci Fi Adventures&quot; with school friends Neil Bailey &amp; Paul Mahon in 1975. His first strip in this comic was &quot;The Space Vampire&quot;. This was followed by the &quot;Escape from the Planet of the Apes&quot; series.

== Career ==
Dillon got his first professional work at the age of 16, drawing the title story in the first issue of &quot;Hulk Weekly&quot; for Marvel UK, later working on the &quot;Nick Fury&quot; strip. In the 1980s he also drew for &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, where he created the character of Abslom Daak. He did a considerable amount of work for the comics &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Warrior&quot;.

Along with Brett Ewins, Dillon started the seminal comic magazine &quot;Deadline&quot; in 1988, which continued for another seven years and was instrumental in supporting young, underground, comic artists such as Jamie Hewlett as well as championing and supporting new bands of the period such as The Senseless Things and Blur. &quot;Deadline&quot; is highly regarded for bringing underground comics and graphic novels into the mainstream during the 1990s. and can be considered as a precursor for publications such as Loaded and Dazed and Confused, as well as defining and promoting the nascent Britpop movement of the time.

In mid-1989, Dillon met writer Garth Ennis, with whom he eventually had his most notable professional collaborations. During a social gathering about a year later in Dublin, Ennis recalls, &quot;After everyone else had passed out, we sat up &#x27;til dawn and killed off a bottle of Jameson, talking about what we wanted to do in comics- what we thought could be done with them, what the medium was for. I can recall a sort of mutual &#x27;Oh yes, you. You&#x27;re the one. You get it.&#x27; This was to pay off handsomely in the years to come.&quot; With Ennis, Dillon worked on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; and, later, on &quot;Preacher&quot; which concluded in 2000 after 66 issues. Dillon also created the character Dogwelder, featured in Ennis&#x27;s series &quot;Hitman&quot;, and the aptly named Sixpack and Dogwelder comic series, that ran from 2016 to 2017.

&quot;Preacher&quot; was made into a critically acclaimed TV show in 2016, starring Dominic Cooper. Dillon is credited as co-executive producer on the series.

== Death ==
Dillon&#x27;s younger brother, concept artist Glyn, announced on social media on 22 October 2016 that Dillon had died in New York City. The cause was complications of a ruptured appendix. His death was met with an outpouring of grief and a number of tributes from the comics creator community, as well as the following statement from DC Group editor Marie Javins:
Dillon&#x27;s long-time collaborator Garth Ennis paid tribute to Dillon thus:
The first episode of season two of the &quot;Preacher&quot; TV series is dedicated to Dillon.

== Awards ==
* 1998 National Comics Award for Best Artist
* 1999 Harvey Award for Best Continuing Series for &quot;Preacher&quot;
* 2000 Eagle Award for Favourite (Colour) Comic for &quot;Preacher&quot;

<text>Earl Annesley, of Castlewellan in the County of Down, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 17 August 1789 for Francis Annesley, 2nd Viscount Glerawly, with special remainder to his younger brother the Honourable Richard Annesley. He had previously represented Downpatrick in the Irish House of Commons. The titles of Baron Annesley, of Castlewellan in the County of Down, and Viscount Glerawly, in the County of Fermanagh, were created in the Peerage of Ireland on 20 September 1758 and 14 November 1766 respectively for his father William Annesley, who sat as Member of the Irish Parliament for Midleton. Annesley was the sixth son of the Honourable Francis Annesley, fourth son of Francis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia.

The first Earl Annesley had several illegitimate children but no legitimate issue. He was succeeded (in the earldom according to the special remainder) by his younger brother, the second Earl. He had earlier represented seven different constituencies in the Irish Parliament and served as a Commissioner of Customs for Ireland. His eldest son, the third Earl, sat in the British House of Commons as the representative for Downpatrick. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby and was an Irish representative peer in the House of Lords from 1857 to 1874.

He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was a soldier and also represented County Cavan in Parliament as a Conservative. Between 1877 and 1908 he sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer. His line of the family failed on the death of his only son, the sixth Earl, who was killed during the First World War. During his life in 1884 the Earl had a property named the &#x27;Moorish tower&#x27; constructed, only for it to become ruin before a century later. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Hon. William Octavius Beresford Annesley, sixth son of the third Earl. This line of the family failed in 1957 on the death of his son, the eighth Earl. He was succeeded by his third cousin once removed, the ninth Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of the Hon. Robert Annesley, second son of the second Earl. the titles are held by the ninth Earl&#x27;s third son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his elder brother in 2011.

<text>Ralph Campbell Jr. (December 7, 1946 – January 11, 2011) was an American politician and auditor who served as the North Carolina State Auditor from 1993 to 2005. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to hold statewide elected executive office in North Carolina. Campbell was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, and he attended St. Augustine&#x27;s College. He graduated with a degree in business administration in 1968, and served in the United States Army Reserve from 1971 until 1977. After leaving the reserve, he worked various government jobs before being elected to the Raleigh City Council in 1985.

In 1992, Campbell ran for North Carolina State Auditor and was elected, defeating Republican Vernon Abernethy. Taking office in January 1993, he equipped office staff with desktop computers and field auditors with laptop computers during his first term and pushed for the implementation of an entirely digital auditing system. Campbell conducted several high-profile audits during his tenure, occasionally annoying government workers and other Democrats. Re-elected in 1996 and 2000, he lost a bid for a fourth term to Republican Les Merritt. Leaving office in 2005, Campbell worked as a consultant and served as treasurer of the North Carolina Democratic Party. Campbell was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010, and he died the following year.

== Early life ==

Ralph Campbell Jr. was born on December 7, 1946, in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States to Ralph Campbell Sr. and June Kay Campbell. Both of his parents were civil rights activists. His maternal grandmother, Willie Otey Kay, was a prominent dressmaker in Raleigh. Ralph Jr. grew up with two brothers, Bill (who would later serve as Mayor of Atlanta) and Eddie, and one sister, Mildred. In 1960, the elder Campbells requested that the Raleigh School Board admit Ralph Jr., Mildred, and Bill to attend all-white schools. The board allowed Bill to be transferred—and thus become the first black student to attend an all-white public school in the city—but denied the applications for Ralph Jr. and Mildred, citing overcrowding at the junior high school to which they sought admission.

Campbell accompanied his father and sister to the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. After graduating from John W. Ligon High School in 1964, he attended St. Augustine&#x27;s College, receiving a degree in business administration in 1968. He later took graduate-level business courses at North Carolina Central University.

== Early career ==

From 1971 until 1977, Campbell served in the United States Army Reserve. After leaving the reserve, he worked as a field auditor for the North Carolina Department of Revenue, and from 1986 to 1990 as a plan auditor for the State Health Benefits Office. In 1990, Campbell took an administrative job in the North Carolina Department of Insurance, holding the job until 1992. In 1985, Campbell was elected to the Raleigh City Council, assuming office on December 3. He was re-elected in 1987, 1989, and 1991. In the city council, he chaired the Law and Finance Committee and Intergovernmental Committee from 1985 to 1989 and served as mayor pro tempore in his final full term from 1989 to 1991. He resigned from the council effective January 1, 1993.

== North Carolina State Auditor ==

=== Election and first term ===

Campbell decided to run for the office of North Carolina State Auditor in 1992, declaring his candidacy in January. Facing two other candidates in the Democratic Party&#x27;s primary election, he took a leave of absence from his job in the Department of Insurance and travelled across the state to hold meetings and rallies. He won the May 5 primary, securing the Democratic nomination with 48 percent of the vote, and faced Republican Vernon Abernethy in the general election. Campbell pledged that if he was elected he would create an advisory council for the office and establish a technical assistance program to educate officials in other state agencies on cost-controlling methods. Abernethy emphasized his Certified Public Accountant status and criticized Campbell for lacking accounting experience. Campbell won the general election on November 3, saying, &quot;How sweet it is to be standing with my fellow North Carolinians on the edge of tomorrow [...] We have chosen hope over fear.&quot; His victory made him the first black person ever elected to a statewide executive office in North Carolina.

Campbell was sworn in as North Carolina State Auditor on January 9, 1993. During his first term he equipped office staff with desktop computers and field auditors with laptop computers and pushed for the implementation of an entirely digital auditing system. He served as head of the state&#x27;s Information Resource Management Commission and helped determine its policy towards the internet and later reviewed the government&#x27;s response to the Year 2000 problem. In May 1995 he was involved in a car accident while driving his government-issued vehicle. Campbell was initially charged with driving while impaired, but the police later determined that his blood alcohol content was lower than the level necessary for such a case and dropped the charges while also finding the driver of the other vehicle at fault for the collision.

Ralph Campbell ran for re-election in 1996, pledging that if he re-secured his office he would continue to enhance its technological capabilities. He was challenged by Republican candidate Jack Daly, a law student. Daly and his campaign official, Nate Pendley, accused Campbell of misusing his state vehicle and criticized him for the 1995 collision, saying he should resign from office. Campbell rejected the allegations. He ultimately won re-election with less than 50 percent of the vote, receiving the fewest votes among the Democratic candidates on the Council of State.

=== Second term and re-election ===

Campbell conducted several high-profile audits during his tenure, occasionally annoying government workers and other Democrats. He released a critical audit of North Carolina&#x27;s mental health services in early 2000, for which he received broad praise, and the report led to the creation of a legislative panel to study the matter. In June he audited the expenses of State Attorney General Mike Easley, who used official funds to pay for public service announcements. The audit cleared Easley of any wrongdoing, but Campbell was accused of protecting Easley by his political opponents, since Easley was a candidate for governor.

For the 2000 Democratic primary contest for state auditor, Pendley recruited a homeless man and client of Daly, Kenneth Campbell, to challenge Ralph Campbell for the nomination. Daly filed Kenneth Campbell&#x27;s candidacy and paid the associated fees. Daly renewed his candidacy for the auditor&#x27;s office, and sponsored another former client to run in the primary. Ralph Campbell stated that Kenneth had been deceived, and the latter&#x27;s candidacy was invalidated by election officials after one asserted that the move was done to confuse voters in the primary. Campbell attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention as a delegate. For his own 2000 campaign, he collected a significant amount of his campaign contributions from Atlanta-area donors, where his brother Bill was serving as mayor. His Republican opponent in the general election, Les Merritt, attempted to tie Ralph Campbell to a federal corruption investigation into Atlanta&#x27;s city government and turned over his campaign financial disclosures to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Campbell&#x27;s campaign officials denied any wrongdoing. He won his third term over Merritt in November with 51 percent of the vote.

=== Third term and election defeat ===

In late 2001 Campbell accused the North Carolina Technological Development Authority, a nonprofit designed to promote small technology companies, of wasting its money on frivolous travel and entertainment expenses and excessive salaries. As a result, Easley—who was governor—cut off the organization from state funds and it later filed for bankruptcy. In May 2001, the auditor&#x27;s office began exploring the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of state computer networks. In December 2002 Campbell was elected president of the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council. The following year his office reported on the John A. Hyman Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Congressman Frank Ballance, accusing it of financial improprieties. The audit led to state and federal investigations, and as a result the auditor&#x27;s office lobbied for increased oversight into nonprofits which received state funds, including the implementation of new financial reporting requirements and the hiring of additional auditors. Following an audit of state juvenile justice facilities, the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention adopted one of Campbell&#x27;s recommendations and declared that it would create task forces to review the department&#x27;s reporting and investigative procedures for incidents of abuse.

In March 2004 Campbell released an audit of the North Carolina State Ports Authority which led its chief executive officer to resign and the board of directors to revise its rules regarding credit cards and travel expenses. The following month the auditor&#x27;s office released a report which accused the North Carolina Medicaid program of misallocating $414 million in federal funding. Campbell sent the audit to state and federal prosecutors for review, and said, &quot;This is the most damaging audit that we have ever had to release in my 11, 12 years as state auditor.&quot; The audit led to a public dispute between Campbell and Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Carmen Hooker Odom. Odom denounced the findings during a North Carolina General Assembly committee hearing, asserted that what problems existed would have been fixed if Campbell had followed-up on issues his office discovered in 1997, and stated that she wished to return to the &quot;very good relationship&quot; she had with Campbell before the release of the audit. Campbell followed her presentation by saying, &quot;Let me thank the secretary for her magnanimous gesture of working together as I pull the daggers and the arrows out of my back from the beginning part of that presentation.&quot; His comment elicited gasps from the audience, and after he summarized the report, the legislators intensively questioned Odom on the spending of the Medicaid funds. In June he was elected president of the National State Auditors Association.

Merrit challenged Campbell again for the auditor&#x27;s office in the 2004 election. He criticized Campbell for not fully uncovering the Medicaid problems in 1997. The North Carolina Republican Party attacked Campbell&#x27;s connections to his brother Bill, who had been indicted in the course of the federal investigation on corruption charges. Campbell lost re-election in November, with Merritt receiving about 28,000 more votes. Campbell believed that his race and some of his audits played a role in his electoral defeat. His office performed about 3,600 audits during his tenure. His tenure ended on January 15, 2005. Another black person was not elected to serve on the Council of State until Mark Robinson was elected Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 2020.

== Later life ==

In March 2005 Campbell became treasurer of the North Carolina Democratic Party. He endorsed Beth Wood, a former employee in the state auditor&#x27;s office, as the Democratic candidate to challenge Merritt in the 2008 election. After leaving office, Campbell worked as a consultant. In 2010 he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He was admitted to the Duke Raleigh Hospital in January 2011 and died on January 11. Following his death, his body lay in state in the State Capitol rotunda. Governor Beverly Perdue also ordered that all North Carolina flags at state facilities were to be flown at half-staff in his honor. Perdue stated, &quot;His entire life Ralph Campbell was a gift to the people of North Carolina.&quot; A funeral was held at St. Ambrose Church in Raleigh on January 15 and he was subsequently buried. On December 7, a library in Raleigh was dedicated in his honor.

<text>Menispermum (moonseed) is a small genus of deciduous climbing woody vines in the moonseed family (Menispermaceae). Plants in this genus have small dioecious flowers, and clusters of small grape-like drupes. The name, moonseed, comes from the shape of the seed, which resembles a crescent moon. The word &quot;Menispermum&quot; is derived from the Greek words μήν (&quot;mēn&quot;), meaning (crescent) moon, and σπέρμα (&quot;sperma&quot;) meaning seed. The common name moonseed is also applied to some other species in the related genus &quot;Cocculus&quot;.

==Species==
There are only two recognised species in the genus &quot;Menispermum&quot; these being :
* &quot;Menispermum canadense&quot; – Canadian moonseed, Ghost grape (northeastern North America)
* &quot;Menispermum dauricum&quot; – Asian or Daurian moonseed, named for the homeland of the Daur, a Mongolic people inhabiting the part of Northeast Asia to which the plant is native. Common name in Chinese : 蝙蝠葛 ( bian fu ge ).

===Formerly placed here===
* &quot;Anamirta cocculus&quot; (as &quot;M. cocculus&quot; )
* &quot;Calycocarpum lyonii&quot; (as &quot;M. lyonii&quot; )
* &quot;Cocculus carolinus&quot; (as &quot;M. carolinum&quot; )
* &quot;Cocculus hirsutus&quot; (as &quot;M. hirsutum&quot; )
* &quot;Cocculus orbiculatus&quot; (as &quot;M. trilobum&quot; )
* &quot;Jateorhiza palmata&quot; (as &quot;M. columba&quot; or &quot;M. palmatum&quot; )
* &quot;Pericampylus glaucus&quot; (as &quot;M. glaucum&quot; )
* &quot;Sinomenium acutum&quot; (as &quot;M. acutum&quot; )
* &quot;Tinospora cordifolia&quot; (as &quot;M. cordifolium&quot; )
* &quot;Tinospora crispa&quot; (as &quot;M. crispum&quot; )

==Toxicity==
All parts of these plants are known to be poisonous, containing dauricine and related isoquinoline alkaloids, and children have died from eating the fruits. Dauricine inhibits cardiac K+ channels thus causing arrhythmia. Other symptoms caused by consumption of the grape-like fruits include excitation of the CNS, leading to seizures and neuromuscular arrest.
First aid in cases of Menispermum poisoning involves the induction of vomiting, followed by the administration of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate. Clinical therapy : gastric lavage ( possibly with 0.1% potassium permanganate ) instillation of medicinal charcoal and sodium sulphate; electrolyte substitution, control of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate ( pH of urine 7.5 ). In case of spasms, intravenous administration of diazepam. Provision of intubation and oxygen respiration in case of respiratory arrest or paralysis. Checking of diuresis and kidney function.

==Medicinal Use==
&quot;Menispermum dauricum&quot; has been used to treat skin disorders, rheumatism, and cervical cancer.

&quot;Menispermum canadense&quot; has been used in herbal medicine as a tonic, laxative, dermatological aid, venereal aid, and diuretic. Yellow Medicine County in Minnesota is named after one of this plant&#x27;s common names.

Plants of this species are sometimes grown as ornamentals in gardens. Gardeners can propagate this plant from the division of runners or by seed.

<text>The Cetomimiformes or whalefishes are an order of small, deep-sea ray-finned fish. Some authorities include the whalefishes as part of the order Stephanoberyciformes, within the superfamily Cetomimoidea. Their sister order, the Beryciformes, includes the flashlight fish and squirrelfish.

Within this group are five families and approximately 18 genera and 32 species (but see below). Thought to have a circumglobal distribution throughout the tropical and temperate latitudes, whalefishes have been recorded at depths in excess of 3,500 metres.

==Description==
Named after their whale-shaped body (from the Greek &quot;ketos&quot; meaning &quot;whale&quot; or &quot;sea monster&quot;, &quot;mimos&quot; meaning &quot;imitative&quot; and the Latin &quot;forma&quot; meaning &quot;form&quot;), the Cetomimiformes have extremely large mouths and highly distensible stomachs. Their eyes are very small or vestigial; the lateral line (composed of huge, hollow tubes) is consequently very well developed to compensate for life in the pitch black depths.

The dorsal and anal fins are set far back; all fins lack spines. The swim bladder is also absent, except in the larvae and juveniles which occur in the surface waters. Whalefish coloration is typically red to orange, sometimes with a black body. Some species possess light-producing organs called photophores; these are widespread among deep-sea fishes.

The largest known species reach a length of just 40 centimetres; most species are half this size. Sexual dimorphism is (apparently) exceptionally strong: males may only grow to 3.5 centimetres while females may be ten times as large. This is not uncommon among deep-sea fishes, with the males serving little use other than as suppliers of sperm: an even more extreme case are the parasitic males in deep-sea anglerfish.

== Families ==
*Cetomimidae — flabby whalefishes
*Rondeletiidae — redmouth whalefishes
*Barbourisiidae — velvet whalefish (monotypic)

The gibberfishes (Gibberichthyidae) on the other hand, usually placed in the Stephanoberyciformes &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, appear to be close relatives of the Rondeletiidae and Barbourisiidae, as has been occasionally proposed.

<text>Cetomimidae is a family of small, deep-sea beryciform ray-finned fish. They are among the most deep-living fish known, with some species recorded at depths in excess of . Females are known as flabby whalefishes, Males are known as bignose fishes, while juveniles are known as tapetails and were formerly thought to be in a separate family, dubbed Mirapinnidae. Adults exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, and the adult males were once thought to be exemplars of still another family, Megalomycteridae.

Thought to have a circumglobal distribution throughout the Southern Hemisphere, Cetomimidae are the most diverse family of whalefishes. The largest species, &quot;Gyrinomimus grahami&quot;, reaches a length of some 40 cm, though most species average around 20 cm. They are distinguished from other whalefishes by their loose, scaleless skin and lack of photophores.
== Description ==

Living at extreme, lightless depths, adult females have evolved an exceptionally well-developed lateral line system. Their eyes are either very small or vestigial and instead this system of sensory pores (running the length of the body in a distinct lateral line) helps the fish to accurately perceive its surroundings by detecting vibrations. Named after the baleen whale-like bodies of adult females (from the Greek &quot;ketos&quot; meaning &quot;whale&quot; or &quot;sea monster&quot; and &quot;mimos&quot; meaning &quot;imitative&quot;), Cetomimidae have large mouths, and their dorsal and anal fins are set far back of the head. All fins lack spines, and the pelvic fins are absent. The fish also lack swim bladders.

Adult female Cetomimidae are a red to orange-brown color in life, with the fins and jaws, in particular, being brightly colored. Longer electromagnetic wavelengths (such as red and orange) do not penetrate this depth of the ocean. Animals which have evolved at this depth cannot see these longer wavelengths, rendering the fish effectively black.

Their stomachs are highly distensible, allowing adult females to pursue prey otherwise too large for them to eat. Adult males do not eat at all, their jaws having fused shut during the transformation from their juvenile phase. Males retain the shells of prey consumed while still in the juvenile form and continue to metabolize these shells throughout the remainder of their lives. Both traits may have evolved due to extreme food scarcity in the ocean depths.

Though little is known regarding their life history, new discoveries are being made. They live in the nutrient-poor habitat of the oceanic bathypelagic zone, at depths between 1,000 and 4,000 m. They are believed to swim upward, toward the upper section of this zone, when laying and fertilising their eggs, as most fish in this zone do, as it contains more nutrients. Cetomimidae larvae have not been found below depths of 1000 m. In early 2009, the Royal Society published an article detailing the discovery &quot;that three families with greatly differing morphologies, Mirapinnidae (tapetails), Megalomycteridae (bignose fishes), and Cetomimidae (whalefishes), are larvae, males, and females, respectively, of a single-family, Cetomimidae.&quot; Apparently, &quot;morphological transformations involve dramatic changes in the skeleton, most spectacularly in the head, and are correlated with distinctly different feeding mechanisms. Larvae have small, upturned mouths and gorge on copepods. Females have huge gapes with long, horizontal jaws and specialized gill arches allowing them to capture larger prey. Males cease feeding, lose their stomach and esophagus, and apparently convert the energy from the bolus of copepods found in all transforming males to a massive liver that supports them throughout adult life.&quot;

Like many deep-sea fishes, Cetomimidae is thought to undergo nightly vertical migrations; they feed within the upper 700 m of the water column by starlight and retreat back to the abyssal depths by daybreak. Judging by the latest studies, the younger fish seem to frequent shallower water more than the adults do.

== Tapetails ==
Before a report released in January 2009, the juveniles of the species were thought to belong to a separate taxonomic family Mirapinnidae in the Cetomimiform order, with three genera &quot;Eutaeniophorus&quot;, &quot;Mirapinna&quot;, and &quot;Parataeniophorus&quot;.
These &quot;tapetails,&quot; as they are also known, had been known exclusively from immature specimens, which live in shallower waters than the adults.

The tapetails are named for their caudal fins, which include a narrow streamer that may be longer than the fish&#x27;s body. The genus &quot;Mirapinna&quot;, known as the hairyfish, lacks the streamer, but has multiple hair-like growths on its body. All mirapinnids lack scales and fin rays. Mirapinnids are all small fish, less than in length. They feed on small crustaceans. Male juveniles retain the copepods of these crustaceans, which they process in their liver for the rest of their life. &quot;Most of the largest juveniles have a gut swollen with copepods visible externally in life as a swollen orange bulge. This bolus of copepods must provide the nutrition required to generate the large liver that sustains the male through the rest of its life.&quot;

<text>Carl Christian Rafn (January 16, 1795 – October 20, 1864) was a Danish historian, translator and antiquarian. His scholarship to a large extent focused on translation of Old Norse literature and related Northern European ancient history. He was also noted for his early advocacy of the recognition of Norse colonization of North America.

==Biography==
Carl Christian Rafn was born in Brahesborg on the island of Fyn in Funen County, Denmark. After attending the Odense Cathedral School (&quot;Odense Katedralskole&quot;), he entered the University of Copenhagen where he earned his law degree and graduated (1816). After having been employed as a lieutenant with the Funen light dragoons in Odense, in 1820, he became a teacher in Latin and grammar at the Army Cadet Academy (&quot;Landkadetakademiet&quot;) in Copenhagen.

Rafn was particularly interested in discovering the location of Vinland as mentioned in Norse sagas. Together with Icelandic scholar Finnur Magnússon and Danish linguist Rasmus Rask, he founded the Royal Norse Ancient Writings Society (&quot;Det Kongelige nordiske Oldskriftselskab&quot;). He was also a member of the Arnamagnæan Institute (&quot;Den Arnamagnæanske Kommission&quot;) which managed the Arnamagnæan Foundation
(&quot;Det Arnamagnæanske Legat&quot;), custodians for the collection of manuscripts from 17th-century Icelandic scholar Árni Magnússon.

Rafn published much of his work in 1837 in the &quot;Antiquitates Americanæ&quot;. It is considered the first scholarly exposition of pre-Columbian Norse exploration. At the time of Rafn&#x27;s research, the Norse sagas concerning Vinland were considered by most scholars to be mere legends. The ideas advanced by Rafn found new support since the 1960s with the discovery of the Norse settlement at L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland, Canada.

In 1836, he was admitted as a member of the Royal Danish Society for History (&quot;Det kongelige danske Selskab for Fædrelandets Historie&quot;). In 1836 he was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He was a member of numerous other foreign associations and societies and received the philosophical and legal doctorate from abroad.

Rafn became a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1828 and was awarded the Grand Cross of the Dannebrog (&quot;Dannebrogsmand&quot;) in 1842.
He died in 1864 at the age of 69 and was buried at Assistens Cemetery in Copenhagen.

<text>Henry Ernest Dudeney (10 April 1857 – 23 April 1930) was an English author and mathematician who specialised in logic puzzles and mathematical games. He is known as one of the foremost creators of mathematical puzzles.

==Early life==
Dudeney was born in the village of Mayfield, East Sussex, England, one of six children of Gilbert and Lucy Dudeney. His grandfather, John Dudeney, was well known as a self-taught mathematician and shepherd; his initiative was much admired by his grandson. Dudeney learned to play chess at an early age, and continued to play frequently throughout his life. This led to a marked interest in mathematics and the composition of puzzles. Chess problems in particular fascinated him during his early years.
==Career==
Although Dudeney spent his career in the Civil Service, he continued to devise various problems and puzzles. Dudeney&#x27;s first puzzle contributions were submissions to newspapers and magazines, often under the pseudonym of &quot;Sphinx.&quot; Much of this earlier work was a collaboration with American puzzlist Sam Loyd; in 1890, they published a series of articles in the English penny weekly &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;.

Dudeney later contributed puzzles under his real name to publications such as &quot;The Weekly Dispatch&quot;, &quot;The Queen&quot;, &quot;Blighty&quot;, and &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. For twenty years, he had a successful column, &quot;Perplexities&quot;, in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, edited by the former editor of &quot;Tit-Bits&quot;, George Newnes. Dudeney continued to exchange puzzles with fellow recreational mathematician Sam Loyd for a while, but broke off the correspondence and accused Loyd of stealing his puzzles and publishing them under his own name.

Some of Dudeney&#x27;s most famous innovations were his 1903 success at solving the Haberdasher&#x27;s Puzzle (Cut an equilateral triangle into four pieces that can be rearranged to make a square) and publishing the first known crossnumber puzzle, in 1926. He has also been credited with discovering new applications of digital roots. Dudeney was a leading exponent of verbal arithmetic puzzles; his were always alphametic, where the letters constitute meaningful phrases or associated words.

Previously, it had been claimed (though not by Dudeney himself) that he was the inventor of verbal arithmetic. This was later refuted by the counter example of a verbal arithmetic puzzle published in the US in 1864.

Omission of detailed puzzle rules in the cited farm journal suggests they were already popular in America by 1864, when Dudeney was 7 years old. The popularity of these puzzles guarantees they&#x27;d be well known by then to Sam Loyd, an American puzzler and early Dudeney puzzle collaborator.

Both Dudeney and Loyd were featured by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;—Loyd in August 1957 and Dudeney in June 1958.

==Personal life==

In 1884 Dudeney married Alice Whiffin (1864–1945). She later became a very well known writer who published many novels as well as a number of short stories in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; under the name &quot;Mrs. Henry Dudeney&quot;. In her day, she was compared to Thomas Hardy for her portrayals of regional life. The income generated by her books was important to the Dudeney household, and her fame gained them entry to both literary and court circles.

After losing their first child at the age of four months in 1887, the Dudeneys had one daughter, Margery Janet (1890–1977). She married (John) Christopher Fulleylove, son of John Fulleylove and one of an esteemed family of English artists. The Fulleyloves emigrated to North America, first living in Canada and eventually settling first in Oakland, Michigan, and later New York. They had three sons: John Gabriel (died in infancy), James Shirley, and Julian John (&quot;Barney&quot;); and two daughters: Catherine and Elizabeth Ann (&quot;Nancy&quot;).

Alice&#x27;s personal diaries were edited by Diana Crook and published in 1998 under the title &quot;A Lewes Diary: 1916–1944&quot;. They give a lively picture of her attempts to balance her literary career with her marriage to her brilliant but volatile husband.

==Death==

In April 1930, Dudeney died of throat cancer in Lewes, where he and his wife had moved in 1914 to rekindle their marriage after a period of separation. Alice Dudeney survived him by fourteen years and died on 21 November 1945, after a stroke.

Both are buried in the Lewes town cemetery. Their grave is marked by a copy of an 18th-century Sussex sandstone obelisk, which Alice had copied after Ernest&#x27;s death to serve as their mutual tombstone.

<doc id="465318" wikidata="Q3098851" url="?curid=465318" title="Dighton Rock">
<text>The Dighton Rock is a 40-ton boulder, originally located in the riverbed of the Taunton River at Berkley, Massachusetts (formerly part of the town of Dighton). The rock is noted for its petroglyphs (&quot;primarily lines, geometric shapes, and schematic drawings of people, along with writing, both verified and not.&quot;), carved designs of ancient and uncertain origin, and the controversy about their creators. In 1963, during construction of a coffer dam, state officials removed the rock from the river for preservation. It was installed in a museum in the nearby Dighton Rock State Park. In 1971, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

==Appearance==
The boulder has the form of a slanted, six-sided block, approximately high, wide, and long. It is gray-brown crystalline sandstone of medium to coarse texture. The surface with the inscriptions has a trapezoidal face and is inclined 70 degrees to the northwest. It was found facing the water of the bay.

==History and mythology==
In 1680, the English colonist Rev. John Danforth made a drawing of the petroglyphs, which has been preserved in the British Museum. His drawing conflicts with the reports of others and the current markings on the rock. In 1690 Rev. Cotton Mather described the rock in his book &quot;The Wonderful Works of God Commemorated&quot;: Among the other Curiosities of New-England, one is that of a mighty Rock, on a perpendicular side whereof by a River, which at High Tide covers part of it, there are very deeply Engraved, no man alive knows How or When about half a score Lines, near Ten Foot Long, and a foot and half broad, filled with strange Characters: which would suggest as odd Thoughts about them that were here before us, as there are odd Shapes in that Elaborate Monument.

During the 19th century, many popular publications and public figures mentioned the rock. The poet and critic James Russell Lowell suggested that presidential candidates&#x27; letters to newspapers should be written in its undeciphered script: &quot;[I]f letters must be written, profitable use might be made of the Dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script, every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning.&quot; Lowell made other references to the rock in his widely circulated satirical writing, and may thus have helped to popularize it.
Hypotheses about the creation of the markings include:

;Indigenous peoples of North America
: …who were known to have inscribed petroglyphs in rocks (a schematic face on the Dighton Rock is similar to an Indian petroglyph in Eastern Vermont)

; Ancient Phoenicians
: …proposed in 1783 by Ezra Stiles in his &quot;Election Sermon&quot; as the &quot;descendants of the sons of Japheth&quot; 

;Norse
: …proposed in 1837 by Carl Christian Rafn. Rejected by archaeologists such as T. D. Kendrick and Kenneth Feder.

;Portuguese
: …proposed in 1912 by Edmund B. Delabarre, who (after seeing Portuguese writing) believed that they then used the rock for their own inscriptions Delabarre wrote that markings on the Dighton Rock suggest that Miguel Corte-Real reached New England. Delabarre stated that the markings were abbreviated Latin, and the message, translated into English, reads as follows: &quot;I, Miguel Cortereal, 1511. In this place, by the will of God, I became a chief of the Indians.&quot; Hunter (2017) provides copious evidence and analysis debunking the Corte-Real origin myth.

;Chinese
: …proposed by Gavin Menzies in his 2002 pseudohistorical book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered America&quot;

==State park==

In November 1952, the Miguel Corte-Real Memorial Society of New York City acquired of land adjacent to the rock to create a park. However, in 1951 the Massachusetts Legislature expropriated the same land for a State Park. More land was purchased. Dighton Rock State Park now has an area of . The vicinity of Dighton Rock has been beautified and furnished with parking and picnic facilities.

==Depths of inscriptions==
Although Mather described these as deeply cut, a statement which has been repeated to the present day, early reports suggested that this was not exactly the case. DelaBarre wrote:
One thing is certain, that former descriptions of the depth of the incisions cannot be used as evidence for any change. The first who describes them calls them &quot;deeply engraved&quot; in 1690; but Cotton Mather had never seen the rock, so far as we know, and this statement of his is doubtless on a par with his other statement that the characters are on &quot;a mighty Rock.&quot; Greenwood gives the first reliable description, in 1730. He definitely says that the &quot;indentures are not very considerable,&quot; and his drawing and his other statements prove that he had as much difficulty in making out the real characters as has ever been experienced since then. Even on the lowest part of the face, which alone does show evident signs of much wear, Mather&#x27;s draughtsman, and Greenwood, and their next followers, were even less successful in making out apparent characters than have been some later observers. Sewall in 1768 and Kendall in 1807 made definite statements to the effect that the greater part of the lines were so much effaced as to make their decipherment impossible, or wholly subject to the fancy.

<doc id="465322" wikidata="Q63184" url="?curid=465322" title="Bill Brandt">
<text>Bill Brandt (born Hermann Wilhelm Brandt; 2 May 1904 – 20 December 1983) was a British photographer and photojournalist. Born in Germany, Brandt moved to England, where he became known for his images of British society for such magazines as &quot;Lilliput&quot; and &quot;Picture Post&quot;; later he made distorted nudes, portraits of famous artists and landscapes. He is widely considered to be one of the most important British photographers of the 20th century.

==Life and work==

Born in Hamburg, Germany, son of a British father and German mother, Brandt grew up during World War I, during which his father, who had lived in Germany since the age of five, was interned for six months by the Germans as a British citizen. Brandt later disowned his German heritage and would claim he was born in South London. Shortly after the war, he contracted tuberculosis and spent much of his youth in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. He traveled to Vienna to undertake a course of treatment by psychoanalysis. He was, in any case, pronounced cured and was taken under the wing of socialite Eugenie Schwarzwald. When Ezra Pound visited the Schwarzwald residence, Brandt made his portrait. In appreciation, Pound reportedly offered Brandt an introduction to Man Ray, whose Paris studio and darkroom Brandt would access in 1930.

In 1933 Brandt moved to London and began documenting all levels of British society. From 1936 he began to document the British class system in 1936, encouraged by his reading of George Orwell&#x27;s essays and J. B. Priestley&#x27;s 1934 &quot;An English Journey&quot;, He said later: &quot;the extreme social contrast, during those years before the war, was, visually, very inspiring for me. I started by photographing in London, the West End, the suburbs, the slums.&quot; He documented the 1936 Jarrow March, then he travelled to the northeast of England, to capture the effects of the 1930s depression on the industrial landscape of the United Kingdom. He then focused predominantly on recording domestic scenes of miners in Northumberland, and then the urban landscape of Halifax, West Yorkshire, of which he later said, in a rare late career interview, as being &quot;absolutely extraordinary; a real dream town – I&#x27;d never seen anything like it before.

This kind of documentary was uncommon at that time. Brandt published two books showcasing this work, &quot;The English at Home&quot; (1936) and &quot;A Night in London&quot; (1938). He was a regular contributor to magazines such as &quot;Lilliput&quot;, &quot;Picture Post&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. He documented the Underground bomb shelters of London during The Blitz in 1940, commissioned by the Ministry of Information. Brandt took a total of 39 photos between the 4th and 12th of November before he had to stop due to catching the flu. The photos were taken with a Rolleiflex camera.

During World War II Brandt concentrated on many subjects – as can be seen in his &quot;Camera in London&quot; (1948) but excelled in portraiture and landscape. To mark the arrival of peace in 1945 he began a celebrated series of nudes. His major books from the post-war period are &quot;Literary Britain&quot; (1951), and &quot;Perspective of Nudes&quot; (1961), followed by a compilation of his best work, &quot;Shadow of Light&quot; (1966). Brandt became Britain&#x27;s most influential and internationally admired photographer of the 20th century. Many of his works have important social commentary but also poetic resonance. His landscapes and nudes are dynamic, intense and powerful, often using wide-angle lenses and distortion.

Brandt died in London in 1983.

==Recognition==
In 1984, Bill Brandt was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<text>The domain name int is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) in the Domain Name System of the Internet. Its name is derived from the word &quot;international&quot;, characterizing its use for international organizations and treaty-related purposes. The first use of this domain was by NATO, which had previously been assigned the top-level domain .nato.

According to Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) policy, based on RFC 1591, the sTLD &quot;int&quot; is reserved for international treaty-based organizations, United Nations agencies, and organizations or entities having observer status at the UN. &quot;int&quot; is considered to have the strictest application policies of all TLDs, as it implies that the holder is a subject of international law. For this reason, the application procedure requires the applicant to provide evidence that it is indeed treaty-based by providing a United Nations treaty registration number and that it has independent legal status. Previously, it also was open to Internet infrastructure services; those services have since been required to register in .arpa.

==Delegations==
, the domain &quot;int&quot; consists of 235 subdomain delegations.

The subdomain eu.int was used by the European Union–affiliated institutions. However, the aforementioned institutions&#x27; domain names switched to the TLD eu on May 9, 2006 (Europe Day). All previous eu.int addresses continued to be accessible for a transitional period of at least one year. , the European Central Bank continues to use ecb.int in addition to ecb.eu and ecb.europa.eu, and the .int domain is still sometimes used for email addresses.

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) saw its initial application for a domain name under &quot;int&quot; rejected on the grounds that the convention did not explicitly create an entity subject of international law. However, POPS appealed to the IANA Reconsideration Committee and obtained its domain (pops.int) on the grounds that other conventions lacking such specific language had nevertheless obtained a registration. The IANA granted the domain after the committee determined that (1) the organization was chartered by a treaty that was very likely to enter into force, and (2) despite lacking a legal track record, it met &quot;the requirement for independent international legal personality.&quot; This grant was subject to the provision that the status of eligibility be renewed if the treaty had not entered into force within four years of the registration.

Additionally, the domain &quot;int&quot; was historically also used for Internet infrastructure databases. The name space arpa had been slated to be moved into &quot;int&quot;, but in 2000 the Internet Architecture Board recommended that no new infrastructure databases should be added to &quot;int&quot; and that &quot;arpa&quot; retain its function. The only remaining technical role of &quot;int&quot; was for reverse translation of IPv6 addresses in the zone &quot;ip6.int&quot;. This zone was officially removed on 6 June 2006 in favor of &quot;ip6.arpa&quot;, also administered by IANA.

===Grandfathered delegations===
Several domains under &quot;int&quot; were granted prior to the application of the strict guidelines. World YMCA is an example of the loose guidelines applied in the early 1990s. IANA has not withdrawn the existing assignment from YMCA and other organisations such as The Phone Company (which has however not been available since 2011 and the domain name is no longer registered) who do not meet the current criteria.
