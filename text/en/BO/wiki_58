<text>Jenny Blake Isabella (born December 22, 1951), who writes under the names Tony Isabella and Jenny Blake, is an American comic book writer, editor, actor, artist and critic. She is the creator of Marvel Comics superhero Black Goliath, and of DC Comics&#x27; first major African-American superhero, Black Lightning. She was a columnist and critic for the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; magazine.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and influences ===
Isabella was born in Cleveland, Ohio on December 22, 1951. She discovered comics at the age of four, when her mother began bringing her I. W. Publications titles she bought at Woolworth. Early influences from the comic book world included Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Roy Thomas, Robert Kanigher, and Len Wein; Isabella also cited being influenced by William Shakespeare, Harlan Ellison, Ed McBain, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks, Lester Dent, Dave Barry, Max Allan Collins, Don Pendleton, and Studs Terkel.

As a teenager, she had many letters published in comic book letter columns, primarily in the pages of Marvel titles. She was an active member of the comics fandom, a member of CAPA-alpha (an amateur press association for comics), and a regular contributor to comics fanzines.

===Marvel Comics===
Isabella&#x27;s fanzine work attracted the attention of Marvel editor Roy Thomas (whose career began in similar fashion), and in 1972 Thomas hired Isabella as an editorial assistant. With Marvel&#x27;s establishment of Marvel UK that year, Isabella oversaw reprints used in Marvel UK&#x27;s nascent comics line. She briefly edited for Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white magazine line.

As a writer, Isabella scripted &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, the characters It! The Living Colossus in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;, Luke Cage in &quot;Hero for Hire&quot; and &quot;Power Man,&quot; Tigra in &quot;Marvel Chillers&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and &quot;Captain America&quot;. While writing the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; feature in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, she co-created the supporting character Misty Knight with artist Arvell Jones. Isabella developed the concept of &quot;The Champions&quot; series and wrote the first several issues.

====Controversy====
During her mid-1970s run on &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, Isabella wrote a two-year story arc in which Johnny Blaze occasionally encountered an unnamed character referred to as &quot;the Friend&quot; who protected him from Satan, the source of his supernatural powers and identity as Ghost Rider. Isabella said in 2007:
Isabella later identified the assistant editor as Jim Shooter. In 2020, Shooter said he was concerned that this &quot;basically established the Marvel universe is a Christian universe&quot; and could alienate readers by suggesting &quot;that all other religions are false&quot;. Shooter said he made the changes after consulting with editor Marv Wolfman.

===DC Comics===
Isabella worked as a writer and story editor for DC Comics, and is known for creating &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, and writing both the character&#x27;s short-lived 1970s and 1990s series. After reaching an agreement with DC, Isabella returned to the character in 2017 with the publication of the &quot;Black Lightning: Cold Dead Hands&quot; limited series.

Isabella and artist Richard Howell produced the &quot;Shadow War of Hawkman&quot; mini-series in 1985, involving the characters of Hawkman and Hawkwoman. An ongoing series was launched the following year.

===Justice Machine===
In 1987, Isabella began writing the &quot;Justice Machine&quot; series for , co-plotting with series creator and penciller Mike Gustovich. The new series picked up from the end of the Bill Willingham/Gustovich written limited series &quot;Justice Machine featuring the Elementals&quot;, which re-booted the series&#x27; continuity from the older Noble Comics/Texas Comics-published original series. The ongoing book became one of Comico&#x27;s best-selling series, selling upwards of 70,000 copies of each issue at its peak. Isabella wrote the first 11 issues of the Comico series before moving on to other projects.

In 1990, Isabella returned to the characters and wrote the series for Innovation Comics, with Gustovich pencilling once more.

===&quot;Tony&#x27;s Tips&quot;===
Isabella wrote the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; column &quot;Tony&#x27;s Tips&quot; for over a decade. The last column was June 22, 2010. Starting in 2013, she continued &quot;Tony&#x27;s Tips&quot; online at &quot;Tales of Wonder&quot;. She also regularly writes about comics and her work on her personal blog.

=== Books ===
Isabella and her fellow &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; columnist Bob Ingersoll co-authored the short story &quot;If Wishes Were Horses...&quot; which was published in &quot;The Ultimate Super-Villains: New Stories Featuring Marvel&#x27;s Deadliest Villains&quot; (1996). The pair also wrote the novels &quot;Captain America: Liberty&#x27;s Torch&quot; (1998) and &quot;Star Trek: The Case Of The Colonist&#x27;s Corpse &quot;(2003)&quot;.&quot;

In 2009, her non-fiction book &quot;1000 Comics You Must Read&quot; was published by Krause Publications.&quot;&quot;

===Other work===
During the 1980s, Isabella operated Cosmic Comics, a comic book shop in the Colonial Arcade in Downtown Cleveland.

She has translated and localized foreign-language Disney comics for the U.S. market.

In 2020, Isabella cameoed as &quot;Judge Isabella&quot; on the CW series &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, based on the DC comic created by her and Trevor Von Eeden, who also plays a judge.

== Personal life ==
Isabella&#x27;s wife is named Barbara; they have two children, Eddie (born c. 1989) and Kelly (born c. 1992).

In a February 9, 2025 social media post, Isabella came out as transgender with a meme reading &quot;Keep Calm and Yes I&#x27;m Transgender&quot;. In a Facebook post, she said she would continue writing as both Jenny Blake Isabella and Tony Isabella.

<doc id="457317" wikidata="Q7437624" url="?curid=457317" title="Scottish Assembly">
<text>The Scottish Assembly was a proposed legislature for Scotland that would have devolved a set list of powers from the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Labour Government led the Scotland Act 1978 through Westminster which provided for the establishment of the Scottish Assembly.

Although the majority of those who voted at the referendum on 1 March 1979 voted in favour of the Act, the provisions were not put in place due to the additional requirement that 40% of the total electorate also vote in favour. The Scottish National Party subsequently refused to support the government in a later vote of no confidence. Home rule for Scotland would not become a reality until 1999 following the Scotland Act 1998 establishing the Scottish Parliament.

==History==

A devolved Scottish Assembly that would have some form of legislative powers in jurisdiction over Scotland was a long-held political priority for many individuals and organisations. The drive for home rule first took concrete shape in the nineteenth century, as demands for it in Ireland were met with similar (although not as widespread) demands in Scotland.

===19th Century===

In 1853 the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights was established. This body was close to the Conservatives and was motivated by a desire to secure more focus on Scottish problems in response to what they felt was undue attention being focused on Ireland by the then Liberal government.

This body was concerned with increasing the attention that Scotland was receiving and did not advocate legislative devolution in the form of an assembly as such, but nevertheless, it marked the beginning of a political focus on Scotland.

Shortly after this, the Liberals began to commit to home rule. In 1871, William Ewart Gladstone stated at a meeting held in Aberdeen that if Ireland was to be granted home rule, then the same should apply to Scotland. In 1885 the post of Secretary for Scotland was re-established as the demands for greater political focus on Scotland grew. In the following year Gladstone introduced a home rule bill for Ireland helping to prompt the formation of the Scottish Home Rule Association, a nominally non-partisan political organisation, but actually closely tied with the Liberals, which aimed for the establishment of an assembly.

===Early 20th Century===

From 1895 to 1905 the Conservatives and their Liberal Unionist allies were in power (the two combined usually referred to by the single moniker &quot;Unionist&quot;), and home rule did not feature as part of their plans. However, the return of a Liberal government in 1905 gave great hope to those seeking an assembly, as the Liberals were officially committed to the idea. But it did not feature as an immediate priority of government, and by the time a Scottish home rule bill was presented to the Westminster Parliament in 1913, and passed second reading but did not proceed further due to the First World War.

After the war a second &quot;Scottish Home Rule Association&quot; was formed (the first had fallen into inactivity). This was driven not only by Liberals but also by those involved in the growing Labour Party and the Independent Labour Party in particular. The Labour Party, formed in 1900, was formally committed to establishing an assembly for Scotland and this seemed to increase prospects for home rule.

The demands for political change in the way in which Scotland was run changed dramatically in the 1920s when Scottish nationalists started to form various organisations. The Scots National League was formed in 1920 in favour of Scottish independence, and this movement was superseded in 1928 by the formation of the National Party of Scotland, which became the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934.

At first the SNP sought only the establishment of a devolved Scottish assembly, but in 1942 they changed this to support all-out independence. This caused the resignation of John MacCormick from the SNP and he formed the Scottish Covenant Association. This body proved to be the biggest mover in favour of the formation of a Scottish assembly, collecting over two million signatures in the late 1940s and early 1950s and attracting support from across the political spectrum. However, without formal links to any of the political parties it withered, and devolution and the establishment of an assembly were put on the political back burner.

However, by the 1960s the SNP&#x27;s support was growing, as shown by their victory in the 1967 Hamilton by-election. The pro Union parties responded by committing themselves to supporting devolution. The Labour government formed the Kilbrandon Commission to draw up devolution plans, and Edward Heath committed the Conservatives to supporting some form of devolution at the 1968 Scottish Conservative Conference in Perth (commonly known as his &quot;Declaration of Perth&quot;).

===1970s===

However the SNP had a disappointing result in the 1970 general election, and for the first part of the 1970s devolution under Heath&#x27;s government was off the cards. But significant SNP advances in the general elections in 1974 brought the issue to the fore again.

In 1978 the Labour government passed the Scotland Act which legislated for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly, provided the Scots voted for such in a referendum. However, the Labour Party was bitterly divided on the subject of devolution. Despite officially favouring it, vast numbers of members opposed the establishment of an assembly, and this division caused the failure to reach the required 40% of the electorate voting in favour of an assembly (that itself was a quota only added to the Scotland Act by an amendment proposed by a Labour MP).

The ensuing general election in 1979 proved electorally disastrous for both Labour and the SNP, and it seemed that the prospects for a Scottish Assembly were remote. However, in the early 1980s a number of Labour Party and SNP members decided to form the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly, which pamphleteered and lobbied for devolution. This campaign, combined with growing resentment at the fact that despite a majority of Scots voting against the Conservatives they were forming their government, increased demands for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.

==Scottish Assembly proposed in the Scotland Act 1978==

===Structure===
Had the Scotland Act 1978 entered force, it would have created a Scottish Assembly with limited legislative powers. There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a &quot;First Secretary&quot;, taking over some of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Meetings of the Scottish Assembly would have been held at the Old Royal High School in Regent Road, Edinburgh. The former school hall was adapted for use by the Scottish Assembly, including the installation of microphones and new olive green leather seating. Members would have been elected by the first past the post system.

===Powers and legislation===
The Scottish Assembly would have had the power to introduce primary legislation (to be known as Measures of the Scottish Assembly) within defined areas of competence. This form of legislation would not receive royal assent like Acts of Parliament do. Instead, the legislation is signed via an Order in Council, which the monarch signs and appends to the Act of Assembly once passed.

The areas of responsibility included:
*Education
*The environment
*Health
*Home affairs
*Legal matters
*Social services

Responsibility for agriculture, fisheries and food would be divided between the Assembly and the United Kingdom government, while the latter would retain control of electricity supply.

Two possible contenders for the post of First Secretary were the Reverend Geoff Shaw, leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, and Professor John P Mackintosh MP – but both died in 1978.

==Scottish Constitutional Convention==
In 1989 the Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed encompassing the Labour Party and the Lib-Dems as well as other parties, local authorities, and huge sections of civic Scotland. Its purpose was to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement for Scotland. Suddenly the prospects for a Scottish Assembly seemed much brighter, despite the fact the SNP decided not to take part as they felt that independence would not be a constitutional option countenanced by the convention.

The convention produced its final report in 1995 and, with the return of a Labour government in 1997, devolution seemed assured. Later that year the Scottish people voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing the devolved Scottish Parliament in a referendum, and the first elections for that body took place in 1999.

<text>The Short S.25 Sunderland is a British flying boat patrol bomber, developed and constructed by Short Brothers for the Royal Air Force (RAF). The aircraft took its service name from the town (latterly, city) and port of Sunderland in North East England.

Developed in parallel with the civilian S.23 &quot;Empire&quot; flying boat, the flagship of Imperial Airways, the Sunderland was developed specifically to conform to the requirements of British Air Ministry Specification R.2/33 for a long-range patrol/reconnaissance flying boat to serve with the Royal Air Force. As designed, it served as a successor to the earlier Short Sarafand flying boat. Sharing several similarities with the S.23, it featured a more advanced aerodynamic hull and was outfitted with various offensive and defensive armaments, including machine gun turrets, bombs, aerial mines, and depth charges. The Sunderland was powered by four Bristol Pegasus XVIII radial engines and was outfitted with various detection equipment to aid combat operations, including the Leigh searchlight, the ASV Mark II and ASV Mark III radar units, and an astrodome.

The Sunderland was one of the most powerful and widely used flying boats throughout the Second World War. In addition to the RAF, the type was operated by other Allied military air wings, including the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), South African Air Force (SAAF), Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), French Navy, Norwegian Air Force, and the Portuguese Navy. During the conflict, the type was heavily involved in Allied efforts to counter the threat posed by German U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic. On 17 July 1940, a RAAF Sunderland (of No. 10 Squadron) performed the type&#x27;s first unassisted U-boat kill. Sunderlands also played a major role in the Mediterranean theatre, performing maritime reconnaissance flights and logistical support missions. During the evacuation of Crete, shortly after the German invasion of the island, several aircraft were used to transport troops. Numerous unarmed Sunderlands were also flown by civil operator British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), traversing routes as far afield as the Pacific Ocean.

During the post-war era, use of the Sunderland throughout Europe rapidly declined, while greater numbers remained in service in the Far East, where large developed runways were less prevalent. Between mid-1950 and September 1954, several squadrons of RAF Sunderlands saw combat action during the Korean War. Around a dozen aircraft had also participated in the Berlin airlift, delivering supplies to the blockaded German city. The RAF continued to use the Sunderland in a military capacity up to 1959. In December 1960, the French Navy retired its aircraft, which were the last remaining examples in military use within the Northern Hemisphere. The type also remained in service with the RNZAF up to 1967, when they were replaced by the land-based Lockheed P-3 Orion. A number of Sunderlands were converted for use within the civil sector, where they were known as the Hythe and the Sandringham; in this configuration, the type continued in airline operation until 1974 - despite being originally made for military use, the Sunderland had a far longer commercial lifespan than its civilian market Empire sibling and was one of the last large WWII-era flying boats in airline service. Several examples were preserved, including a single airworthy Sunderland which has been placed on display in Florida at Fantasy of Flight.
==Development==
===Origins===
During the early 1930s, there was intense international competition to develop suitable aircraft to operate new long-range intercontinental passenger service between the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany. It was recognised that the United Kingdom had no existing equivalent to the new American Sikorsky S-42 flying boats or the German Dornier Do X. Accordingly, in 1934, the British Postmaster General declared that all first-class Royal Mail sent overseas was to travel by air, establishing a subsidy for the development of intercontinental air transport in a fashion similar to the U.S. domestic programme a decade earlier. In response, Imperial Airways announced a competition to design and manufacture a fleet of 28 large flying boats, each weighing and having a range of with a capacity for 24 passengers. A corresponding contract was issued to Short Brothers of Rochester for their design, which became the S.23 Empire.

While the Empire flying boat has often been credited as a predecessor of the Sunderland, according to aviation author Geoffrey Norris, this impression &quot;is not strictly true&quot;. During November 1933, the British Air Ministry released Specification R.2/33, which called for the development of a next-generation long-range general purpose flying boat, intended to perform ocean reconnaissance missions. The specification envisioned an aircraft, either a monoplane or biplane, which would have to have performance equal to the recently delivered Short Sarafand flying boat, along with various other requirements, including the need to be powered by a maximum of four engines and to be much more compact than the Sarafand. Specification R.2/33 was released before the publication of the commercial Imperial Airways requirement; by the time that Short received Imperial Airways&#x27; request the company had already started planning the design of the prospective military flying boat. After reviewing both sets of requirements, Short decided to prioritise the development of the civil S.23 design but also to work on a response to specification R.2/33.

Chief designer Arthur Gouge had originally intended for a COW 37 mm gun to be mounted in the bow of the craft to accompany the single Lewis gun installed in its tail. As with the S.23, he made efforts to produce a fuselage that generated the lowest amount of drag possible, while a much longer nose than had been used for the S.23 was ultimately adopted.

===Selection===
During October 1934, Shorts settled upon the general configuration and geometry of the design, opting for a four-engine shoulder-wing monoplane configuration, similar to the Short Empire that had been ordered at the same time. The military flying boat design received the internal designation of S.25. While the S.25 design bore a strong resemblance to the civil S.23, it featured an improved aerodynamic form, and sheetmetal with curvature in more than one direction. This compound curve was more complex to manufacture but gave a more ideal shape.

During late 1934, the S.25 proposal was submitted by the company to the Air Ministry. Rival firm Saunders-Roe had also designed and submitted its own flying boat, known as the Saro A.33, as its response to the issuing of Specification R.2/33. Following an initial evaluation of the submissions, the Ministry decided to place orders for the production of prototypes for both the S.25 and A.33 proposals; this measure was originally made for the purpose of performing flight tests in support of a detailed evaluation, after which production order would be awarded to one of the competitors.

During April 1936, the Air Ministry was sufficiently confident in Shorts&#x27; submission that a development contract for an initial batch of 11 further S.25 boats was issued to the company. On 4 July 1936, the first of the Empire flying boats to be built, G-ADHL, named &#x27;Canopus&#x27;, conducted its first flight which affirmed the basic principles of the S.25&#x27;s design while the crucial final design conference was held around the same time as the flight. The competitive fly-off was abandoned after the sole A.33 was destroyed due to a structural failure, resulting in the S.25 being the only candidate.

As construction of the prototype S.25 proceeded, several design changes were performed for various reasons. In terms of its armament, in response to feedback from Air Ministry and Royal Air Force (RAF) experts reviewing the project, it was decided to change its intended defensive weapons, resulting in the switch to a single 0.303 Vickers K machine gun for the nose turret while an arrangement of four 0.303 Browning machine guns in the tail position was also adopted at the same time. The tail turret was also changed to a powered version; Gouge therefore had to devise a solution to account for the resulting movement aft of the aircraft&#x27;s centre of gravity, which was initially achieved via the presence of ballast positioned in the forward area. By the end of September 1937, the prototype had been completed.

===Flight testing===
On 16 October 1937, the initial S.25 prototype (&quot;K4774&quot;) performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight, fitted with Bristol Pegasus X radial engines capable of generating of power each. The more powerful &quot;Pegasus XXII&quot; model was unavailable at the time. Flown by Shorts&#x27; chief test pilot John Lankester Parker and Harold Piper, the initial flight lasted for around 45 minutes; later that day, a second flight of a similar duration was performed. Parker later declared his satisfaction with the basic design. Prior to the first flight, the type had received the name &quot;Sunderland&quot;.

Following early flight trials with the first prototype, the aircraft was returned to the workshop where it underwent further modifications; the adoption of a wing sweepback of 4° 15&#x27; was achieved via the addition of a spacer into the front spar attachments. This design change, which had been made to account for the changes in defensive armament, repositioned the flying boat&#x27;s centre of lift enough to compensate for the altered centre of gravity; further alterations were necessary to maintain the hydrodynamics properties. On 7 March 1938, &quot;K4774&quot; conducted its first post-modification flight, having been outfitted with the intended Bristol Pegasus XXII radial engines, each one capable of generating .

On 21 April 1938, the first Sunderland Mark 1 of the development batch conducted its first flight. By this point, manufacturer testing of the prototype had already been completed and the prototype had been transferred to the Seaplane Experimental Station at Felixstowe, Suffolk for its official evaluation by the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE); on 8 March 1938, it was joined by the second production aircraft. On 28 May 1938, this second aircraft, which had been cleared for operations under tropical conditions, flew a record-breaking flight to Seletar, Singapore, stopping off along the route at Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Habbaniyah, Bahrain, Karachi, Gwalior, Calcutta, Rangoon, and Mergui.

Testing showed that the aircraft could be fully refueled in 20 minutes, and that its most economical cruising speed was about at . At this speed and altitude, a consumption rate of gave the aircraft an endurance of 18 hours, during which it could cover . The take-off distance was found to be .

==Design==
===Overview===

The Short S.25 Sunderland was a large four-engined flying boat developed for military use. The design of the S.25 shared much in common with the civil-orientated S.23, principally differing in its use of a deeper hull profile. As with the S.23, the interior of the Sunderland&#x27;s fuselage contained two individual decks; the lower deck contained a total of six bunks, along with a galley outfitted with a twin kerosene pressure stove, a yacht-style porcelain flush toilet, an anchoring winch, and a small machine shop for performing inflight repairs. The crew was originally intended to total seven members; this was subsequently increased for later versions of the Sunderland to around 11 crew members and sometimes greater, dependent upon the specific mission being undertaken.

The Sunderland featured all-metal, mainly flush-riveted construction, except for the flight control surfaces, which used a fabric-covered metal frame construction. Of these, the flaps employed unusual Gouge-patented devices that slid backwards along curved tracks, moving rearwards and downwards to increase the wing area and generating 30% greater lift for landing. The thick wings, upon which the aircraft&#x27;s four nacelle-mounted Bristol Pegasus XXII radial engines were carried, also accommodated a total of six drum-style fuel tanks, which had a total capacity of 9,200 litres (2,025 Imperial gallons, 2,430 U.S. gallons). In addition to the main fuel tanks, an arrangement of four smaller fuel tanks was installed behind the rear wing spar later on; with the extra tanks fitted, the Sunderland had a combined total fuel capacity of 11,602 litres (2,550 Imperial gallons, 3,037 U.S. gallons), which was enough to enable the type to conduct eight- to 14-hour patrols.

The specification to which the Sunderland was developed to conform with had called for an offensive armament of a 37 mm gun and up to of bombs, mines or (eventually) depth charges. The ordnance was stored inside the fuselage in a purpose-built bomb room and was winched up to racks, under the wing centre section, that could be traversed out through doors on each side of the fuselage above the waterline to the release position. Defensive armament included a Nash &amp; Thompson FN-13 powered turret with four .303 British Browning machine guns in the extreme tail and a pair of manually-operated .303 set on either side of the fuselage, firing from ports just below and behind the wings. These machine guns were later upgraded to 0.5-inch calibre Brownings. There were two different nose turret weapons, the most common, later, being two Browning machine guns. The nose weapons were later augmented by four fixed guns, two each side, in the forward fuselage that were fired by the pilot. Much later, a twin-gun turret was to be dorsal-mounted on the upper fuselage, about level with the wing trailing edge, bringing the total defensive armament up to 16 machine guns.

===Equipment and on-water management===
As with all water-based aircraft, there was a need to be able to navigate on water and to control the craft up to and at a mooring. In addition to the standard navigation lights, there was also a demountable mooring mast that was positioned on the upper fuselage just aft of the astrodome hatch with a 360-degree white light to show that the aircraft was moored. The crewmembers were trained in common marine signals for watercraft to ensure safety in busy waters. The craft could be moored to a buoy by a pendant that attached to the keel under the forward fuselage. When the craft was off the buoy, the forward end of the pendant was attached to the front of the hull just below the bomb aimer&#x27;s window. For anchoring, there was a demountable bollard that fixed to the forward fuselage from where the front turret was retracted to allow an airman to man the position and pick up the buoy cage or to toss out the anchor.

For taxiing after landing, the galley hatches were used to extend sea drogues that could be used to turn the aircraft or maintain its crosswind progress (by deploying the drogue on one side only), or to slow forward motion as much as possible (both deployed). When not in use, the drogues were hand hauled back inboard, folded, and stowed in wall-mounted containers just below the hatches. Operation of the drogues could be a very dangerous exercise if the aircraft was travelling on the water at speed or in strong currents, because the approximately drogue would haul up on its five-tonne attachment cable end inside the galley very sharply and powerfully. Once deployed, it was normally impossible to recover a drogue unless the aircraft was stationary relative to the local tidal flow.

Portable beaching gear could be attached by ground crew so that the aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted of a pair of two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four-wheel trolley and towbar attached under the rear of the hull. A standard stocked anchor was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the anchor winch. Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.

===Access and servicing===

The Sunderland was usually entered through the bow compartment door on the left forward side of the aircraft. The internal compartments—bow, gun room, ward room, galley, bomb room and the after compartments—were fitted with &quot;swash&quot; doors to keep them watertight to about two feet (610 mm) above normal water level; these doors were normally kept closed. There was another external door in the tail compartment on the right side. This door was intended for boarding from a Braby (U-shaped) pontoon that was used where there was a full passenger service mooring alongside a wharf or similar. This door could also be used to accept passengers or stretcher-bound patients when the aircraft was in the open water; this was because the engines had to be kept running to maintain the aircraft&#x27;s position for the approaching vessel and the front door was too close to the left inboard propeller. Normal access to the external upper parts of the aircraft was through the astrodome hatch at the front of the front spar of the wing centre section, just at the rear of the navigator&#x27;s station.


Bombs were loaded in through the &quot;bomb doors&quot; that formed the upper half walls of the bomb room on both sides. The bomb racks were able to run in and out from the bomb room on tracks in the underside of the wing. In order to load them, weapons were hoisted up to the extended racks that were run inboard and either lowered to stowages on the floor or prepared for use on the retracted racks above the stowed items. The doors were spring-loaded to pop inwards from their frames and would fall under gravity so that the racks could run out through the space left in the top of the compartment. The bombs could be released locally or remotely from the pilot&#x27;s position during a bomb run.

Normally, the weapons were either bombs or depth charges and the racks were limited to a maximum of each. After the first salvo was dropped, the crew had to get the next eight weapons loaded before the pilot had the aircraft positioned on the next bombing run. The fixed nose guns (introduced when in service with Australian units) were removed when the aircraft was on the water and stowed in the gun room just aft of the bow compartment. The toilet was in the right half of this same compartment and stairs from the cockpit to the bow area divided the two.
Maintenance was performed on the engines by opening panels in the leading edge of the wing either side of the powerplant. A plank could be fitted across the front of the engine on the extensions of the open panels. A small manually started auxiliary petrol engine, which was fitted into the leading edge of the right wing, powered a bilge pump for clearing water and other fluids from the fuselage bilges and a fuel pump for refuelling. Generally, the aircraft were reasonably water tight, and two people manually operating a wobble pump could transfer fuel faster than the auxiliary pump. In sheltered moorings or at sea, fuelling was accomplished by a powered or unpowered barge and with engine driven or hand powered pumps. At regular moorings, there would be specially designed refuelling barges to do the job, normally manned by trained marine crew. These vessels could refuel many aircraft during the course of the day. Handling of the fuel nozzles and opening/closing the aircraft fuel tanks would normally be an aircraftman&#x27;s task.

Airframe repairs were either effected from the inside or delayed until the aircraft was in a sheltered mooring or beached. One serious problem was that the heat-treated rivets in the hull plates were susceptible to corrosion after a period in salt water (depending on the quality of the heat treatment process). The heads would pop off from stress corrosion, allowing seawater to leak into the bilges. The only option was to haul the aircraft out of the water and replace them, usually at the cost of many additional heads breaking off from the vibration of the riveting.

===Damage control===
A large float mounted under each wing maintained stability on water. With no wind, the float on the heavier side was always in the water; with some wind, the aircraft could be held using the ailerons with both floats out of the water. In the event of a float being broken off for some reason, as the craft lost airspeed after landing crew members would go out onto the opposite wing, to keep the remaining float in the water until the aircraft could reach its mooring. Marine growths on the hull were a problem; the resulting drag could be enough to prevent a fully loaded aircraft from gaining enough speed to become airborne. The aircraft could be taken to a freshwater mooring for sufficient time to kill off the fauna and flora growing on the bottom, which would then be washed away during takeoff runs. The alternative was to scrub it off, either in the water or on land.

Aircraft with lower hull damage were patched or had the holes filled with any materials to hand before landing. The aircraft would then be immediately put onto a slipway with its wheeled beaching gear or beached on a sandy shore before it could sink. More than two fuselage compartments had to be full of water to sink the aircraft. During the Second World War, a number of severely damaged aircraft were deliberately landed on grass airfields ashore. In at least one case, an aircraft that made a grass landing was repaired to fly again. On the Sunderland Mk V, fuel could be dumped from retractable pipes that extended from the hull and were attached to the bomb room side of the galley aft bulkhead. It was expected that dumping would be done while airborne, but it could also be performed while floating on the water, albeit with care to ensure that the floating fuel went downwind away from the aircraft.

==Operational history==

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, on 3 September 1939, 39 Sunderlands were in service with the RAF. Although British anti-submarine efforts were disorganised and ineffectual at first, Sunderlands quickly proved useful in the rescue of the crews from torpedoed ships. On 21 September 1939, two Sunderlands rescued the entire 34-man crew of the torpedoed merchantman &quot;Kensington Court&quot; from the North Sea. As British anti-submarine measures improved, the Sunderland began to inflict losses as well. A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Sunderland (of No. 10 Squadron) made the type&#x27;s first unassisted kill of a U-boat on 17 July 1940.

During its service, the Sunderland Mark I received various improvements. The nose turret was upgraded with a second .303 (7.7 mm) gun. New propellers together with pneumatic rubber wing de-icing boots were also fitted. Although the .303 guns lacked range and hitting power, the Sunderland had a considerable number of them and it was a well-built machine that was hard to destroy. On 3 April 1940, a Sunderland operating off Norway was attacked by six German Junkers Ju 88C fighters; during the engagement, it shot one down, damaged another enough to cause it to retreat and later perform a forced landing and drove off the rest. The Germans are reputed to have nicknamed the Sunderland the &quot;Fliegendes Stachelschwein&quot; (&quot;Flying Porcupine&quot;) due to its defensive firepower.

Sunderlands also proved themselves in the Mediterranean theatre. They flew many evacuation missions during the German seizure of Crete, carrying as many as 82 passengers. One flew the reconnaissance mission to observe the Italian fleet at anchor in Taranto before the famous Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s torpedo attack on 11 November 1940.

New weapons made the flying boats more deadly in combat. In 1939 during an accidental fratricidal attack, one anti-submarine bomb hit the British submarine doing no more damage than breaking its light bulbs; other bombs had reportedly bounced up and hit their launch aircraft. In early 1943, these ineffective weapons were replaced by Torpex-filled depth charges that would sink to a determined depth and then explode. This eliminated the problem of bounce-back, and the shock wave propagating through the water augmented the explosive effect.
While the bright Leigh searchlight was rarely fitted to Sunderlands, ASV Mark II radar enabled the flying boats to attack U-boats on the surface. In response, the German submarines began to carry a radar warning system known formally as &quot;Metox&quot;, and informally as the &quot;Cross of Biscay&quot; due to the appearance of its receiving antenna, that was tuned to the ASV frequency and gave the submarines early warning that an aircraft was in the area. Kills fell off drastically until ASV Mark III radar was introduced in early 1943, which operated in the centimetric band and used antennas mounted in blisters under the wings outboard of the floats, instead of the cluttered stickleback aerials. Sunderland Mark IIIs fitted with ASV Mark III were called Sunderland Mark IIIAs. Centimetric radar was invisible to Metox and baffled the Germans at first. Admiral Karl Dönitz, commander of the German U-boat force, suspected that the British were being informed of submarine movements by spies. In August 1943, a captured RAF airman misled the Germans by telling them that the aircraft were homing in on the signals radiated by the Metox, and consequently U-boat commanders were instructed to turn them off.

The Germans responded to Sunderland attacks by fitting some U-boats with one or two 37 mm and twin quad 20 mm flak guns to fire back at their attackers. While Sunderlands could suppress flak to an extent with their nose turret guns, the U-boats&#x27; guns had superior range, hitting power and accuracy. Attempting to shoot down Allied aircraft did, however, prolong the U-boat&#x27;s presence on the surface, which made sinking the vessel easier. Nonetheless, fitting of substantial arrays of anti-aircraft guns temporarily decreased U-boat losses while both Allied aircraft and shipping losses rose. As a countermeasure to the increased defensive armament of the U-boats, the Australians fitted their aircraft in the field with an additional four .303s (7.7 mm) in fixed mounts in the nose, allowing the pilot to add fire while diving on the submarine before bomb release. Most aircraft were similarly modified. The addition of single .50 inch (12.7 mm) flexibly mounted M2 Browning machine guns in the beam hatches behind and above the wing trailing edge also became common.

====1943 encounter with Ju 88s====

The type&#x27;s capacity to defend itself was demonstrated in particular by an air battle over the Bay of Biscay on 2 June 1943, when eight Junkers Ju 88Cs attacked a single Sunderland Mk III of No. 461 Squadron RAAF: &quot;EJ134&quot;, squadron code: &quot;N for Nuts&quot;. The 11 crew, led by F/Lt Colin Walker, were on an anti-submarine patrol, while also watching for any signs of a missing airliner, BOAC Flight 777. At 1900 hours, the rear gunner saw the Ju 88s, which belonged to &quot;V.Kampfgeschwader 40&quot; and were led by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Friedrich Maeder. Walker ordered the dumping of the bombs and depth charges, and took the engines to full power. Two Ju 88s made simultaneous passes at &quot;EJ134&quot; from both sides, scoring hits and disabling one engine, while the pilots fought fires and took the Sunderland through corkscrew manoeuvres. On a third pass, the dorsal turret gunner badly damaged or shot down a Ju 88, although the Sunderland&#x27;s rear gunner was knocked unconscious.
The next Ju 88 that attacked was hit by fire from the dorsal and nose turrets, and appeared to have been shot down. By this time, one crew member on the Sunderland had been mortally wounded and most of the others were wounded to varying degrees, while the aircraft&#x27;s radio gear had been destroyed, among other damage. However, the rear gunner had recovered, and when &quot;EJ134&quot; was attacked from behind, another Ju 88 was badly damaged and left the fight. The remaining Ju 88s continued to attack and the front gunner damaged one of these, setting its engines on fire. Two more Ju 88s were also damaged and the Germans disengaged. &quot;EJ134&quot; was badly damaged and the crew threw everything they could overboard, while nursing the aircraft over the journey to Britain. At 2248 hours, Walker managed to beach the aircraft at Praa Sands, Cornwall. The 10 surviving crew members were able to wade ashore, while the Sunderland broke up in the surf. Walker received the Distinguished Service Order and several other crew members also received medals. They claimed three Ju 88s destroyed. With the exception of Walker, the crew returned to operations in a new &quot;N for Nuts&quot;, which was lost over the Bay of Biscay two months later, in an attack by six Ju 88s. On 2 June 2013, a memorial was dedicated on the green at Praa Sands.

===Postwar===
At the end of the Second World War, a number of new Sunderlands built at Belfast were simply taken out to sea and scuttled as there was nothing else to do with them. In Europe the type was removed from service relatively quickly but in the Far East, where well developed runways were less common and large land based maritime patrol aircraft like the new Avro Shackleton could not be used so easily, there was still a need for it, and it remained in service with the RAF Far East Air Force at Singapore until 1959, and with the Royal New Zealand Air Force&#x27;s No. 5 Squadron RNZAF until 1967.

During the Berlin Airlift (June 1948 – August 1949) 10 Sunderlands and two transport variants (known as &quot;Hythes&quot;) were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to the isolated city, landing on the Havel river near RAF Gatow until it iced over. The Sunderlands were frequently used for transporting salt, as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater and their control cables were roof-mounted, as opposed to underfloor in most other aircraft. Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage. When the Havelsee did freeze over the Sunderland&#x27;s role was taken by freight-converted Handley Page Halifaxes with salt being carried in panniers fitted under the fuselage to avoid the corrosion problem.
From mid-1950, RAF Sunderlands also saw service during the Korean War initially with No. 88 Squadron but shortly followed by Nos. 205 and 209 Squadrons. The three squadrons shared the operational task equally with rotational detachments of three or four aircraft and crews based at Iwakuni, Japan. Missions lasting 10 to 13 hours were flown daily throughout the war, and also during the Armistice period that followed, until September 1954. The Sunderland also saw service with the RNZAF until 1967.

The French Navy Escadrille 7FE, which received Sunderlands when it was formed in 1943 as No. 343 Squadron RAF, continued to operate them until December 1960, the last unit to operate Sunderlands in the Northern Hemisphere.

==Variants==

===Prototype===
The first S.25, now named the Sunderland Mark I, flew from the River Medway on 16 October 1937 with Shorts&#x27; chief test pilot, John Lankester Parker at the controls. The deeper hull and installation of nose and tail turrets gave the Sunderland a considerably different appearance from the Empire flying boats. The prototype was fitted with Bristol Pegasus X engines, each providing 950 hp (709 kW ), as the planned Pegasus XXII engines of 1,010 hp (753 kW) were not available at the time.

The 37 mm gun, originally intended as a primary anti-submarine weapon, was dropped from the plans during the prototype phase and replaced with a Nash &amp; Thompson FN-11 nose turret mounting a single .303-inch (7.7 mm) Vickers GO machine gun. The turret could be winched back into the nose, revealing a small &quot;deck&quot; and demountable marine bollard used during mooring manoeuvres on the water. The change of armament in the nose to the much lighter gun moved the centre of gravity rearwards.

After the first series of flights, the prototype was modified to have a wing that was swept 4.25° to the rear, thereby moving the centre of pressure into a more reasonable position in relation to the new centre of gravity. This left the engines and wing floats canted out from the aircraft&#x27;s centreline. Although the wing loading was much higher than that of any previous Royal Air Force flying boat, a new flap system kept the takeoff run to a reasonable length.

===Sunderland Mark I===
The RAF received its first Sunderland Mark I in June 1938 when the second production aircraft (&quot;L2159&quot;) was flown to 230 Squadron at RAF Seletar, Singapore. By the outbreak of war in Europe, in September 1939, RAF Coastal Command was operating 40 Sunderlands.

The main offensive load was up to of bombs (usually ), mines () or other stores that were hung on traversing racks under the wing centre section (to and from the &quot;bomb room&quot; in the fuselage). Later, depth charges (usually 250 lb) were added. By late 1940, two Vickers K machine guns had been added to new hatches that were inserted into the upper sides of the fuselage just aft of the wing, with appropriate slipstream deflectors. A second gun was added to the nose turret. New constant speed propellers and deicing boots were installed as well during 1940.

The Sunderland had difficulty in landing and taking off from rough water, but, other than in the open sea, it could be handled onto and off a short chop, by a skilled pilot. Many rescues were made, early in the war, of crews that were in the Channel having abandoned or ditched their aircraft, or abandoned their ship. During May 1941, during the Battle of Crete Sunderlands transported as many as 82 armed men from place to place in one load. Steep ocean swells were never attempted, however a calm ocean could be suitable for landing and takeoff.

Beginning in October 1941, Sunderlands were fitted with ASV Mark II &quot;Air to Surface Vessel&quot; radar. This was a primitive low frequency radar system operating at a wavelength of 1.5 m, that used a row of four prominent &quot;stickleback&quot; Yagi antennas on top of the rear fuselage, two rows of four smaller aerials on either side of the fuselage beneath the stickleback antennas, and a single receiving aerial mounted under each wing outboard of the float and angled outward.

A total of 75 Sunderland Mark Is were built: 60 at Shorts&#x27; factories at Rochester and Belfast, Northern Ireland, and 15 by Blackburn Aircraft at Dumbarton.

===Sunderland Mark II===

In August 1941, production moved on to the Sunderland Mark II which used Pegasus XVIII engines with two-speed superchargers, producing 1,065 hp (794 kW) each.

The tail turret was changed to an FN.4A turret that retained the four .303 guns of its predecessor but provided twice the ammunition capacity with 1,000 rounds per gun. Late production Mark IIs also had an FN.7 dorsal turret, mounted offset to the right just behind the wings and fitted with twin .303 machine guns. The hand held guns behind the wing were removed in these versions.

Only 43 Mark IIs were built, five of these by Blackburn.

===Sunderland Mark III===

Production quickly changed in December 1941 to the Sunderland Mark III, which featured a revised hull configuration which had been tested on a Mark I the previous June. This modification improved seaworthiness, which had suffered as the weight of the Sunderland increased with new marks and field changes. In earlier Sunderlands, the hull &quot;step&quot; that allows a flying boat to &quot;unstick&quot; from the surface of the sea was an abrupt one, but in the Mk III it was a curve upwards from the forward hull line.
The Mark III turned out to be the definitive Sunderland variant, with 461 built. Most were built by Shorts at Rochester and Belfast, a further 35 at a new (but temporary) Shorts plant at White Cross Bay, Windermere; while 170 were built by Blackburn Aircraft. The Sunderland Mark III proved to be one of the RAF Coastal Command&#x27;s major weapons against the U-boats, along with the Consolidated Catalina.

As the U-boats began to use &quot;Metox&quot; passive receivers the ASV Mk II radar gave away the presence of aircraft and the number of sightings diminished drastically. The RAF response was to upgrade to the ASV Mk III, which operated in the 10 cm band, with antennas that could be faired into fewer more streamlined blisters. During the Mk III&#x27;s life there were a large number of almost continuous improvements made, including the ASV Mk IIIA and four more machine guns in a fixed position in the wall of the forward fuselage just behind the turret (developed on RAAF aircraft first) with a simple bead and ring sight for the pilot. Sunderlands with upgraded ASV Mk III equipment were designated Mk IIIA.

Despite the 14-hour-long patrols expected of their crews, early Sunderland gunners were provided with only 500 rounds of ammunition each. Later 1,000 round ammunition boxes were installed in the turrets. The beam hatch guns were removed from Mk II aircraft but Mk IIIs and then Mk Is gained much more capable .50 (12.7 mm) guns, one each side.

Offensive weapons loads increased too. The introduction of the hydrostatically fused depth charge meant that additional weapons could be carried on the floor of the bomb room in wooden restraints, along with ammunition boxes of anti-personnel bombs that could be hand launched from various hatches to harass U-boat crews otherwise manning the twin 37 and dual quadruple 20 mm cannons with which U-boats were fitted.

As radar detection became more effective there were more night patrols to catch U-boats on the surface charging their batteries. Attacking in the dark was a problem that was solved by carrying one inch (25.4 mm), electrically initiated flares and dropping them out of the rear chute of the aircraft as it got close to the surface vessel. Sunderlands were never fitted with Leigh lights.

===Sunderland Mark IV===
The Sunderland Mark IV was an outgrowth of the 1942 Air Ministry Specification R.8/42, for a generally improved Sunderland with more powerful Bristol Hercules engines, better defensive armament and other enhancements. The new Sunderland was intended for service in the Pacific. Although initially developed and two prototypes built as the &quot;Sunderland Mark IV&quot; it was different enough from the Sunderland line to be given a different name, the S.45 &quot;Seaford&quot;.

Relative to the Mark III, the Mark IV had a stronger wing, larger tailplanes and a longer fuselage with some changes in hull form for better performance in the water. The armament was heavier with .50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and 20 mm Hispano cannon. The changes were so substantial that the new aircraft was redesignated the Short Seaford. Thirty production examples were ordered; the first delivered too late to see combat and only eight production Seafords were completed and never got beyond operational trials with the RAF.

===Sunderland Mark V===

The next production version was the Sunderland Mark V, which evolved out of crew concerns over the lack of power of the Pegasus engines. The weight creep (partly due to the addition of radar) that afflicted the Sunderland had resulted in running the Pegasus engines at combat power as a normal procedure and the overburdened engines had to be replaced regularly.

Australian Sunderland crews suggested that the Pegasus engines be replaced by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp engines. The 14-cylinder engines provided 1,200 hp (895 kW) each and were already in use on RAF Consolidated Catalinas and Douglas Dakotas, and so logistics and maintenance were straightforward. Two Mark IIIs were taken off the production lines in early 1944 and fitted with the American engines. Trials were conducted in early 1944 and the conversion proved all that was expected.
The new engines with new Hamilton Standard&#x27;s Hydromatic constant-speed fully feathering propellers provided greater performance with no real penalty in range. In particular, a Twin Wasp Sunderland could stay airborne if two engines were knocked out on the same wing while, in similar circumstances, a standard Mark III would steadily lose altitude. Production was switched to the Twin Wasp version and the first Mark V reached operational units in February 1945. Defensive armament fits were similar to those of the Mark III, but the Mark V was equipped with new centimetric ASV Mark VI C radar that had been used on some of the last production Mark IIIs as well.

A total of 155 Sunderland Mark Vs were built with another 33 Mark IIIs converted to Mark V specification. With the end of the war, large contracts for the Sunderland were cancelled and the last of these flying boats was delivered in June 1946, with a total production of 777 aircraft completed.

===Transport variants===
In late 1942, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) obtained six Sunderland Mark IIIs, which had been de-militarised on the production line, for service as mail carriers to Nigeria and India, with accommodation for either 22 passengers with 2 tons of freight or 16 passengers with 3 tons of freight. Armament was removed, the gun positions being faired over, and simple seating fitted in place of the bunks. As such they were operated by BOAC and the RAF jointly from Poole to Lagos and Calcutta. Six more Sunderland IIIs were obtained in 1943. Minor modifications to the engine angles and flight angle resulted in a significant increase in the cruise speed, which was a relatively unimportant issue for the combat Sunderlands. In late 1944, the RNZAF acquired four new Sunderland Mk IIIs already configured for transport duties. In the immediate postwar period, these were used by New Zealand&#x27;s National Airways Corporation to link South Pacific Islands in the &quot;Coral Route&quot; before TEAL Short Sandringhams took over after 1947.

===Post-war civilian use===
At the war&#x27;s end BOAC obtained more Mark IIIs and gradually came up with better accommodation for its passengers, in three configurations. Bench seats were removed, and civil-standard seating installed: The H.1 configuration had 16 seats on one deck, while the H.2 had an additional promenade deck, and the H.3 had 24 seats, or sleeping berths for 16. These conversions were given the name Hythe and BOAC operated 29 of them by the end of the war. In February 1946, the first of these, &quot;G-AGJM&quot;, made a 35,313-mile route survey from Poole to Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo in 206 flying hours. It was the first British civil flying boat to visit China and Japan.

A more refined civilian conversion of the Sunderland was completed by the manufacturer as the postwar Short Sandringham. The Sandringham Mk. I used Pegasus engines while the Mk. II used Twin Wasp engines.

==Surviving aircraft==


*&quot;ML814&quot; a Mark III, converted to Mark V and then for passenger work, is on display in Kermit Weeks&#x27; Fantasy of Flight in Florida, US. It was bought in 1993, and flown across the Atlantic from the UK. According to the FoF website &quot;ML814&quot; is the &quot;last 4-engined passenger flying boat that can still fly.&quot; Formerly RNZAF NZ4108 – SH.974b MR.5 went to Airlines of New South Wales as VH-BRF &quot;Islander&quot; and was converted to a Sandringham in Australia. Airlines of New South Wales subsequently taken over by the major Australian airline Ansett and became Ansett Flying Boat Services and operated from Rose Bay, Sydney, Australia until 1974. Currently it is the last four-engined passenger flying boat to have crossed a major ocean. Although it is reported to be maintained in airworthy condition, it has not been flown since 1996 and remained on display in the museum&#x27;s main hangar for the majority of its time there, being towed to the ramp for various outdoor events in the 21st century.

In addition a few aircraft have been preserved as static museum exhibits.
*&quot;ML824&quot; is on display in Hangar 1 at the RAF Museum London at Hendon, which acquired it in 1971. The interior of the aircraft is accessible to visitors. Originally preserved at Pembroke Dock after final service with the French Navy. It made its last flight from Lanveoc Poulmic, near Brest to Pembroke on 24 Mar 1961.
*&quot;ML796&quot; is on display at Imperial War Museum Duxford in Cambridgeshire.
*&quot;NJ203&quot; RAF Short Sunderland IV/Seaford I S-45 NJ203. 1947 Converted to Short Solent 3 by Short Bros Belfast. 1949 BOAC G-AKNP &quot;City of Cardiff&quot;. 1951 Trans Oceanic Airways of Australia as VH-TOB &quot;Star of Papua&quot;. 1953 South Pacific Air Lines as N9946F &quot;Isle of Tahiti&quot;. Last flew 1958. 1958 Howard Hughes – Hughes Tool Company. Since 1990 it has been on display at the Oakland Aviation Museum, California, USA.
*&quot;NZ4111&quot; located at the Chatham Islands. Serving with No. 5 Squadron 6 RNZAF March-11 April 1959, coded KN-D; it took part in a flypast to mark the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge on 30 May 1959. On 4 November 1959, it was badly damaged in an accident in the Chatham Islands when the Sunderland hit rocks in Te Whanga Lagoon while taxiing and sank in shallow water. It was stripped of usable parts and written off RNZAF books on 9 December 1959. This was the first of the RNZAF Mk.5 Sunderlands to be written off due to damage. The fuselage was broken into major components for use on a farm; the owners are now reassembling the hull and fuselage sections.
*&quot;NZ4112&quot; – Hulk used by Hobsonville Yacht Club until 1970, then scrapped. Cockpit and front of aircraft transported to the Ferrymead Heritage Park for the Ferrymead Aeronautical Society Inc. Christchurch, New Zealand.
*&quot;NZ4115&quot; SH.1552b MR.5. Previously SZ584 and BOAC G-AHJR is on display at the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland, New Zealand. The interior and cockpit having been extensively restored and hull repairs some reskinning having taken place to airworthy standards and the exterior repainted in NZ4115&#x27;s later RNZAF maritime scheme Q for Quebec is now displayed inside the MOTAT Aviation Display Hall with Short Bros sister TEAL Short Solent ZK-AMO. Q for Quebec&#x27;s turrets, armaments and radar and radar domes are being refitted while on display.

Sunderland &quot;T9044&quot; was discovered on the seabed off Pembroke Dock in Wales in 2000. The site is protected and recovery of the aircraft is ongoing.

The wreck located by Calshot Divers at Calshot in 2010 is very likely to be that of &quot;ML883&quot; and not &quot;PP118&quot; as originally thought. This wreck site is awkward to dive due to its proximity to the Fawley Refinery, Solent shipping lane, Calshot RNLI station and public slipway.

<text>Defensive design is the practice of planning for contingencies in the design stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral. They are also recessed in the wall in a way that makes it impossible to touch connectors once they become live.

Defensive design in software engineering is called defensive programming. Murphy&#x27;s law is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design, and also of its ultimate limitations.

==Applications ==

===Computer software ===

Implementation decisions and software design approaches can make software safer and catch user errors.
Code that implements this is termed a sanity check.

* Data entry screens can &quot;sanitize&quot; inputs, e.g. numeric fields contain only digits, signs and a single decimal point if appropriate.

* Inputs can be checked for legitimate values, e.g. for counts of workplace injuries (or number of people injured) the number can be 0 but can&#x27;t be negative and must be a whole number; for number of hours worked in one week the amount for any specified employee can be 0, can be fractional, but can&#x27;t be negative and can&#x27;t be greater than 168, nor more than 24 times the number of days they were in attendance.

* A word processor requested to load a saved document should scan it to ensure it is in good form and not corrupted. If it is corrupted, the program should say so, then either accept the partial document that was valid, or refuse the entire document. In either case it should remain running and not quit.

=== Electronics ===

Many electrical connectors apply this principle by being asymmetric.
Alternatively, USB-C plugs are mechanically but not electrically symmetric, but achieve an illusion of symmetry resulting from how devices respond to the cable, and hence can be plugged in either of two ways. Accompanying circuitry makes the plugs and cables behave as though they are symmetric.

<text>Doug Swingley (born May 14, 1953) is an American dog musher and dog sled racer who lives in Lincoln, Montana, and is a four-time winner of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across Alaska. His first Iditarod was in 1992. His first victory came in 1995 and he followed it by winning in 1999, 2000, and 2001. He competed in every Iditarod from 1992 to 2002, and during his rookie outing he won the Dorothy G. Page Halfway award, for being the first musher to reach the halfway point of the race. He is the only winner from the lower 48 states and second in number of wins. Prior to his Iditarod wins, he also won the Montana Race to the Sky in 1991.

Swingley pulled out of the 2004 Iditarod because of frostbite in his corneas (eyes). Since the injury, his night vision has diminished, so he prefers to race during the day. He placed 14th in the 2005 race. He entered the 2006 race. The only five-time winner is Rick Swenson. Doug took control of the race early and led the race coming into the Takotna checkpoint 436 miles in where he elected to take his mandatory 24-hour layover. During the layover he was passed by Jeff King, but those two would challenge each other for the lead until the race reached the Bering Sea coast where Jeff King finally pulled away as Doug&#x27;s team was having difficulty negotiating occasional stretches of bare ice. Doug finished the race in second place behind King, but vowed to return in 2007 with a very strong team. Swingley was born and raised in Great Falls. In 2002, he married Melanie Shirilla under the &quot;burled arch&quot;, the traditional finish line of the Iditarod in Nome.

<doc id="457323" wikidata="Q7352429" url="?curid=457323" title="Robin Gray (Australian politician)">
<text>Robin Trevor Gray (born 1 March 1940) is a former Australian politician who was Premier of Tasmania from 1982 to 1989. A Liberal, he was elected Liberal state leader in 1981 and in 1982 defeated the Labor government of Harry Holgate on a policy of &quot;state development,&quot; particularly the building of the Franklin Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Franklin River. He was only the second non-Labor premier to hold the post in 48 years, and the first in 51 years to govern in majority.

==Early life==
Gray was born in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne. Once he had completed high school, he won a scholarship to Dookie Agricultural College and completed a Bachelor of Agricultural Science at the University of Melbourne. His qualifications led to a job as an agricultural consultant at a firm in Victoria&#x27;s Western District. In 1965, the firm sent Gray to northern Tasmania to operate a branch of the firm in Launceston.

==Political career==
During 1976, the state leader of the Liberal Party, Max Bingham, convinced Gray to stand as a candidate in the state election for that year. Gray ended up out-polling three sitting Liberal members in Wilmot. Bingham resigned as leader following his party&#x27;s poor performance at the 1979 election, which resulted in a marked swing away from the Liberals. Gray was elected Deputy Leader under Geoff Pearsall, and when Pearsall resigned in 1981 for unexplained personal reasons, Gray took over the party&#x27;s leadership.

The campaign on which Gray embarked, to build the Franklin Dam, aroused protests from environmentalists, led by Dr Bob Brown (later a Senator). Gray in 1982 allied with militant left wing FEDFA trade union leader Kelvin McCoy to form in November 1982 the &quot;Organisation for Tasmanian Development&quot; (OTD) which was directly associated with notable stickers seen on cars in Tasmania like &quot;Doze in a Greenie: help Fertilize the South-West&quot;, &quot;If It&#x27;s Brown, Flush It&quot;, and &quot;Keep Warm This Winter:Burn a Greenie&quot;. Gray and McCoy praised each other publicly in their promotion of the &quot;Gordon-below-Franklin dam&quot;. One of the more notable events of Gray&#x27;s involvement with the OTD was the 3,000-strong rally in Queenstown on 11 December 1982, which included former Premier Eric Reece. Despite Reece&#x27;s ALP background, Gray praised Reece as &quot;the greatest living Tasmanian.&quot;

In 1983, the newly elected federal Labor government led by Bob Hawke intervened to prevent the building of the dam. However it was finally a High Court of Australia decision (&quot;Commonwealth v Tasmania&quot;)—despite the persistent clamour for states&#x27; rights in which even Joh Bjelke-Petersen was utilised—which stopped the dam&#x27;s construction. Tasmania was the recipient of $276 million in grants by way of compensation.

Gray was elected to a second term in 1986. This marked the first time in 58 years that a non-Labor government had managed to win a second term in Tasmania.

In 1989, he became the centre of the debate over LGBT rights in Tasmania. Gray stated that homosexuals were not welcome in Tasmania.

But after seven years in power, Gray&#x27;s Liberals suffered a two-seat swing at the 1989 election, which left them one seat short of a majority, although they were still the largest single group in parliament. The ALP formed an accord with the Greens, whose unprecedented five seats gave them the balance of power. Gray refused to resign and asked the Governor, Sir Phillip Bennett, to call fresh elections. Bennett refused to accept his advice, believing that Gray had lost the support of the House and was no longer in a position to ask for a dissolution. When the new legislature rejected Gray&#x27;s choice for Speaker, Gray realised he stood no chance of surviving a vote of confidence on the floor of the House and resigned. ALP leader Michael Field became the new Premier.

A Royal Commission later found that Edmund Rouse, a prominent Launceston businessman and chairman of the forestry company Gunns Limited, had tried to bribe a Labor backbencher to cross the floor and keep Gray in power. Gray denied any knowledge of this but an ALP appointed Royal Commission criticised his conduct (having an unexplained $10,000 in the freezer was a problem), but found no legal case to answer. He resigned as Liberal leader on 17 December 1991. Post the Royal Commission conclusion, in 1992 Gray won one of the highest personal votes ever recorded at the next State election.

==Life after politics==

From 1996 until his retirement on 5 May 2010, Gray was a director of Gunns. His son, Ben Gray, was a co-founder of private equity firm BGH Capital.

In 2020, he published a book &quot;Proud to be Tasmanian&quot; (co-authored with his former chief of staff Andrew Tilt). In the book he attacked then party president (and subsequently Senator) Eric Abetz for moving to get rid of him as party leader.

Gray was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2024 Australia Day Honours for &quot;distinguished service to the people and Parliament of Tasmania, and to the community&quot;.

<doc id="457325" wikidata="Q979975" url="?curid=457325" title="Great American Ball Park">
<text>Great American Ball Park is a baseball stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. It is the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds, and opened on March 31, 2003, replacing Cinergy Field (formerly Riverfront Stadium), the Reds&#x27; former ballpark from 1970 to 2002. Great American Insurance bought the naming rights to the new stadium at US$75 million for 30 years.

==History==

===Planning and funding===
In 1996, Hamilton County voters passed a ½% sales tax increase to fund the construction of new venues for both the Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). According to the lease agreement, the Reds owed $2.5 million in rent annually for years 1–9 to Hamilton County, and owe $1 annually for years 10-35 of the contract. The Reds and the Bengals had previously shared occupancy of Riverfront Stadium, but by the mid-1990s, they complained that the multi-purpose stadium lacked amenities necessary for small-market professional sports teams to compete and each lobbied for venues of their own. Nearby Paycor Stadium broke ground in 1998 and was opened on August 19, 2000.

===Design and construction===

Great American Ball Park was built by the architectural firms HOK Sport (now Populous) and GBBN at a cost of approximately US$290 million. It is located on the plot of land between the former site of Riverfront Stadium (currently, The Banks mixed-use development) and Heritage Bank Center (previously, U.S. Bank Arena, previously Riverfront Coliseum). The limited construction space necessitated the partial demolition of Cinergy Field. It was fully demolished on December 29, 2002.

===2015 All-Star Game===
The ballpark hosted the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The Reds put in $5 million for improvements, which included two new bars and upgraded concession stands.

===Lowest attendance record===
The Reds set the lowest attendance record (not counting 2020) on April 17, 2023, at Great American Ballpark, due to the cold weather. The attendance number was 4,967 fans. Temperatures were near 30 degrees, which is not normal for April weather, let alone baseball weather. Fans were seen in the stands holding blankets and drinking hot coffee, which can be bought at most concession stands. The Reds defeated the Tampa Bay Rays, by a score of 8–1.

==Features==

The original address of Great American Ball Park was 100 Main Street. However, after the death of former pitcher and longtime broadcaster Joe Nuxhall in 2007, the address was changed to 100 Joe Nuxhall Way. A sign bearing Nuxhall&#x27;s traditional signoff phrase &quot;rounding third and heading for home&quot; is located on the third base side exterior of the park. The Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum is adjacent to Great American Ball Park. In honor of Crosley Field, the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; home park from 1912 to June 1970, a monument reminiscent of the park&#x27;s infamous left field terrace was built on the main entrance plaza on Joe Nuxhall Way; statues of Crosley-era stars Nuxhall, catcher Ernie Lombardi, first baseman Ted Kluszewski, and outfielder Frank Robinson are depicted playing an imaginary baseball game. The distance to center field is the exact same distance as the distance to center field at the Reds&#x27; former home, Riverfront Stadium.

=== The Gap ===
A 35-foot-(10.7-m)-wide break in the stands between home plate and third base called &quot;The Gap&quot; or &quot;Gapper&#x27;s Alley&quot; is bridged by the concourse on each level (see photo). Aligned with Sycamore Street, it provides views into the stadium from downtown and out to the skyline from within the park.

=== Power Stacks ===
In right center field, two smokestacks, reminiscent of the steamboats that were common on the Ohio River in the 19th and early 20th centuries, flash lights, emit flames and launch fireworks to incite or respond to the home team&#x27;s efforts. When the Reds strike out a batter, fire blows out of the stacks beginning with the 2012 season (previously, steam was spewed out following a strikeout). Fireworks are launched from the stacks after every Reds home run and win. The seven baseball bats featured on both smokestacks symbolize the #14 of Pete Rose. On May 15, 2015, a part of the top of the right smokestack caught on fire during the 6th inning of a Reds game, caused by a loose propane valve, causing smoke to be blown across the field, several sections of seats to be evacuated, and the Cincinnati Fire Department being called to put it out. No one was injured.

=== The Spirit of Baseball ===
A 50-foot-by-20-foot (15 x 6 m) Indiana limestone bas relief carving near the main entrance features a young baseball player looking up to the heroic figures of a batter, pitcher and fielder, all set against the background of many of Cincinnati&#x27;s landmarks, including the riverfront and Union Terminal. Local designers and artist created the piece between 2001 and 2003 with concept, design and project oversight / management by Berberich Design. The illustrative artist was Mark Riedy, the sculptors of the scale model used for fabrication were Todd Myers and Paul Brooke with fabrication by Mees Distributors.

=== Mosaics ===
Just inside the main gates off the Crosley Terrace are two mosaic panels measuring wide by high. The mosaics depict two key eras in Reds history: &quot;The First Nine&quot;, the 1869 Red Stockings who were the first professional baseball team in history with a record of 57–0 in their first season and &quot;The Great Eight&quot;, the famous Big Red Machine that won back-to-back World Series in 1975 and 1976. The mosaics were created between 2001 and 2003 with concept, design and project oversight / management by Berberich Design. The illustrative artist was Mark Riedy. These mosaic panels are made of opaque glass tiles and were produced in Ravenna, Italy by SICIS.

=== Scoreboard ===
At wide by high, the scoreboard is the ninth largest in Major League Baseball. This scoreboard was originally built by the Trans-Lux company in 2003, and featured a monochrome scoreboard in addition to a smaller color videoboard, as well as 5 banners for sponsors. After the Trans-Lux company collapsed in 2008, the Reds paid $4 million to install a new, LED scoreboard and HD video screen from Daktronics in time for the 2009 season. The scoreboard was replaced with a full-color videoboard as part of these renovations and was capable of showing HD video. The sponsor banners were moved to the sides of the scoreboard, and an additional one was added. The scoreboard clock was originally a replica of the Longines clock at Crosley Field, but has since been modified.

The scoreboard was replaced in 2020 with a larger videoboard as part of a general overhaul of the videoboards in Great American Ball Park. The sponsorship banners on the right side were replaced with additional video space. All of the videoboards throughout the facility are capable of showing high dynamic range (HDR) content, thus making it the first MLB facility with a fully integrated HDR video system.

=== Home Run Deck ===
If a Reds player hits the &quot;Hit Me&quot; sign located between the Power Stacks located in right field, a randomly selected fan will win the red Toyota Tundra pickup truck located on top of an elevator shaft approximately from home plate beyond the center field fence, which is valued at approximately US$31,000.

=== Crosley Terrace ===
As a nod to Crosley Field, the Reds&#x27; home from 1912 to 1970, a monument was created in front of the main entrance to highlight the park&#x27;s famous left-field terrace. Bronze statues of Crosley-era stars Joe Nuxhall, Ernie Lombardi, Ted Kluszewski, and Frank Robinson (created by sculptor Tom Tsuchiya) are depicted playing in an imaginary ballgame. The grass area of the terrace has the same slope as the outfield terrace at Crosley Field.

=== 4192 mural ===
A three-piece mural on the back of the scoreboard in left field depicts the bat Pete Rose used for his record-breaking 4,192nd hit and the ball he hit in . This was replaced with new banners in 2015 as part of the All-Star Game upgrades.

=== Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum ===
Located on the west side of Great American Ball Park on Main Street, the Hall of Fame and Museum celebrate the Reds&#x27; past through galleries and extensive use of multimedia. The Hall of Fame has been in existence since 1958, but did not previously have a building.

=== Rose Garden ===
Adjacent to both the stadium and the Reds Hall of Fame is a rose garden that symbolizes Pete Rose&#x27;s record-breaking 4,192nd hit. It was strategically placed here because the ball landed around this area in Riverfront Stadium. The garden is visible from a stairwell in the hall of fame displaying the number of balls that Rose hit. This was replaced with a different marker as part of the construction of the 1869 Pavilion in 2019.

== Fan amenities ==

=== Nursing suites ===
For the 2015 season, Great American Ball Park became the first MLB ballpark to feature a suite designed exclusively as a place for mothers to feed and care for their babies. Reds COO Phil Castellini, a father of 5, says he felt compelled to do his best to provide a worthwhile solution after stadium officials told him an increasing number of women were asking where they could nurse their children at the ballpark. The suite has 5 glider chairs, diaper-changing stations, a restroom, a kitchenette, refrigerator, lockers, and televisions showing the game. It&#x27;s located on the Suite Level near the Champions Club elevators. A second nursing suite was added as part of the addition of the TriHealth Family Zone on the former site of Redlegs Landing.

=== Sportsbook ===
For the 2023 season, the Reds partnered with BetMGM Sportsbook to introduce on-site sports betting. The BetMGM Sportsbook at Great American Ball Park is located in the Machine Room, and features three betting windows and 15 self-service kiosks, in addition to a full-service bar and food options.

<text>The Franklin River is a major perennial river located in the Central Highlands and western regions of Tasmania, Australia. The river is located in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park at the mid northern area of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Its source is situated at the western edge of the Central Highlands and it flows west towards the West Coast.

The river is named in honour of Sir John Franklin, a Governor of Tasmania, who later died searching for the Northwest Passage.
==Location and features==
The river rises below Mount Hugel west of Derwent Bridge on the western slopes of the Central Highlands and flows generally west and south through remote and rugged mountainous country until meeting its confluence with the Gordon River. From source to mouth the river is joined by sixteen tributaries including the Surprise, Collingwood, Lucan, Loddon, Andrew and the Jane rivers. In its upper reaches, the Franklin is impounded by two reservoirs, Lake Undine and Lake Dixon. The river is crossed by the Lyell Highway, also in its upper reaches. There are some archaeological sites that have identified pre-European activity. The upper reaches of the Franklin River were traversed by explorers in the nineteenth century, in their attempts to access Frenchmans Cap.

In the early twentieth century, access to the river was mostly pine logging in the lower reaches.

In the middle of the century, adventurous canoers sought to conquer the river&#x27;s formidable challenges. The book &quot;Shooting The Franklin : Early canoeing on Tasmania&#x27;s wild rivers&quot; identifies three trips in the 1950s.

=== Named places on the Franklin ===

In the case of earlier travellers, few locations of the river were named at all. During his initial journeys down the river, Bob Brown submitted names for some features. Before and since, rafters and canoers have added names for many of the bends and rapids on the river:

== Franklin River conservation battle ==

In the 1980s, the Franklin River become synonymous with Australia&#x27;s largest conservation movement of the time, the movement battled to block Hydro Tasmania&#x27;s proposed hydro-electric power plan, from building on the Franklin.

The focus on the dam and the issues of wilderness experience led to the development of people utilising the river at levels never previously experienced. The result of a drowning on the river led to stricter guidelines for users of the river. Richard Flanagan&#x27;s &quot;Death of a River Guide&quot; is a fictional account of a drowning, by a writer with an academic and historical understanding of the area.

<doc id="457327" wikidata="Q3569827" url="?curid=457327" title="Wooden Ships and Iron Men">
<text>Wooden Ships and Iron Men is a naval board wargame simulating naval combat during the Age of Sail that was published by Battleline Publications in 1974, then revised and republished by Avalon Hill the following year.

==Name==
The name should come from the phrase attributed to Austrian admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff about the battle of Lissa «Wooden ships commanded by men with iron heads defeated iron ships commanded by men with wooden heads», with which he wanted to ascribe the defeat&#x27;s responsibility to the inept Italian commands, in particular to Carlo Pellion di Persano.

==Description==
&quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; is a two-player game that simulates naval combat in the 18th and 19th centuries between individual ships as well as with larger fleet actions. The 1975 Avalon Hill edition of the game has 23 scenarios, including the Battles of The Saintes, the Nile, and Trafalgar, as well as smaller and lesser known actions. (Avalon Hill published a further nine scenarios in various issues of &quot;The General&quot;).

===Components===
The Avalon Hill 1975 edition of the game comes with:
* 22&quot; x 28&quot; mounted hex grid map board (representing ocean) in two single-fold pieces. (In the 1981 2nd edition, this became a single piece four-fold board.)
* rule book
* 100 die-cut counters
* log sheets for plotting movement, forming boarding parties and tracking damage
* reference sheet
* six-sided die

===Gameplay===
The rules are divided into a Basic game and an Advanced game. There are also optional rules that can be added in whole or in part to the Advanced game. In addition to movement and combat, the rules cover towing damaged vessels, fields of fire restricted by fallen masts, running aground, determinlng depth of waters by means of a lead line, and exploding or sinking ships.

===Combat===
Damage can be inflicted on a ship either by the use of cannon fire, or by sending a boarding party to capture the ship.

===Victory conditions===
All scenarios use an identical method of calculating victory points by comparing the strengths of captured and destroyed vessels.

==Publication history==
In 1974, Battleline Publications released the first edition of &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; with what would become the Basic rules. The following year, Avalon Hill acquired the rights to the game and S. Craig Taylor revised the game, adding Advanced as well as optional rules. Game development was by Mick Uhl, and the revised game was published in 1975. Avalon Hill released a second edition with updated rules in 1981.

In 1987, Avalon Hill published an identically titled video game for the Commodore 64 that was based on the board game. 

Nine years later, Avalon Hill released a second &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; video game, this one for PC computers.

==Reception==
In a 1976 poll conducted by wargame publisher Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) to find the most popular wargame in the United States, &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; was Avalon Hill&#x27;s most popular game, placing 7th out of 202 games. In a similar 1976 poll conducted by Avalon Hill, but only of their own games, &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot; placed first out of 25 games. 

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer called the game &quot;Playable and yet highly realistic; it simulates numerous naval battles at a detailed tactical level, with different types of sail, various forms of ammunition, and an immense range of different ships.&quot; Palmer noted that &quot;wind plays a crucial role, and the reasons for the historical formations become apparent.&quot; He did note that many scenarios were unbalanced &quot;but experienced players design their own groups from a point system.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Complex but accurate.&quot;

In Issue 29 of &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Doug Davies admired the rules that emphasized the importance of wind direction. However, he noted that while differences in combat ability between various ships were reflected in the rules, no such difference in the navigation abilities of the crews were differentiated. He also noted that visibility in every scenario except one night action is assumed to be unlimited, which he thought &quot;could be deemed to be unrealistic&quot;, given the amount of gunpowder smoke that drifted between the ships. He also felt that some unrealistic maneuvers could be made by canny players taking advantage of the map&#x27;s hex grid. Davies also felt that too many of the scenarios involved actions that were historically unbalanced, and questioned why more closely balanced actions from history were not chosen, such as several historical and hard-fought naval battles during the American War of Independence. Despite these quibbles, Davies was quite taken with this game, and concluded &quot;the best method of trying to appreciate the subtleties of the &#x27;Nelson touch&#x27; is by playing the excellent &quot;Wooden Ships and Iron Men&quot;.&quot;

In Issue 19 of &quot;Wargamer&quot;, Andy Bagley called this game &quot;arguably the most popular tactical naval game, a game whose simple mechanics belie the complexity and subtlety of skills needed by the would-be Admiral.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, Jon Freeman wrote, &quot;two turns of this game speak volumes about the significance of wind direction for sailing ships-of-the-line [...] Purely for the feel of &quot;being there&quot;, this game is unsurpassed.&quot;

In Issue 4 of &quot;Command&quot;, Dennis Agosta called the game &quot;easy to learn, easy to play, well-balanced and extremely exciting to play.&quot; His only complaint was that the game box did not include a tray to hold counters.

In &quot;The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training&quot;, Martin Campion compared this game to its rival, &quot;&quot; (SPI, 1974), in terms of use in the classroom and noted, &quot;They deal with the same subject, but &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; does it in much more detail. [&quot;Frigate&quot;] is best used for fleet actions with two to four players. [&quot;Wooden Ships&quot;] is best used in single ship actions with two players or fleet actions with a lot of players to do the bookwork.&quot;

==Reviews==

<text>The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, abbreviated to TWWHA, is a World Heritage Site in Tasmania, Australia. It is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering , or almost 25 per cent of Tasmania. It is also one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, and includes the South West Wilderness.

The main industry of the TWWHA is tourism, yet the region has a lack of development partially due to the juxtaposition of development with the idea of pristine nature. There is no permanent habitation in the area save for small parts on the periphery. The region is known for activities such as bushwalking, whitewater rafting, and climbing.

The Tasmanian Wilderness qualifies for 7 out of the 10 classification criteria evaluated for World Heritage. Along with Mount Tai in China, it is the highest measurement attained for World Heritage Site status on Earth.

The TWWHA was first placed on the World Heritage List in 1982 under joint arrangements between the federal government of Australia and the Tasmanian government during the Franklin Dam controversy, and expanded in 1989 following the Helsham Inquiry, a decision to protect a eucalypt forest from logging. Due to the subpar planning and management of the area during the 1990s, a management plan was drawn up and promulgated in 1992, further replaced by a new management plan in 1999. In 2014, the Abbott government proposed de-listing the Tasmanian Wilderness as a World Heritage Site so as to allow the logging of trees within the protected area. This was rejected by the World Heritage Committee the same year. In 2016, the Tasmanian government withdrew the bid to allow logging in the Tasmanian Wilderness after a UNESCO report opposed the idea.

== Background ==
Tasmania is one of the states of Australia. It is an island in the Southern Ocean, immediately south of mainland Australia. It has a temperate maritime climate, substantially different from most of mainland Australia. Australia has 20 World Heritage Sites, the first of which was listed in 1981. The best known are Kakadu, Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) and the Great Barrier Reef. The Tasmanian Wilderness is probably the best known of the rest.

Tasmania is approximately north to south and east to west, and about south of mainland Australia. Around 30 per cent of the state&#x27;s land is reserved under some category of conservation land tenure. The Tasmanian Wilderness covers approximately 20 per cent of the state. It comprises Tasmania&#x27;s four largest national parks and several smaller areas of various other conservation land tenures. 3.4 million hectares out of the 6.8 million hectares of Tasmanian land is covered by forest, 70 per cent of which is in public land, 40 per cent in commercial forests, and 30 per cent on protected public land. Tasmania has a population just under 500,000. It has the weakest economy of all the Australian states, and tourism is seen as one of the few economic growth areas. Tasmania&#x27;s tourism marketing promotes ecotourism based on the state&#x27;s natural values; particularly those of the Tasmanian Wilderness. This puts considerable environmental pressure on the Tasmanian Wilderness even though most tourist accommodation is outside the boundaries and most tourism occurs at a few well-developed sites near the periphery of the area.

== Geography ==
The Tasmanian Wilderness is an extensive, wet, temperate, wilderness area covering much of southern and western Tasmania. It is approximately north to south and averages east to west, or before expansions in 2013. The area of the region became 15,800 kilometres2, or almost 25% of Tasmania after extensions in 1989 and 2013. Although the highest point is only 1,600 metres (5,000 feet) above sea level and there is no year-round snow cover, much of the area is very rugged and contains the only extensive, recently glaciated areas in Australia. The last glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. It constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, and includes the South West Wilderness.

==Development and tourism==
The Tasmanian Wilderness contains no permanent human habitation, apart from a small amount of accommodation near the periphery. Few roads penetrate the area. There is also a trout fishery (introduced northern hemisphere species) in the Central Plateau lakes. Unlike most of the rest of the Tasmanian Wilderness, the Central Plateau section has a long history of use by local people. As well as fishing, some hunting, horse riding, four-wheel-driving and associated hut use continues. These established practices are seen by some groups to be at odds with achieving conservation outcomes. This has led to the removal of roads, huts, and any other human traces in favor of the idea of a pristine wilderness.

Tourism and recreation is the predominant industry in the area. There are about half a million visitors to the TWWHA annually. Activities within the TWWHA include cruises, commercial flights and landings, bushwalking (it has been described as the Mecca of bushwalkers in Australia), whitewater rafting, and climbing. More remote regions of the TWWHA have no ports, and thus expedition ships are used for land-based activities. However, due to management guidelines in the TWWHA, the region remains rarely visited by these ships, though there are also smaller commercial ships in the area.

==Biology==
===Flora===
The TWWHA is located in the Australasian realm. One of the supporting factors for its listing as a World Heritage Site is its biodiversity and natural qualities. There are six ecosystem groups in the TWWHA - rainforest, sclerophyll communities, alpine treeless vegetation, subalpine treeless vegetation, and wetland communities. The TWWHA includes many species of ancient origin, primitive taxa, and a high degree of plant diversity, with unusual features such as shrubs evolving in a maritime climate in alpine and subalpine treeless ecosystems. The TWWHA also contains the longest continuous pollen record in Australia at the Darwin Crater.

===Fauna===
The TWWHA includes 1,397 species from 293 families. There are 30 species of terrestrial mammals, 120 species of terrestrial birds, 14 species of terrestrial reptiles, seven species of frogs, 16 species of freshwater fish, and 68 species of marine fish. Much of the fauna found within the TWWHA is unique to the area, such as the Moss Froglet and the Pedra Branca Skink. In terms of invertebrates, the TWWHA includes 904 species of Uniramia, 179 species of Chelicerata, 90 species of Aschelminthes, 88 species of Crustacea, 69 species of Mollusca, 57 species of Annelida, eight species of Platyhelminthes, and one species each for Onychophora and Nemertea.

== History ==

=== Pre 20th century ===

The Tasmanian Wilderness, a network of parks and reserves with steep gorges, underwent severe glaciation. Human remains dating back more than 20,000 years have been found in limestone caves in the area. The area was used for millennia by Aboriginal Tasmanians, who have left their signature on the area in the form of an ecology strongly influenced by their burning practices, as well as physical remains including middens and artwork. The Aboriginal presence in the area dates back to the Pleistocene, 35,000 years ago. Middens from the Holocene have been found in the area. Aboriginal people no longer live permanently in the area, but some places are of great significance to the present-day Aboriginal Tasmanian community, which influenced the region&#x27;s listing as a World Heritage Site. Historically, the area was extensively explored and prospected during the 19th century, with a history of convicts in the area, but the only economic activity in the area has been small-scale mining and logging, a limited amount of trapping (for furs) and, in a limited area, grazing, which continued until very recently. The area also contains one large and several smaller hydroelectric schemes. Apart from the hydroelectric impoundments, none of these activities have left much lasting trace.

=== World heritage status ===
==== 1980s ====
The area was placed on the World Heritage List in two stages, in 1982 and 1989. The 1982 listing came in the midst of a political furore over the proposed construction of a major hydroelectric dam within the area. Construction of the dam did not proceed as a result of federal government intervention using authority obtained as a result of the World Heritage listing. The factors influencing its listing include the Aboriginal heritage of the site, geomorphic values, and biodiversity.

The area was expanded in 1989 as a result of the Helsham Inquiry, a decision to protect a major area of tall eucalypt forest from logging. This began a conflict regarding further inclusion of areas - the majority opinion stated that only five areas deserved to be listed, while the differing view was that there were additional areas to those five, ending up in an additional 600,000 hectares. The latter of these views later prevailed, ending in the expansion of the area greatly. In the same year, the region was given a statutory management plan. Again, the area&#x27;s World Heritage status gave the federal government the right to be involved, and reinforced the perception in some sections of the Tasmanian community that World Heritage listing was a ploy to give the federal government the right to intervene in land management issues which would otherwise be a matter for the state government alone.

During the 1980s, the funding of the management of the area was greatly increased from around 1 million Australian dollars in the early 1980s to 3 million by the middle of the decade. In the mid-1990s, funding reached 9 million dollars, while the budget reached 11 million in 2008. This increase in funding importantly allowed for the employment of more staff.

There was also serious distrust of the Parks and Wildlife Service in some quarters, mostly dating back to when the Central Plateau was added to the Tasmanian Wilderness in 1989. Many established practitioners had been led to believe that all activities that had previously been permitted within the area would be allowed to continue after World Heritage listing. Soon after listing, some of their more environmentally unacceptable activities were restricted or banned to reflect the new status of the area (for example, several four-wheel-drive tracks into sensitive areas were closed). This resulted in a polarisation of strongly held views in the Tasmanian community on the future management of the area and, in some quarters, considerable antagonism towards the Parks and Wildlife Service. Many people in the local communities were affected by the little consideration they got from &quot;Wilderness ideology&quot;, leading to their acting against good management practices due to their mistrust of the Parks and Wildlife Service.

==== 1990s ====
In 1990, planning for the area was still poorly coordinated. Only one of the four major national parks had a finalised management plan and, although plans were in varying stages of completion for several other parts of the Tasmanian Wilderness, the decision was made to prepare a single management plan for the entire area. Several stages of public comment, accompanied at times by considerable controversy in the local media, led to a very &quot;pro-wilderness&quot; draft management plan. A series of last-minute alterations to the plan, following a change of state government and after the closure of public comment, diluted the &quot;pro-wilderness&quot; nature of the plan and thereby antagonised the conservation lobby, but defused many of the strongly felt objections of established users, some of whom had threatened civil disobedience in relation to some plan prescriptions. However, some of these stakeholders, particularly local communities adjacent to the area, felt that their input to the planning process had been ignored and remained fundamentally dissatisfied with aspects of the plan, which was finalised in September 1992. Some aspects of the 1992 plan met with poor acceptance from &quot;established practitioners&quot; from the start, and some other problems (such as the absence of a mechanism to assess new development proposals) became apparent as the plan was implemented. Nevertheless, it guided management of the area for the next seven years, two years longer than its intended life.

The 1992 plan helped develop a framework by which to gauge the effectiveness of management plans. Under Dr. Helen Hocking, the achievement of the plan&#x27;s objectives was evaluated. The plan was criticised as treating &quot;wilderness&quot; as the most important value of the region and disregarding all other values The Parks and Wildlife Service was determined to overcome a number of the ongoing issues identified from the 1992 plan so, in 1994, the decision was made to review the plan with the aim of having the new plan in place by September 1997. This deadline was not met for a variety of reasons, including state and federal elections that delayed key approval processes. The new plan took effect in March 1999. The most controversial management issues dealt with in the development of the new plan were those related to tourism, established practices and fire management; the key nature conservation question being whether land managers should actively use fire to maintain the diversity of the ecosystem. The plan also added into consideration Aboriginal cultural heritage and tourism.

====21st century====
In September 2004, the first &quot;State of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Report&quot; was released, which focused on ecological protection.

Despite advising the UN World Heritage Committee (WHC) in 2010 that it had no intention to extend the property any further, the federal government submitted a proposal for a minor boundary modification to the property in January 2013 which was accepted at the 37th session of the WHC in June 2013.

In 2014, the Abbott government proposed de-listing the Tasmanian Wilderness as a World Heritage Site so as to allow the logging of trees within the protected area. If successful, the proposal would have marked the first time a developed nation had de-listed a site for economic purposes. The proposal was rejected by the 38th Session of the World Heritage Committee in June 2014, which met in Doha, Qatar. The Abbott government stated after that it intended to respect the decision of the committee.

In 2016, the Tasmanian government withdrew the bid to allow logging in the Tasmanian Wilderness after a UNESCO report opposed the idea, despite UNESCO World Heritage procedures allowing for such an activity.

==Management==
In Australia, land management is the responsibility of the states. However, the World Heritage Convention is an international agreement, signed by the federal government. This gives the federal government a role in the management of Australia&#x27;s World Heritage Areas. The area&#x27;s World Heritage status also results in Tasmania receiving considerable federal funding for management of the area.

The TWWHA is managed jointly by the federal government and the state of Tasmania through the Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife Service. The arrangements developed between Tasmania and the federal government include organizations such as the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Ministerial Council, a Steanding Committee, and the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Consultative Committee, of which half of its members are appointed by the Tasmanian state government while the other half is appointed by the federal government.

<text>Desteldonk () is a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent located in the province of East Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1965. In 1927, part of the original municipality was already annexed to Ghent. On 1 January 1965, the municipality of Desteldonk was merged into Ghent.

The first historical record of Desteldonk dates back to 966 when it was listed as Thesledung. In 1236, it was named as a parish.

<text>The 6th Airborne Division was an airborne infantry division of the British Army during the Second World War. Despite its name, the 6th was actually the second of two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, the other being the 1st Airborne Division. The 6th Airborne Division was formed in the Second World War, in mid-1943, and was commanded by Major-General Richard N. Gale. The division consisted of the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades along with the 6th Airlanding Brigade and supporting units.

The division&#x27;s initial operation, which also resulted in it becoming the first Allied unit to land its troops in France as part of Operation Overlord, was Operation Tonga on 6 June 1944, D-Day, part of the Normandy landings, where it was responsible for securing the left flank of the Allied invasion. Having successfully carried out this task the division remained in Normandy for three months before being withdrawn in September. The division was entrained day after day later that month, over nearly a week, preparing to join Operation Market Garden but was eventually stood down. While still recruiting and reforming in England, it was mobilised again and sent to Belgium in December 1944, to help counter the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge. Their final airborne mission followed in March 1945, Operation Varsity, the second Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine.

After the war the division was identified as the Imperial Strategic Reserve, and moved to the Middle East. Initially sent to Palestine for parachute training, the division became involved in an internal security role. In Palestine, the division went through several changes in formation, and had been reduced in size to only two parachute brigades by the time it was disbanded in 1948.

==Creation==
On 31 May 1941, a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created. Then on 23 April 1943 the War Office authorised the formation of a second British airborne division.

This second formation was numbered the 6th Airborne Division, and commanded by Major-General Richard Nelson &quot;Windy&quot; Gale, who had previously raised the 1st Parachute Brigade. Under his command would be the existing 3rd Parachute Brigade, along with two battalions (2nd Ox and Bucks and 1st Ulster Rifles) transferred from the 1st Airborne Division, to form the nucleus of the new 6th Airlanding Brigade. The airlanding brigade was an important part of the airborne division, its strength being almost equal to that of the two parachute brigades combined, and the glider infantry battalions were the heaviest armed infantry units in the British Army. At the same time, several officers, combat veterans from the 1st Airborne Division, were posted to the division as brigade and battalion commanders. Between May and September, the remainder of the divisional units were formed, including the 5th Parachute Brigade, the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, the 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery and the division&#x27;s Pathfinders the 21st Independent Parachute Company. Headquarters were at Syrencot House, Figheldean, Wiltshire.

From June to December 1943, the division prepared for operations, training at every level from section up to division by day and night. Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy, who would be equipped with artillery and tanks. Training was therefore designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness, with emphasis given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft. A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the troops would march back to their barracks, usually a distance of around . An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected; airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in 24 hours, and battalions .

At the end of the war in Europe, in May 1945, the division was selected to go to India and form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India, when the Japanese surrendered after the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following the surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength and was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.

When the division was dispatched to the Middle East, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned to bring them up to strength. In May 1946, after the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded, the 1st Parachute Brigade joined the division, replacing the 6th Airlanding Brigade. The next major manpower development came in 1947, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade was disbanded and the 2nd Parachute Brigade, while remaining part of the division, was withdrawn to England, then sent to Germany. On 18 February 1947, it was announced that the 6th Airborne Division would be disbanded when they left Palestine. Gradually the division&#x27;s units left the country and were disbanded, the last ones comprising part of divisional headquarters, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Airborne Squadron, Royal Engineers, departed on 18 May 1948.

==Operational history==
On 23 December 1943, the division was told to be prepared for active service from 1 February 1944. Training intensified and in April 1944, under the command of I Airborne Corps, the division took part in Exercise Mush. Held in the counties of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire, this was an airborne military exercise spread over three days involving both the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions. Unknown to the 6th Airborne, the exercise was a full-scale rehearsal for the division&#x27;s involvement in the imminent Normandy invasion. During which, the division&#x27;s two parachute brigades would land just after midnight on 6 June, while the airlanding brigade arrived later in the day at 21:00. The division&#x27;s objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area, by dominating the high ground, in the area between the rivers Orne and Dives. This included the capture of two bridges crossing the Orne river and canal; destroying the Merville Gun Battery, which was in a position to engage troops landing at the nearby Sword Beach; and destroying bridges crossing the Dives, to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landing beaches from the north.

===D-Day===


The invasion of Normandy started just after midnight 6 June 1944. The first units of the division to land were the pathfinders and six platoons from &#x27;D&#x27; Company of the 2nd Battalion, Ox and Bucks Light Infantry, from Brigadier Hugh Kindersley&#x27;s 6th Airlanding Brigade. While the pathfinders marked the division drop zones, &#x27;D&#x27; Company carried out a coup de main glider assault on the two bridges crossing the River Orne and the Caen Canal. Within minutes of landing, both bridges had been captured and the company dug in to defend them until relieved. The company commander, Major John Howard, signalled their success by transmitting the codewords &quot;Ham and Jam&quot;.

Shortly afterwards the aircraft carrying Brigadier Nigel Poett&#x27;s 5th Parachute Brigade arrived overhead heading for their drop zone (DZ) to the north of Ranville. The brigade were to reinforce the defenders at the bridges, the 7th Parachute Battalion in the west, while the 12th Parachute Battalion and the 13th Parachute Battalion dug in to the east, centred around Ranville, where brigade HQ would be located.

Brigadier James Hill&#x27;s 3rd Parachute Brigade had two DZs, one in the north for the 9th Parachute Battalion who were tasked to destroy the Merville Gun Battery and the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion who would destroy bridges over the River Dives. The 8th Parachute Battalion would land at the other DZ, and destroy bridges over the Dives in the south.

===Normandy===

===Breakout===


With the capture of Breville the division was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20 June. Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20 July; the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into the line between the 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. Then on 7 August the 6th Airborne Division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne came under command of British I Corps, part of the First Canadian Army, and when issuing his orders Lieutenant-General John T. Crocker, aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect them to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine the division would have to cross three major rivers, and there were only two main lines of advance; one road running along the coast and another further inland from Troarn to Pont-Audemer. The division returned to England in early September, having suffered over 4,500 casualties since D-Day.
===Ardennes===

In England the division went into a period of recruitment and training, concentrating on house to house street fighting in the bombed areas of Southampton and Birmingham. The training programme culminated in Exercise Eve, an assault on the River Thames, which was intended to simulate the River Rhine in Germany. By December the division, now commanded by Major-General Eric L. Bols, was preparing for Christmas leave, when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke. With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved, the Battle of the Bulge became the largest single battle on the Western Front during the Second World War. As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, the 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the Allied strategic reserve. The division was shipped to the Continent by sea, through Calais and Ostend. Together with the other two reserve formations, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, already at Rheims in northern France, they were sent to Belgium. On Christmas Day the 6th Airborne moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade on the left, the 5th Parachute Brigade on the right, and the 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve. Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back until, at the end of January 1945, the brigade crossed into the Netherlands. Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas between Venlo and Roermond. The division carried out patrols on both sides of the river against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division. Near the end of February, the 6th Airborne Division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission; to cross the River Rhine.

===Rhine crossing===
Whereas all other Allied airborne landings had been a surprise for the Germans, the Rhine crossing was expected, and their defences were reinforced in anticipation. The airborne operation was preceded by a two-day round-the-clock bombing mission by the Allied air forces. Then on 23 March 3,500 artillery guns targeted the German positions. At dusk Operation Plunder, an assault river crossing of the Rhine by the 21st Army Group, began. For their part in Operation Varsity, the 6th Airborne Division was assigned to Major General Matthew Ridgway&#x27;s U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, serving alongside Major General William Miley&#x27;s U.S. 17th Airborne Division.
===Far East===
The 5th Parachute Brigade was sent to the Far East arriving after VJ Day, they were sent to protect and secure Dutch East Indies interest and property, as well as dealing with internal security in Java and Singapore, whilst disarming members of the Japanese Army till 1946. By this time they were sent back to Palestine to take part in peacekeeping with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division. 
===Palestine===

In late 1945, the 6th Airborne Division deployed to Palestine as the Jewish insurgency against British rule there intensified. Its duties included enforcement of curfews and searches of cities, towns, and rural settlements for arms and guerrillas. In late 1947, as the British withdrawal from Palestine began, it was involved in the 1947-48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine between the Jewish and Arab communities, and engaged both Jewish and Arab forces. The division&#x27;s units gradually departed the country, with the last of the division&#x27;s troops leaving Haifa on 18 May, only a few days after Israeli independence. Between October 1945 and April 1948, the division&#x27;s losses to enemy action were 58 killed and 236 wounded. Another 99 soldiers died from causes other than enemy action. During searches of Jewish and Arab areas for arms, the division&#x27;s soldiers had uncovered 99 mortars, 34 machine guns, 174 sub machine guns, 375 rifles, 391 pistols, 97 land mines, 2,582 hand grenades and 302,530 rounds of ammunition.

<text>The Trebbia (stressed &quot;Trèbbia&quot;; ) is a river predominantly of Liguria and Emilia Romagna in northern Italy. It is one of the four main right-bank tributaries of the river Po, the other three being the Tanaro, the Secchia and the Panaro.

Along its eastern banks in 218 BC was fought one of the battles of the Second Punic War: the Battle of Trebbia, where Hannibal defeated a Roman consular army.

The drainage basin is divided among Emilia Romagna, , Liguria, , and Lombardy, . Its principal tributaries are the torrents Aveto and Perino (from the right) and the torrent Boreca (from the left).

==Geography==
The source of the river, the Trebbia river spring, is in the Ligurian Apennines on the south slopes of Monte Prelà, to the south of Monte Antola in the &quot;comune&quot; of Torriglia, Province of Genoa. Monte Prelà, high, is part of the Antola massif.

The spring is not on the peak but is at roughly . Across a small ridge to the west, on which sits Torriglia, and slightly further downslope is the source of the Scrivia river. Over a ridge to the northeast is the Brugneto reservoir, water supply for Genoa. The reservoir was created in 1959 by damming Brugneto stream, which formerly joined its waters to the Trebbia, but now only does so when the reservoir is full. A ridge running north from Prelà connects to Monte Druso, then to Monte Cremado, and finally to Monte Antola at . From its peak on a clear day can be seen Genoa, Corsica, the Tuscan Archipelago and the Alps.

From its source the river flows towards north-east for until it reaches the Po just to the west of Piacenza. The Alta Val Trebbia (&quot;High Trebbia Valley&quot;) includes the valley down to Bobbio. It straddles eight &quot;comuni&quot; of the Province of Genoa: Torriglia, Rondanina, Propata, Fascia, Montebruno, Rovegno, Fontanigorda and Gorreto. Each of these contains numerous hamlets, some on the river, most on the slopes. Gorreto is on the Ligurian side of the border with Piacenza province.
Past Gorreto the Trebbia flows under a few mountain villages arriving at the next town, Ottone. Below Ottone Val Boreca enters from the left opposite the frazione of Losso. The Boreca is a mountain brook falling from the heights of the &quot;four provinces&quot; region generally too small to be shown on maps but visible in satellite photographs. Just below Zerba (from which it is accessed) its waters are impounded by a dam diverting them through the turbines of a hydroelectric power station.

The border with the Province of Pavia in southernmost Lombardy follows the Trebbia for about where it bends around Ponte Organasco, so that some of the river and bottom lands are in Lombardy. Further downstream the valley opens to accommodate Corte Brugnatella and then closes to form steep sides again. Receiving the Torrente Carlone from the left it enters Bobbio on the left bank. Here the high valley ends and the valley becomes the Val Trebbia.

The river goes on under a good many small communities located up on the flanks of the hills before reaching the next good-sized town on it, Travo, and then Rivergaro. Here the val ends. It widens and merges with the Pianura Padana, &quot;plain of the Po&quot;, beyond Rivergaro and a few miles later encounters the suburban communities on the west side of Piacenza before entering the Po. Geologically the course of the lower Trebbia and that of the Po is unstable except where stabilized by man.

Nearly the whole course of the river is paralleled by the &quot;Strada statale della Val Trebbia&quot;, highway SS45, running between Piacenza and Genoa. It encounters the river at Rivergaro and winds with it through the mountains, breaking away just below the source to bend southwest over the ridges to Genoa.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
The following trees are predominant in the forests of Val Trebbia: &quot;Fagus silvatica&quot; at to ; over 1500 m: &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;, &quot;Sorbus aria&quot;, &quot;Laburnum anagyroides&quot;, &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;, &quot;Abies alba&quot;, &quot;Larix decidua&quot;, &quot;Alnus incana&quot;, &quot;Populus tremula&quot;; below : &quot;Quercus cerris&quot;, &quot;Quercus sessiflora&quot;, &quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;, &quot;Ostrya carpinifolia&quot;, &quot;Carpinus betulus&quot;, &quot;Fraxinus ornus&quot;, &quot;Acer campestre&quot;, &quot;Ulmus campestris&quot;, &quot;Populus alba&quot;, &quot;Populus canescens&quot;, &quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;, &quot;Prunus avium&quot;, &quot;Pirus communis&quot;, &quot;Malus communis&quot;, &quot;Corylus avellana&quot;; below : &quot;Castanea sativa&quot;.

The shrubbery includes the following species: &quot;Juniperus communis&quot;, &quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;, &quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;, &quot;Polygala chamaebuxus&quot;, &quot;Daphne mezereum&quot;, &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;, &quot;Cornus mas&quot;, &quot;Euonymus europaea&quot;, &quot;Cytisus sessilifolius&quot;, &quot;Erica arborea&quot;, &quot;Ruscus aculeatus&quot;, &quot;Clematis vitalba&quot;, &quot;Lonicera caprifolium&quot;, &quot;Crataegus oxyacantha&quot;, &quot;Rosa canina&quot;, &quot;Spartium junceum&quot;.

The ferns are &quot;Polypodium volgare&quot;, &quot;Asplenium ruta-muraria&quot;, &quot;Dryopteris filix-mas&quot;, &quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;, &quot;Notholaena marantae&quot;.

===Fauna===
The Val Trebbia is within the endemic range of Moltoni&#x27;s warbler, a subspecies of &quot;Sylvia cantillans&quot; better known in the western Mediterranean islands. The birds forage for insects in mixed shrubland of varying heights and both broad-leaved and coniferous composition.

The other birds include &quot;Buteo buteo&quot;, &quot;Falco tinnunculus&quot;, &quot;Accipiter nisus&quot;, &quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;, &quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;, &quot;Charadrius dubius&quot;, &quot;Motacilla alba&quot;, &quot;Motacilla flava&quot;, &quot;Alcedo atthis&quot;, &quot;Alectoris rufa&quot; and &quot;Picus viridis&quot;.

==Geologic history==
The northern Apennines are a belt of northeast-southwest mountains on the coast of northwest Italy folded by transverse thrusting from sedimentary rock. The streams draining it run primarily in a northeastern direction perpendicular to the line of the folds and project into the Po river an average of from the source. The eroded landscape of the north Apennines covers about .

For much of their lengths, these heavily braided streams run through montane terrain that is minimally developed, is known for its wildlife, and remains in a pristine state. The sediment eroded from the mountains is deposited in alluvial fans and terraces in the Po valley, which is heavily populated and in ancient times flooded regularly. Diking has prevented much of the flooding but now due to confinement of deposition within the stream beds significant lengths of stream run entirely above ground, in places as high as the rooftops. This is a development of the previous thousand years.

The native rock differs between the two banks. On the left is mainly sedimentary rock, the Monte Antola limestone, which is actually a marlstone. On the right is both sedimentary and metamorphic rock: ophiolite, serpentinite, basalt, jasper.

Val Trebbia is covered with a blanket of rich soil reddish or brown in color from hematite an average of deep. It consists of loess deposited in layers during periods of glacial maxima beginning about 400000 years ago in the Middle Pleistocene. The loess initially accumulated on gravelled terraces deriving from native rock.

==Cultural history==
Judging from the archaeological evidence, the Trebbia valley has been continuously occupied since the end of the Acheulian in the Paleolithic, about 150000 years ago. In the Mesolithic various summer camps for high-altitude hunting were located in the valley. Neolithic cultures were at first diverse (4500 BC). Later in the Neolithic, at about 4000 BC, the Square-mouthed pottery culture began to prevail; at about 3000 BC, the Chassey-Lagozza culture of the Chalcolithic. The Bronze Age population resided in settlements located at positions with natural defenses. Etruscan elements began in the Iron Age, about the 5th century BC. Celtic artifacts immediately preceded the Roman presence.

Along its eastern banks in 218 BC was fought one of the battles of the Second Punic War: the Battle of Trebbia, where Hannibal defeated a Roman consular army.

The name of the river is first known from Polybius, who wrote in the middle Roman Republic, but used materials dating to earlier. Which people first assigned it and during which period remains unclear. Without knowing the probable language the few etymologies are highly speculative.

In 1799 a major battle between the Russians and Austrians under Suvorov with the French took place here.

<text>The Royal Library () in Copenhagen is the national library of Denmark and the academic library of the University of Copenhagen. It is among the largest libraries in the world and the largest in the Nordic countries. In 2017, it merged with the State and University Library in Aarhus to form a combined national library. The combined library organisation (the separate library locations in Copenhagen and Aarhus are maintained) is known as the Royal Danish Library ().

It contains numerous historical treasures, and a copy of all works printed in Denmark since the 17th century are deposited there. Thanks to extensive donations in the past, the library holds nearly all known Danish printed works back to and including the first Danish books, printed in 1482 by Johann Snell.

==History==
The library was founded in 1648 by King Frederik III, who contributed a comprehensive collection of European works. It was opened to the public in 1793.

In 1989, it was merged with the prestigious Copenhagen University Library (founded in 1482) (UB1). In 2005, it was merged with the Danish National Library for Science and Medicine (UB2), now the Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences. The official name of the organization as of 1 January 2006 is The Royal Library, the National Library of Denmark and the Copenhagen University Library. In 2008, the Danish Folklore Archive was merged with the Royal Library.

===Librarians===
The first librarian was Marcus Meibom, followed 1663-1671 by Peder Griffenfeld. Later librarians included J. H. Schlegel, Jon Erichsen, Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer (1787-1823 notorious for stealing numerous books to enrich the library collections) and Chr. Bruun. Since 1900 the former librarians are H.O. Lange (1901-1924), Carl S. Petersen (1924-1943), Svend Dahl (1943-1952), Palle Birkelund (1952-1982), Torkil Olsen (1982-1986), Erland Kolding Nielsen (1986-2017), followed by the present Director General Svend Larsen.

===Book theft in the 1970s===
In the 1970s, the library saw the largest book theft in Danish history, with the case only being resolved in 2003. Almost 3,200 works (books and similar), mostly antiques, were stolen from the library by an employee. Most have since been recovered, but a few hundred remain missing.

==Items collected== 
Books, journals, newspapers, pamphlets and corporate publications, manuscripts and archives, maps, prints and photographs, music scores, documentation of folkways and popular traditions, four annual electronic copies of the Danish Internet by legal deposit.

As of 2017, the Royal Library held 36,975,069 physical volumes and
2,438,978 electronic titles. The online catalogue, in combination with the reading room, is still patrons&#x27; most direct form of access to the collections.

==The Royal Library today==
Today, The Royal Library has five sites: The main library at Slotsholmen, Copenhagen harbour (in the Black Diamond), covering all subjects and special collections; one at Nørre Alle, Faculty Library of Natural and Health Sciences; one at Gothersgade, central Copenhagen, Faculty Library of Social Sciences; one at Amager, Faculty Library of Humanities; and, one in Studiestræde, central Copenhagen, The Faculty of Law Library. The annual circulation is 11,400,000 loans (10,900,000 of these are electronic loans). The members are 32,196 active users. The annual budget: 394M Danish Kroner (58M US Dollars), including building expenses and maintenance.

The library is open to anyone above the age of 18 with a genuine need to use the collections. Special rules apply for use of rare and valuable items.

==Buildings at the Slotsholmen site==
The old building of the Slotsholmen site was built in 1906 by Hans Jørgen Holm. The central hall is a copy of Charlemagne&#x27;s Palace chapel in the Aachen Cathedral. The building is still being used by the library.
In 1999, a new building adjacent to the old one was opened at Slotsholmen, known as the Black Diamond. The Black Diamond building was designed by Danish architects schmidt hammer lassen. Named for its outside cover of black marble and glass, the Black Diamond building houses a concert hall in addition to the library.

The Black Diamond is formed by two black cubes that are slightly tilted over the street. In between, there is an eight-storey atrium whose walls are white and wave-shaped, with a couple of transversal corridors that link both sides, and balconies on every floor. The atrium&#x27;s exterior wall is made of glass; so, you can see the sea; and, on the opposite shore, you can see Christianshavn&#x27;s luxury buildings.

Three bridges connect the Black Diamond with the old part of the Royal Library; those three bridges (two small ones for internal transport and a big one with the circulation desk) go over the road. At the ceiling of the big bridge, there is a huge painting by Danish painter Per Kirkeby.

==Significant holdings==
The Royal Library acquires Danish books through legal deposit. The holdings include an almost complete collection of all Danish printed books back from 1482. In 2006, legal deposit was extended to electronic publications and now the library harvests four electronic copies of the Danish Internet each year. Danish books printed before 1900 are digitized on demand and made freely available to the public. As the National library, RDL has vast collections of digital material (Danish net archive, digitized radio and TV and newspapers etc.) which are relevant for scholars in many fields. The library also holds a large and significant collection of old foreign scholarly and scientific literature, including precious books of high value and of importance for book history, including a rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible.

The library holds treasures which are inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register: A collection of about 2,000 books by and about Carl Linné (1997); the manuscripts and correspondence of Hans Christian Andersen (1997); the Søren Kierkegaard Archives (manuscripts and personal papers) (1997); Guamán Poma de Ayala&#x27;s &quot;El Primer Nueva Coronica y Buen Gobierno&quot;, an autographed manuscript of 1,200 pages including 400 full-page drawings depicting the indigenous point of view on pre-conquest Andean life and Inca rule, the Spanish conquest in 1532, early Spanish colonial rule, and the systematic abuse of the rights of the indigenous population (2007). &quot;Biblia Latina&quot;. Commonly called the Hamburg Bible or &quot;the Bible of Bertoldus&quot; (MS. GKS 4 2°), a richly illuminated Bible in three very large volumes made for the Cathedral of Hamburg in 1255. The 89 illuminated initials in the book are unique both as expressions of medieval art and as sources to the craft and history of the medieval book. (2011);

Other treasures are the Copenhagen Psalter, the Dalby Gospel Book, the Angers fragment (parts of Denmark&#x27;s first national chronicle), and maps of the Polar Region. The library also holds important collections of Icelandic manuscripts, primarily in &quot;Den gamle kongelige samling&quot; (The Old Royal Collection) and &quot;Den nye kongelige samling&quot; (The New Royal Collection). Denmark&#x27;s most outstanding Icelandic collection, the Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection, is however not a holding of The Royal Library but of the University of Copenhagen.

In 2010, the library acquired the 14th-century Courtenay Compendium at auction.

<text>John Matthew &quot;Jaybird&quot; Moore (November 18, 1862 – February 3, 1940) was an American rancher and statesman from Texas who served in the United States House of Representatives from District 8 from 1905 to 1913. He was engaged in Fort Bend County&#x27;s Jaybird–Woodpecker War and affiliated with the Jaybirds. Moore was also present during the fighting at the Battle of Richmond on August 16, 1889.

==Early life and education==
John Matthew Moore was born on November 18, 1862, in Richmond, Texas, during the American Civil War as the son of Dr. Matthew A. and Henrietta (&quot;née&quot; Huddlestone) Moore. His family owned a farm and many slaves near Oyster Creek. He was educated at the State A. and M. College of Texas in College Station, which is now Texas A&amp;M University. He attended the college from 1878 to 1880.

==Career==
E. H. Loughery wrote in 1897 that Moore was engaged in merchandising and farming from 1880 to 1883, and that Moore was primarily interested in stockraising, banking and farming in Richmond after 1883. He was Chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee of Fort Bend County in 1888, and from 1890 to 1892 Moore was the president of the Jaybird Democratic Association of Fort Bend County. Prior to being elected as a member of the Texas House of Representatives, he had been a delegate to several minor and state conventions.

During the Jaybird–Woodpecker War, a man was killed across the street from his home.

John Matthew Moore has often been confused for John Marks Moore, who was the Secretary of State of Texas during Lawrence Sullivan Ross&#x27;s administration. John Matthew Moore has been erroneously claimed to have been a Secretary of State of Texas by the &quot;Fort Bend Herald and Texas Coaster&quot;, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, and the University of Texas at Austin.

==Personal life and legacy==

John Matthew Moore married Lottie Dyer, daughter of J. Foster Dyer, on July 30, 1883, in Nashville, Tennessee. J. Foster Dyer was a wealthy farmer and stockman of Fort Bend County. Mrs. Moore was an excellent musician and was educated in Virginia and at Baylor University at Waco. Moore was a member of Houston Lodge, No. 151 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. Moore&#x27;s son, John Jr., served as a two-term Mayor of Richmond, Texas, and a two-term judge in Fort Bend County, Texas. John Jr.&#x27;s son, Hilmar, was the Mayor of Richmond, and the longest-serving elected official in the United States, having served 30 terms from 1949 until Moore&#x27;s death on December 4, 2012.

<text>Il Sodoma (1477 – 14 February 1549) was the name given to the Italian Renaissance painter Giovanni Antonio Bazzi. Il Sodoma painted in a manner that superimposed the High Renaissance style of early 16th-century Rome onto the traditions of the provincial Sienese school; he spent the bulk of his professional life in Siena, with two periods in Rome.

==Biography==
Giovanni Bazzi was born in Vercelli, Piedmont, in 1477. His first master was the &quot;archaic&quot; Martino Spanzotti; he also appears to have been a student of the painter Giovenone. After acquiring the strong colouring and other distinctive stylistic features of the Lombard school and – though he is not known to have travelled to Milan – somehow absorbing the superficial mannerisms of Leonardo, he travelled to Siena before 1503, perhaps at the behest of agents of the Spannocchi family, and began with fresco cycles for Olivetan monks and a series of small Ovidian ceiling panels and a frieze depicting the career of Julius Caesar for Sigismondo Chigi at Palazzo Chigi.

 Along with Pinturicchio, Sodoma was one of the first to practice in Siena the style of the High Renaissance. His first important works were frescoes in the Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, on the road from Siena to Rome, illustrating the life of St Benedict in continuation of the series that Luca Signorelli had begun in 1498. Gaining fluency in the prevailing popular style of Pinturicchio, Sodoma completed the set in 1502 and included a self-portrait with badgers and ravens. 

Sodoma was invited to Rome in 1508 by the celebrated Sienese merchant Agostino Chigi and was employed there by Pope Julius II in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. He executed two great compositions and various ornaments and grotesques in vaulted ceilings divided into feigned compartments in the antique manner that Pinturicchio had recently revived, working at the same time as Raphael. Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s rhetorical story that Sodoma&#x27;s larger works did not satisfy the pope, who engaged Raphael to substitute a program of &quot;Justice, Poetry, and Theology&quot;, is not borne out by the documents.

Before October 1510 he was in Siena, where he painted the exterior of Palazzo Chigi in monochrome chiaroscuro with scenes from the Bible and from Antiquity, the first such work seen in Siena. His painting at this time began to show distinct Florentine influences, especially of Fra Bartolommeo.
Called again to Rome by Chigi, in the Villa Chigi (now the Villa Farnesina), working alongside Baldassarre Peruzzi, Sodoma painted subjects from the life of Alexander the Great: &quot;Alexander in the Tent of Darius&quot; and the &quot;Nuptials of the Conqueror with Roxanne&quot;, which some people consider his masterpiece. When Leo X became pope (1513), Sodoma presented him with a picture of the &quot;Death of Lucretia&quot; (or of Cleopatra, according to some accounts). Leo gave him a large sum of money as a reward and created him a &quot;cavaliere&quot;.

In his youth, Bazzi had married, but he and his wife soon separated. A daughter married Bartolomeo Neroni, called also &quot;Riccio Sanese&quot; or &quot;Maestro Riccio&quot;, one of his principal pupils. 
Bazzi acquired his nickname of &quot;Il Sodoma&quot;, as it were &quot;the sodomite&quot;, from as early as 1512.
This appears to have been one among various nicknames, he was also known as &quot;Mattaccio&quot; or &quot;Matazo&quot; (&quot;the madman&quot;) among the monks of Monte Oliveto.
It is due to the contemporary art historian Giorgio Vasari that Bazzi&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Il Sodoma&quot; has become conventional. 
According to Vasari&#x27;s testimony, Bazzi always surrounded himself with &quot;boys and beardless youths, whom he loved more than was decent&quot;, for which reason he acquired the nickname &quot;Il Soddoma&quot;. 
Still, according to Vasari, Bazzi took pride in the nickname and composed stanzas and songs about it.

Bazzi returned to Siena and, at a later date, sought work in Pisa, Volterra, and Lucca. From Lucca, he returned to Siena not long before his death on 14 February 1549 (older narratives say 1554). He had supposedly squandered his property and is said, without documentary support, to have died in penury in the great hospital of Siena. One of his pupils is known as Giomo del Sodoma.

==Work==

Some critics see in Sodoma&#x27;s &quot;Madonna&quot; in the Pinacoteca di Brera (if it really is by him) the direct influence of Leonardo da Vinci. Modern criticism tends not to follow Giovanni Morelli in supposing that Raphael painted Sodoma&#x27;s portrait next to himself in &quot;The School of Athens&quot;, while a drawing at Christ Church is supposed to be a portrait of Raphael by Sodoma.

Among his masterpieces are the frescoes, completed in 1526, in the chapel of St. Catherine of Siena painted for the church of San Domenico (Siena), depicting the saint in ecstasy, fainting as she receives the Eucharist from an angel. In the Oratory of San Bernardino, are scenes from the history of the Virgin, painted in conjunction with Girolamo del Pacchia and Domenico di Pace Beccafumi (1536–1538). These frescoes depict the &quot;Visitation &quot;and the &quot;Assumption&quot;. In San Francesco are the &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot; (1513) and &quot;Christ Scourged&quot;. Many critics regard one or the other of these paintings as Sodoma&#x27;s masterpiece. In the choir of Pisa Cathedral is the &quot;Sacrifice of Abraham&quot;, and in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence a &quot;St. Sebastian&quot;.

Some of his works, including the &quot;Holy Family&quot; now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena) have been mistaken for works of Leonardo da Vinci. His easel pictures are rare; there are two in the National Gallery, London.

==Critical assessments==
It is said that Sodoma jeered at Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; and that Vasari repaid him by presenting a negative account of Sodoma&#x27;s morals and demeanour and withholding praise of his work. According to Vasari, the name by which Bazzi was known was &quot;Il Mattaccio&quot; (the Madcap, the Maniac), this epithet having been bestowed upon him by the monks of Monte Oliveto. He dressed gaudily, like a mountebank, and his house was a Noah&#x27;s ark, owing to the strange miscellany of animals he kept there. He was a cracker of jokes and fond of music, and he sang poems composed by himself on indecorous subjects.

Vasari alleges that Sodoma was always a negligent artist, his early success in Siena, where he painted many portraits, being partly due to lack of competition, a judgment in which Sydney Freedberg concurs. Vasari asserts that as he aged, he became too &quot;lazy&quot; to make cartoons for his frescoes but daubed them straight onto the wall. Vasari nevertheless admits that Sodoma produced some works of very fine quality and that during his lifetime his reputation was high.

<text>William George Fargo (May 20, 1818 – August 3, 1881) was an American businessman and politician who founded the Wells Fargo banking corporation and American Express company.

==Early life==
William George Fargo was born in Pompey in Onondaga County, New York, on May 20, 1818. He was the eldest of twelve children of William C. Fargo (1791–1878) and Stacy Chappel Strong (1799–1869). His younger brother was James Congdell Strong Fargo (1829–1915), president of the American Express Company for 30 years. William&#x27;s education consisted only of the rudiments taught in a country school as he left school at the age of 13 to carry the mail in Pompey and help support his family.

His father, who was born in New London, Connecticut, fought in the War of 1812. The elder Fargo was stationed at Fort Niagara and fought in the battle of Queenston Heights under General Van Rensselaer that resulted in the death of British General Isaac Brock. Fargo was wounded in his right thigh, just before the Americans took possession of the ground.

His grandfather, William Beebe Fargo (1757–1801), served with distinction in the American Revolutionary War, the son of William Fargo (1726–1813). His great-grandfather was the son of Moses Fargo (1691–1798) and the grandson of Moses Fargo (1648–1742), who was born in Lyon, France. His father Jacent &quot;Jason&quot; Fargeau, had emigrated with his wife and children to Wales, from where Moses and his elder brother Aaron went to Norfolk, Connecticut, in 1670.

==Career==
At the age of 13, Fargo left school and started carrying mail for his native village of Pompey, New York. In the winter of 1838, Fargo started working with Hough &amp; Gilchrist, grocers, from Syracuse. He remained there for a year until he went to work with the grocers Roswell and Willett Hinman. After three years, Fargo obtained a clerkship in the forwarding house of Dunford &amp; Co., Syracuse. In 1841, he became a freight agent, an express messenger between Albany and Buffalo, for the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad in Auburn. A year later in 1843, Fargo was a Resident Agent in Buffalo, New York. He left the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad and joined Livingston, Wells &amp; Co., as messenger.

===American Express Company===

On April 1, 1845, along with Henry Wells and Daniel Dunning, Fargo organized the Western Express which ran from Buffalo to Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago and intermediate points, under the name of &quot;Wells &amp; Co&quot;. At that time, there were no railroad facilities west of Buffalo, and Fargo, who was in charge of the business, made use of steamboats and wagons.

In 1845, Daniel Dunning withdrew from the company, and in 1846, Henry Wells sold out his interest in this concern to William A. Livingston, who became Fargo&#x27;s partner in &quot;Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company&quot;. In 1850, three competing express companies: &quot;Wells &amp; Company&quot; (Henry Wells), &quot;Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company&quot; (Fargo and William A. Livingston), and &quot;Wells, Butterfield &amp; Company&quot;, the successor earlier in 1850 of &quot;Butterfield, Wasson &amp; Company&quot; (John Warren Butterfield), were consolidated and became the American Express Company, with Wells as President and Fargo as Secretary.

In 1866, upon the resignation of Henry Wells and American Express&#x27; merger with the Merchants Union Express Company, Fargo was elected President of the American Express Company. He was the company&#x27;s president until he died in 1881, at which point his brother, J. C. Fargo, assumed the presidency, holding the post until 1914.

===Wells Fargo &amp; Company===
In 1852, Henry Wells and William Fargo created Wells Fargo &amp; Co. when Butterfield (and other directors of American Express) objected to the extension of its operations to California. The original &quot;Wells Fargo &amp; Co.&quot; was created to facilitate an express business between New York and San Francisco by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the Pacific coast. The new company offered banking services, which included buying gold and selling paper bank drafts, and express services, which included rapid delivery of gold and anything else valuable. The company opened for business in the gold rush city of San Francisco, and soon the company&#x27;s agents opened offices in the other new cities and mining camps in the West.

In 1861, Wells Fargo &amp; Company bought and reorganized the Overland Mail Co., which had been formed in 1857 to carry the United States mail, and of which Fargo had been one of the original promoters.

===Other===
Fargo was a director and vice-president of New York Central Railroad Company, a director and shareholder of the Northern Pacific Railway, a director of the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railroad Company, and a shareholder in the Buffalo Coal Company and the McKean and Buffalo Railroad Company. He was also a stockholder in several large manufacturing establishments in Buffalo.

==Political career==
In 1861, he was elected mayor of Buffalo, serving from 1862 to 1866, as he was elected to a second term in 1863. During his term as mayor, the Buffalo riot of 1862 took place. Fargo was a lifelong Democrat and stood against secession. He supported the Union during the Civil War by paying a part of the salary of his employees that were drafted.

==Personal life==
In January 1840, Fargo married Anna H. Williams (1820–1890), daughter of Nathan Williams, one of the proprietors of Pompey, with whom he had eight children:
*Georgia Fargo (1841–1892), who died unmarried
*Alma Cornelia Fargo (1842–1842), who died young
*Sarah Irene Fargo (1843–1854)
*William George Fargo Jr. (1845–1872), who married Minerva Elizabeth Prendergast (1848–1873)
*Hannah Sophia Fargo (1847–1851), who died young
*Mary Louise Fargo (1851–1852), who died young
*Helen Lacy Fargo (1857–1886), who married Herbert G. Squiers (1859–1911), a diplomat who served as Minister to Cuba (1902–1905) and Panama (1906–1909)
*Edwin Morgan Fargo (1861–1865), who died young

In 1868, when he was 50, Fargo bought on the Buffalo&#x27;s west side; and between 1868 and 1872, he built the Fargo Mansion at Jersey and Fargo Streets, which was Buffalo&#x27;s largest mansion. The home was completed in 1872 at a cost of $600,000 (). Another $100,000 () was spent to furnish and decorate the mansion. Michael Rizzo, a Buffalo historian, wrote:

He died on August 3, 1881, after battling an illness for several months. After his funeral on August 7, 1881, he was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery. At the time of his death, only two of his children were living, Georgia and Helen Fargo. William&#x27;s brother, J. C. Fargo, succeeded him as President of American Express after his death.

==Legacy==
Fargo&#x27;s wife, Anna, died in 1890. With their two surviving children living elsewhere, the Fargo Mansion stood vacant for 10 years. It was deemed too expensive to maintain and, with no buyer, the mansion was demolished and the block was divided into residential lots in 1901. The mansion and estate grounds were only 30 years old.

Fargo Avenue in Buffalo; the Fargo Quadrangle at the University at Buffalo; and Fargo, North Dakota, are named after him.

The Fargo Estate Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

<text>Rhön-Grabfeld is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southeast and clockwise) the districts of Hassberge, Schweinfurt and Bad Kissingen, and the states of Hesse (district Fulda) and Thuringia (districts Schmalkalden-Meiningen and Hildburghausen).

==History==
In medieval times the region was a part of the Bishopric of Würzburg. When the clerical states of Germany were dissolved in 1803, it fell to Bavaria. The district of Rhön-Grabfeld was established in 1972, when the former districts of Bad Neustadt, Königshofen and Mellrichstadt were merged.

==Geography==
The district consists of two distinct areas: The eastern parts of the Rhön mountains and the Bavarian portion of Grabfeld.

Grabfeld is a fertile region south of the Rhön mountains. Literally it means &quot;digfield&quot;. According to local legend a queen once lost her beloved ring in the Grabfeld. She ordered her servants to dig up the whole area. When the ring was found, she was relieved and ordered a royal estate to be built where it was found. Later this estate became the city of Königshofen.

The source of the Fränkische Saale is located in the district. The river runs through the district from north to south.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a crown representing the Grabfeld legend
* a wavy line representing the Saale River
* three summit crosses representing the mountains of the Rhön

<text>PIRCH or pIRCh is a shareware Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client published by Northwest Computer Services. Its name is an acronym – PolarGeek&#x27;s IRC Hack.

The last version of the program, known as PIRCH98, was released in 1998. PIRCH has in the past been considered to be the number-two Windows IRC client behind mIRC.

PIRCH inspired the creation of Vortec IRC due to a lack of software updates.

==Reception==
Forrest Stroud&#x27;s 1998 review of Pirch stated it has &quot;great selection of features and is an IRC client that will especially appeal to novice IRC users&quot;, such as the capability of simultaneous multiple server connections. But Stroud noted, &quot;PIRCH is relatively slow in listing channels for servers and also lacks the capability to filter the number of channels based on the number of users or the ability to sort based on the name of a channel&quot;.

In 1999, Joe Barr of LinuxWorld referred to Pirch as a &quot;nice Windows client&quot;.

<text>Stick Around for Joy is the third and final studio album by the Icelandic alternative rock band the Sugarcubes. It was released in 1992 by Elektra. The album was supported by four singles: &quot;Hit&quot;, which reached number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the US and number 17 on the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Walkabout&quot;, &quot;Vitamin&quot; and &quot;Leash Called Love&quot;, which went to number one on the US Dance chart.

The album peaked at number 95 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the band&#x27;s lowest charting positions on both charts.

==Production==
The band recorded the album in the United States, with producer Paul Fox.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Björk&#x27;s singing is shapely, passionate and willfully bizarre; she carries the album pretty much on her own.&quot; &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot; deemed &quot;Stick Around for Joy&quot; the band&#x27;s &quot;most accessible and, true to its name, happiest sounding album, packed end to end with lively and tuneful dance pop.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; thought that &quot;it&#x27;s the churning interplay of guitarist Thor Eldon and the rhythm section that ultimately carries the album.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; wrote that &quot;bassist Bragi Olafsson and drummer Siggi Baldursson don&#x27;t do much to dispel the notion that funk just isn&#x27;t a Nordic thing.&quot; The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; wrote that by &quot;Stick Around for Joy&quot; the Sugarcubes had &quot;already degenerated into mind-numbing mediocrity.&quot;

<text>The various tones of the color coral are orange, red and pink representations of the colors of those cnidarians known as precious corals.
The web color coral is a shade of orange. It is displayed adjacent. Other modern color schemes use different shades of orange or red.

The first recorded use of &quot;coral&quot; as a color name in English was in 1513.

==Variations of coral==

===Coral red===
The color coral red is displayed adjacent.

===Coral pink===
The color coral pink is displayed adjacent, a pinkish color.

The complementary color of coral pink is teal. The first recorded use of &quot;coral pink&quot; as a color name in English was in 1892. Late in 2016, the color sample was renamed Coral Red by Pantone, as the RGB, hex and HTML color table showed the same color as being reddish, standing against popular belief of pinkish. 

Still today, some people call coral red &quot;coral pink&quot; due to this old attribution.

The normalized color coordinates for coral pink are identical to Congo pink, which was first recorded as a color name in English in 1912.

===Light coral===
The web color light coral is a pinkish-light orange color as displayed adjacent. It is also a HTML/CSS color name and a X11 color name.

<doc id="457387" wikidata="Q914206" url="?curid=457387" title="Life's Too Good">
<text>Life&#x27;s Too Good is the debut studio album by Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes. It was released April 25, 1988 by One Little Indian in the UK and Europe and in May 1988 by Elektra Records in the US. The album was an unexpected success and brought international attention for the band, especially to lead singer Björk, who would launch a successful solo career in 1993.

Consisting of veterans of Reykjavík&#x27;s early 1980s rock culture, the band took elements of the post-punk sound that characterised the scene, intending to create a humorous take on pop music&#x27;s optimism, which is reflected in the album&#x27;s title. Despite never having intended to be taken seriously, and because of the success of their debut and their contractual obligations, the Sugarcubes went on to release two further studio albums.

==Release==

The lead single &quot;Birthday&quot; was released on Derek Birkett&#x27;s One Little Indian Records in August 1987. After influential magazine &quot;NME&quot; declared it &quot;Single of the Week&quot;, the Sugarcubes, especially lead singer Björk, unexpectedly got the attention of the British music press. Across the following months, the band reluctantly appeared on the covers of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most prominent pop magazines and experienced &quot;massive hype&quot; which generated a wave of interest from the press and the public. Despite offers by major labels like Warner Bros. and PolyGram, none of these labels were willing to give the Sugarcubes complete creative control, so the band decided to record the album themselves and release it on One Little Indian. &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot; was finally released in April 1988. &quot;Coldsweat&quot; and &quot;Deus&quot; were issued as singles prior to the album&#x27;s release in January and April 1988 respectively, while the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s remix of &quot;Birthday&quot; (subtitled the &quot;Christmas Mix&quot;) was released as a single in August 1988. &quot;Motorcrash&quot; followed as the album&#x27;s final single in November 1988.

While recording &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot;, the Sugarcubes had befriended Howard Thompson, who worked in Elektra Records&#x27; A&amp;R division; he orchestrated a licensing deal and the album was released in the United States. &quot;Birthday&quot; proved to be very successful on American college radio, before crossing over to mainstream radio. To the band&#x27;s frustration, the American media also focused on Björk. At the end of 1988, the Sugarcubes undertook an American tour, which evolved into an international tour catapulted by the album&#x27;s growing sales.

Paul White of Me Company designed the artwork for &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot;. The figures depicted in the artwork are derivations of a signature he had which consisted of a character &quot;made up of just a face, legs and a [penis].&quot; White stuck to using flat-color backgrounds; this discipline was born out of the need to keep printing costs as low as possible, and had previously been followed for the sleeve designs of the &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;Coldsweat&quot; singles. The album was issued in various color schemes, including green, yellow, blue and pink.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot; was released to largely positive reviews, receiving acclaim from the British and American press. In his review for &quot;NME&quot;, Steven Wells gave the album an unconventional score of fifty out of ten, awarding ten points each for &quot;cheekiness&quot;, &quot;naughtiness&quot;, &quot;sexiness&quot;, &quot;silliness&quot; and &quot;scariness&quot;. Nancy Culp of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; said that while the Sugarcubes&#x27; music is not particularly innovative, &quot;their approach is fresh and their energy indisputable.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn commented that &quot;&quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot; has the feel of an impact album: one of those rare debuts—like the first X or Talking Heads albums—that not only influence the creative underground but stretch the overall boundaries of rock.&quot; John Dougan praised Björk&#x27;s vocals and the album&#x27;s &quot;strong&quot; songs in a retrospective review for AllMusic, and considered that the album &quot;lived up to all the advance hype.&quot;

Less impressed was Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who wrote that the band&#x27;s &quot;sense of mischief isn&#x27;t just playful—it&#x27;s experimental and a little wicked. It&#x27;s also so imperfectly realized that you have to infer it out from underneath their breathy swoops, willful shifts and starts, and translated lyrics—so imperfectly realized that most of their fans, critics included, barely notice it.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot; is credited as the first Icelandic album &quot;of its breed&quot; to have a worldwide impact. In 2014, Treble wrote that the album &quot;[generated] a larger interest towards the country’s popular and alternative music scenes alike.&quot; The album is considered a definite influence on all subsequent Icelandic popular music, and on international acts such as Savages and Florence and the Machine. Since its release, &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Good&quot; has generated a dedicated following, and is nowadays cited as an important cult classic. The album helped in regarding the Sugarcubes as &quot;the biggest rock band to emerge from Iceland.&quot; &quot;Coldsweat&quot; was covered by the industrial rock band Diatribe on the 1993 album &quot;Shut Up Kitty: A Cyber-Based Covers Compilation&quot;.

<text>The discography of Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk consists of ten studio albums, two soundtrack albums, one compilation album, six remix albums, eight live albums, four box sets, three collaboration albums, forty-five singles, ten promotional singles and eight remixes series. All of her recordings were released under One Little Independent Records.

Björk started her career after a recording of her rendition of Tina Charles&#x27; 1976 song &quot;I Love to Love&quot; became popular on Icelandic radio. Her first eponymous solo release, considered juvenilia, was released under Fálkinn label in 1977. Thereafter, Björk ventured into bands, singing as the lead vocalist of groups like Tappi Tíkarrass, Kukl, the Elgar Sisters and, most notably, the Sugarcubes. In 1990 she released &quot;Gling-Gló&quot; alongside Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar, a cover album of jazz standards.

Björk released her first solo studio album, titled &quot;Debut&quot;, in 1993. A sleeper hit in United Kingdom, the record eventually hit the top three in the Official Charts Company and received platinum certifications from BPI, RIAA and ARIA. The album included the singer&#x27;s debut single &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, which gained chart success on &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative and Dance charts. The album was later reissued to include the third single &quot;Play Dead&quot;, taken from the soundtrack of &quot;The Young Americans&quot;, which became her first top 20 single on BPI charts. Subsequent singles &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; and &quot;Violently Happy&quot; also obtained moderate chart success and recurrent rotation on MTV. Her second album, &quot;Post&quot;, was released in June 1995, and peaked at number two in the UK and was certified platinum by BPI and RIAA. The album spawned three top 10 singles in the UK, including &quot;Army of Me&quot;, &quot;Hyperballad&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;, which became her best-selling single and was certified gold by BPI. The album was followed by a companion remix album, called &quot;Telegram&quot; (1996). Björk focused on combining electronic beats with string instruments with her third album &quot;Homogenic&quot; (1997), which sold 1 million copies around Europe. 

In 2000, Björk starred in Lars von Trier&#x27;s feature film &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, for which she also composed the companion soundtrack &quot;Selmasongs&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot;, a promotional single from the album, received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. &quot;Vespertine&quot;, the singer&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released in 2001 and was certified Gold in the UK. The following year, Björk released her &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, a companion box-set, &quot;Family Tree&quot;, and a series of live albums, collected in the &quot;Live Box&quot; box set. In 2004, Björk released her fifth studio album, titled &quot;Medúlla&quot;, composed almost entirely using human voices and sounds. Its first promotional single, &quot;Oceania&quot;, was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee for the 2004 Summer Olympics and debuted at the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Athens. The next year, Björk starred in and composed the soundtrack for Matthew Barney&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Restraint 9&quot;. Björk released her sixth studio album, &quot;Volta&quot;, in 2007. The album was her first to reach the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while its first single &quot;Earth Intruders&quot; is Björk highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The 2009 release &quot;Voltaïc&quot;, is a companion box-set consisting of live and remix recordings. Björk&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Biophilia&quot; (2011), was a multimedia project encompassing various apps for each song, a series of educational workshops in four continents, a worldwide tour and a documentary. After releasing several remixes as a part of &quot;The Crystalline Series&quot; and the &quot;Biophilia Remix Series&quot;, Björk released a remix album titled &quot;Bastards&quot; in 2012. After the end of the tour, the singer released her sixth live album, &quot;Björk: Biophilia Live&quot;. 

Coinciding with a MoMa retrospective on her career, Björk released her eighth studio album, &quot;Vulnicura&quot; in 2015. The album was followed by the &quot;Vulnicura Remix Series&quot;, an acoustic album called &quot;Vulnicura Strings&quot;, a live album, &quot;Vulnicura Live&quot;, and an immersive exhibition, &quot;Björk Digital&quot;, which culminated in the release of a virtual reality video album, &quot;Vulnicura VR&quot;. Björk&#x27;s subsequent ninth and tenth studio albums, &quot;Utopia&quot; and &quot;Fossora&quot;, were released in 2017 and 2022 respectively. Both were promoted through remixes and a theatrical concert tour, Cornucopia. In 2025, the tour was released as a concert film, and as a live and video album.

<doc id="457389" wikidata="Q4683453" url="?curid=457389" title="Administrative assistant">
<text>A person responsible for providing various kinds of administrative assistance is called an administrative assistant (admin assistant) or sometimes an administrative support specialist. In most instances it is identical to the modern iteration of the position of secretary or is a sub-specialty of secretarial duties.

==Job duties==

Admin assistants perform clerical duties in nearly every industry. Some administrative assistants, like those in the legal industry, may be more specialized than others. Most administrative assistant duties revolve around managing and distributing information within an office. This generally includes answering phones, taking memos and maintaining files. Administrative assistants may also be in charge of sending and receiving correspondence, as well as greeting clients and customers.

Bookkeeping

Admin assistants in some offices may be charged with monitoring and recording expenditures. Duties may range from creating spreadsheets to reporting expenses to an office manager. As such, some administrative assistants may be required to be knowledgeable in office bookkeeping software, such as Microsoft Excel.

Planning and scheduling

Planning events like board meetings and luncheons may also be the responsibility of admin assistants. This may require researching vendor prices or inquiring about participants&#x27; availability. Other duties may include scheduling appointments and preparing presentation materials.

Documentation

Admin assistants may also help office members with documentation. Aside from storing, organizing and managing files, assistants may need to type, edit and proofread documents. Some assistants may need to take dictation or record the minutes of meetings.

==Specialized job duties==

Administrative assistants in some fields may be required to have extensive professional knowledge. Accordingly, duties for these assistants may be more specialized. For example, legal administrative assistants may need to have a thorough understanding of legal terminology and procedures, while medical assistants may need to be well-versed in dealing with insurance companies and reading medical reports.

In this role they are also referred to as administrative support specialists.

==Employment outlook and salary information==

Average employment growth of 12% was expected for secretaries and administrative assistants, from 2012 to 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). General secretaries and administrative assistants, not serving as legal, medical or executive secretaries, earned an annual median wage in 2018 of $52,840, according to the BLS.

<text>Elijah &quot;Lije&quot; Baley is a fictional character in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series. He is the main character of the novels &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, &quot;The Naked Sun&quot; and &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, and of the short story &quot;Mirror Image.&quot; He is seen in flashbacks several times and talked about frequently in &quot;Robots and Empire&quot;, which is set roughly 160 years after his death. He is further mentioned in passing in &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot; as a &quot;Culture Hero&quot;. Besides Asimov&#x27;s works he appears in the &quot;Foundation&#x27;s Friends&quot; story &quot;Strip-Runner&quot; by Pamela Sargent, and &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &#x27;The Caves of Steel&#x27;&quot; poem by Randall Garrett.

==Biography==

Elijah Baley is a plainclothesman, a homicide detective in the New York City Police Department 3,000 years in the future. He is a doleful character with a quick temper. Like Sherlock Holmes, he is a pipe-smoker, a habit he fights against in &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;. He has a strong sense of duty and loyalty and is very protective of his family and his status. His wife, Jezebel Baley, prefers to be called Jessie. Their son, Bentley, became a leader in the second wave of interplanetary space exploration.

Baley, like most earth-born human beings of his century, is strongly agoraphobic, as &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; reveals that most natives of Earth live their entire lives in immense domed cities (&quot;caves of steel&quot;) and rarely, if ever, travel to the outside surface. Baley&#x27;s agoraphobia is an important personality characteristic and plot point in several of the novels in which he appears. In the later stories he has limited success in overcoming his agoraphobia, which he recognizes as a potential limitation to his species and more directly his son. (Baley&#x27;s agoraphobia mirrors Asimov&#x27;s own personality, who was a well known .)

Asimov&#x27;s novels are typically devoid of profanity. Consequently, Baley&#x27;s favourite expletive is &quot;Jehoshaphat!&quot;, which he says in times of great stress or excitement.

In &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, he is called upon to help solve the murder of a Spacer. The Spacers assign him a robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who becomes his lifelong friend. He meets up with R. Daneel again in &quot;The Naked Sun&quot;, where again he is asked to investigate the murder of a Spacer, this time on the planet Solaria, making him the first Earthman to leave Earth since the first wave of colonization. Later, in the &quot;Robots of Dawn&quot;, while investigating another murder on behalf of the Spacers he recognizes R. Giskard&#x27;s telepathic abilities long before anyone else does. Giskard modifies Baley&#x27;s mind to prevent him from being able to tell anyone. While off Earth he develops a somewhat romantic and sexual relation with Gladia, a Spacer woman who, prompted by meeting him, becomes the first Solarian in centuries to willingly leave Solaria and the last to do so.

In &quot;Robots and Empire&quot; he is seen in a number of flashbacks, in particular over the course of the novel, Giskard, Gladia and finally Daneel all recall the last time they ever met him. Daneel&#x27;s memory is notable as it covers an extremely elderly Baley bestowing his last words upon Daneel and reveals he perished mere moments after Daneel left his presence (at Baley&#x27;s request, to prevent the sight of his death from distressing the Three Laws-compliant Daneel). His words have a profound impact on Daneel&#x27;s behavior even many thousands of years on.

Some details of Baley&#x27;s life lack continuity throughout the Robot novels. In &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, for example, it is noted that Baley&#x27;s mother died shortly after his father was declassified (lost his civil classification and therefore all social and economic status), and that Baley did not remember her. However, in &quot;The Robots of Dawn&quot;, Baley recalls his mother cajoling him to eat her chicken soup and telling him that even the Spacers did not have anything as good. In &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot;, Baley is also reported to have a sister, but she is never referred to again. In the same way, Baley&#x27;s intense shame at his father&#x27;s declassification and the resulting deprivations of his childhood are not referred to in succeeding novels.

In later stories, it is revealed that Baley becomes a legendary hero for millennia. References to him can be found in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;.

<text>Coral is a feminine given name derived from the precious coral used to make jewelry. The name is ultimately derived from the Greek word &quot;korallion&quot; and the Latin &quot;coralium&quot;.

The name came into fashion in the Anglosphere in the late 1800s along with other gemstone names for girls. Coral necklaces were traditionally worn by young children to protect them from illness.

==Usage==
The name was at the height of popularity in most English-speaking countries in the late 1800s and the first half of the 20th century. Its greatest popularity in Spain was between 1980 and 2010. The name has since declined in popularity but remains in regular use. In the United States, 128 newborn girls were named Coral in 2021. Name variants Coralie and Coraline are also in regular use for girls.

<text>The Revolutionary Communist Group (RCG) is a communist, Marxist and Leninist political organisation in the United Kingdom.

According to its own statements, the group &quot;exists in order to defend and develop an anti-imperialist trend within Britain, based on the long term interests of the entire working class and the oppressed internationally. We stand for the creation of a society organised both to meet the needs of the entire population, and to ensure the fullest possible development of every individual.&quot; Emphasising a campaign against capitalism and the oppression of the working class, the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, which they consider to be imperialistic in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of Northern Ireland, the involvement of British troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the British government&#x27;s support for Israel.

Believing that the British electoral system under capitalism cannot bring about any real change in society, and as it does not consider itself a party (believing that a communist party, led by a vanguard of the proletariat, has not yet developed in Britain), the RCG has not taken part in elections since 1979. The group also publish their own newspaper, Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!, which has been running since November–December 1979 and now appears every two months.

== Political ideology ==

===Marxist position===

The Revolutionary Communist Group is a communist organisation. It believes that the United Kingdom is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (i.e., a state where the ruling capitalist class control the economic and political powers to the detriment of the working class, in this case through a representative democracy), and believe that the only real way to enact social change is for the working class to take power in a revolution, thereby establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., a state ruled through participatory democracy by the working class for the benefit of the masses).

Writing in 2007, the British Trotskyist group Permanent Revolution characterised the RCG&#x27;s position as being &quot;distinctive on the British left by their open espousal of left Stalinism, which essentially consists of an uncritical support for the leadership of anti-imperialist struggles, an uncritical support for the Cuban regime, a completely undemocratic internal structure, an active participation in anti-racist struggles and complete rejection of any united front work within the British labour movement, trade unions or Labour Party.&quot; Group members see this as a caricature of the RCG, and instead claim that the RCG is a democratic-centralist organisation in the Leninist tradition.

=== Criticism of British imperialism ===
The RCG believes that the United Kingdom has been an imperialist power since the end of the nineteenth century, stating that &quot;Britain is the oldest imperialist country in the world. It was the first to develop into finance monopoly capitalism – imperialism, and is still a major imperialist power, second only to the United States. Britain&#x27;s imperialist character has been decisive in determining British economic, social and political developments.&quot; In this way they believe that the British state has interfered in foreign affairs, historically through the British Empire and continuing through foreign wars and corporate dominance, to the detriment to the working class masses living in these countries.

The group supports revolutionary national democratic governments in various Third and Second World countries such as the Bolivarian government of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, and the government of Evo Morales in Bolivia. It supports socialist Cuba and the socialist government of Cuba. The RCG believes that such movements in alliance with Cuba have the ability to radically help the working class masses living in these nations, and fight against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, United States and other First World states who use them for cheap labour. As they make clear on their website, &quot;The resistance movements in the oppressed nations are weakening imperialism; an anti-imperialist movement in this country in unity with these struggles can deal a decisive blow against British imperialism and the British ruling class. For this reason the RCG has always given complete and unconditional support to liberation movements fighting imperialism and we support their right to carry out their struggles by any means necessary.&quot;

The RCG argues that socialists should not give their support to the centre/centre-left Labour Party, which is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. On this subject, David Yaffe stated the RCG&#x27;s position that &quot;no anti-imperialist or socialist movement can be built unless the British left makes a fundamental and irrevocable break with the British Labour Party.&quot; He went on to characterise the party&#x27;s policies in government as being &quot;openly racist, imperialist and warmongering&quot;. At the same time it has remained critical of other socialist organisations in Britain such as the Communist Party of Great Britain, Militant, the International Marxist Group and the Socialist Workers Party for what it sees as being &quot;major obstacle[s]&quot; to the building of an anti-imperialist movement in Britain. This is because many of these groups denounced the governments of socialist states such as the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and North Korea, and instead encouraged their members to vote for the Labour Party.

=== Criticism of racism, immigration controls and discrimination ===

The RCG has been firmly critical of racism and particularly the racism of the British government and state. It has supported groups of black nationalists in the United States in their efforts at defending themselves against racism. It also opposes any constraints on immigration, believing that any such measures are inherently racist in an imperialist country. It also criticises all other forms of discrimination in society, stating that &quot;We oppose all discrimination against anyone on grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability.&quot;

==History==

===Early years: 1970-1976===
Developing in the early 1970s, the RCG grew out of the &quot;Revolutionary Opposition&quot; faction of the International Socialists (IS), (forerunners of the Socialist Workers Party), being strongly influenced by the politics of Roy Tearse. When the leading figures of the &quot;Revolutionary Opposition&quot;, the name itself only first appearing in print in their appeal document, were expelled from the IS, its members met to decide on their course of action, and disagreements between Tearse&#x27;s allies and the majority of the faction around David Yaffe rapidly surfaced. The result was that Tearse&#x27;s supporters formed the Discussion Group which led a quiet life for a number of years inside the Labour Party before dissolving. Meanwhile, Yaffe and his comrades proceeded to found the Revolutionary Communist Group in 1974.

In 1975 the RCG began publishing a theoretical journal called &quot;Revolutionary Communist&quot; in which it in part espoused a view of crisis theory, a theme they had already addressed in the IS when challenging the work of the theoreticians of that group. They developed Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s analysis of the labour aristocracy, and showed its relevance for politics in the period after the Second World War. Their conclusions led them to call for no vote for the Labour Party.

The early years of the RCG saw the group lose a large part of its initial membership. For example, in September 1975 the Birmingham branch decamped in order to join the Workers&#x27; Socialist League.

A few years after the RCG&#x27;s foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as Stalinism and the South African government. One group, dominated by Frank Furedi (1947-), a sociologist at the University of Kent who used the pseudonym of &quot;Frank Richards&quot;, began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been &quot;organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru&quot;. In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members. Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1981, and would publish the magazine &quot;Living Marxism&quot; from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from Leninism to Libertarian Marxism.

The RCG recognised the progressive role played by some of the traditional communist parties such as the South African Communist Party and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the socialist revolution in Cuba.

Whilst many self-proclaimed socialist organisations, especially those regarding themselves as Trotskyist, in the UK welcomed the demise of the Eastern Bloc and then of the Soviet Union the RCG argued that these events were counterrevolutionary and constituted a setback in the class struggle internationally because many national liberation movements and socialist states in the Third World were supported by the Soviet Union and the Comecon. The RCG believed that while the Soviet Union was a socialist state, as a result of both internal developments in the Soviet Union itself and the reactionary role of working class parties (social democratic and communist) in the imperialist countries, the revolution degenerated and the communist party became an elite party separate from the working class. These developments laid the foundation for the counterrevolution between 1989-91.

===Solidarity with Ireland and South Africa: 1977-1989===

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the RCG became heavily involved in support for the Irish national liberation struggle, working with the Prisoners Aid Committee, Sinn Féin and the Troops Out Movement (TOM), and focusing particularly on support for Irish republican prisoners held in British prisons. The analysis which the RCG developed through this work, on the role of national liberation movements in opposing imperialism, laid the foundations for much of its later positions, and its relationship to the rest of the British left. Unlike many other left organisations, the RCG consistently argued that British troops had no progressive role to play in Ireland, and called for total support for the Republican movement in the struggle against British imperialism. Their involvement with the prisoner support groups established a tradition of outspoken support for prison struggles which has continued to the present, with a page of every issue of their newspaper dealing with prison conditions and struggles. In 1990, when prisoners at Strangeways (see 1990 Strangeways Prison riot) took over the prison in protest at conditions, the RCG was active together with other groups supporting them on the outside, and later published a book, &#x27;Strangeways: A Serious Disturbance&#x27;, largely written by prisoners and former prisoners.

During the 1980s, the RCG&#x27;s most notable activity was its participation in the non-stop picket of the South African embassy in London calling for the release of Nelson Mandela. This was organized by the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group, within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party, the Humanist Party and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by Norma Kitson, the wife of the South African Communist activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a South African prison for his work in the National High Command of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the military wing of the African National Congress.

City AA was eventually expelled by the national leadership of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, over differences centering on City Group&#x27;s insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain.

Another significant campaign during the 1980s was the Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign, against the deportation of one of the group&#x27;s members to Sri Lanka. This developed into a high-profile national campaign involving people from left-wing groups such as the RCG, local residents of Manchester, and extending to church leaders and Labour Party Members of Parliament.

=== Solidarity with Cuba and Palestine: 1990-present ===
In 1995 the RCG set up Rock Around the Blockade (RATB), a solidarity organisation with the Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning on issues such as the US economic blockade and the Cuban Five, and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period.

In 2001 three members were asked to leave or resign because of what were described as their reactionary ultra-left views. One example of the division was over the September 11th attacks in 2001, which the three people who left viewed as a victory against imperialism. They had previously alleged that the leadership was bureaucratic and failing to train the membership in Marxism-Leninism. The three left to form Communist Forum, often known by the name of their newsletter, &quot;Fightback&quot;. They have ceased to be active.

Following the start of the Palestinian second intifada in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun to picket Marks and Spencer in Manchester over their support for Israel, and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Newcastle, Stockton, Middlesbrough, Durham, Rochdale, Nottingham, Leicester, across London, Stratford and Brighton. Throughout this period the flagship store on Oxford Street in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis.

In 2005 and 2006, the RCG stepped up their work in solidarity with asylum seekers, supporting the setting up of UNITY, an asylum seekers&#x27; union, in Glasgow, and helping to establish Tyneside Community Action for Refugees (TCAR) in Newcastle and Gateshead and the North West Asylum Seekers Defence Group (NWASDG) in Manchester (for a selection of reports from this period see 1, 2).

===Opposition to government spending cuts===
In October 2010 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced cuts in state spending of £81bn, £11bn greater than the £70bn cuts which the preceding Labour government had said in autumn 2009 were necessary. There would be cuts in state benefits, central government departments and a 26% reduction in central government funding for local government. In its newspaper, the RCG said the ruling class &quot;has declared class war&quot;. The RCG adopted a slogan &quot;No cuts – full stop!&quot; It condemned Labour-run councils implementing the cuts. It described Labour councillors voting for such cuts as &quot;class enemies&quot;, opposing any alliance with them against the coalition government. It criticised those on the left who sought unity at any price with such politicians.

As a part of the government cuts, the coalition announced plans to simultaneously cut much university funding and dramatically increase the tuition fees charged to students. This move led to widespread student protests taking place in November and December 2010, during which demonstrators occupied the central Jeremy Bentham Room in University College London (UCL) for several weeks. The protesting UCL students (some of whom were RCG members or supporters) organised a panel discussion to be held during which representatives from several leftist organisations (including the RCG&#x27;s David Yaffe as well as figures from the Green Party of England and Wales, Socialist Appeal and Workers Power) discussed the reforms then being made by the government and university authorities to higher education in Britain.

===Allegation of sexual harassment (2017)===

In October 2017 the RCG posted on their website &quot;The Revolutionary Communist Group is aware of a historic allegation of sexual harassment by a member of the organisation. The RCG views such allegations with utmost seriousness. The comrade involved has been suspended from membership and will remain suspended until an internal enquiry completes an investigation into the matter and reports with recommendations on further action&quot;. At the end of that year in December, the RCG updated on their website &quot;Following an investigation and a period of suspension, the comrade has been reinstated as of 1 January 2018. The comrade understands that his actions were unacceptable for a communist and a member of the RCG. Through the process we have undertaken, his consciousness and behaviour has changed, and continues to change to the extent that we have decided he can now be readmitted as a full member. The RCG takes seriously the sexism, discrimination and exploitation women face and is committed to building an organisation that opposes all such oppression.&quot;

== Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism! newspaper ==

The newspaper of the Revolutionary Communist Group, &quot;Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!&quot; (FRFI) commemorated 25 years of publication with issue Number 182 December 2004/January 2005. The paper is still published every two months and by December 2021 will have been continuously published for 41 years.

Commenting on the reason for the paper&#x27;s title, David Yaffe has stated that it was chosen because it was in &quot;itself a political statement. It declares that fighting racism and imperialism must be at the heart of any socialist movement in imperialist Britain.&quot;

<text>Franz Klammer (born 3 December 1953) is a former champion alpine ski racer from Austria. He dominated the downhill event for four consecutive World Cup seasons (1975–78). He was the gold medalist at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, winning the downhill at Patscherkofel by a margin of 0.33 seconds with a time of 1:45.73. Klammer won 25 World Cup downhills, including four on the Hahnenkamm at Kitzbühel. He also holds the record for the most victories (four) on the full course at Kitzbühel.

==Background==
Klammer was born into a farming family in Mooswald, community Fresach, Carinthia; like many alpine farm boys, he skied to school each winter day. His home village did not have any ski lifts, so as a child he climbed up the pasture behind his house to ski downhill. Klammer started racing at the relatively late age of 14, competing in the winter whilst working on the family farm during the summer after he dropped out of school. He had a tough struggle to make the Austrian ski team, which traditionally was dominated by the states of Tyrol and Salzburg. He made his World Cup debut at the age of 19 in 1972 at the Val Gardena downhill: he finished ninth in the training run for the race, but could only manage 32nd place on race day due to nerves. He spent 13 seasons on the World Cup circuit, from December 1972 to March 1985.

Klammer has been married to his wife, Eva, since 1979: the couple met in 1975 when he was in Tunisia at a fitness camp with the Austrian ski team. They have two daughters, Sophie and Stephanie.

==Career==
Klammer first showed signs of promise in the second half of the 1973 World Cup season, finishing second in the St. Anton downhill behind Bernhard Russi of Switzerland, the reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill champion. Klammer, aged 19, followed this up with a third at St. Moritz and a third in the giant slalom at Mont Sainte-Anne (the only time he finished on the podium in a World Cup giant slalom in his career). The following season he finished second in the downhill standings behind Roland Collombin of Switzerland. Klammer beat Collombin and Russi at Schladming in December 1973 under terrible conditions, but Collombin bested him at Garmisch, Avoriaz and Wengen.

Klammer won every downhill in the 1975 season, except Megève, where one of his skis came off. Without this incident, he would have won the overall World Cup title in March 1975, due to a good slalom result two days earlier at Chamonix, which would have granted him at least a third place (15 points) for the AK-combined of slalom Chamonix / downhill Megève. In the Olympic test event at Patscherkofel at Innsbruck in January 1975, Klammer had defeated defending Olympic champion Bernhard Russi of Switzerland, the runner-up, by nearly a half-second.

Entering the 1976 Winter Olympics, the 22-year-old Klammer was the favourite to take the gold medal in the downhill at Innsbruck in his native Austria. He was the defending World Cup downhill champion and had won the three previous downhills in January at Wengen, Morzine and Kitzbühel, and also the previous year&#x27;s race on the same Patscherkofel course. Starting in 15th position, Klammer was the last of the top seeds and knew that Bernhard Russi had set a blistering pace to lead by over a half-second. Klammer took heavy risks on the treacherous piste, skied on the edge of disaster and won by 0.33 seconds to the delight of the Austrian fans. A dozen years earlier on the same course in 1964, Egon Zimmermann posted a 2:18.16 to win the gold medal. Klammer&#x27;s 1:45.73 was more than thirty-two seconds faster.

Although he dominated the downhill event in World Cup competition, the overall title remained elusive, because the technical specialists had two events in which to earn points (slalom and giant slalom), whereas a speed specialist had only one. The second speed event, the super-G, was not a World Cup event until December 1982, at the twilight of Klammer&#x27;s World Cup career.

At the end of the 1975 season, despite having won 8 of 9 downhills, he finished third for the overall World Cup title. The final event was a parallel slalom and Klammer lost in the first round. Italy&#x27;s Gustav Thöni defeated Sweden&#x27;s Ingemar Stenmark in the finals and won his fourth overall title in five years. Klammer finished fourth overall in 1976, third in 1977, and fifth in 1978.

Klammer won the World Cup downhill title five times: 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1983 – twice more than the next best downhiller. In the 1975 season he won 8 of 9 World Cup downhill races, including his first of three consecutive victories (1975–77) on the prestigious &quot;Streif&quot; on the Hahnenkamm at Kitzbühel. He won a fourth in 1984, at the age of 30.

After his fourth consecutive season title in downhill in 1978, he began a prolonged slump until the end of the 1981 season. He may have been affected by his brother&#x27;s spinal cord injury in a downhill race, as well as a change of ski supplier (from Fischer to Kneissl).

Unable to make the four-member Austrian downhill team for the 1980 Olympics, Klammer could not defend his Olympic title at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Rather than retire, he worked long and hard at a comeback. Finally in December 1981, after another ski change from Kneissl to Blizzard, he won at Val-d&#x27;Isère. The following season he regained the World Cup Downhill title, his fifth, followed by the 1984 victory at Kitzbuehel, his fourth on the Hahnenkamm. At the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo, (then Yugoslavia, now Bosnia), Klammer finished a disappointing tenth on a less-than-challenging course on Bjelašnica.

At his peak (Wengen 1976 to Wengen 1977), Klammer won ten consecutive downhills, including the pressure-laden win at the 1976 Olympics. He won 8 of 9 during the 1975 season and also won 19 of 23, 20 of 26 and 21 of 29 downhills. His career total is 26 downhill wins: 25 World Cup and 1 Olympic. These achievements mark him as one of the greatest downhill racers ever: Karl Schranz achieved 20 wins over an extended career while Klammer won 19 in less than three seasons.

In an interview with Austrian television in 2006, the 52-year-old Klammer was asked about his greatest achievement. He answered that although his gold medal at the Olympic Games in Innsbruck was generally regarded as his greatest career achievement, winning at Kitzbühel in 1984 meant something very special to him, considering that he had not won there for seven years.

His final World Cup race was in March 1985 at Aspen, Colorado. He retired from international competition at the age of 31.&lt;br&gt;Klammer finished with 26 World Cup victories, 45 podiums and 87 top ten finishes (71 downhill, 5 combined, 11 giant slalom).

==Motor racing==
Immediately after his retirement from alpine competition, Klammer took up motor racing, and was soon involved in touring car racing, driving Mercedes-Benz saloons all over Europe and racing professionally as far away as Australia. In 1990, he won a round of the prestigious European Touring Car Championship.

==Legacy==
Klammer was a hero to Austrian ski racing fans and also to fans the world over for doing a great deal to promote the popularity of alpine ski racing. He is known as &quot;The Kaiser&quot; and also as the &quot;Klammer Express&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with Graham Bell for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Klammer attributed his success to being the first downhiller to carve a whole turn from start to finish, contrasting his style with skiers of the previous generation such as Karl Schranz and Jean-Claude Killy who would skid at the start of a turn before engaging in a carve.

In an interview with Tom Brokaw that aired on NBC on 13 February 2010, as part of their 2010 Winter Olympics coverage, American Olympian Bode Miller cited Klammer&#x27;s style and approach to ski racing as a major source of inspiration for him.

Inspired by his younger brother Klaus, who was paralysed from the waist down after a crash in a downhill at the age of 16, Klammer has established the Franz Klammer Foundation, which benefits seriously injured athletes.

<text>Tiddlywinks is a game played on a flat felt mat with sets of small discs called winks, a pot, which is the target, and a collection of squidgers, which are also discs. Players use a squidger (nowadays made of plastic) to shoot a wink into flight by flicking the squidger across the top of a wink and then over its edge, thereby propelling it into the air. The offensive objective of the game is to score points by sending your own winks into the pot. The defensive objective of the game is to prevent your opponents from potting their winks by squopping them: shooting your own winks to land on top of your opponents&#x27; winks. As part of strategic gameplay, players often attempt to squop their opponents&#x27; winks and develop, maintain and break up large piles of winks.

Tiddlywinks is sometimes considered a simple-minded, frivolous children&#x27;s game, rather than a sophisticated strategic game. However, the modern competitive game of tiddlywinks made a strong comeback at the University of Cambridge in 1955. The modern game uses far more complex rules and a consistent set of high-grade equipment.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Tiddlywinks&quot; derives from British rhyming slang for an unlicensed public house or a small inn only licensed to sell beer and cider (tiddlywink, kiddlywink).&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=dFUJAAAAQAAJ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tiddly was slang for an alcoholic drink. It may be related to &quot;pillywinks&quot;.

== Rules ==

Tiddlywinks is a competitive game involving four colours of winks. Each player controls the winks of a colour, the colours being blue, green, red and yellow. Red and blue are always partners against green and yellow. There are six winks of each colour, which begin the game in the corners of a felt mat measuring 6 feet by 3 feet. This mat is ordinarily placed on a table, and a pot is placed at its centre. There are two primary methods of play with the four colours of winks: a pairs game, and a singles game. The pairs game involves four players, playing in partnerships, with each winker playing a single colour. The singles game involves a single winker playing against another single winker, each playing two colours of winks in alternation.

The players take turns, and there are two basic aims: to cover (or &quot;squop&quot;) opponent winks, and to get one&#x27;s own winks into the pot. As in pool or snooker, if a player pots a wink of their own colour, they are entitled to an extra shot, and this enables a skilled player to pot all of their winks in one turn. The point of squopping, which is the key element distinguishing the modern competitive game from the child&#x27;s game (though recognized in even the earliest rules from 1890), is that a wink that is covered (even partially) may not be played by its owner. The wink on top may be played, though, and sophisticated play involves shots manipulating large piles of winks.

The game ends in one of two ways: either all the winks of one colour are potted (a &quot;pot-out&quot;), or play continues up to a specified time limit (usually 25 minutes), after which each colour has a further five turns. Then a scoring system is used to rank the players, based on the numbers of potted and unsquopped winks of each colour.

== Strategy ==
The important appeal of the game for many players is the required combination of manual dexterity and strategic thought as well as tactics. Tiddlywinkers often claim that the game combines physical skill (such as in snooker or golf) with the strategy of chess. Tiddlywinks is unique in the combination of skill and strategy it requires. Strategy in tiddlywinks is often rather deep, since winks can be captured by squopping (covering) them. Strategic and tactical planning involves anticipating opponents&#x27; moves rather than just building a sequence of one&#x27;s own moves. Another factor that complicates the game is that there is a time limit to the play of the game; it does not merely run until some objective in the game has been met.

All in all, tiddlywinks goes beyond the purely cerebral nature of a game such as chess. The fact that shots can be made or missed, together with the continuum of possible outcomes, makes strategy much less rigid than in chess, and prevents planning more than seven or eight shots in advance.

== Equipment ==

The winks and pot used in competitive play are standard, and are supplied by the English Tiddlywinks Association. The pots are made of moulded plastic (historically always red), with specified diameters at the top and the base, and specified height. The winks are made to specified measurements, and are made by slicing an extruded cylinder rather than by moulding, and then smoothing them in a tumbler. Although this leads to some minor variation in thickness, it produces a much smoother edge to the wink than that seen on cheap moulded winks.

The mats are made of thick felt. Mats obtained from different suppliers have different characteristics, and part of the skill of a tournament player is to adjust to different mats.

Squidgers are custom-made by their owners or purchased from squidger makers. A player may use as many as they like, selecting an appropriate squidger for each shot. Top players may carry up to twenty different squidgers, but will not typically use all of them in one game. The rules governing squidgers permit a range of dimensions, and the material is not specified, except for the condition that squidgers must not damage either the winks or the mat. Modern squidgers are predominantly made from different types of plastic, though antique ones were made from bone, vegetable ivory, and other materials. Squidgers are usually filed or sanded to form a sharp edge and then polished.

== Terminology ==
Selected terms used in the game include:

Blitz: an attempt to pot all six winks of a given player&#x27;s colour early in the game

Bomb: to send a wink at a pile, usually from distance, in the hope of significantly disturbing it

Boondock: to free a squopped wink by sending it a long way away, leaving the squopping wink free in the battle area

Bristol: a shot which moves a pile of two or more winks as a single unit; the shot is played by holding the squidger at a right angle to its normal plane

Carnovsky (US)/Penhaligon (UK): potting a wink from the baseline (i.e., from 3 feet away)

Cracker (UK): a simultaneous knock-off and squop, i.e. a shot which knocks one wink off the top of another while simultaneously squopping it

Crud (UK): a forceful shot whose purpose is to destroy a pile completely

Good shot: named after John Good. The shot consists of playing a flat wink (one not involved in a pile) through a nearby pile with the intent of destroying the pile

Gromp: an attempt to jump a pile onto another wink (usually with the squidger held in a conventional rather than a Bristol fashion)

John Lennon memorial shot: a simultaneous boondock and squop

Lunch: to pot a squopped wink (usually belonging to an opponent)

Scrunge (UK): to bounce out of the pot

Squidger: the disc used to shoot a wink

Squop: to play a wink so that it comes to rest above another wink

Sub: to play a wink so that it (unintentionally) ends up under another wink

Tiddlies: points calculated when determining the finishing placement of winkers in a tiddlywinks game

== History ==

===Nineteenth century===

The game began as a parlour game in Victorian England. Bank clerk Joseph Assheton Fincher (1863–1900) filed the original patent application for the game in 1888 and applied for the trademark &quot;Tiddledy-Winks&quot; in 1889. John Jaques and Son were the exclusive distributors of the game named Tiddledy-Winks.

However, competition was quite fierce, and for several years starting in 1888 other game publishers came out with their own versions of the game using other names, including Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter, and many others. It became one of the most popular crazes during the 1890s, played by adults and children alike.

Throughout its history, many different varieties were produced to meet the marketplace demands, including those combining tiddledy-winks principles with tennis, basketball, baseball, croquet, cricket, football, golf, and other popular sports and endeavours. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the public perception of the game changed.

=== Competition organisations ===
There are two national associations, the English Tiddlywinks Association (ETwA) and the North American Tiddlywinks Association (NATwA), (the Scottish Tiddlywinks Association having disbanded in the late 1990s). These organisations are responsible for conducting tournaments and maintaining the rules of the game. International competition is overseen by the International Federation of Tiddlywinks Associations (IFTwA), founded on 16 June 1963 though in practice it is rarely called upon to intervene.

Although tiddlywinks nowadays is a singles or pairs game, competition in the 1950s until the 2000s centred on team competition, with teams consisting of several (two to four) pairs. There were a number of university teams, and international matches were also played. More recently, singles and pairs tournaments have come to be the focus of competitive tiddlywinks, with only a few team matches being played each year. The four most prestigious tournaments are the National Singles and National Pairs tournaments held in England and the United States. The World Singles and World Pairs championships operate on a challenge basis; anyone winning a national tournament (or being the highest-placed home player behind a foreign winner) is entitled to challenge the current champion.

There are several other less prestigious tournaments in England and the United States throughout the year, often with a format designed to encourage inexperienced players. The results of tournaments and world championship matches are used to calculate Tiddlywinks Ratings, which give a ranking of players.

===1950s===
The birth of the modern game can be traced to a group of Cambridge University undergraduates meeting in Christ&#x27;s College on 16 January 1955. Their aim was to devise a sport at which they could represent the university. Within three years the Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society was formed; although the two universities had been playing matches since 1946. In 1957, an article appeared in &quot;The Spectator&quot; entitled &quot;Does Prince Philip cheat at tiddlywinks?&quot; Sensing a good publicity opportunity the Cambridge University Tiddlywinks Club (CUTwC) challenged Prince Philip (later to become Chancellor of the university in 1976) to a tiddlywinks match to defend his honour. The Duke of Edinburgh appointed The Goons as his Royal champions. The Duke presented a trophy, the Silver Wink, designed and made by Robert Welch for the British Universities Championship.

The English Tiddlywinks Association (ETwA) was founded on 12 June 1958 with the Reverend Edgar &quot;Eggs&quot; Ambrose Willis as its first Secretary-General.

===1960s===

During the 1960s as many as 37 universities were playing the game in Great Britain.

In 1962, the Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society (OUTS) toured the United States for several weeks under the sponsorship of Guinness. They were undefeated against various hastily-formed teams such as a group of Madison Avenue executives, the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair &quot;All-Stars&quot;, and a group of Harvard students. A match against the New York Giants was scheduled but the football players backed out at the last moment. A very prominent article appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine on 14 December 1962 with coverage of the Harvard team. Harvard&#x27;s Gargoyle Undergraduate Tiddlywinks Society (GUTS) dominated winks in this era. In the next few years, Harvard and other colleges continued to play, though at a low ebb. From 1962 to 1966, tiddlywinks play in the United States was governed by the National Undergraduate Tiddlywinks Association (NUTS).

The North American Tiddlywinks Association (NATwA) was formed on 27 February 1966, replacing NUTS, with founders from both American (Harvard University and Harvard Medical School) and Canadian (University of Waterloo and Waterloo Lutheran University) teams.

In the meantime, in the fall of 1965, Severin Drix started a team at Cornell, and challenged his friend Ferd Wulkan of MIT to start a tiddlywinks team. MIT and Cornell played in NATwA&#x27;s tiddlywinks tournaments starting in February 1967, and became dominant. The Harvard and Waterloo teams disappeared from the scene by 1968. The game took particularly strong root at MIT, and the early development of most American players can still be traced to MIT today.

While the basic elements of the modern strategic game were devised by CUTwC in its early years, the rules have continued to be modified under the auspices of the various national tiddlywinks associations. ETwA coordinated the game throughout the boom period of the 1960s when winks flourished. A decline in interest within the UK in 1969–1970 led to the establishment of the three national competitions which have been contested to date, namely the National Singles, National Pairs, and the Teams of Four. There are also annual Open Competitions, notably in Oxford, Cambridge and London.

===1970s===
The first serious trans-Atlantic contact was established in 1972, when a team from MIT including Dave Lockwood toured the UK. The success of the Americans shocked complacent Britons. Competition started at the highest level, the World Singles, in 1973. A challenge system was agreed between ETwA and NATwA. The supreme ruling body in world contests is the International Federation of Tiddlywinks Associations (IFTwA). To challenge at the world level, a player must win one of the national titles, or finish as the highest placed home player behind a foreign winner. There have been over 65 World Singles contests to date. The Americans dominated all the early matches, and it was not until the 22nd contest that a Briton won for the first time. Since then the top Britons and Americans have been closely matched. After the establishment of the World Singles, a World Pairs event followed, and there have since been over 40 World Pairs contests. International matches have been played since 1972.

===Twenty-first century===
During its history, winks has enjoyed variable levels of interest. The game has never taken a strong hold outside the UK and North America. The focus of British tiddlywinks is still at Cambridge, and CUTwC&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations in 2005 were well attended. The Oxford University Tiddlywinks Society has recently fallen out of existence. Despite this there has recently been some resurgence in the game, with new clubs having been formed recently in the University of York and in Shrewsbury School.

In America, there has been a tradition of tiddlywinks in Washington D.C., Boston, Eastern Ohio, and Ithaca, New York. There was a renewal of winks in 2007 through the MIT Tiddlywinks Association. National competitions are well attended, with a group of enthusiastic young players joining the stock of veteran players who have proved themselves at the highest level in world competition. In the US, the game had a firm footing in certain high schools, since the children of many of the players who took up the game in the late 1960s and early 1970s played when they were in high school. These players are now looking to revive university tiddlywinks in the United States.

On 1 March 2008, there was a Royal Match in Cambridge to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the original Royal Match played against The Goons in 1958 (see above). CUTwC players took on HRH Prince Philip&#x27;s Royal Champions, the Savage Club, with members of the original 1958 CUTwC team in attendance. Cambridge repeated their victory from 1958 by winning the match 24–18.

Since 2000, the World Singles championship has been dominated by Larry Kahn and Patrick Barrie, with each player having won seven matches (as of December 2019).

<text>Indiana Dunes National Park is a national park of the United States located in northwestern Indiana managed by the National Park Service. It was authorized by Congress in 1966 as the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and was redesignated as the nation&#x27;s 61st national park on February 15, 2019. The park runs for about along the southern shore of Lake Michigan and covers . Along the lakefront, the eastern area is roughly the lake shore south to U.S. 12 or U.S. 20 between Michigan City, Indiana, on the east and the Cleveland-Cliffs steel plant on the west. This area&#x27;s conservation scheme is enhanced by the older Indiana Dunes State Park. To the west of the steel plant lies West Beach and a small extension south of the steel mill continues west along Salt Creek to Indiana 249. The western area is roughly the shoreline south to U.S. 12 between the Burns Ditch west to Broadway in downtown Gary, Indiana. In addition, there are several outlying areas, including Pinhook Bog, in LaPorte County to the east; the Heron Rookery in Porter County, the center of the park; and the Hoosier Prairie State Nature Preserve and the Hobart Prairie Grove, both in Lake County, the western end of the park.

==History==


There is little evidence of permanent Native American communities forming during the earlier years; rather, the evidence suggests that seasonal hunting camps were the norm. The earliest evidence for permanent camps was the occupation of the Ohio valley by the Hopewell culture. Five groups of mounds have been documented in the dunes area. These mounds are consistent with the period of 200 BCE (Goodall Focus) to 800 CE (early Mississippian), though even that was a short lived permanency. Beginning in the 1500s, European exploration and trade introduced more changes to the human environment. Tribal animosities and traditional European competition affected tribal relations. Entire populations began moving westward, while others sought to dominate large geographic trading areas. Once again, the dunes became a middle point on a journey from the east or the west. It continued to remain a key hunting ground for villages over a wide area.

It wasn&#x27;t until the 19th century that native villages once again were scattered through the area, but this was soon followed by European settlement. Joseph Bailly was the earliest recorded settler in the dunes. He moved here from trading villages around Niles, Michigan. Settling along the Calumet River. Soon he was joined by a series of other settlers and the communities in the dunes began to develop. They included Chesterton, Porter, Tremont, and the Town of the Pines. These pioneer communities grew and expanded.

City West was one of several &quot;ghost towns&quot; situated in the dunes. Planned as a rival to Chicago, it was partly built in 1837 but failed that summer, during a national economic panic. The remains of the town, partly carted off to be used as lumber, were located near where the pavilion in the state park now stands, until a forest fire in the 1850s destroyed whatever was left. Today, most of the coastline has been settled for use as homes, factories, and businesses, with some areas reserved for public parks.

===Preserving the dunes and National Lakeshore===
 Triggered by a publication on the unique flora of the dunes in the 1899 &quot;Botanical Gazette&quot; by University of Chicago botanist Henry Chandler Cowles, a movement began to preserve the dunes habitat. In 1916, the visionary National Parks Director Stephen Mather held hearings in Chicago on a &quot;Sand Dunes National Park&quot;. Another factor leading to the desire to preserve the dunes was the disappearance of the Hoosier Slide, a particularly large dune along this shore. The sand from this dune was found to be ideal for glass manufacture, and much of this sand was transported to the Ball Brothers and Hemingray Glass Co. plants in Muncie, producing the well-known &#x27;Ball Blue&#x27; canning jars and &#x27;Hemingray Blue&#x27; insulators. The Hoosier Slide was completely consumed by 1920, and a power plant sits on the site today. In 1926, the Indiana Dunes State Park opened. In the 1950s, a desire to maximize economic development through a &quot;Port of Indiana&quot; spurred interest in preservation. The Save the Dunes Council, including its president Dorothy Richardson Buell and activist Hazel Hannell, began a nationwide campaign to buy the land. Their first success was the purchase of in Porter County, the Cowles Tamarack Bog. The &quot;Kennedy Compromise&quot; entailed the creation of a national lakeshore and a port. Illinois Senator Paul H. Douglas led the Congressional effort to save the dunes. In late 1966, the bill passed and the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore became a reality. Four subsequent expansion bills for the park (1976, 1980, 1986, and 1992) have increased the size of the park to more than .

===Redesignation as National Park===
A bill to reclassify Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as Indiana Dunes National Park was sponsored by Representative Pete Visclosky and Senators Todd Young and Mike Braun and previously by Senator Joe Donnelly, who wanted to bring the site more recognition. Deputy Director of the National Park Service Paul Daniel Smith testified that the Service opposed the redesignation because it would be inconsistent with the Service&#x27;s naming conventions and the Indiana Dunes have more in common with other national lakeshores and seashores than national parks, which are typically much larger.

H.R. 1488 originally passed in the House of Representatives on November 1, 2017, but it did not receive a vote in the Senate during the 115th Congress. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 included the bill as a provision and was signed by President Donald Trump on February 15, creating the country&#x27;s 61st National Park and the first in Indiana.

==Geography==
The creeks and rivers of the national park include:
* Dunes Creek is a northwards-flowing stream which drains the flows northward, receiving first the Great Marsh tributary from the east and then the West Branch tributary which drains Cowles Bog. Dunes Creek passes through the coastal sand dunes to empty into Lake Michigan.
* East Arm Little Calumet River, also known as the &quot;East Branch Little Calumet River&quot;, is a portion of the Little Calumet River that begins just east of Holmesville, Indiana, in New Durham Township in LaPorte County and flows west to Porter County where it is diverted to the Port of Indiana-Burns Waterway and Lake Michigan.
* Salt Creek is a tributary of the East Arm Little Calumet River that begins south of Valparaiso in Porter County, Indiana, and flows north until it joins the East Arm Little Calumet River just before it exits to Lake Michigan via the Port of Indiana-Burns Waterway.
* Trail Creek is a north- by northwest-flowing stream whose main stem begins at the confluence of the West Branch Trail Creek and the East Branch Trail Creek in LaPorte County, Indiana, and flows through the Michigan City harbor into Lake Michigan.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, Indiana Dunes National Park has a hot summer Humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the plant hardiness zone at Indiana Dunes National Park at 614 ft (187 m) is 6a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −9.4 °F (−23.0 °C).

The primary feature of Indiana Dunes National Park is Lake Michigan. The lake brings with it several weather-related conditions that can create threats to the enjoyment of the area.
* Winter: Winter months bring the risk of shelf ice. This is a condition where the winter winds push ice from Lake Michigan onto the beaches. As the cold depends, the ice can build up into long ridges creating an arctic dunescape. Much of this ice is floating. It may be dangerous to walk on the ice as there can be air pockets into which you can sink. Rescue is extremely difficult.
* Summer: During the summer months, rip currents can occur in Lake Michigan. These occur suddenly and can sweep swimmers far out into the lake. Rip currents are most prevalent on days with a strong north wind. Rip currents are created when masses of water are pushed against the shoreline by a north wind. The mass of water becomes trapped between the beach and the first sandbar. As the wind continues, the volume of water increases until weight of incoming water and the mass of the sandbar are unable push back the growing volume of water behind the sandbar. Then, the trapped water creates a narrow channel through the sandbar. The water rushes back into the lake forming a river in the lake. Anything or anyone in the current is taken out into the lake.

==Geology==
The Lake Michigan Basin was formed during the Wisconsin Glacial Period. The Michigan Lobe of the continental glacier began its retreat northward over 20,000 years before present (YBP) forming the southern shore of the Lake Michigan Basin.

The Valparaiso Moraine is the dominant geologic form that created the various landscape forms of the Indiana Dunes about 40,000 YBP. Within the arc created by the Valparaiso Moraine are the two younger recessional moraines of the Tinley Moraine and the Lake Border Moraine. Each moraine created a dam across the southern outflow of the melt waters of the receding glaciers. As each glacial lake breached a low spot in the moraines, water levels receded, leaving a series of shorelines and dune ridges.

The Calumet Shoreline is the oldest visible shoreline of Lake Michigan. It is a visible sand ridge along Ridge Road through Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana. Two older shorelines, the Tolleston and the Glenwood Shoreline are much harder to identify and further south in those counties.

During the periods of glacial retreat, there were periods of stability. During these times, glacial lakes formed along the southern borders of the glaciers, bound into the Lake Michigan Basin by the recessional moraines. Four major glacial lake periods created the Indiana Dunes. They are the glacial Lake Chicago (14,000 YBP), glacial Lake Algonquin (9,000 YBP), glacial Lake Chippewa (7,000 YBP), and the Nipissing Great Lakes stage (4,000 YBP). Once the glaciers had fully retreated from the Lake Michigan basin, after the Lake Nipissing stage, the same factors that created the dunes south of the current shoreline, expanded the existing shoreline. The littoral currents or Longshore drift transport sand southward along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. As they encounter streams bringing water from inland, sandbars are created, pointing down current, either southward if the shore is north to south or westward along the southern shore itself. If the currents were strong enough, as they were when the Glenwood Shoreline was created, shallow inland bays would be formed with a wide sand spit between each bay and the open lake. Over time, the sand spits would merge with the far shoreline, forming interdunal ponds. Each sand spit would become a dune ridge. As the ponds filled in and wind built the outer sand ridges higher, the ponds would dry up and only a stream would remain, as with the Little Calumet River today, just south of the state and national parks. As the shoreline moved northward, new ridges formed along with additional streams, now slower and less powerful, and the process duplicated itself. To the west of the Indiana Dunes, Wolf Lake in Hammond, Indiana, forms a western border to the dunes. Here the same process is at work, only the littoral drift is again south, but along the western shore, pushing the sand and sand spits eastward. Today, it is the remnants of the marsh lands and inter-dunal or inter-sand spit lakes that have formed this region over 40,000 years.

==Flora and fauna==
The park is in the central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion.

According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Indiana Dunes National Park has an Oak/Hickory (&quot;100&quot;) potential vegetation type and an Eastern Hardwood forest, aka Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest (&quot;26&quot;) potential vegetation form.

===Rare, threatened, and endangered species===
The park includes habitats for several rare plants and animals. The park has more than 1,400 species of vascular plants, ranking it 8th in total plant species among all units of the National Park System. At least two plant species are on the Federal list of Threatened and Endangered Species:

* Mead&#x27;s milkweed (&quot;Asclepias meadii&quot;)
* Pitcher&#x27;s thistle (&quot;Cirsium pitcheri&quot;)

Several others are on the list of state T&amp;E species. Populations of each plant group are estimated to be around 100–120 individual plants. The species included are:

* White baneberry (&quot;Actaea pachypoda&quot;)
* Virginia snake root (&quot;Aristolochia serpentaria&quot;)
* Shooting star (&quot;Dodecatheon meadia&quot;)
* American columbo (&quot;Frasera caroliniensis&quot;)
* Pink corydalis (&quot;Corydalis sempervirens&quot;)

Among the federally threatened and endangered wildlife are:

* Indiana bat (&quot;Myotis sodalis&quot;)
* Eastern massasauga rattlesnake (&quot;Sistrurus catenatus catenatus&quot;)
* Rufa Red knot (&quot;Calidris canutus rufa&quot;)
* Piping plover (&quot;Charadrius melodus&quot;)
In addition, the park has habitat suitable for the bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;).

===Species count===


===Wildlife===
Indiana Dunes National Park is host to wide variety of wildlife, including white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoons, opossums, cottontail rabbits, various rodents, Canada geese, gulls, squirrels, hawks, turkey vultures, mallards, great blue herons, songbirds, and garter snakes. Recent records, documented photographically, indicate that North American river otter (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;) and bobcat (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) began returning to the area in 2011 and 2018, respectively. As of 2023, the Indiana Audubon have observed nearly 370 bird species living in or migrating through the Indiana Dunes.

===Flowering plants===
Indiana Dunes has over 369 species of flowering plants. Of these, thirteen are considered threatened or in danger of extinction. Additionally, there four invasive flowering plants on the list. Some of the most common spring flowers include the May apple, buttercups (six varieties), and violets (14 varieties). Summer brings out the orchids (five varieties) and much goldenrod (11 varieties).

===Invasive plants===
Invasive plants are those introduced species that dominate a landscape pushing out traditionally native species and others species by their ability to multiply rapidly. There are 54 such species in the dunes.

===Unusual sightings===
In October 1920, a rare Arctic three-toed woodpecker was captured a mile west of Dune Park Station. Later that month another male was captured east of Dune Park Station. One was busy digging out grubs and the other was nervously flying from tree to tree.

In May 1919, a clay-colored sparrow was found near Dune Park. It was a part of a larger flock of Harris&#x27;s sparrow migrating along the western shore of Lake Michigan.

===Extirpated species===
Several species of plants and animals have disappeared from the dunes. Few can be clearly identified. Among those species thought to be gone are listed below:

===Exotic and invasive species===

Alien or exotic species are plants and animals which are not native to the area. These plants can be classified as &quot;Invasive&quot; if they rapidly replace other plants and animals in the ecosystem, creating a monoculture and threatening the extinction of the traditional plants and animals. Among plants found in the park, the following are considered to be &quot;exotic&quot;. Those marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; are listed as &quot;invasive.&quot;
* Yarrow, (&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;)
* Tree of heaven, (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;)*
* Garlic mustard, (&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;)*
* Japanese barberry, (&quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot;)*
* Oriental bittersweet, (&quot;Celastrus orbiculatus&quot;)*
* Ox-eye daisy, (&quot;Chrysanthemum leucanthemum pinnatifidum&quot;)
* Field thistle, (&quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;)*
* Common day-flower, (&quot;Commelina communis&quot;)
* Queen Anne&#x27;s lace, (&quot;Daucus carota&quot;)
* Autumn olive, (&quot;Elaeagnus umbellata&quot;)*
* Creeping Charlie, (&quot;Glechoma hederacea&quot;)*
* Yellow downy bush honeysuckle, (&quot;Lonicera × muendeniensis&quot;)
* Bush honeysuckle, (&quot;Lonicera tatarica&quot;)*

* English plantain, (&quot;Plantago lanceolata&quot;)
* Japanese knotweed, (&quot;Reynoutria japonica&quot;, syn. &quot;Polygonum cuspidatum&quot;)*
* Sulphur cinquefoil, (&quot;Potentilla recta&quot;)
* All-heal, (&quot;Prunella spp.&quot;)
* Apple, (&quot;Pyrus malus&quot;)
* Black locust, (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;)*
* Northern catalpa, (&quot;Catalpa speciosa&quot;)*
===BioBlitz===
On May 15 and 16, 2009, the park hosted an All Taxa Biological Diversity survey. In a 24-hour period, as part of the BioBlitz 2,000 students and thousands of additional volunteers surveyed the park for every available living species. John Francis, vice president of research, conservation and exploration for the National Geographic Society, stated that 890 species had been inventoried. The tally at the close of the 24 hours was 890 species, including 26 amphibians and reptiles, 101 birds, 18 fish, 27 fungi, 11 mammals, 410 plants, and 178 insects. The tally had risen to 1,200 unique species by June 1.

==Natural areas==
===Calumet Prairie===
Calumet Prairie is a joint venture between the National Park Service and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. The Calumet Prairie State Nature Preserve in the northern portion of the land between Interstate 90 to the north and the Little Calumet River on the south. The National Park owns the southern half of this plot.

===Cowles Bog===

Cowles Bog, a National Natural Landmark, is a wetland complex containing bog, fen, marsh, swamp, wet meadow, and pond habitats; named in honor of biologist and ecologist Henry Chandler Cowles. Located south and west of Dune Acres, Indiana, Cowles Bog is the sole remnant of the &quot;Central Dunes&quot; where Cowles performed his pioneering field studies of ecological succession and species diversity. The complex is drained by Dunes Creek, which flows to Lake Michigan at the Indiana Dunes State Park swimming beach. A National Park trail runs from Mineral Springs Road into Cowles Bog.

===Great Marsh===
The Great Marsh is an interdunal wetland just south of the dune ridge overlooking Lake Michigan. It stretches from steel plants in Burns Harbor, east to County Line Road on the edge of Michigan City. A century ago, it was the nesting and migratory layover for many birds which depended on its variety of plants. In the late 19th century, the marsh was drained through a series of ditches, creating three watersheds and reducing the water table. As the water levels changed, new plants and trees moved in, creating a new habitat and displacing the wildlife that was dependent on the pre-existing wetlands.

* Native plants &amp; animals
** Coots
** Mallards
** Wood ducks
** Kingfishers
** Tree swallows
** Rusty blackbirds
** Green herons
** Beaver
** sedges

* Invasive plants
** Common reed
** Hybrid cattail
** Reed canary grass
** Green ash
** Cottonwood
** Silver maple

* &quot;Restoration&quot;
Beginning in 1998, the national lakeshore began restoration of the marsh by closing Derby Ditch and restoring . The work consists of:
** Plugging culverts
** Filling ditches
** Creating levees with spillways
** Planting native plants, either as seed or small sprouts
** Removing non-native plants and trees

===Heron Rookery===
The heron rookery is located along the East Arm Little Calumet River in the northeast corner of Porter County. The rookery is physically separated from the main part of the park. It is accessible from County Road 600 East, south of County Road 1400 North. The rookery is a hardwood forest. The great blue heron nests for which the site is named are no longer a feature of the area. Spring brings out a variety of wildflowers.

===Hobart Prairie Grove===
Hobart Prairie Grove is an area of forested ravines along the west shore of Lake George. The Hobart Prairie Grove preserves several habitats including wetlands, prairie remnants, white oak flatlands, and a rare bur oak savanna. At about , the grove contains 343 native plants and a variety of birds and animals. The unique soil is at least 70 percent silt and clay with some sand. The soil supports a diversity of life. The Hobart Woodland trail is a walk to an overlook on Lake George from the Oak Savannah rail trail. The Oak Savannah rail trail runs from North Hobart Road, Hobart to South Colfax Street, Griffith. Of the trails length, are through the Hobart Prairie Grove. The trail follows the old Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railroad route and connects with the Prairie Duneland rail trail, continuing east to Chesterton.

===Hoosier Prairie===
Hoosier Prairie, a National Natural Landmark, is a tallgrass prairie adjacent to Griffith, Indiana. It is a geographically isolated unit of the park, owned and maintained by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources as a state nature preserve. Some 574 species of plants have been observed growing in this patch of prairie.

===Miller Woods===
Miller Woods is located in Miller Beach, Indiana. It is accessed through the Paul H. Douglas Center for Environmental Education on Lake Street. The area is dominated by ridge and swale topography. the ridges or swells are beach and dune sand. They date from the post Glacial Lake Nipissing period some 3000 years before present. The swales are the depressions between the ridges. They are generally either ponds or marshes.

===Mnoké Prairie===

Mnoké Prairie is an active prairie restoration along Beam Street in the central portion of the park. The prairie&#x27;s name was suggested by Potawatomi elders; &quot;mno&quot; means good, &quot;ké&quot; means earth. It is pronounced &quot;mno-ca&quot; (the second syllable is like the word &quot;cat&quot; without the &quot;t&quot;.) The Little Calumet River Trail provides access through the prairie. It is accessible from the Mnoké Prairie parking lot on Beam Street.

===Mount Baldy===
Mount Baldy is a sand dune located at the east end of the park. At tall, it is one of the tallest sand dunes on the southern shore of Lake Michigan. It is a wandering dune that moves an average of every year, and so is called a &quot;living dune&quot;. Mount Baldy is accessible from U.S. Route 12 (also known as Dunes Highway) between the Town of Pines and the western border of Michigan City. Visitors were formerly allowed to hike up the dune. , much of the dune itself, including the summit, was closed to allow beach grasses and other native plants to regenerate, and prevent injuries to visitors. An alternative trail leading to the beach takes visitors directly past the dune, cresting just slightly lower than the summit itself. On a clear day, there are views of Lake Michigan, Chicago&#x27;s skyline, and south shore, from this point.

===Pinhook Bog===

Pinhook Bog, a National Natural Landmark, is a geographically isolated unit of the national park. The quaking peat bog is located near U.S. Route 421 approximately south of Michigan City. The bog formed from a postglacial kettle moraine left behind about 14,000 years before the present by the melting of the ice sheet during the end of the last glacial period. The acidic bog is noted for pitcher plants and other wetland species. Access to the bog is restricted to ranger-led guided tours.

==Historic areas==
===Bailly Homestead===

This is the location of the pioneer trading post established in 1822 by fur trade pioneer Joseph Bailly. Bailly settled here and his last home, adapted from his 1830s retirement house, survives. The Homestead was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1962.

===Chellberg Farm===

The real estate became the home of the Chellberg family, who built a farm on its sandy soil. , the park maintains a heritage farm on the Chellberg land, with the Bailly family cemetery on the northern edge of the property.

===Bailly Cemetery===

The Bailly Cemetery is located half a mile north of the homestead. Its location is a sandy bluff, which once looked out across the dunes to Lake Michigan. Today, the forest covers the dunes and the lake is not visible. Numerous changes have occurred since the first burial in 1827.

Joseph Bailly buried his only son by Marie in the fall of 1827 on a sandy knoll. He erected an oak cross on the site and a three-sided shelter. After 1866, the Bailly area was no longer the quiet place that it had been. Other families now lived in the area and some had been using the cemetery for their families as well. However, late in 1866, Rose Howe (granddaughter of Joseph Bailly) had the family plots fenced and requested that those other families remove their deceased to other cemeteries. In 1879, she had the entire cemetery walled in and an iron gate installed to the north.

Finally in 1914, Rose Howe took one further step to protect the cemetery of her family. She had the area inside the wall filled with sand. Stone steps replaced the gate to a contemplative walk atop the cemetery. An oaken cross was raised atop this new ground, continuing the tradition started by her grandfather. Rose Howe died in 1916, while in California. She was returned to Indiana in 1917 and was the last burial in the family cemetery.

===Century of Progress Architectural District===

The Century of Progress Architectural District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the east portion of the park. The district consists of a total of five buildings, all from the Homes of Tomorrow Exhibition during the 1933 Century of Progress World&#x27;s Fair which took place in Chicago.

===Good Fellow Club Youth Camp===
Created by the Good Fellow Club of U.S. Steel in 1941, the camp served the children of Gary, until 1977. It provided outdoor recreation and a chance to leave the city behind for a week or more. The camp used tent cabins with a central restroom and shower house. Atop a rise was the main lodge where meals were provided and a trading post with a bowling alley were maintained.

===Lustron Homes===

The national park acquired three Lustron houses during its land acquisition process. The Jacob Klien House was located in an endangered habitat. It was moved to the east side of Drake Avenue in Beverly Shores and placed atop a dune overlooking the lake. The Schulof house located on Lakefront Drive was transferred to the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana for preservation and was moved to Stephens Street in Porter. The Powell house remains inaccessible within the park on Lakefront Drive.

===Swedish Farmsteads Historic District (pending)===

The Swedish Farmsteads of Porter County, Indiana, are representative of the numerous rural communities settled by a significant ethnic population. They influenced the religious community and social community. Swedish immigration was at its highest from 1840 until 1920. At its height in 1910, it was estimated that 1 out of every 5 Swedes was living in the United States.

==Recreation==
The park contains of beaches, as well as sand dunes, bogs, marshes, swamps, fens, prairies, rivers, oak savannas, and woodland forests. The park is also noted for its singing sands. More than 350 species of birds have been observed in the park. It has one of the most diverse plant communities of any unit in the U.S. National Park System with 1418 vascular plant species including 90 threatened or endangered ones. The Indiana Dunes area is unique in that it contains both Arctic and boreal plants (such as the bearberry) alongside desert plants (such as the prickly pear cactus).

First-time visitors to the park often go to the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center at U.S. Route 20 and Indiana Route 49, near Porter. This center offers standard visitor-center amenities, including a video, brochures, hands-on exhibits, and a gift shop. It is free to the general public.

Camping is available at the Dunewood Campground on U.S. Route 12. The campground includes an RV dump station and two loops of trailer accessible sites (some with pull-through drives). All sites have grills, a picnic table, and access to restrooms with running water and showers. There are a limited number of walk-in sites in the Douglas Loop.

The park provides opportunities for bird watching, camping, of hiking, fishing, swimming, horseback riding, and cross-country skiing. Cycling is available on the Calumet Trail, a crushed limestone multiuse trail which runs through the eastern section of the park, providing access to Indiana Dunes State Park, as well as to the communities of Beverly Shores; the Town of Pines; and Mount Baldy on the edge of Michigan City, Indiana. The Great Marsh Trail opened in 2010 with an accessible, paved section usable by wheelchairs opening in fall 2012. The trail is off Broadway in the east end of the park. The park has about 2 million visits a year. Rules state not to feed any of the wildlife, including seagulls, deer, or raccoons. Collecting crinoid fossils on the beach is strictly prohibited. Possession or use of a metal detector is also prohibited – as in all national parks.

Interpretation (interp.) employees provide free walks and talks throughout the park on a regular basis. The Singing Sands, the official newspaper of the national park is published semi-annually with a listing of Interp.- lead activities. Events in 2013, showed that on large dunes unexpected sink holes may develop. Scientists concluded these are caused by buried trees that eventually decay causing cavities.

===Trails===
Indiana Dunes has numerous short hike trails and a few longer distance trails:
* Paul H. Douglas Trail, formerly the Miller Woods Trail, is located off Lake Street in Gary&#x27;s Miller Beach community. The trail is fully accessible from a parking lot just north of the Douglas Center for Environmental Education.
* Tolleston Dune overlook is a short accessible walk through the treetops to a dune ridge overlook of the vast inland marsh. For a more in depth experiences, the Tolleston Dune trail consists of two loops forming a walk around the through the marsh and oak savannas. Both trails start along U.S. 12, just east of the Porter-Lake County Line Road and the West Beach unit of the park in the Town of Ogden Dunes.
* Succession Trail is located at West Beach. The trail climbs into the high dunes, and while mostly on boardwalk and stairways, the climb is steep. This trail is about long.

* Bailly-Chellberg Trails is a series of interconnected trails. Primarily, it consists of two loops through the historic area around the Bailly Homestead and the Chellberg Farm. This trail takes visitors to a second growth forest, where the trees had once been removed for farming or timber harvest. Included along the north spur is a trip the Bailly Cemetery.
* The Little Calumet River Trail offers an opportunity to visit a restored prairie and the flood plain of the East Arm Little Calumet River. Both represent the land before settlers arrived. This trail can be reached from the Bailly-Chellburg Trails by walking west from the Homestead to Howe Road, then following it across the East Arm Little Calumet River and up through the wetland overlook and parking lot for Mnoke Prairie. This trail ends near the north end of the two loops of the Bailly Chellberg Trails, or visitors can walk from the parking area at Howe Road

* Cowles Bog Trail is reached off of North Mineral Springs Road. Parking is to the east of the guard shack for Dune Acres. This loop is one of the most rugged trails in the park. Visitors begin with a long level walk skirting the wetlands of the Cowles Bog complex and the dune ridges to the north. Following the first fork to the north, they must climb through the dunes until they reach Lake Michigan. This is one of the least crowded areas of the park. Upon return, visitors can take the west part of the loop. Again through the dunes, covered with northern white cedars, black oaks and a variety of trees, visitors will again see inter-dunal wetlands, the open beach, and the long, flat Cowles Bog wetland complex. To complete the full , visitors need to continue west around the wetlands to the parking area at Mineral Sproad crossing, with parking available at Mineral Springs Road, Dune Park station, Calumet Dunes Trail Park, and at U.S. 12, where it crosses the South Shore Tracks, just west of Michigan City.
* The Calumet Dune Trail is fully accessible from the Calumet Dunes Interpretive Center (Kemil Road at U.S. 12). The trail is long and fully paved. Here, visitors may observe a mature wetland forest.
* The far western end of the Calumet Dune Trail links to the Glenwood Dune Horse and Hiking Trail. The Horse trail is long and is accessible by horses and hikers from its own parking lot at U.S. 20 just west of Kemil Road. Visitors must bring their own horses.

===Burnham Plan trails===
The Marquette Plan, a Lakeshore Investment Strategy for Indiana, is composed of two key elements. A trail is planned to cross Indiana to link Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan communities along the Lake Michigan shore. There are planned both land trails for bicycles and hikers and a blue water trail for kayakers.

====Water Trail====
The Lake Michigan Water Trail, was designated a National Recreation Trail in 2011 and currently extends from Chicago&#x27;s Northerly Island to Michigan City&#x27;s Millennium Plaza.

====Long Distance Hike/Bike Trail====
There will be links to major parks and a wide variety of cultural and natural sites. The Calumet Trail will eventually connect the eastern and western segments of Indiana Dunes National Park. The Porter Brickyard Trail opened in 2012 as part of the Burnham Plan Centennia&quot;l&quot;. It will link several community hike/bike trails to the Calumet Hike/Bike trail creating a link between the Lake County communities and Michigan City. Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission is guiding the work with assistance from local governments, the National Park Service, private landowners, and the American Planning Association.

===Lake Michigan===
West Beach, located adjacent to U.S. Route 12 and County Line Road, lies on the border of Gary and Portage, Indiana. It is a geographically separated section of the park that is preserved as a piece of public beach access and an example of the same theme of plant succession as is found in Cowles Bog. This section of the park displays most of the successive stages of Indiana Dunes biotic progression, from open beach sands to mature Eastern Black Oak forest. The West Beach Succession Trail opened in 2007 and features different stages of plant succession in the beach and inland dunes.

The Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk was completed in 2009 as a project of the National Park Service, Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority, and the City of Portage. The National Park Service owns the site and all facilities. The site is operated by the City of Portage through a cooperative management agreement.

Porter Beach, located north of U.S. Route 12, is a small, public sand beach within Indiana Dunes National Park. The surrounding area is residential and is governed by the town of Porter.

== Synopsis ==

=== &quot;The Small Rain&quot; ===

This was Pynchon&#x27;s first published story. It centers around Nathan Levine, a lazy Specialist 3/C in the Army stationed at New Orleans who, along with several of his companions in the battalion are assigned to help with the cleanup at a small island named Creole, which has just been hit by a hurricane. He picks up dead bodies back at the island and after the horrific day of work, he heads back thinking about how to go forward with his life, if at all.

=== &quot;Low-lands&quot; ===
Dennis Flange, a lawyer at Wasp and Winsome, Attorneys at Law, calls into the office, telling them he&#x27;s not coming in. What he&#x27;s going to do instead is sit at home and drink wine with the neighborhood garbage man, Rocco Squarcione. As they sit and talk, Dennis&#x27;s wife, Cindy, comes home and is noticeably frustrated by Dennis&#x27;s afternoon activities. To make matters worse, an old rowdy Navy &quot;friend&quot; of the Flanges, named Pig Bodine, shows up in a stolen MG to see his old friend. At this, Cindy orders the three men off the premises. They all get in Rocco&#x27;s garbage truck, and head down to the dump, patrolled by an old man named Bolingbroke. There, Dennis waxes philosophical about the dump, thinking of it as an allegory for his life up to that point, and possibly his life in the future. Rocco leaves for home, and Bolingbroke, Bodine, and Dennis turn in for the night, swapping sea stories as they doze off. Then, in the middle of the night, Dennis hears a woman&#x27;s voice calling &quot;Anglo! Anglo with the golden hair!&quot;. Realizing this is him, Dennis runs off into the dump looking for the woman. Remembering that Bolingbroke said that gypsies were in the area, Dennis wonders if the woman he&#x27;s looking for is a gypsy. Then he sees her. She is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen... and is also three feet tall. She takes him to her home, tunneling deep into the dump, where she asks him to marry her. He declines, saying he is already married. To this, she starts crying, thinking Dennis won&#x27;t take her. He then thinks she looks like a child, and that he always wanted children, but Cindy was too busy. He then tells her he&#x27;ll stay... for a while.

=== &quot;Entropy&quot;===
A weekend-long lease-breaking party devolves into disarray as Meatball Mulligan entertains a revolving door of cronies, servicemen, and jazz musicians while, in a hothouse room, Callisto and his lover Aubade ponder the everpresent condition of enclosed systems creating disorder while trying to nurse a baby bird back to health. The temperature outside remains 37 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day, fueling apocalyptic paranoia in Callisto, who pontificates on the discoveries of the Laws of Thermodynamics, the Clausius theorem, and Gibbs and Boltzmann, finally deciding that entropy is an adequate metaphor to apply to American consumerist society, &quot;a similar tendency from the least to the most probable, from differentiation to sameness, from ordered individuality to a kind of chaos.&quot; 
Meanwhile, Meatball juggles his attention between conversations about communication theory and personal relationships, keeping the musicians from smoking marijuana in his place, and the unexpected entrances of three coed philosophy majors lugging gallons of Chianti and, later, five sailors searching for a whorehouse. As the musicians discuss music theory, the girls and sailors chant drunken songs together, and childish chicanery break out all over, Meatball debates whether to hide in a closet until the party subsides its second wind or try to calm everyone down, one by one. He decides on the latter, patching up each out-of-control situation until the party tapers down to a din. Callisto&#x27;s bird fails to improve under the unchanging conditions, which causes Aubade to smash out a window of the hothouse with her bare hands, displacing the constant temperature of inside and outside and leaving the story in a state of hovering uncertainty of where the next moment will lead.

=== &quot;Under the Rose&quot; ===
Two English spies, named Porpentine and Goodfellow, are sitting in a cafe in Upper Egypt. Their mission is to find out what their nemesis, Moldweorp, is up to in the area. Porpentine theorizes his plan is to assassinate the Consul-General, and so they travel to Cairo to intercept him, along with Goodfellow&#x27;s new girlfriend, named Victoria Wren, her family, and a man named Bongo-Shaftsbury. During the trip, Bongo-Shaftsbury attempts to attack Victoria&#x27;s younger sister Mildred, but Porpentine stops him. He then realizes that the man is a spy working for Moldweorp, and Bongo-Shaftsbury is put under guard. Upon reaching Cairo, the two men check into their hotels. The next morning, they head to the opera house where the Consul-General is a guest. Upon reaching their destination, they realize their hunch was correct, and Moldweorp and his spies are swarming the place. After Porpentine foils the assassination attempt, a chase across the streets of Cairo ensues. They reach the Sphinx, and exit their cabs, running across the desert. Porpentine and Goodfellow catch Moldweorp, and they talk a moment. Porpentine tells Goodfellow to return to the cab. He does, and a shot rings out. Turning around, he sees his companion face-down in the hot desert sand, as Moldweorp walks away. Sixteen years later, Goodfellow surveys a motorcade containing Archduke Franz Ferdinand, upon hearing rumors of a possible assassination. He&#x27;s joined by his new girlfriend, a barmaid this time, who thinks of him as just a simple-minded Englishman, no good in bed but liberal with his money.

=== &quot;The Secret Integration&quot; ===
Grover Snodd and his friends Tim Santora, Carl Barrington (an African American), and Etienne Cherdlu, neighborhood kids from Mingeborough, Massachusetts, meet up at Grover&#x27;s house one Saturday afternoon to discuss activities for the weekend. Their &quot;Inner Junta&quot; talk about planning elaborate practical jokes, financed by collecting milk money from school kids. The meeting adjourns to their secret hideout: the four of them depart, through a lush section of forest they dub King Yrjo&#x27;s Woods, then down a stream aboard a refurbished flat-bottomed boat they christened the &quot;S.S. Leak&quot;, to the cellar of an abandoned manor known as &quot;The Big House”. Here they solidify plans to infiltrate and disrupt a PTA meeting with smoke bombs and sodium/water explosions. 

In a flashback, the failure of the group&#x27;s previous year&#x27;s operation is recalled: before he can fulfill his assigned task in that plan, Hogan Slothrop, an 8-years-sober AA member, gets a call to sit with another member who is alone and afraid. He and Tim go to the hotel where Mr. Carl McAfee, an African-American musician from Mississippi, is staying. Mr. McAfee eyes the situation with the kids and, chalking it up to a bad joke, sends them away and calls room service for a fifth of whiskey. Hogan steadfastly claims his seriousness and the kids stay to keep him company. Grover calls the hotel and asks to show up with Etienne. McAfee can&#x27;t afford to pay for the bottle of whiskey, much less the room he&#x27;s staying in, and breaks down into screaming and crying in his bed, passing out in-between fits. The police are called in to escort Mr. McAfee out as a vagrant, despite protests from the kids and Hogan&#x27;s insistence that the man is sick, not a criminal. 

Later that year, the Junta discusses their parents’ concerns about Carl Barrington&#x27;s family&#x27;s arrival, and how it will affect the neighborhood and community. In response to the word &quot;integration&quot; being thrown around, Grover, the boy genius, offers the calculus definition. A week later, Grover learns (and shares) the other meaning for “integration&quot; (which he realizes is the meaning that the parents are using): white and black kids in the same schools. Carl&#x27;s family is a sort of trigger for the gentrification of the area, an easy target, an explanation for the racist remarks made by Tim&#x27;s mother and reflected around the neighborhood, and gives light to the mockery of Hogan&#x27;s dispatch to Mr. McAfee&#x27;s aid.

Returning to the present: when the boys walk Carl home from the secret hideout, and find that his yard has literally been trashed by their own parents, it is revealed that Carl, although accepted by the boys as a legitimate member of the Junta, is actually only an &quot;imaginary playmate” (which explains earlier curious comments by adults). He is the means by which the boys attempt to come to terms with, and understand, their parents’ prejudices and actions. In the end, he can harmlessly evaporate until needed again.

<doc id="457404" wikidata="Q5480266" url="?curid=457404" title="Francis Blomefield">
<text>Rev. Francis Blomefield (23 July 170516 January 1752), FSA, Rector of Fersfield in Norfolk, was an English antiquarian who wrote a county history of Norfolk: &quot;An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk&quot;. It includes detailed accounts of the City of Norwich, the Borough of Thetford and all parishes in the southernmost Hundreds of Norfolk, but he died before completing it. This was done by a friend, Rev. Charles Parkin. The Norfolk historian Walter Rye related that although no portrait of him was known to exist, Blomefield closely resembled the astronomer John Flamsteed, whose portrait was used to depict Blomefield on the frontispiece of one of his volumes. His history of Norfolk was reissued in London in 11 volumes by William Miller in 1805–1810, the last seven being by Parkin.

==Origins==
Francis Blomefield was born in the parish of Fersfield in the south of Norfolk on 23 July 1705, the eldest son of Henry Blomefield (1680-1732) of Winley Wood and Marketfield (free tenements which he purchased in 1724) within that parish and manor. He was described by the Norfolk historian Walter Rye as &quot;a gentleman of independent means&quot; and held a share of the advowson of Fersfield, to which he presented his son in 1729. His mother was Alice Batch (1677–1729), the daughter and heiress of John Batch, of King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk. The Blomefield family had been established at Fersfield for at least six generations and claimed descent from Sir Henry Broumflete / Bromefilde, sent in 1433 by King Henry VI as one of the delegation to the Council of Basle.

==Career==
Blomefield was educated at the grammar schools at Diss and Thetford in Norfolk. In April 1724 he was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1727 and a Master of Arts degree in 1728. He was ordained a priest on 27 July 1729 by Thomas Tanner, then Chancellor of the Diocese of Norwich, later Bishop of St Asaph. Two days later, on 29 July 1729 he was appointed Rector of Hargham in Norfolk, by the patron Thomas Hare, and shortly afterwards on 13 September 1729 was appointed by his father, whose turn it was at that time as patron, as Rector of Fersfield.

As a boy of 15, Blomefield began recording monumental inscriptions from churches he visited in Norfolk, Suffolk and later Cambridgeshire. Whilst at college, he also kept genealogical and heraldic notes on local families. Soon after leaving university, he was collecting materials for an account of the antiquities of Cambridgeshire, but in 1732, this project was deferred when he was given access to the antiquary Peter Le Neve&#x27;s collection of materials for the history of Norfolk by Le Neve&#x27;s executor &quot;Honest Tom&quot; Martin.
In July 1733, Blomefield published his proposals for &quot;An Essay towards a Topographical History of Norfolk&quot;. While collecting information for his history, he discovered some of the &quot;Paston Letters&quot;. By 1736, he was ready to begin putting the results of his researches into type, assisted by his friend Charles Parkin, Rector of Oxborough. At the end of 1739, the first volume of Blomefield’s &quot;History of Norfolk&quot; was completed; it was printed using his press at Fersfield, acquired for the purpose. The second volume, consisting of a detailed history of Norwich, was begun in 1741 and completed by 1745. The production of this volume took more than four years, and Blomefield seems to have lived in the city while it was being printed.

In 1751, Blomefield published &quot;Collectanea Cantabrigiensia&quot;, his Cambridgeshire notes. A fire is said to have destroyed the press and printing room, along with all the copies of his first volume, forcing Blomefield to start his work again.

He encountered many problems with his printers and engravers, and temporarily lost his notes for the volume about Diss Hundred when they were sent away for correction. He was two-thirds through his third volume of the history of Norfolk and had covered about 40 per cent of the county, when he contracted smallpox on a visit to London and died in Fersfield in January 1752.

==Marriage and issue==
On 1 September 1732, Blomefield married Mary Womock, daughter of Rev. Lawrence Womock, Rector of Castor by Yarmouth in Norfolk and Vicar of Buxton, a cousin of Lawrence Womock, Bishop of St Davids. An earlier Lawrence &quot;Womack&quot; had been Rector of Fersfield in 1609–1642, being preceded as such by Henry Womack and succeeded by Arthur Womack. By his wife Francis Blomefield had three daughters, two of whom survived to adulthood. The four included Elizabeth Blomefield (born 1733), and Alice Blomefield (1735–1735), who died in infancy.

==Succession==
In 1871, Blomefield&#x27;s property – worth more than £7000 – was inherited by a distant cousin, Rev. Leonard Jenyns, a clergyman and naturalist. It included of land near the town of Diss in Norfolk. As a condition of inheritance, Jenyns was required to change his surname to Blomefield.

==Completion of the &quot;History of Norfolk&quot;==
The history of the remaining areas of Norfolk was completed by Blomefield&#x27;s friend, the Rev. Charles Parkin in 1753–1765, but not in Blomefield&#x27;s detailed and accurate manner. The remainder of volume 3 and two further volumes were published in King&#x27;s Lynn between 1769 and 1775. The entire work was subsequently reprinted in 11 quarto volumes by the London publisher William Miller in London between 1805 and 1810.

According to Rye, Parkin died before the volumes were sent to be published – they had to be completed by &quot;some bookseller&#x27;s hack&quot; in King&#x27;s Lynn.

==Assessment==
Blomefield&#x27;s &quot;History of Norfolk&quot; was both detailed and largely reliable and comparable with the best county histories of the period. There is little doubt that in compiling his book Blomefield had frequent recourse to existing historical collections of the antiquary Peter Le Neve, John Kirkpatrick of Norwich and the Bishop of St Asaph, Thomas Tanner, his own work being to some extent one of expansion and addition, despite some extensive collections of his own.

According to Rye, writing for the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in 1886, Blomefield&#x27;s volumes are &quot;an enduring monument of hard disinterested work, for it was wholly a labour of love, and as far as the facts chronicled it is usually very trustworthy.&quot; However, Rye also noted that Blomefield believed – and published – the fabricated accounts in a series of family histories, and that the work contained numerous errors, lacked details and failed to provide accurate etymological definitions.

David Stoker, writing for the revised &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in 2004, felt that Rye had treated Blomefield&#x27;s reputation &quot;shabbily&quot;, emphasising his personal failings and the inevitable errors and misinterpretations in his history. Stoker concludes, &quot;Given the period and circumstances in which [Blomefield] was at work, and the immensity of his task, his was a great achievement. His weakness was in underestimating what he had taken on. There has as yet been no other history of Norfolk on a comparable scale, and it remains the standard work.&quot;

Hassell Smith and Roger Virgoe in 1994 saw Blomefield&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; &quot;one of the great county histories and... still the only major history of Norfolk... [T]he volumes on Norwich still remain the fullest account of the development of the institutions and antiquities, secular and ecclesiastical, of the city.&quot;

<text>An elixir is a sweet liquid used for medical purposes, to be taken orally and intended to cure one&#x27;s illness. When used as a pharmaceutical preparation, an elixir contains at least one active ingredient designed to be taken orally.

==Etymology==
The word was introduced in late Middle English, through Latin from the Arabic (), which in turn is the Arabization of the Ancient Greek () (from () ). For centuries, &quot;elixir&quot; primarily meant an ingredient used in alchemy, either referring to a liquid which purportedly converts lead to gold, or a substance or liquid which is believed to cure all ills and give eternal life.

==Types==
=== Non-medicated elixirs ===
These are used as solvents or vehicles for the preparation of medicated elixirs. Active ingredients are dissolved in a 15–⁠50% by volume solution of ethyl alcohol:
*aromatic elixirs (USP)
*isoalcoholic elixirs (NF)
*compound benzaldehyde elixirs (NF)

=== Medicated elixirs ===
These include:
* antihistaminic elixirs used against allergy, such as chlorpheniramine maleate (USP) or diphenhydramine HCl
* sedative and hypnotic elixirs, the former to induce drowsiness, the latter to induce sleep
*pediatric elixirs such as chloral hydrate
*expectorant elixirs used to facilitate productive cough (i.e. cough with sputum), such as terpin hydrate

=== East Asian vitamin drinks ===
Daily non-alcoholic non-caffeinated &#x27;vitamin drinks&#x27; have been popular in East Asia since the 1950s, with Oronamin from Otsuka Pharmaceutical perhaps the market leader. Packaged in brown light-proof bottles, these drinks have the reputation of being enjoyed by old men and other health-conscious individuals. Counterparts exist in South Korea and China.

Western energy drinks typically have caffeine and are targeted at a younger demographic, with colorful labels and printed claims of increased athletic/daily performance.

===Pseudomedicinal drinks===
See Patent medicine.

==Composition==

An elixir is a hydro-alcoholic solution of at least one active ingredient. The alcohol is mainly used to:
* Solubilize the active ingredient(s) and some excipients
* Retard the crystallization of sugar
* Preserve the finished product
* Provide a sharpness to the taste
* Aid in masking the unpleasant taste of the active ingredient(s)
* Enhance the flavor.
The lowest alcoholic quantity that will dissolve completely the active ingredient(s) and give a clear solution is generally chosen. High concentrations of alcohol give burning taste to the final product.

An elixir may also contain the following excipients:
* Sugar and/or sugar substitutes like the sugar polyols glycerol and sorbitol.
* Preservatives like parabens and benzoates and antioxidants like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and sodium metabisulfite.
* Buffering agents
* Chelating agents like sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
* Flavoring agents and flavor enhancers
* Coloring agents

==Storage==
Elixirs should only be stored in a tightly closed, light resistant container away from direct heat and sunlight.

* Concoction
* Elixir of life
* Internal alchemy
* Energy drink
* Soft drink
* Panacea (medicine), mythological remedy that would cure all diseases
* Suspension (chemistry)
* Syrup
* Spagyric
* Herbal tea
* Tincture, in which alcohol is the major solvent and the ingredient is often highly concentrated.
* Theriac

<text>Daniel Marc Hooper (born 1973), known by the nickname Swampy, is a British environmental activist. He was involved in a number of environmental protests in the 1990s, becoming nationally famous after spending a week in a tunnel aiming to stop the expansion of the A30 in Fairmile, Devon, in 1996. In 2020, he was arrested attempting to stop the destruction of Jones Hill Wood for High Speed 2 (HS2) and then joined a Stop HS2 protest at Euston Square Gardens in London.

==Activism==
Swampy became a nationally known figure in 1996 after spending a week in a complex series of tunnels dug in the path of a new extension to the A30 in Fairmile, Devon, resisting attempts at eviction by police. Specialists were called in to safely remove Swampy and other protesters locked deep inside the network of artificial tunnels. Several people took part in the protest, but Swampy was the last one to be evicted. The magistrate passing sentence on him was David Cameron&#x27;s mother. The mainstream media became fascinated with Swampy, and his subsequent fame included an appearance on the BBC comedy current affairs quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, as the show&#x27;s youngest-ever panelist. A folk song was written about him, entitled &quot;The Fairmile Road Protest Song (Digging Down)&quot;. He also protested against the Newbury bypass, and in 1997, he entered tunnels intended to prevent the building of a second runway at Manchester Airport. He then dropped out of sight and refused to talk to the media.

In 2007, the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; newspaper reported that Swampy was taking part in the climate change protests at Heathrow Airport. Hooper&#x27;s presence on the protest site was dependent on his keeping a low profile, so his celebrity status would not detract from the event. In September 2019, Swampy took part in an Extinction Rebellion protest, attaching himself to a concrete block at the entrance to the Valero Energy fuel refinery in Pembrokeshire. He admitted to a charge of wilful obstruction of the highway and was fined £40, plus £85 for costs and a £32 surcharge, commenting, &quot;I am pleading guilty, I can&#x27;t really afford to keep coming to court.&quot;

Swampy was arrested at Jones Hill Wood in Buckinghamshire in October 2020, having occupied a tree house as part of a Stop HS2 protest to prevent trees being felled because they are on the route of High Speed 2. In January 2021, he was involved in the construction and occupation of tunnels at Euston Square Gardens in London as part of the same protests. His 16 year-old son joined him in the tunnel protest. Swampy left the tunnel on 25 February. Hooper and others again built and occupied a tunnel on the site of HS2 work in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, emerging on 13 November 2021. They spent 35 days holding out against the national eviction team, 28 of those days completely underground.

==Personal life==
Swampy was born in 1973 in Luton, Bedfordshire. In 2006, he was living with his girlfriend and their three children in a yurt, a dome-shaped tent, in Tipi Valley, a commune in west Wales. As of 2013, he was still living in Wales with his family, working for the Forestry Commission and running marathons and half marathons.

<doc id="457426" wikidata="Q3915542" url="?curid=457426" title="Income distribution">
<text>In economics, income distribution covers how a country&#x27;s total GDP is distributed amongst its population. Economic theory and economic policy have long seen income and its distribution as a central concern. Unequal distribution of income causes economic inequality which is a concern in almost all countries around the world.

== About ==
Classical economists such as Adam Smith (1723–1790), Thomas Malthus (1766–1834), and David Ricardo (1772–1823) concentrated their attention on factor income-distribution, that is, the distribution of income between the primary factors of production (land, labour and capital). Modern economists have also addressed issues of income distribution, but have focused more on the distribution of income across individuals and households. Important theoretical and policy concerns include the balance between income inequality and economic growth, and their often inverse relationship.

The Lorenz curve can represent the distribution of income within a society. The Lorenz curve is closely associated with measures of income inequality, such as the Gini coefficient.

=== Measurement ===
The concept of inequality is distinct from that of poverty and fairness. Income inequality metrics (or income distribution metrics) are used by social scientists to measure the distribution of income, and economic inequality among the participants in a particular economy, such as that of a specific country or of the world in general. While different theories may try to explain how income inequality comes about, income inequality metrics simply provide a system of measurement used to determine the dispersion of incomes.

Gini Coefficient: A measure that represents the income or wealth distribution among a nation&#x27;s residents, with 0 expressing perfect equality and 1 indicating perfect inequality.
Lorenz Curve: A graphical representation of income distribution, where a perfectly straight line (45-degree line) reflects absolute equality.
Quintile and Decile Ratios: These divide the population into equal parts (quintiles - fifths, deciles - tenths) to compare the income shares received by each group.

===Economic Theories and Government Policies===
Various economic theories address income distribution, from classical economics, which tends to focus on market mechanisms, to Keynesian economics, which emphasizes the role of government intervention. Policies to influence income distribution include:

Progressive Taxation: Taxing higher incomes at higher rates to redistribute income more evenly.
Public Spending: Directing government expenditure towards education, healthcare, and social security to support lower-income groups.
Wage Policies: Implementing minimum wage laws and encouraging collective bargaining to improve wages for low- and middle-income workers.
International Perspectives on Income Distribution
Income distribution varies greatly around the world. Comparing countries through tools like the World Income Inequality Database (WIID) or the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID) can provide insights into global patterns and the effectiveness of different policies.

Trends and Current Data
Recent trends in income distribution show increasing income inequality in many parts of the world. This trend has been exacerbated by globalization and changes in the global economy. Current data from sources like the OECD can be used to update the article with the latest figures and trends.

==== Neoclassical theory of distribution ====
According to this theory, the distribution of national income is determined by factor prices, the payment to each factor of production (wage for labor, rent for land, interest for capital, profit for entrepreneurship) which themselves are derived from the equilibrium of supply and demand in that factor&#x27;s market, and finally, are equal to the marginal productivity of the factors of production. A change in the quantity of any one of the factors will affect the marginal production, supply and demand of factors and eventually alter the income distribution from firms to households within the economy.

=== Limitations ===
There exist some problems and limitations in the measurement of inequality as there is a large gap between the national accounts (which focus on macroeconomic totals) and inequality studies (which focus on distribution).

The lack of a comprehensive measure about how the pretax income differs from the post-tax income makes hard to assess how government redistribution affects inequality.

There is not a clear view on how long-run trends in income concentration are shaped by the major changes in woman&#x27;s labour force participation.

== Income inequality and its causes ==

Income inequality is one aspect of economic inequality. Incomes levels can be studied through taxation records and other historical documents. &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; (2013) by French economist Thomas Piketty is noted for its systematic collection and review of available data, especially concerning income levels; not all aspects of historical wealth distribution are similarly attested in the available records. 

Causes of income inequality and of levels of economic equality/inequality include: labor economics, tax policies, other economic policies, labor union policies, Federal Reserve monetary policies &amp; fiscal policies, the market for labor, abilities of individual workers, technology and automation, education, globalization, gender bias, racism, and culture.

Addressing income inequality requires comprehensive policy interventions that consider these diverse causes, including improving access to education, reforming tax systems, ensuring fair labor practices, and implementing social policies that promote equity and economic mobility.

== How to improve income inequality ==

Source:

=== Taxes ===
The progressive income tax takes a larger percentage of high incomes and a smaller percentage of low incomes. Effectively, the poorest pay the least of their earned incomes on taxes which allows them to keep a larger percentage of wealth. Justification can be illustrated by a simple heuristic: The same dollar amount of money (e.g. $100) has a greater economic impact on only one party—the poor. That same amount has little economic impact on a wealthy individual, so the disparity is addressed by ensuring the richest individuals are taxed a greater share of their wealth. The state then uses the tax revenue to fund necessary and beneficial activities for the society at large. Every person in this system would have access to the same social benefits, but the rich pay more for it, so progressive tax significantly reduces the inequality.

===Education and Skill Development===
Universal Access to Quality Education: Ensuring that all individuals have access to quality education can reduce income inequality by equipping people with the skills they need to succeed.
Lifelong Learning and Retraining Programs: Support for ongoing education and retraining can help workers adapt to changing economic conditions and job markets.

===International Cooperation===
Work with other countries to establish international standards for labor rights, tax policies, and corporate governance to prevent a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in terms of wages and working conditions.
=== In-kind transfers ===
If a cash is given to a poor person, he or she may not make &quot;the best&quot; choice in case, what to buy for this extra money. Then, there is the solution in form of the food stamps or directly the food as an in-kind transfer to the poorest.

=== Housing subsidies ===
The rent and upkeep of housing form a large portion of spending in the lower income families. Housing subsidies were designed to help the poor obtaining adequate housing.

=== Welfare and Unemployment benefits ===
This provides actual money to the people with very low or no income and gives them an absolute freedom in decision-making how to use this benefit. This works best if we assume that they are rational and make decisions in their best interest.

=== Income mobility ===
Income mobility is another factor in the study of income inequality. It describes how people change their economic well-being, i.e. move in the hierarchy of earning power over their lifetime. When someone improves his economic situation, this person is considered upwardly mobile.
Mobility can vary between two extremes: 1) rich people stay always rich and poor stay always poor: people cannot easily change their economic status and inequality then seems as a permanent problem. 2) individuals can easily shift their income class, e.g. from middle earning class to upper class or from lower class to middle class. Inequality is &quot;fluid&quot; and temporary so it does not create a serious permanent problem.

====Measuring income mobility====
Mobility is measured by the association between parents´ and adult children&#x27;s socioeconomic standing, where higher association means less mobility. Socioeconomic standing is captured by four different measures:

#Occupational status: – it is weighted average of the mean level of earnings and education of certain occupations. It has advantages such a collecting important information about parents, which can be reported retrospectively by adult children. It also remains relatively stable in between the occupation career so single measuring provides adequate information of long run standing. On the other hand, it has also limitations for the mobility analyzing. Whereas occupational earning of men usually tends to be higher than by women, by the occupational education it is the other way around.
#Class mobility: – Classes are instead categorical groupings based on specific occupational assets that determine life chances as expressed in outcomes such as income, health or wealth.
#Earnings mobility: – Earning mobility evaluates the relationship between two certain generations by means of linear regression (upper math) of the long transformed measure of children&#x27;s and parents&#x27; earnings.
# Total family income mobility and the mobility of women: – Old economic analysis has been making one mistake, that they did analysis that focused mostly on the father-son pairs and their individual earnings. In the last two decades, they have expanded their research and now they focus more on the mother-daughter pairs as well. Generally earnings provides a stable measure of well-being independently of another financial assets or any kind of transfers.

=== Labor union ===
It is known that labor union reduces the income inequality in both private and public sectors, and research conducted by David Card et al. showed that unionization redressed the income inequality in America and Canada, especially in their public sectors. For American male workers, the reduction of wage inequality was 1.7 percent in the private sector, while the reduction was 16.2 percent in the public sector. For American female workers, the reductions were 0.6 percent and 10.7 percent in the private and public sectors, respectively. In Canada, reduction effects were likewise more noticeable in the public sector.

== Distribution measurement internationally ==
Using Gini coefficients, several organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), have measured income inequality by country. The Gini index is also widely used within the World Bank. It is an accurate and reliable index for measuring income distribution on a country by country level. The Gini index measurements go from 0 to 1 for 1 being perfect inequality and 0 being perfect equality. The world Gini index is measured at 0.52 as of 2016.
== Trends ==
Standard economic theory stipulates that inequality tends to increase over time as a country develops, and to decrease as a certain average income is attained. This theory is commonly known as the Kuznets curve after Simon Kuznets. However, many prominent economists disagree with the need for inequality to increase as a country develops. Further, empirical data on the proclaimed subsequent decrease of inequality is conflicting.

Across the board, a number of industries are stratified across the genders. This is the result of a variety of factors. These include differences in education choices, preferred job and industry, work experience, number of hours worked, and breaks in employment (such as for bearing and raising children). Men also typically go into higher paid and higher risk jobs when compared to women. These factors result in 60% to 75% difference between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s average aggregate wages or salaries, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women&#x27;s lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and sexual discrimination. According to the European Commission direct discrimination only explains a small part of gender wage differences.

A study by the Brandeis University Institute on Assets and Social Policy which followed the same sets of families for 25 years found that there are vast differences in wealth across racial groups in the United States. The wealth gap between Caucasian and African-American families studied nearly tripled, from $85,000 in 1984 to $236,500 in 2009. The study concluded that factors contributing to the inequality included years of home ownership (27%), household income (20%), education (5%), and familial financial support and/or inheritance (5%). In an analysis of the American Opportunity Accounts Act, a bill to introduce Baby Bonds, Morningstar reported that by 2019 white families had more than seven times the wealth of the average Black family, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances.

There are two ways of looking at income inequality, within country inequality (intra-country inequality) – which is inequality within a nation; or between country inequality (inter-country inequality) which is inequality between countries.

According to intra-country inequality at least in the OECD countries, a May 2011 report by OECD stated that the gap between rich and poor within OECD countries (most of which are &quot;high income&quot; economies) &quot;has reached its highest level for over 30 years, and governments must act quickly to tackle inequality&quot;.

Furthermore, increased inter-country income inequality over a long period is conclusive, with the Gini coefficient (using PPP exchange rate, unweighted by population) more than doubling between 1820 and the 1980s from .20 to .52 (Nolan 2009:63). However, scholars disagree about whether inter-country income inequality has increased (Milanovic 2011), remained relatively stable (Bourguignon and Morrisson 2002), or decreased (Sala-i-Martin, 2002) since 1980. What Milanovic (2005) calls the “mother of all inequality disputes” emphasizes this debate by using the same data on Gini coefficient from 1950 to 2000 and showing that when countries’ GDP per capita incomes are unweighted by population income inequality increases, but when they are weighted inequality decreases. This has much to do with the recent average income rise in China and to some extent India, who represent almost two-fifths of the world. Notwithstanding, inter-country inequality is significant, for instance as a group the bottom 5% of US income distribution receives more income than over 68 percent of the world, and of the 60 million people that make up the top 1% of income distribution, 50 million of them are citizens of Western Europe, North America or Oceania (Milanovic 2011:116,156).

Larry Summers estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution, or approximately $7,000 per family. Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007–2009 subprime mortgage crisis, as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.

In a TED presentation shown here , Hans Rosling presented the distribution and change in income distribution of various nations over the course of a few decades along with other factors such as child survival and fertility rate.

As of 2018, Albania has the smallest gap in wealth distribution with Zimbabwe having the largest gap in wealth distribution.

These trends underscore the complexity of income distribution as a global challenge. While the specifics can vary greatly by region and country, the common themes of technological change, globalization, policy choices, and demographic shifts play pivotal roles in shaping the dynamics of income inequality worldwide. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced understanding of both global trends and local contexts, as well as coordinated efforts across multiple sectors of society.

== Income distribution in different countries ==

===Japan===
Despite these issues, Japan&#x27;s Gini coefficient—a measure of income inequality—remains lower than in many OECD countries. Still, the relative poverty rate highlights significant economic hardship among certain population segments. The government has responded with policies aimed at converting non-regular positions to regular ones, increasing the minimum wage, and enhancing social security for low-income families.
* Post-tax Gini coefficient: 0.32.
* Unemployment rate: 2.6%.
* GDP per capita: $40 850.
* Poverty rate: 15.7%
Addressing income inequality in Japan moving forward will require policies that tackle demographic challenges, ensure fair employment practices, and foster inclusive economic growth. Enhancing the social safety net and providing targeted assistance to vulnerable groups will be key to mitigating income inequality&#x27;s impacts.

===India===
India&#x27;s economy was growing rapidly in 2011, but a big section of the population was still living in poverty, making income disparity a serious problem.

Post-tax Gini coefficient: In 2011, India&#x27;s estimated Gini coefficient ranged from 0.33 to 0.36, indicating moderate to high levels of income inequality.

Rate of unemployment: During this time, India&#x27;s jobless rate was roughly 9%.
GDP per capita: In 2011, the GDP per capita was approximately USD 1,500, indicating a significant income gap between developed countries and India.

Rate of poverty: In 2011, more than 20% of Indians were living below the country&#x27;s poverty line, making it a high rate of poverty.

The Indian government put in place a number of measures to alleviate economic disparity, including:

The goal of social welfare initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is to provide jobs in rural areas.
Public Distribution System (PDS) and other subsidized food programs help low-income households maintain food security.
Economic changes like financial inclusion programs that give underprivileged people access to banking services in an effort to promote inclusive growth.
===Thailand===
Thailand has been ranked the world&#x27;s third most unequal nation after Russia and India, with a widening gap between rich and poor according to Oxfam in 2016. A study by Thammasat University economist Duangmanee Laovakul in 2013 showed that the country&#x27;s top 20 land owners owned 80 percent of the nation&#x27;s land. The bottom 20 owned only 0.3 percent. Among those having bank deposits, 0.1 percent of bank accounts held 49 per cent of total bank deposits. , Thai per capita income is US$8,000 a year. The government aims to raise it to US$15,000 (498,771 baht) per year, driven by average GDP growth of five to six percent. Under the 20-year national plan stretching out to 2036, the government intends to narrow the income disparity gap to 15 times, down from 20 times in 2018.

===Australia===
Australia was suffering from the global fallout from the 2008 financial crisis in 2011, but compared to many other industrialized countries, its economy remained comparatively strong, partly because of its solid mining industry and close trading relations with China.

Post-tax Gini coefficient: In 2011, Australia&#x27;s Gini coefficient was roughly 0.33, showing a moderate degree of income inequality by global standards.

Rate of unemployment: In 2011, Australia&#x27;s unemployment rate was 5.1%, which was consistent with a stable labor market.

GDP per capita: In 2011, the GDP per capita was approximately USD 62,000, indicating a robust economy.

Poverty rate: Various estimates place the poverty rate between 12 and 13 percent.

Australia&#x27;s government prioritized resolving income inequities that were made worse by the global economic slump during this time, as well as maintaining economic stability. Among the measures taken to lessen income inequality were:

* Bolstering the social safety net by raising welfare payments.
* Introducing fiscal measures like progressive taxes that are intended to redistribute income. Encouraging work by taking steps to increase the number of jobs being created in different industries.

These measures were a part of Australia&#x27;s larger strategy to guarantee that the country&#x27;s economic expansion benefited all facets of society, especially in light of the unpredictability of the world economy.

=== United States ===

2011: In the United States, income has become distributed more unequally over the past 30 years, with those in the top quintile (20 percent) earning more than the bottom 80 percent combined.

2019: The wealthiest 10% of American households control nearly 75% of household net worth.

* Post-tax Gini coefficient: 0.39.
* Unemployment rate: 4.4%.
* GDP per capita: $53 632.
* Poverty rate: 11.1%.

Low unemployment rate and high GDP are signs of the health of the U.S. economy. But there is almost 18% of people living below the poverty line and the Gini coefficient is quite high. That ranks the United States 9th income inequal in the world.

The U.S. has the highest level of income inequality among its (post-)industrialized peers. When measured for all households, U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed countries before taxes and transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households. In 2016, average market income was $15,600 for the lowest quintile and $280,300 for the highest quintile. The degree of inequality accelerated within the top quintile, with the top 1% at $1.8 million, approximately 30 times the $59,300 income of the middle quintile.

The economic and political impacts of inequality may include slower GDP growth, reduced income mobility, higher poverty rates, greater usage of household debt leading to increased risk of financial crises, and political polarization. Causes of inequality may include executive compensation increasing relative to the average worker, financialization, greater industry concentration, lower unionization rates, lower effective tax rates on higher incomes, and technology changes that reward higher educational attainment.

=== United Kingdom ===
Inequality in the UK has been very high in the past, and did not change much until the onset of industrialization. Incomes used to be remarkably concentrated pre-industrial evolution: up to 40% of total income went into the pockets of the richest 5%. In the more recent years income distribution is still an issue. The UK experienced a large increase in inequality during the 1980s—the incomes of the highest deciles increase while everyone else was stagnant. Uneven growth in the years leading up to 1991 meant further increases in inequality. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, more even growth across the distribution meant little changes in inequality, with rising incomes for everybody. In sight of Brexit, there is more predicted income distribution discrepancies between wages.

2019: The United Kingdom was doing a lot to reduce one of the widest gaps between rich and poor citizens, what has led to getting on the 13th place in the ranking of income inequality in the world.

* Post-tax Gini coefficient: 0.35.
* Unemployment rate: 4.3%.
* GDP per capita: $39 425.
* Poverty rate: 11.1%.

=== Russia ===

*Post-tax Gini coefficient: 0.38.
* Unemployment rate: 5.2%.
* GDP per capita: $24 417.
* Poverty rate: NA.

Occupying the 11th place in the ranking of income inequality in the world. USA TODAY stated: &quot;Russia has a Corruption Perceptions Index score of 28 – tied for the worst among OECD member states and affiliates and one of the lowest in the world. &quot; The cause of the income gap are the close connections of Russian oligarchs and the government. Thanks to these relationships, oligarchs get lucrative business deals and earn more and more money.

=== South Africa ===
South Africa is well known for being one of the most unequal societies in the world. The first democratic elections in 1994 were promising in terms of equal opportunities and living standards for South African population, but a few decades later the inequality is still very high. For instance, the top decile’s share of income rose from 47 percent in 1994 to 60 percent in 2008 and 65 percent in 2017. The share of the poorest half of the population fell from 13 percent to 9 percent to 6 percent. An explanation for this trend is that South Africa governs a dual economy splitting the country into two different section. One section is built around an advanced capitalist economy while the other one is highly underdeveloped and mostly filled by black South Africans, which further leads to racial division of local population. As a result, on average a black South African earns three times less than a white South African. 

* Post-tax Gini coefficient: 0.62.
* Unemployment rate: 27.3%.
* GDP per capita: $12 287.
* Poverty rate: 26.6%.
The highest income inequality is in South Africa, based on 2019 data.

=== Brazil ===
Income distribution is typically higher is typically higher in developing economies than in advanced economies. In most major emerging economies, income inequality rose over the past three decades (2016), namely in China, Russia, South Africa and India. Although some might argue, the Brazilian Institute of Statistics claims that from 2004 to 2014, income inequality in Brazil declined. The Gini coefficient for household per capita income has gone down from 0,54 to 0,49. This decline is due to boosted income of the poor by sustained economic growth and implementation of social policies, for example increase in minimum wage or targeted social programs. In particular, the Bolsa Família program, introduced by reelected president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose goal is to support families in need. Although criticized, this program has not only helped reduce income inequality, but also increased literacy and lower child labor and mortality. In addition, progressive taxation, as well as schooling, demographic changes, and labor market segmentation, contributed to reducing inequality.

Even though Brazil has managed to lower its income inequality, it is still very high compared to the rest of the world, with around half of the total income being concentrated among the richest 10 per cent, a little above a fifth among the top 1 per cent, and close to one tenth among the top 0.1 per cent.

* Gini coefficient: 0.52(2022)
* Unemployment rate: 8.032% (2024).
* GDP per capita: $17,827.6 (2022)
* Poverty rate: 1.4% (3,65$) (2023)

===China===
China is one the fastest growing economies in the world since its reform policies in late 1970s. However, this phenomenon is often accompanied by an increase in income inequality. China&#x27;s Gini coefficient has risen from 0,31 to 0,491 between the years 1981 and 2008. The main reason for China&#x27;s high Gini coefficient is an income gap between rural and urban household. The share of the urban–rural income gap in total income inequality increased by 10 per cent over the period 1995–2007, rising from 38 to 48%. In China, constraints on migration limit the extent to which rural residents can move to urban areas in search of higher incomes and thereby reduce the urban–rural income gap. Although the urbanization rate has more than doubled in last 50 years, the prosses is still decelerated by various institutional and social barriers. As a result the share of national income of China&#x27;s top 10% wealthiest people is 41%.

* Gini coefficient: 0.371(2020)
* Unemployment rate: 5.1% (2024)
* GDP per capita: $21,482.6 (2022)
* Poverty rate: 2% (3,65$) (2020)

===Nordic countries===
In the past, the income distribution in Nordic countries including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland was renowned for being relatively low compared to the rest of the world. This is caused by a combination of factors such as progressive taxation, strong social welfare system, strong labor market institutions, and a culture of social cohesion which definitely contributes to them being notoriously the happiest in the world. Moreover, Nordic countries seem to be unaffected by the trends towards increasing inequality and higher unemployment observed in other countries, particularly the US and the UK Even though each of the Nordic countries have experienced temporarily rising income inequality, and they have all been affected by economic crises, they all shown a remarkable ability to recover and return to a persistent growth path and a stable relatively low income inequality. 

The following data is for Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland respectively
* Gini coefficient: 0.283 (2021), 0.298 (2021), 0.277 (2019), 0.277 (2021), 0.261 (2017)
* Unemployment rate: 4.892% (2024), 8.365% (2024), 3,8% (2024),4.892% (2024), 3.383% (2024)
* GDP per capita: $77,953.7 (2022), $68,178.0 (2022), $121,259.2 (2022), $62,823.0 (2022), $71,840.1 (2022)
* Poverty rate: 0,2% (3,65$) (2021), 0,8% (3,65$) (2021), 0,3% (3,65$) (2019), 0% (3,65$) (2021), 0% (3,65$) (2017)
== Development of income distribution as a stochastic process ==
It is difficult to create a realistic and not complicated theoretical model, because the forces determining the distribution of income (DoI) are varied and complex and they continuously interact and fluctuate.

In a model by Champernowne, the author assumes that the income scale is divided into an enumerable infinity of income ranges, which have uniform proportionate distribution. The development through time of the DoI between ranges is regarded to be a stochastic process. The income of any person in one year may depend on the income in the previous year and on a chance of progress. Assuming that to every &quot;dying&quot; income receiver, there is an heir to his or her income in the following year, and vice versa. This implies that the number of incomes is constant through time.

Under these assumptions any historical development of the DoI can be described by the following vectors and matrices.

* formula_1 ... number of the income receivers in range r = 1, 2, ... in the initial year formula_2
* formula_3 ... matrix, that contains proportions of the occupants of r-th range in the year formula_4 shifted to the s-th range in the following year formula_5

The vector of the DoI can be expressed as

formula_6

The elements of proportion matrices can be estimated from historical data.

<text>Conley from &quot;O′Conghaile&quot; or Ó Conghalaigh (“hound valiant”) is a surname of Irish or Manx origin. The anglicized forms Conneely, Connealy, and Cunneely emerged due to the loss of the &quot;gh&quot; sound, which lengthened the second syllable of Conghal. In Connacht, these forms are often shortened from McNeilly, derived from Mac Conghaile. Another possible origin is the West Cork name Mac Coingheallaigh or Ó Coingheallaigh, meaning &quot;faithful to pledges.&quot; Historically, O&#x27;Connolly was a principal name of County Monaghan.

Conley is also used as a male given name, anglicized from Old Irish Conláed, meaning &quot;constant fire,&quot; which combines cunnail (&quot;prudent, constant&quot;) and áed (&quot;fire&quot;). Alternatively, it could be a compound name from Old Irish cond (&quot;intellect,&quot; &quot;mind,&quot; or &quot;king&quot;) or cenn (&quot;head, chief&quot;) and ley, an Anglo-Norman term for &quot;field, meadow, or forest clearing.&quot; Conley is a variant spelling of Connelly, Connley, and Connolly.

<doc id="457429" wikidata="Q7708488" url="?curid=457429" title="United States textile workers' strike of 1934">
<text>The United States textile workers&#x27; strike of 1934, colloquially known later as The Uprising of &#x27;34 was the largest textile strike in the labor history of the United States, involving 400,000 textile workers from New England, the Mid-Atlantic states and the U.S. Southern states, lasting twenty-two days.

==The background to the strike==
The textile industry, once concentrated in New England with outposts in New Jersey and Philadelphia, had started moving South in the 1880s. By 1933 Southern mills produced more than seventy percent of cotton and woolen textiles in more modern mills, drawing on the pool of dispossessed farmers and laborers willing to work for roughly forty percent less than their Northern counterparts. As was the rest of economic life, the textile industry was strictly segregated and drew only from white workers in the Piedmont. Until 1965, when passage of the Civil Rights Act broke the color line in hiring, less than 2% of textile workers were African American.

Throughout the 1920s, however, the mills faced an intractable problem of overproduction, as the wartime boom for cotton goods ended, while foreign competition cut into their markets. Although manufacturers tried to reduce the oversupply by forming industry associations to regulate competition, their favored solution to the crisis was to squeeze more work out of their employees through what workers called the &quot;stretch-out&quot;: speeding up production by increasing the number of looms assigned to each factory hand, limiting break times, paying workers by piece rates, and increasing the number of supervisors to keep workers from slowing down, talking or leaving work.

The stretch-out sparked hundreds of strikes throughout the Southeast: by one count, there were more than eighty strikes in South Carolina in 1929 alone. While most of them were short-lived, these strikes were almost all spontaneous walkouts, without any union – or other – leadership.

That year also saw the massive strikes that began in Gastonia, North Carolina, and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which were violently suppressed by local police and vigilantes. Here again, workers were often more militant than their trade union leadership: to take one striking example, the workers at the Loray Mill in Gastonia walked out under the leadership of the communist-led National Textile Workers Union. The Communist Party founded the NTWU in its short-lived attempt to create revolutionary unions.

In the meantime, the Great Depression made matters worse. The economic collapse drove a number of New England and Mid-Atlantic manufacturers into bankruptcy, while those employers who survived laid off workers and increased the amount and pace of work for their employees even further. Textile workers across the region, from worsted workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts and silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, to cotton millhands in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in hundreds of isolated strikes, even though there were thousands of unemployed workers desperate to take their places.

==Rising hopes under the New Deal==
The election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) appeared to change things. The NIRA, which Roosevelt signed in June 1933, called for cooperation among business, labor and government and established the National Recovery Administration (NRA). It was to oversee the creation of codes of conduct for particular industries that would reduce overproduction, raise wages, control hours of work, guarantee the rights of workers to form unions, and stimulate an economic recovery.

The NIRA rarely, if ever, lived up to its promises: employers usually dominated the panels that created these codes, which often offered far less than what workers and their unions demanded, and the NIRA and the codes themselves were toothless, since the Act did not provide any effective means to enforce the standards.

Even so, the promise of the right to join a union had an electrifying effect on textile workers: the United Textile Workers (UTW), which had no more than 15,000 members in February, 1933, grew to 250,000 members by June, 1934, of whom roughly half were cotton mill workers. Textile workers also put tremendous faith in the NIRA to bring an end to the stretch-out, or at least temper its worst features. As one union organizer said, textile workers in the South saw the NIRA as something that &quot;God has sent to them.&quot;

The NIRA quickly promulgated a code for the cotton industry regulating workers&#x27; hours and establishing a minimum wage; it also established a committee to study the problem of workloads. In the meantime, however, the employers responded to the new minimum wages by increasing the pace of work. When the labor board set a forty-hour work week, mill owners required the same amount of work in those forty hours as they had in the previous fifty- to sixty-hour week.

By August 1934, workers had filed nearly 4,000 complaints to the labor board protesting &quot;code chiseling&quot; by their employers; the board found in favor of only one worker. Union supporters often lost their jobs and found themselves blacklisted throughout the industry. Workers, both north and south, wrote thousands of letters to the White House, the Department of Labor, the NRA, and Eleanor Roosevelt asking for them to intervene.

In what proved to be a dry run of the larger strike to follow, cotton mill workers in South Carolina&#x27;s Horse Creek Valley struck to force employers to live up to the code, only to face special deputies, highway patrolmen and a machine-gun unit of the National Guard sent to keep the mills open. When the NIRA&#x27;s special board came to Horse Creek, it did not respond to the workers&#x27; complaints, but urged them to return to work. When they attempted to do so, the mill owners not only refused to allow the workers back, but evicted them from company housing. The NIRA took no action to stop the employers from violating the codes.

==First steps toward a national strike==
When the mill owners made the cotton mill employees&#x27; hours larger still further – with the blessing of the NRA – without raising their hourly wage rates in May, 1934, the UTW threatened a national strike. This talk was largely bluster; the union had made no preparations for a strike that size. When the NRA promised to give the UTW a seat on the board, balanced by the addition of another industry representative, the UTW canceled the planned strike.

While the UTW called off its plans for a strike, local leaders thought differently. The UTW locals in the northern part of Alabama launched a strike that began on July 18 in Huntsville, then spread to Florence, Anniston, Gadsden, and Birmingham. While the strike was popular, it was also ineffective: many employers welcomed it as a means of cutting their expenses, since they had warehouses full of unsold goods.

In Columbus, Georgia, a city on the Alabama border, the Georgia Webbing and Tape Company had been on strike since July. On August 10, 1934 Reuben Sanders was killed in a scuffle between strikebreakers and strikers. &quot;Eight thousand people viewed Sander&#x27;s body as it lay in state at the Central Textile Hall in the heart of the city on Sunday, August 12.&quot;

The UTW called a special convention in New York City on Monday, August 13, 1934 to address the crisis. The UTW drew up a list of demands for the industry as a whole: a thirty-hour week, minimum wages ranging from $13.00 to $30.00 a week, elimination of the stretch-out, union recognition, and reinstatement of workers fired for their union activities. The delegates, especially those from the southern states, voted overwhelmingly to strike the cotton mills on September 1, 1934 if these demands were not met. They planned to bring out the woolen, silk and rayon workers at a date to be set later.

Mill owners had seen the strike threat as more empty talk from the union. The White House took a largely &quot;hands off&quot; attitude, leaving it to the first National Labor Relations Board to set up a meeting of the parties. The employers refused to meet with the union.

==The strike begins==
The strike swept through Southern cotton mills, outpacing the union organizers and employing &quot;flying squadrons&quot; which traveled by truck and on foot from mill to mill, calling the workers out. In Gastonia, where authorities had violently suppressed a strike led by the National Textile Workers Union in 1929, an estimated 5,000 people marched in the September 3rd Labor Day parade. The next day union organizers estimated that 20,000 out of the 25,000 textile workers in the county were out on strike.

It is not clear whether the UTW expected to have this much success so easily and so quickly in the South; it had only shallow roots and few regular organizers in that region. But Southern textile workers had a good deal of experience in confronting management, both by impromptu strikes and other means, and a deep well of bitterness against their employers.

Some workers converted their experience into a nearly messianic belief in the power of unionism to take them out of bondage. One labor official made the connection in Biblical terms: &quot;The first strike on record was the strike in which Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt. They too struck against intolerable conditions&quot;.

Textile workers in the North went out on strike in great numbers as well, although they were spread more evenly across different industries and had more diverse grievances than the Southern cotton mill workers. Within a week, almost 400,000 textile workers nationwide had left their jobs and the textile industry was shut down.

Music also played an important role in the strike as radio stations looking for an audience located themselves near mill stations spreading information to workers and giving them a better sense of community. The stations would mainly play music that was popular and well known among the workers.

==Reaction from the authorities==

The mill owners were initially taken by surprise by the scope of the strike. They immediately took the position that these flying squadrons were, in fact, coercing their employees to go out on strike.

Governor Blackwood of South Carolina took up this theme, announcing that he would deputize the state&#x27;s &quot;mayors, sheriffs, peace officers and every good citizen&quot; to maintain order, then called out the National Guard with orders to shoot to kill any picketers who tried to enter the mills. Governor Ehringhaus of North Carolina followed suit on September 5.

Millowners persuaded local authorities throughout the Piedmont to augment their forces by swearing in special deputies, often their own employees or local residents opposed to the strike; in other cases they simply hired private guards to police the areas around the plant. Violence between guards and picketers broke out almost immediately. The major known incidents include:
* On September 2, a picketer and mill guard died in a shootout in Trion, Georgia
* On September 2, guards killed two picketers in Augusta, Georgia
* On September 3, the Saylesville Massacre was committed by the Rhode Island State Guard. Four picketers were killed and 132 injured.
* On September 6, the Chiquola Mill Massacre saw seven picketers killed and thirty others wounded as they fled the picketline (Honea Path, South Carolina)

Authorities ordered out the National Guard elsewhere in the second week of the strike. Governor Green sent the Guard to Saylesville, Rhode Island after several thousand strikers and sympathizers trapped several hundred strikebreakers in a factory. Governor Green declared martial law in the area on September 11, after picketers armed with rocks, flowerpots and broken headstones from a nearby cemetery battled troops armed with machine guns, in a 36-hour incident that resembled a civic insurrection. Casualty figures vary. A granite marker erected at one of the battle sites names four workers who died in the Saylesville conflict.

Another picketer was shot to death the following day, about five miles away in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, when guardsmen fired into the crowd attempting to storm the Woonsocket Rayon Plant. Governor Green then asked the federal government to send federal troops; the Roosevelt administration ignored the request.

Maine deployed the Guard in a more tactical manner, sending them to Augusta and Lewiston to discourage wavering employees from joining the strike. That tactic did not work, however, everywhere: workers at Pepperell Mills&#x27; plant in Biddeford and York Manufacturing&#x27;s plant in Saco went out even though the guard was sent to prevent the arrival of flying squadrons rumored to be coming from New Bedford, Massachusetts.

Governor Wilbur L. Cross of Connecticut also mobilized the Guard, but did not declare martial law. Instead the state labor commissioner met with picketers during the second week of the strike and brought about a reduction in tensions by urging strikers to respect the law and not hurl epithets at strikebreakers.

Things were different in Georgia, where Governor Eugene Talmadge declared martial law in the third week of the strike and directed the National Guard to arrest all picketers throughout the state, holding them in a former World War I prisoner of war camp for trial by a military tribunal. While the state only interned a hundred or so picketers, the show of force effectively ended picketing throughout most of the state.

==End of the strike==
The strike was, in fact, already falling apart, particularly in the South, where local government refused to provide any relief assistance to strikers and there were few sympathetic churches or unions to provide support. Although the union had pledged before the walkout began to feed strikers, it was wholly unable to fulfill this promise. While roughly half of the textile workers in North and South Carolina and roughly three fourths in Georgia were on strike at this point, with similar figures in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, workers had started to drift back to work and struck plants were reopening, if with only skeleton crews.

At that point the mediation board that Roosevelt had appointed in the first week of the strike issued its report. As was typical of federal commissions of this era, the board temporized, urging further studies of the economic plight of the employers and the effects of the stretch-out on their employees. It urged the President to create a new Textile Labor Relations Board to hear workers&#x27; complaints and urged employers not to discriminate against strikers.

President Roosevelt announced his support for the report, then urged employees to return to work and the manufacturers to accept the commission&#x27;s recommendations. The UTW took the opportunity to declare victory and held a number of parades to celebrate the end of the strike.

In fact, the strike was a total defeat for the union, particularly in the South. The union had not forced the mill owners to recognize it or obtained any of its economic demands. The employers refused, moreover, to reinstate strikers throughout the South, while the Cotton Textile National Industrial Relations Board never ceded any authority to any other board. Thousands of strikers never returned to work in the mills.

==Aftermath==
In March 1935, approximately 2,000 textile workers at Callaway Mills went on strike in LaGrange, Georgia, and martial law was declared in the city. At least one striker was killed by National Guardsmen as the soldiers evicted families from mill-owned homes. Some consider the 1935 strike in LaGrange to be the last throes of the General Textile Strike. Ironically, President Roosevelt was a friend and frequent visitor of Cason Callaway, President of Callaway Mills at the time.

The strike represented the high point for union hopes of organizing textile workers in the South for the next several decades. When the CIO formed the Textile Workers Organizing Committee (TWOC) three years later, TWOC focused on northern manufacturers outside the cotton industry. TWOC&#x27;s successor, the Textile Workers Union of America, faced similar problems organizing in the South; the CIO&#x27;s postwar organizing drive in the South fell apart chiefly because of its inability to organize textile workers there.

The union might have escaped this disaster if it had characterized the strike as a first step, rather than attempting to pass it off as a victory. That, however, would have required that the union also devote the resources necessary to follow up with renewed, systematic organizing efforts in the immediate aftermath of the strike, instead of concerning itself with the futile effort to win reinstatement for discharged strikers through the Textile Labor Board. The memory of blacklisting and defeat soured many Southern textile workers on unions for decades.

The 1934 defeat was less cataclysmic in the North, in that the strike was in fact, a number of separate events, commencing at different times in separate industries and in furtherance of local goals. Northern employers were not as ruthless in blacklisting workers and the TWOC made some headway in organizing these plants in the years that followed. Those victories were impermanent, however, as much of northern industry either went South or went bankrupt in the years that followed.

Anti-union sentiment in the South kept wages low for decades, but also acted as a catalyst for development later when industries moved there from the North and Midwest because of lower costs. Employers resisted integrating textile mills; when they were forced to do so by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, researchers found that African Americans were accepted overall by other employees, although they continued to face discrimination in job training and advancement. By the time this occurred, many jobs in the textile industry were already moving overseas, a trend that accelerated in the 1980s.

<text>Roy Warren Spencer (born December 20, 1955) is an American meteorologist and climate scientist. He is a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA&#x27;s Aqua satellite. He has served as senior scientist for climate studies at NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center. He is known for his satellite-based temperature monitoring work, for which he was awarded the American Meteorological Society&#x27;s Special Award. Regarding climate change, Spencer is a &quot;lukewarmer&quot;, with the view that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have caused some warming, but that influence is small compared to natural variations in global average cloud cover. He wrote several political books slamming what he calls &quot;hysteria&quot; about climate change, he says hurt both science and the people.

==Education and career==
Spencer received a BS in atmospheric sciences from the University of Michigan in 1978 and his MS and PhD in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1980 and 1982. His doctoral thesis was titled, &quot;A case study of African wave structure and energetics during Atlantic transit&quot;.

After receiving his PhD in 1982, Spencer worked for two years as a research scientist in the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He then joined NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center as a visiting scientist in 1984, where he later became senior scientist for climate studies. After leaving NASA in 2001, Spencer has been a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). As well as his position at UAH, Spencer is currently the U.S. Science Team leader for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on NASA&#x27;s Aqua satellite, a position he has held since 1994.

In 2001, he designed an algorithm to detect tropical cyclones and estimate their maximum sustained wind speed using the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU).

Spencer has been a member of several science teams: the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Space Station Accommodations Analysis Study Team, Science Steering Group for TRMM, TOVS Pathfinder Working Group, NASA Headquarters Earth Science and Applications Advisory Subcommittee, and two National Research Council (NRC) study panels. He is on the board of directors of the George C. Marshall Institute, and on the board of advisors of the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation.

Spencer&#x27;s research work is funded by NASA, NOAA, DOE, and the DOT. He also received money from Peabody Energy.

==Peer-reviewed articles on climate change==

===Negative cloud feedback===
In 2007, Spencer and others published a paper in &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; regarding negative cloud feedback in the tropics that potentially supports Richard Lindzen&#x27;s Iris hypothesis, which proposes that as the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease, allowing infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere to outer space. Spencer stated, &quot;To give an idea of how strong this enhanced cooling mechanism is, if it was operating on global warming, it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent. [...] Right now, all climate models predict that clouds will amplify warming. I&#x27;m betting that if the climate models&#x27; &#x27;clouds&#x27; were made to behave the way we see these clouds behave in nature, it would substantially reduce the amount of climate change the models predict for the coming decades.&quot;

===Cloud formation and temperature change===
In 2008, Spencer and William Braswell published a paper in the &quot;Journal of Climate&quot; which suggests that natural variations in how clouds form could actually be causing temperature changes, rather than the other way around, and could also lead to overestimates of how sensitive the Earth&#x27;s climate is to greenhouse gas emissions. Spencer stated, &quot;Our paper is an important step toward validating a gut instinct that many meteorologists like myself have had over the years, [...] that the climate system is dominated by stabilizing processes, rather than destabilizing processes – that is, negative feedback rather than positive feedback.&quot;

===Energy lost to space as compared to climate models===
In 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper in &quot;Remote Sensing&quot; concluding that more energy is radiated back to space and released earlier than previously thought. Spencer stated, &quot;The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show. There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans.&quot;

The paper was criticized by climate scientists. Kerry Emanuel of MIT, said this work was cautious and limited mostly to pointing out problems with forecasting heat feedback, and that the interpretations of the study by non-scientists have &quot;no basis in reality.&quot;

The editor-in-chief of &quot;Remote Sensing&quot;, Wolfgang Wagner, later resigned over publication of Spencer and Braswell (2011), stating, &quot;From a purely formal point of view, there were no errors with the review process. [...] the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view ...but that it essentially ignored the scientific arguments of its opponents. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal.&quot; Wagner added he, &quot;would also like to personally protest against how the authors and like-minded climate skeptics have much exaggerated the paper&#x27;s conclusions in public statements&quot;.

Andrew Dessler later published a paper opposing the claims of Spencer and Braswell (2011) in &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot;. He stated, among other things:
==Views==

===Climate change===
Spencer has published two books on climate change: In 2008, &quot;Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that Hurt the Poor&quot;, and in 2010, &quot;The Great Global Warming Blunder: How Mother Nature Fooled the World&#x27;s Top Climate Scientists&quot;.

He believes that most climate change is natural in origin, the result of long-term changes in the Earth&#x27;s albedo and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have caused some warming, but that its warming influence is small compared to natural, internal, chaotic fluctuations in global average cloud cover. At that time the IPCC hold the view that .

In February 2014 Spencer posted on his blog that he was going to start referring to those who referred to those questioning the mainstream view of global warming (such as Spencer himself) as &quot;climate change deniers&quot; as &quot;global warming Nazis&quot;, contending that &quot;...these people are supporting policies that will kill far more people than the Nazis ever did.&quot; The Anti-Defamation League responded with a statement condemning Spencer&#x27;s comparison. Shelley Rose, the ADL&#x27;s Southeast Interim Regional Director, argued that the comparison of global warming advocates to Nazis was &quot;outrageous and deeply offensive,&quot; and &quot;This analogy is just the latest example of a troubling epidemic of comparisons to Hitler and the Holocaust.&quot;

===Intelligent design===
Spencer believes in the pseudoscience of intelligent design which was criticized by Phil Plait, in &quot;Slate&quot; as advocating &quot;warmed-over creationism&quot;. Spencer&#x27;s views on the matter were used as an example in an exploration by the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; as a possible connection between climate change denial and creationism.

<doc id="457431" wikidata="Q204122" url="?curid=457431" title="Spanair">
<text>Spanair S.A. was a Spanish airline, with its head office in the Spanair Building in L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat, near Barcelona. Until 2009, it was a subsidiary of the SAS Group; the same parent company in control of Scandinavian Airlines and held slightly under 20% of the company. Spanair provided a scheduled passenger network within Spain and Europe, with an extension to West Africa. Worldwide charters were also flown for tour companies. Its main hub was Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport, with focus cities at Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport and Palma de Mallorca Airport. The airline had 3,161 employees and was a Star Alliance member from 2003 until its demise on 27 January 2012.

== History ==

===Foundation and early years===
The airline was established in December 1986 and began operations in March 1988. It was set up as a joint venture between Scandinavian Airlines and Viajes Marsans, and began operations with European charters. Long-haul flights to the United States, Mexico and the Dominican Republic were launched in 1991, followed by domestic scheduled flights in March 1994. The airline flew long-haul flights with Boeing 767-300ER aircraft to Washington and Buenos Aires in the late 1990s.

Spanair joined the Star Alliance on 1 May 2003.

SAS announced in a press release 13 June 2007 that it would sell its shares in Spanair. The divestment was cancelled on 19 June 2008 due to SAS not being able to sell for a price that it considered to &quot;reflect the underlying value in Spanair.&quot; On 30 January 2009, however, a one-euro bid from a group of investors from Catalonia, led by the Consorci de Turisme de Barcelona and Catalana d&#x27;Initiatives, was later accepted, whereupon SAS became a minority shareholder.

A report in the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; on the day of the 2008 Madrid crash suggests that staff were threatening strike action due to concerns about the company&#x27;s viability.

In 2009 the airline asked for public input on a new logo, with a winner being officially confirmed on 13 May 2009. As of June 2009, Spanair began applying the new corporate identity to their aircraft.

===Demise===
On 25 January 2011, the company was in an &quot;Emergency Financial Situation&quot;. The Catalan government approved a €10.5 million loan plan in order to save it. Revenue improved and the company began cutting costs. Financially troubled during its last few years, Spanair ended operations on 27 January 2012, after Qatar Airways pulled out of talks to inject cash into the airline. As a result, SAS had a write-down of 1.7 billion Swedish kronor ($251 million U.S.). Ana Pastor, the development minister of Spain, said that the Spanish government may fine the airline 9 million euros (US$12 million) after breaking serious aviation security rules by shutting down without proper notice. The carrier said all flights will remain suspended, but it did not say whether it planned to file for bankruptcy. The last passenger flight was JK1326 from Trondheim to Las Palmas.

==Corporate affairs==
===Head office===

Spanair&#x27;s head office was located in the Spanair Building (Edifici Spanair) in L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat, near Barcelona.

Previously Spanair&#x27;s head office was in the Spanair Building on the grounds of Palma de Mallorca Airport in Palma de Mallorca. In 2008, during the changes in ownership, Spanair said that its head office would remain in Palma de Mallorca, despite rumors that the company would relocate its head office to Barcelona.

In 2009 the company announced that it planned to relocate its corporate offices to Barcelona. In May 2009 Spanair made Barcelona its registered domicile. The airline began to search for a site for the Spanair headquarters in Barcelona. In June of that year around 200 employees protested outside of the Spanair offices in Palma, saying that the timetable to move the offices was too hasty.

===Service concept===
For economy-class passengers traveling within Western Europe the airline offered a buy on board service offering food and drinks for purchase. Spanair also had revamped their own frequent flyer programme which was renamed Spanair Star. It was innovative for allowing members to redeem points immediately, in the form of a discount on a future flight.

===Sponsorship===
Between 1995 and 2005, Spanair was the main kit sponsor of Spanish football club RCD Mallorca.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Spanair had codeshare agreements with the following airlines until of January 2012, Airlines marked with * were members of Star Alliance at the time of Spanair&#x27;s collapse.
==Fleet==


===Final fleet===
The Spanair fleet consisted of the following aircraft at the time of closure.

===Retired fleet===
Spanair operated the following aircraft before its closure:

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 10 May 2001, Spanair Flight 3203 (McDonnell Douglas MD-83 EC-FXI named &quot;Sunseeker&quot;) was substantially damaged when the starboard undercarriage collapsed while landing at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. All 45 passengers and 5 crew members on board safely evacuated from the aircraft by using the escape slides. The substantially-damaged aircraft was repaired and returned to service.
*On 20 August 2008 at 14:45 CEST, Spanair Flight 5022 (McDonnell Douglas MD-82 EC-HFP named &quot;Sunbreeze&quot;), crashed with 166 passengers and six crew members on board moments after takeoff at Madrid&#x27;s Barajas Airport on a scheduled flight to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Initially 19 of the 172 people aboard the aircraft survived, but one person died in a hospital three days after the crash. The initial investigation reports no deployment of flaps, with failures in the take-off warning system.

<text>Thaipusam or Thaipoosam (Tamil: Taippūcam, ) is a Tamil Hindu festival celebrated on the first full moon day of the Tamil month of Thai coinciding with Pusam star. The festival signifies that Lord Murugan is a Siddha and an enlightened being. On this auspicious day, he transcended from his physical form, a concept known as Mukthi in Hinduism. He dedicated his life to serving humanity and left behind a wealth of wisdom for society.

The festival includes ritualistic practices of Kavadi Aattam, a ceremonial act of sacrifice carrying a physical burden as a means of balancing a spiritual debt. Worshipers often carry a pot of cow milk as an offering and also do mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with &quot;vel&quot; skewers. Devotees prepare for the rituals by keeping clean, doing regular prayers, following a vegetarian diet and fasting while remaining celibate.

Thaipusam is observed by Tamils in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia notably in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. It is also observed by other countries with significant Tamil diaspora like Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa, Canada, the Caribbean countries including Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, and in countries with significant Indian migrants like the United States. It is a public holiday in Mauritius, select states in Malaysia and in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

== Etymology ==
Thaipusam is a portmanteau of two Tamil words: Tamil month of Thai and the name of the star Pusam, denoting the day of occurrence of the festival.

== Theology ==
According to the Kanda Puranam (the Tamil version of the Skanda Purana), three asuras (a race of celestial beings) Surapadman, Tarakasuran, and Singamukhan performed austerities to propitiate the Hindu god Shiva. Shiva granted them various boons which gave them near-immortality and the ability to conquer the three worlds. They subsequently started a reign of tyranny in their respective realms and oppressed the celestial beings including the devas and other people. The devas pleaded Shiva for his assistance to put an end to the reign of Surapadman and the asuras. In response, Shiva manifested five additional heads and a divine spark emerged from each of the six heads. Initially, the wind-god Vayu carried the sparks, but the fire-god Agni took possession of them afterwards because of the unbearable heat. Agni deposited the sparks in the Ganga river. The water in the Ganga started evaporating due to intense heat, and so the goddess Ganga took them to the Saravana lake, where each of the sparks developed into a baby boy. The six boys were raised by handmaidens known as the Kṛttikās and they were later fused into one by Parvati, thus giving rise to the six-headed Murugan. 

Parvati granted him a divine spear known as the vel. Murugan was accompanied by Virabahu who served as his commander-in-chief and eight others, who were sons bore by nine shaktis who arose from the gems of the broken anklet of Parvati, when she ran from her seat due to the heat generated by the sparks emanating from Shiva. Along with the armies of the devas, Murugan waged war on the asuras. Murugan split Surapadman into two with his vel and the two halves transformed into a mango tree and later into a peacock and a rooster. Murugan adopted the peacock as his mount and took the rooster as his flag. Thaipusam festival is celebrated to commemorate the victory of Murugan over the Surapadman.

Murugan is a deity associated with yogic discipline and austerities in Hinduism and is regarded by his adherents to be capable of offering mukti (spiritual liberation) to those who venerate him.

== Occurrence ==
Thaipusam occurs anually and is celebrated on the full moon day in the Tamil month of Thai on the confluence of star Pusam like other festivals.

== Practices ==
Kavadi Aattam is a ceremonial act of sacrifice and offering practiced by devotees during the Thaipusam festival. It forms a central part of the festival and symbolizes a form of debt bondage. &quot;Kavadi&quot; (meaning &quot;burden&quot; in Tamil) is a physical burden which consists of a semicircular piece of wood or steel which are bent and attached to a cross structure in its simplest form, that is balanced on the shoulders of the devotee. By bearing the Kavadi, the devotees implore Murugan for assistance, usually as a means of balancing a spiritual debt or on behalf of a loved one who is in need of help or healing. Worshipers often carry one or more pots of cow milk as an offering (&quot;pal kavadi&quot;) or other objects such as sugarcane, tender coconut, and flowers. The most extreme and spectacular practice is the carrying of &quot;Vel kavadi&quot;, a portable altar up to tall and weighing up to , decorated with peacock feathers and is attached to the body of the devotee through multiple skewers and metal hooks pierced into the skin on the chest and back.

People also do a form of mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with &quot;vel&quot; skewers and flagellation. Since public self mutilation is prohibited by Indian law, these practices are limited in India. Vibuthi, a type of holy ash is spread across the body including the piercing sites. Drumming and chanting of verses help the devotees enter a state of trance. Devotees usually prepare for the rituals by keeping clean, doing regular prayers, following a vegetarian diet and fasting while remaining celibate. They make pilgrimage with bare feet and dance along the route while bearing these burdens.

<text>Stanage Edge, or simply Stanage (from &quot;stone edge&quot;) is a gritstone escarpment in the Peak District, England, famous as a location for climbing. It lies a couple of miles to the north of Hathersage, and the northern part of the edge forms the border between the High Peak of Derbyshire and Sheffield in South Yorkshire. Its highest point is High Neb at above sea level. Areas of Stanage were quarried in the past to produce grindstones, and some can still be seen on the hillside—carved, but never removed.

==Features==
A paved packhorse road ran along the top of the edge, and remains of it can be seen, as can remains of the Long Causeway, once thought to be a Roman road which works its way over the edge on its route from Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe, crossing Hallam Moor and passing Stanedge Pole (note the slightly different spelling), an ancient waymarker on the route to Sheffield. Some cairns along the top are even older, and there is a well-known cave in the cliff known as Robin Hood&#x27;s Cave. More recent features include early 20th-century drinking basins, designed to collect pure rainwater for grouse to drink.

During the construction of the Rivelin tunnel a sighting tower was constructed on the edge to assist in surveying the route of the tunnel. All that remains of the tower is a heap of stones at Ordnance Survey grid reference .

==Sport==
===Rock climbing===

Stanage&#x27;s naturally weathered Millstone Grit face is now known as a highly popular location for rock climbing in the Peak District. The edge runs three miles north from the Cowper Stone to Stanage End. It is the northernmost of an almost continuous line of cliffs, including Burbage Rocks, Froggatt Edge, Curbar Edge, Baslow Edge and Birchen Edge. The Cowper Stone is a block of gritstone at the most southerly point of Stanage. Set alone a few hundred metres from the last buttress of the main crag, it is a large boulder with distinctive rounded breaks running across it. It is the scene of some classic hard-grit routes of the 1980s first climbed by protagonists such as Johnny Dawes and John Allen. The Edge was notably omitted from the first rock climbing guidebook to the Peak District, &quot;Some Gritstone Climbs&quot; by John Laycock, published in 1913, due to the then severe access restrictions to the land. It has subsequently been featured regularly in over a century of regular climbing guidebooks, which document the growth in the number of routes and the rise in climbing standards.

Although the edge reaches only 25 metres in height it is one of the most famous UK climbing venues: aside from having a multitude of routes close to a major population centre, it is home to the route Right Unconquerable (HVS 5a), which, when first climbed by Joe Brown in 1949, was considered a milestone achievement in British climbing. In spite of its height, the edge is home to the longest recorded rock route in the United Kingdom; the 5000m Girdle Traverse, completed by Ron Fawcett in 1992 and graded &quot;E5 6b(ish)&quot;.

===Running===
Stanage is a magnet for walkers and runners. The Fat Boys Stanage Struggle is a popular local fell race that starts in Hathersage—altitude —and routes up to and along Stanage Edge to High Neb——before returning to the village below. The 19 September 2021 edition of the event was won in a time of 40m 51s by Michael Kenyon of Dronfield Running Club; there were 224 finishers.

==In popular culture==
The location has featured in films and television series, most notably in the 2005 film &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; during a scene in which Elizabeth Bennet (portrayed by Keira Knightley) is seen facing the horizon from the Edge.

<text>Chimalman or Chīmalmā /t͡ʃiːmalmaː/ is a goddess in Aztec mythology, and was considered by the Aztecs to be the mother of the Toltec gods Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl. Her name means &quot;shield-hand.&quot;

Several oral traditions say that Chimalman is a spirit which accompanied the Azteca from the homeland of Aztlán. Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl were spiritual entities adopted from the Toltec legacy when the Azteca lived among the Chichimeca. As with many Aztec myths, there are multiple versions of the Chīmalmā story depending on which tribe and time period is examined.

==Mother of Quetzalcoatl==
According to the &quot;Manuscript of 1558&quot;, section 7, the begetting of Quetzalcoatl happened in this way:
&quot;And then when Mixcoatl went to... Huitznahuac, the woman Chimalman came out to confront him... She stood naked, without skirt or shift.&quot;
While she stood thus, Mixcoatl shot an arrow &quot;between her legs&quot;—on two occasions. &quot;And when this had occurred, he took the woman of Huitznauac, the one who is Chimalman, and lay with her and so she became pregnant.&quot;
Another version indicates that Mixcoatl saw Chimalman while hunting in the Morelos valley and fell in love with her. When his efforts to approach her failed, he became angry and shot five arrows at her, all of which she caught in her bare hand. She was given the name &quot;shield-hand&quot; and they were later married, but unable to conceive a child. After praying on the altar of Quetzalcoatl, the priest told Chimalman to swallow a small precious stone, after which she became pregnant. This angered Quetzalcoatl&#x27;s brother, Tezcatlipoca, such that he persuaded others to kill Mixcoatl. Chimalman fled to her hometown of Tepoztlan and died giving birth to her son Topiltzin. Topiltzin would later discover his identity as Quetzalcoatl and that he was sent to help the Toltec civilization. This version is similar to the &quot;Codex Chimalpopoca&quot;, that indicated, &quot;...Quetzalcoatl was placed in her belly when she swallowed a piece of jade.&quot;

<doc id="457455" wikidata="Q189512" url="?curid=457455" title="Zeng Guofan">
<text>Zeng Guofan, Marquis Yiyong (; 26 November 1811 – 12 March 1872), birth name Zeng Zicheng, courtesy name Bohan (), was a Chinese statesman and military general of the late Qing dynasty. He is best known for raising and organizing the Xiang Army to aid the Qing military in suppressing the Taiping Rebellion and restoring the stability of the Qing Empire. Along with other prominent figures such as Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang of his time, Zeng set the scene for the Tongzhi Restoration, an attempt to arrest the decline of the Qing dynasty. Zeng was known for his strategic perception, administrative skill and noble personality on Confucian practice, but also for his ruthlessness in repressing rebellions.

==Early life==

Born Zeng Zicheng in Xiangxiang, Hunan Province in 1811, Zeng was the grandson of Zeng Yuping, a farmer with social and political ambitions. He was also a descendant of the philosopher Zengzi, a student of Confucius. He studied in Yuelu Academy in Changsha Prefecture, where he passed the prefectural examination in 1833, only a year after his father, Zeng Linshu. He passed the provincial examination (&quot;juren&quot;) a year later, and by 1838, at age 27, he had passed the imperial examination, a prestigious achievement in China. He had earned the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree, the highest level in the civil service examinations, which led to his appointment to the Hanlin Academy, a body of outstanding Chinese literary scholars who performed literary tasks for the imperial court. It was at the Hanlin Academy where Zeng changed his given name to &quot;Guofan&quot;, which sounded more prestigious. Zeng served in Beijing for more than 13 years, and remained devoted to the interpretation of the Confucian classics. He moved relatively quickly up the ranks with the aid of his teacher, Mujangga; within five years, he had become a second-grade official.

==Entry into imperial politics==
In 1843, Zeng was appointed as the chief literary examiner in Sichuan Province. Six years later, he was made Senior Deputy Secretary of the Board of Rites. When holding the office of Military Examiner (1851), he was compelled by the death of his mother to return to Hunan Province to carry out filial mourning, which is supposed to last three years. Around the time, the Taiping rebels had overrun Hunan Province and captured the cities and strongholds on both shores of the Yangtze River. By a special decree, Zeng was ordered to assist the provincial governor in raising a volunteer force, and, on his own initiative, he built a fleet of war junks and multiple arsenals, with which he attacked the rebels. This force eventually became known as the Xiang Army (a.k.a. Hunan Army or Chu Army). In training and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng emphasized &quot;family ties, individual responsibility, flexible yet responsible discipline, enhanced military pay, respect for intellectuals serving in the army, and a strong bond between officers and soldiers.&quot; In his first engagement with the rebels, Zeng was defeated, but his lieutenants were more successful. They recovered the provincial capital, Changsha, and destroyed the rebel fleet. Following up these victories of his subordinates, Zeng recaptured Wuchang and Hanyang, near Hankou, and was rewarded for his success by being appointed vice-president of the Board of War. The Xiang Army under Zeng contained some integrated Hangzhou drill groups.

==Fame and military campaigns==
In 1853, other triumphs led to Zeng being made a &quot;baturu&quot;, and to his being decorated with a yellow riding-jacket. Meanwhile, in his absence, the rebels retook Wuchang and burnt the protecting fleet. The tide quickly turned, however, on May 1, 1854, Zeng defeated the Taiping at Xiangtan and in July at Yuezhou. Zeng succeeded in clearing the country round Poyang Lake, and subsequently in ridding Jiangsu Province of the rebels. In January–February 1855 the Xiang Army sufferers a disastrous defeat at Jiujiang, Jiangxi, leading to Zeng attempting suicide. His father died in 1857, and after a brief mourning he was ordered to take supreme command in Zhejiang Province, and to cooperate with the governor of Fujian Province in defence.

Subsequently, the rebels were driven westwards, and Zeng would have started in pursuit had he not been called on to clear Anhui Province of rebel forces. In June 1860, he was appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang (covering Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces) and Imperial Commissioner, overseeing military affairs. At this time, and for some time previously, he had been fortunate in having the active support of Zuo Zongtang, who at a later period recovered Kashgar for the Qing Empire, and of Li Hongzhang. Like all true leaders of men, Zeng knew how to reward good service, and when occasion offered he appointed the former to the governorship of Zhejiang and the latter to that of Jiangsu. In 1862, he was appointed Assistant Grand Secretary of State. At this time, the Qing imperial forces, assisted by the Ever Victorious Army, had checked the progress of the Taiping Rebellion, and Zeng was able to carry out a scheme which he had long formulated of besieging Tianjing, the rebel capital. While Charles George Gordon of the Ever Victorious Army was clearing the cities on the lower waters of the Yangtze River with support from Li Hongzhang, Zeng drew closer his besieging lines around the city.

In July 1864, Tianjing fell into Zeng&#x27;s hands, and he was rewarded with the noble peerage &quot;First Class Marquis Yiyong&quot; () and the right to wear the double-eyed peacock&#x27;s feather. He, Zuo Zongtang and Li Hongzhang were collectively called &quot;Zeng, Zuo, Li&quot; – the military leaders who suppressed the Taiping Rebellion. After the suppression of the rebellion, the Nian Rebellion, closely related to the former Taiping movement, broke out in Shandong Province, and Zeng was sent to quell it.

Success did not, however, always attend him on this campaign, and by imperial order he was relieved of his command by Li Hongzhang, who in the same way succeeded him as the Viceroy of Zhili, where, after the Tianjin Massacre (1870), Zeng failed to carry out the wishes of the imperial court. Instead of the desired policy towards foreigners, Zeng took on a more diplomatic stance. After this rebuff, he retired to his viceroyalty at Nanjing, where he died in 1872 mysteriously in Hong Xiuquan&#x27;s former mansion.

==Personal life==
Zeng was a voluminous writer. His papers addressed to the throne and his literary disquisitions are held in high esteem by Chinese scholars, who treasure the edition of his collected works in 156 books, which was edited by Li Hongzhang in 1876, as a memorial of a great and incorruptible statesman. Zeng enjoyed reading and held a special interest in the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot; and other Chinese classics.

Zeng called Hakka females &quot;big foot hillbilly witches&quot; during the Taiping Rebellion after encountering them for the first time.

Unlike his contemporaries, who had multiple wives or kept concubines, Zeng was officially married only once, to a woman of the Ouyang family when he was in his late teens. He had three sons and five daughters with her, and two of his eldest children died young. His eldest son, Zeng Jize, who inherited his noble peerage &quot;First Class Marquis Yiyong&quot;, went on to become a famous diplomat in the late Qing dynasty.

Zeng&#x27;s ninth brother, Zeng Guoquan, was an ambitious general in the Xiang Army. He was later appointed Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1884. Zeng&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Zeng Baosun, was a feminist, historian, and Christian educator.

Zeng is said to be a descendant of Zengzi, who in turn was said to be a descendant of King Shao Kang of the Xia dynasty.

==Legacy==
Zeng&#x27;s legacy in history is twofold. On one hand he is criticised as a staunchly conservative traitor, but on another he is seen as a hero in preserving order and stability. Many in China and abroad admire his ability to successfully survive in the ruthless bureaucracy of the late Qing dynasty. Many have blamed Zeng for all the civilian losses and damages done during the Taiping Rebellion, while others criticise him for being too friendly with certain foreign ideas. Much Chinese language historiography, including numerous biographies, has questioned what made him fight for an essentially foreign dynasty. 

Since the Cultural Revolution, criticism of Zeng gradually began to disappear. Tang Haoming published in 1992 his three-book trilogy &quot;Zeng Guofan&quot;, a novelisation of Zeng&#x27;s life during and after the Taiping Rebellion. This trilogy characterised Zeng as a common person, but had adopted a much more positive view of Zeng. Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek also praised Zeng&#x27;s ability in military and political affairs.

In recent years, Zeng&#x27;s life and his works have been widely celebrated, especially as an example of local pride in Hunan Province. Zeng&#x27;s leadership and military skills had been used by many as a new field of thought aiding in business or bureaucratic dealings, as in the &quot;self-help&quot; &quot;99 Strategems from Zeng Guofan&quot;.

<text>Gretna () is a town in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, originally part of the historic county of Dumfriesshire. It is located close to the A74(M) on the border of Scotland and England and near the mouth of the River Esk. 

The town is situated east-south-east of Dumfries, east of Annan, north-west of Carlisle, south-east of Glasgow and south of Edinburgh.

==History==

===Etymology===
Gretna means &quot;(place at the) gravelly hill&quot;, from Old English &quot;greot&quot; &quot;grit&quot; (in the dative form greoten (which is where the -n comes from) and &quot;hoh&quot; &quot;hill-spur&quot;.

The Lochmaben Stone is a megalith standing in a field, nearly west of the Sark mouth on the Solway Firth, three hundred yards or so above high water mark on the farm of Old Graitney. It was one of the traditionally recognised meeting places on the England / Scotland border.

===17th century===
Prior to the Acts of Union 1707 of the Parliaments of England and Scotland, Gretna was a customs post for collecting taxes on cattle crossing the border between the two kingdoms. The Gretna customs post was established in 1612. A drove road was constructed between Gretna and Annan in 1619, possibly to facilitate the transportation of cattle from Wigtownshire, Kirkcudbrightshire and Dumfriesshire to markets in England.

===18th century===
Gretna&#x27;s principal claim to fame arose in 1753 when an Act of Parliament, &quot;Lord Hardwicke&#x27;s Marriage Act&quot;, was passed in England, which provided that consent to the marriage had to be given by the parents if both parties were not at least 21 years old. This Act did not apply in Scotland, which allowed boys to marry at 14 and girls at 12, with or without parental consent. The Act also required procedures that gave notice of an impending marriage to the community. As a result, many elopers fled England, and the first Scottish village they reached was often Gretna. The act was repealed in 1849.

===World War I===
HM Factory, Gretna, codenamed &quot;Moorside&quot;, was a cordite munitions factory built between Gretna Green and the Solway Firth to supply ammunition to British forces during World War I. This developed into the town of Gretna.

==Transport==

===Rail===
In the 1840s, there were three main railway companies building lines around Gretna, and this resulted in three railway stations named &quot;Gretna&quot;. The first station called &quot;Gretna&quot; was opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway on 23 August 1843. The station was renamed Gretna Green railway station in April 1852. It closed on 6 December 1965, but a new station was opened by British Rail nearby on 20 September 1993. The station is served by Glasgow South Western Line. This station had a new platform added in 2009, to coincide with the redoubling of this section of track. The other two stations were located a short distance to the east of Gretna, over the border in England. Gretna (Caledonian) railway station was opened on 9 September 1847 by the Caledonian Railway on its main line between Carlisle and Glasgow and Edinburgh. The station closed on 10 September 1951. The North British Railway built Gretna (Border Union) railway station next to the Caledonian station, at Gretna junction, on its short link to the Border Union Railway. The station opened on 1 November 1861 and closed during World War One on 9 August 1915.

===Roads===
A military road was built in 1763 by General Wade linking Gretna to Portpatrick, then the main ferry port to Northern Ireland. This was later to become the route of much of the A75 road to Stranraer. The original route between Gretna and Annan is now the B721 road, and the A75 diverges significantly from it; similarly, the B724 was the original route between Annan and Dumfries.

The main Anglo-Scottish trunk road running north-south through Gretna was the A74 road. With the opening of the M6 motorway to the south of Carlisle in December 1970, most of the A74 in Scotland was upgraded to motorway, these upgraded sections were renamed the A74(M). The &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; was the remaining of non-upgraded dual-carriageway A74 between the northern terminus of the M6 at Carlisle.

In 2008, the six remaining miles were upgraded to a three-lane motorway.

==Sport==
Gretna was the official home of Gretna Football Club, who played in the Scottish Premier League during the 2007–2008 season. A reformed club, Gretna F.C. 2008 is based in Gretna.

AFC Gretna are the town&#x27;s amateur football team who like to give local players a chance. The club, based in the nearby Springfield, played in the DSAFL. However, they now play in the Carlisle City Sunday League system.

Border Towns United are another amateur football team in the town, formed in 2022. The club also play in the Carlisle City Sunday League system in the same league as AFC Gretna. They play at the Graitney.

==Gretna Green==
Nearby Gretna Green, is traditionally associated with eloping English couples because of the more liberal marriage provisions in Scots law compared to English law. Because of this, &quot;Gretna&quot; has become a term for a place for quick, easy marriages.

==Shopping==
Gretna Gateway Outlet Village is a shopping centre on the east side of Gretna. In 2021, this was renamed Caledonia Park.

==Media==
===Television===
Local television news programmes that cover the town are:
*&quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; broadcasting from Glasgow.
*&quot;ITV News Lookaround&quot; which broadcast from Gateshead.
*&quot;BBC Look North&quot; which broadcasts from Newcastle.

===Radio===
Radio stations are served by:
*BBC Radio Scotland on 94.7 FM
*BBC Radio Cumbria on 95.6 FM
*Greatest Hits Radio Dumfries &amp; Galloway on 103.0 FM

===Newspapers===
The local newspaper is &quot;The Dumfries Courier&quot; which publishes on Fridays.

<doc id="457460" wikidata="Q2334593" url="?curid=457460" title="Guaranteed minimum income">
<text>Guaranteed minimum income (GMI), also called minimum income (or mincome for short), is a social-welfare system that guarantees all citizens or families an income sufficient to live on, provided that certain eligibility conditions are met, typically: citizenship and that the person in question does not already receive a minimum level of income to live on.

The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is reduction of poverty. Under more unconditional requirements, when citizenship is the sole qualification, the program becomes a &quot;universal basic income&quot; (UBI) system. Unlike a guaranteed minimum income, UBI does not typically take into account what a recipient already earns before receiving a UBI.

==Elements==
A system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably:

* Social safety net that helps those without sufficient financial means survive through payments
* State child support
* Student loan and grants
* State pensions or social pensions for the elderly
* Disability pensions for those who physically can not work

==History==
===Pre-modern antecedents===
Persian monarch Cyrus the Great ( 590 to 529 B.C.), whose government used a regulated minimum wage, also provided special rations to families when a child was born.

Cash assistance GMI was first documented by the third century BCE Greek philosopher, Aristotle, in his review of the Athenian Constitution. The modern equivalent would be a safety net program for people with less than $1,000 USD in savings to receive $20 USD per day. 

The Roman Republic and Empire offered the Cura Annonae, a regular distribution of free or subsidized grain or bread to poorer residents. The grain subsidy was first introduced by Gaius Gracchus in 123 B.C., then further institutionalized by Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar.

The first Sunni Muslim Caliph Abu Bakr, who came to power in 632 C.E., introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman and child ten dirhams annually. This was later increased to twenty dirhams.

===Modern proposals===
In 1795, American revolutionary Thomas Paine advocated a citizen&#x27;s dividend to all United States citizens as compensation for &quot;loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property&quot; (&quot;Agrarian Justice&quot;, 1795).

French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte echoed Paine&#x27;s sentiments and commented that &#x27;man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth&#x27;s produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence&#x27; (Herold, 1955).

The American economist Henry George advocated for a dividend paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a land value tax.

American economist Milton Friedman began advocating a basic income in the form of a negative income tax in the early 1940s. He discusses the proposal his 1962 book &quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; and his 1980 book &quot;Free to Choose&quot;.

In 1963, Robert Theobald published the book &quot;Free Men and Free Markets&quot;, in which he advocated a &quot;guaranteed minimum income&quot; (the origin of the modern version of the phrase).

In 1966, the Cloward–Piven strategy advocated &quot;overloading&quot; the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by &quot;a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty&quot;.

In his final book &quot;Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?&quot; (1967), Martin Luther King Jr. wrote
In 1968, James Tobin, Paul Samuelson, John Kenneth Galbraith and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.

In 1969, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Family Assistance Plan would have paid a minimum income to poor families. The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate.

In 1973, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote &quot;The Politics of a Guaranteed Income&quot;, in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed Richard Nixon&#x27;s Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal.

In 1987, New Zealand&#x27;s Labour Finance Minister Roger Douglas announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax. Both were quashed by then Prime Minister David Lange, who sacked Douglas.

In his 1994 &quot;autobiographical dialog&quot;, classical liberal Friedrich Hayek stated: &quot;I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country&quot;.

In 2013, the Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal, illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income.

In 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published the book &quot;Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises&quot;, in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment. The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism.

Other modern advocates include Ayşe Buğra (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI), and Andrew Coyne (Canada).

==Funding==
Tax revenues would fund the majority of GMI proposals. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs, such as unemployment insurance.

Another approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding. However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as Modern Monetary Theory would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation. This hypothetical Chartalist approach can be seen in the implementation of quantitative easing programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollars were created without requiring taxes.

==Examples around the world==

=== Austria ===

Social assistance is the last social safety net provided by the state (principle of subsidiarity). Social assistance is only granted if people cannot secure their livelihood either through their own efforts or through family assistance (maintenance obligation) or on the basis of a social insurance or other benefit entitlement. Due to other existing benefits in Austria, many people are not dependent on social assistance.

=== Belgium ===

=== Brazil ===
Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President Lula da Silva signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income. This law is primarily implemented through the Bolsa Família program. Under this program, poorer families receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Família is a conditional cash transfer program, meaning that beneficiaries receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they are cut off from aid. The program has been criticised as vote-buying, trading productive individuals&#x27; earning for the votes of welfare recipients As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil&#x27;s population, were participating in Bolsa Família.

===Canada ===

Canada has experimented with minimum income trials. During the Mincome experiment in Manitoba in the 1970s, Mincome provided lower-income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The trial was eventually ended but this was due to budget shortfalls and a change in government. 

The province of Ontario began a minimum income experiment in 2017. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income. Recipients of this program could receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers used this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs. On 31 August 2018, following a change in government, incoming Premier Doug Ford announced that the pilot would be cancelled at the end of the current fiscal year.

===China===
China&#x27;s Minimum Livelihood Guarantee also called &quot;dibao&quot;, is a means-tested social assistance scheme introduced in 1993 and expanded to all Chinese cities in 1999.

===Cyprus===
In July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a ″&quot;Guaranteed Minimum Income&quot;″ for all citizens.

===Denmark===

Kontanthjælp (formerly known as bistandshjælp) is a public benefit in Denmark granted to citizens who would otherwise not be able to support themselves or their families. In principle, cash benefits are a universal right for all citizens who meet certain statutory criteria. 

===Estonia===

A subsistence allowance is financial help for a person or family in need, which provides minimal resources for everyday life (food, medicine, housing costs, etc.).

===Finland===

Basic subsistence allowance paid by Kela may be granted to a person or family whose income and assets are insufficient to cover the necessary daily expenses.

=== France ===
In 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the Revenu minimum d&#x27;insertion. In 2009, it was turned into Revenu de solidarité active (RSA), a new system that aimed to solve the poverty trap by providing low-wage workers a complementary income to encourage activity.

=== Germany ===

=== Greece ===

The minimum guaranteed income is a selective financial benefit to ensure that all citizens enjoy a minimum standard of living and cover their basic needs. It has been tested and implemented in European Union countries and others. In 2019 it was incorporated as a requirement in the Greek Constitution.

=== Hungary ===
=== India ===
Modern independent India developed many means and livelihood tested cash transfer programs through Direct Benefit Transfer at both the federal and the state level. At the federal level, these include minimum income social pension programs such as National Social Assistance Scheme, guaranteed employment program like National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 or a disability aid like Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme. At the state level, there can be additional minimum income programs, one such being &quot;Laksmir Bhandar&quot; run by the state of West Bengal that transfers a minimum aid to families without work in the state.

=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, €20 of earnings per day of permitted work (beneficiaries are allowed up to three days per week) is disregarded from employment income when calculating &quot;Jobseekers’ Allowance&quot; entitlement and deductions are calculated as 60 percent of earnings less this income disregard. In addition, the &quot;Part-time Job Incentive Scheme&quot; and &quot;Back to Work Family Dividend&quot; are fixed-duration payments offered to the long-term unemployed incentive moving into work. In return for relinquishing claims to primary assistance benefits, both schemes provide benefits for a fixed duration that are slightly lower than household GMI entitlements, but which are not tapered with employment income, subject to certain eligibility requirements. Ireland&#x27;s relatively generous tapering system serves to smooth disincentives to increase income and work and contributes to their lower measured participation tax rates (PTRs) and marginal effective tax rates (METRs).

=== Italy ===
The citizens&#x27; income was a social welfare system created in Italy in January 2019. Although its name recalls one of a universal basic income, this provision was actually a form of conditional and non-individual guaranteed minimum income.

=== Netherlands ===
=== Norway ===

Income support can be granted if the applicant has insufficient income and resources to live on and is not entitled to other social security benefits. Income support is paid by the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration.

=== Poland ===
=== Portugal ===
The Social Insertion Income is a benefit for combating poverty, enabling individuals and their families to obtain support adapted to their situation, facilitating the satisfaction of their basic needs and aiming to integrate them into work, society and the community.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Saudi Arabia has a Citizen&#x27;s Account Program which provides a basic income to registered citizens. In December 2017, immediately before the program began, more than 3.7 million households had registered, representing 13 million people, or more than half the population. , between one fifth and one third of Saudi residents are estimated to be non-citizens.

=== Slovakia ===
Material need assistance (pomoc v hmotnej núdzi) includes one hot meal a day, essential clothing and shelter.

=== South Africa ===
The Social Relief of Distress grant (SRD) in South Africa is given to those whose monthly income falls short of the individual food poverty line, which is the minimal amount required to buy food that provides adequate calories for survival.

=== Spain ===

In Spain, the ingreso mínimo vital is an economic benefit guaranteed as part of the Social security in Spain. The IMV is defined as a &quot;subjective right&quot; and is intended to prevent poverty and social exclusion of people who live alone or integrated into a coexistence unit when they are in a situation of vulnerability due to lack of sufficient financial resources to cover their basic needs. The benefit, which is not fixed and varies depending on various factors, ranges between 462 and 1015 euros per month, is expected to cover 850,000 households (approximately 2.5 million people) and will cost the government 3 billion euros per year.

=== Sweden ===

Social assistance consists partly of a &quot;national standard&quot; (riksnorm) and partly of &quot;reasonable costs outside the national standard&quot;. The national standard includes costs such as food, clothing and footwear. Reasonable non-standard costs include rent and household electricity.

===Switzerland===
===United Kingdom===

Universal Credit is a social welfare program in the United Kingdom that consolidates several means-tested benefits into a single payment, aiming to simplify the welfare system and incentivize work.

===United States===
The United States has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a United States government program that provides stipends to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD or SSDI), a payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program. It is managed by the Social Security Administration and is designed to provide income supplements to people who are restricted in their ability to work because of a disability, usually a physical disability. SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person&#x27;s disability is temporary or permanent.

An early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), established by the Social Security Act. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government. Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP), which would replace the AFDC. FAP was intended to fix many of the problems of the AFDC, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee George McGovern also proposed a minimum income—in the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs was implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments. In 1996, under President Bill Clinton, the AFDC was replaced with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This would block grant funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed.

Another guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the welfare trap by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.

<text>In mathematics, a block matrix or a partitioned matrix is a matrix that is interpreted as having been broken into sections called blocks or submatrices.

Intuitively, a matrix interpreted as a block matrix can be visualized as the original matrix with a collection of horizontal and vertical lines, which break it up, or partition it, into a collection of smaller matrices. For example, the 3x4 matrix presented below is divided by horizontal and vertical lines into four blocks: the top-left 2x3 block, the top-right 2x1 block, the bottom-left 1x3 block, and the bottom-right 1x1 block.

:formula_1

Any matrix may be interpreted as a block matrix in one or more ways, with each interpretation defined by how its rows and columns are partitioned.

This notion can be made more precise for an formula_2 by formula_3 matrix formula_4 by partitioning formula_2 into a collection formula_6, and then partitioning formula_3 into a collection formula_8. The original matrix is then considered as the &quot;total&quot; of these groups, in the sense that the formula_9 entry of the original matrix corresponds in a 1-to-1 way with some formula_10 offset entry of some formula_11, where formula_12 and formula_13.

Block matrix algebra arises in general from biproducts in categories of matrices.
==Example==
The matrix

:formula_14

can be visualized as divided into four blocks, as 

:formula_15.

The horizontal and vertical lines have no special mathematical meaning, but are a common way to visualize a partition. By this partition, formula_16 is partitioned into four 2×2 blocks, as

:formula_17

The partitioned matrix can then be written as

:formula_18

==Formal definition==
Let formula_19. A partitioning of formula_20 is a representation of formula_20 in the form

:formula_22,

where formula_23 are contiguous submatrices, formula_24, and formula_25. The elements formula_26 of the partition are called blocks.

By this definition, the blocks in any one column must all have the same number of columns. Similarly, the blocks in any one row must have the same number of rows.

=== Partitioning methods ===
A matrix can be partitioned in many ways. For example, a matrix formula_20 is said to be partitioned by columns if it is written as

:formula_28,

where formula_29 is the formula_30th column of formula_20. A matrix can also be partitioned by rows:

:formula_32,

where formula_33 is the formula_34th row of formula_20.

=== Common partitions ===
Often, we encounter the 2x2 partition

:formula_36,

particularly in the form where formula_37 is a scalar:

:formula_38.
==Block matrix operations==

===Transpose===
Let

:formula_22

where formula_40. (This matrix formula_20 will be reused in and .) Then its transpose is

:formula_42,

and the same equation holds with the transpose replaced by the conjugate transpose.

====Block transpose====
A special form of matrix transpose can also be defined for block matrices, where individual blocks are reordered but not transposed. Let formula_43 be a formula_44 block matrix with formula_45 blocks formula_46, the block transpose of formula_20 is the formula_48 block matrix formula_49 with formula_45 blocks formula_51. As with the conventional trace operator, the block transpose is a linear mapping such that formula_52. However, in general the property formula_53 does not hold unless the blocks of formula_20 and formula_55 commute.

===Addition===

Let 

:formula_56,

where formula_57, and let formula_20 be the matrix defined in . (This matrix formula_59 will be reused in .) Then if formula_60, formula_61, formula_62, and formula_63, then

:formula_64.

===Multiplication===
It is possible to use a block partitioned matrix product that involves only algebra on submatrices of the factors. The partitioning of the factors is not arbitrary, however, and requires &quot;conformable partitions&quot; between two matrices formula_20 and formula_59 such that all submatrix products that will be used are defined.
Let formula_20 be the matrix defined in , and let formula_59 be the matrix defined in . Then the matrix product

:formula_69

can be performed blockwise, yielding formula_55 as an formula_71 matrix. The matrices in the resulting matrix formula_55 are calculated by multiplying:

:formula_73

Or, using the Einstein notation that implicitly sums over repeated indices:

:formula_74

Depicting formula_55 as a matrix, we have

:formula_76.

===Inversion===

If a matrix is partitioned into four blocks, it can be inverted blockwise as follows:

:formula_77

where A and D are square blocks of arbitrary size, and B and C are conformable with them for partitioning. Furthermore, A and the Schur complement of A in P: must be invertible.

Equivalently, by permuting the blocks:

:formula_78

Here, D and the Schur complement of D in P: must be invertible.

If A and D are both invertible, then:

: formula_79

By the Weinstein–Aronszajn identity, one of the two matrices in the block-diagonal matrix is invertible exactly when the other is.

===Determinant===
The formula for the determinant of a formula_80-matrix above continues to hold, under appropriate further assumptions, for a matrix composed of four submatrices formula_81. The easiest such formula, which can be proven using either the Leibniz formula or a factorization involving the Schur complement, is
:formula_82

Using this formula, we can derive that characteristic polynomials of formula_83 and formula_84 are same and equal to the product of characteristic polynomials of formula_20 and formula_86. Furthermore, If formula_83 or formula_84 is diagonalizable, then formula_20 and formula_86 are diagonalizable too. The converse is false; simply check formula_91.

If formula_20 is invertible, one has

:formula_93
and if formula_86 is invertible, one has

:formula_95

If the blocks are square matrices of the &quot;same&quot; size further formulas hold. For example, if formula_55 and formula_86 commute (i.e., formula_98), then 
:formula_99
This is also true when formula_100, formula_101, or .
This formula has been generalized to matrices composed of more than formula_80 blocks, again under appropriate commutativity conditions among the individual blocks.

For formula_103 and formula_104, the following formula holds (even if formula_20 and formula_59 do not commute)
:formula_107

==Special types of block matrices==

===Direct sums and block diagonal matrices===

====Direct sum====

For any arbitrary matrices A (of size &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot;) and B (of size &quot;p&quot; × &quot;q&quot;), we have the direct sum of A and B, denoted by A formula_108 B and defined as 
:formula_109

For instance,

:formula_110

This operation generalizes naturally to arbitrary dimensioned arrays (provided that A and B have the same number of dimensions).

Note that any element in the direct sum of two vector spaces of matrices could be represented as a direct sum of two matrices.

====Block diagonal matrices ====

A block diagonal matrix is a block matrix that is a square matrix such that the main-diagonal blocks are square matrices and all off-diagonal blocks are zero matrices. That is, a block diagonal matrix A has the form

:formula_111

where A&quot;k&quot; is a square matrix for all &quot;k&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;. In other words, matrix A is the direct sum of A1, ..., A&quot;n&quot;. It can also be indicated as A1 ⊕ A2 ⊕ ... ⊕ A&quot;n&quot; or diag(A1, A2, ..., A&quot;n&quot;) (the latter being the same formalism used for a diagonal matrix). Any square matrix can trivially be considered a block diagonal matrix with only one block.

For the determinant and trace, the following properties hold:
:formula_112 and
:formula_113

A block diagonal matrix is invertible if and only if each of its main-diagonal blocks are invertible, and in this case its inverse is another block diagonal matrix given by
:formula_114

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of formula_115 are simply those of the formula_116s combined.

===Block tridiagonal matrices===

A block tridiagonal matrix is another special block matrix, which is just like the block diagonal matrix a square matrix, having square matrices (blocks) in the lower diagonal, main diagonal and upper diagonal, with all other blocks being zero matrices. It is essentially a tridiagonal matrix but has submatrices in places of scalars. A block tridiagonal matrix formula_20 has the form

:formula_118

where formula_119, formula_120 and formula_121 are square sub-matrices of the lower, main and upper diagonal respectively.

Block tridiagonal matrices are often encountered in numerical solutions of engineering problems (e.g., computational fluid dynamics). Optimized numerical methods for LU factorization are available and hence efficient solution algorithms for equation systems with a block tridiagonal matrix as coefficient matrix. The Thomas algorithm, used for efficient solution of equation systems involving a tridiagonal matrix can also be applied using matrix operations to block tridiagonal matrices (see also Block LU decomposition).

===Block triangular matrices===

====Upper block triangular====
A matrix formula_20 is upper block triangular (or block upper triangular) if

:formula_123,

where formula_124 for all formula_125.

====Lower block triangular====
A matrix formula_20 is lower block triangular if

:formula_127,

where formula_124 for all formula_125.

===Block Toeplitz matrices===

A block Toeplitz matrix is another special block matrix, which contains blocks that are repeated down the diagonals of the matrix, as a Toeplitz matrix has elements repeated down the diagonal.

A matrix formula_20 is block Toeplitz if formula_131 for all formula_132, that is,

:formula_133,

where formula_134.

===Block Hankel matrices===
A matrix formula_20 is block Hankel if formula_131 for all formula_137, that is,

:formula_138,

where formula_134.

<text>Kinder Scout is a moorland plateau and National Nature Reserve in the Dark Peak of the Derbyshire Peak District in England. Part of the moor, at above sea level, is the highest point in the Peak District, in Derbyshire and the East Midlands.

==Overview==
Kinder Scout is part of the Dark Peak Site of Special Scientific Interest, and part of the plateau was designated as a National Nature Reserve in 2009. Much of the area is owned and managed by the National Trust as part of its High Peak Estate. The city of Manchester and the Greater Manchester conurbation can be seen from the western edges, as can Winter Hill near Bolton and, in good weather, the mountains of Snowdonia in North Wales. To the north, across the Snake Pass, lie the high moors of Bleaklow and Black Hill, which are of similar elevation; the Pennine Way long-distance footpath crosses the three hills on its route from nearby Edale to Kirk Yetholm in Scotland.

Kinder Scout featured on the BBC television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; (2005) as one of the wonders of the Midlands; however, it is considered by many to be in Northern England, lying between the cities of Manchester and Sheffield. In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the &quot;Kinderscoutian&quot;, derives its name from Kinder Scout. In an early text this summit was identified as &quot;the Peak&quot;, and the whole area is often referred to locally as &quot;The Peak&quot; or &quot;The Peaks&quot;.

The Aetherius Society considers it to be one of its 19 holy mountains.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kinder&quot; was first recorded in the Domesday Survey of 1086 as &quot;Chendre&quot;, and is of obscure meaning. It is believed to be pre-English in origin. &quot;Scout&quot; is an old word for a high, overhanging rock (derived from the Norse &quot;skúte&quot;), and refers to the cliffs on the western side of the plateau.

==Public access==
Kinder Scout is accessible from the villages of Hayfield and Edale in the High Peak of Derbyshire. It is a popular hiking location and the Pennine Way crosses Kinder Scout and the moors to the north. This has resulted in the erosion of the underlying peat, prompting work by Derbyshire County Council and the Peak District National Park Authority to repair it, in conjunction with the landowner, the National Trust. The Four Inns Walk, a competitive hiking event crosses over Kinder Scout.

The plateau was the location of the Kinder Scout Mass Trespass in 1932. From the National Park&#x27;s inception, a large area of the high moorland north of Edale was designated as &quot;open country&quot;. In 2003, the &quot;right to roam&quot; on uncultivated land was enshrined into law, and this area of open country has been significantly extended.

Parts of the Kinder Scout plateau (except legal rights of way) are still occasionally closed for conservation, public safety, grouse shooting or fire prevention reasons, but prior notice is generally given on the Peak District National Park Authority&#x27;s website.

==Landmarks==
===Kinder Downfall===

Kinder Downfall is the tallest waterfall in the Peak District, with a 30-metre fall. It lies on the River Kinder, where it flows west over one of the gritstone cliffs on the plateau edge. Although usually little more than a trickle in summer, in spate conditions it is impressive. In certain wind conditions (notably when there is a strong westerly wind), the water is blown back on itself, and the resulting cloud of spray can be seen from several miles away. In cold winters the waterfall freezes providing local mountaineers with an icy challenge that can be climbed with ice axes, ropes and crampons. Below the Downfall the River Kinder flows into Kinder Reservoir.
===Jacob&#x27;s Ladder===

Jacob&#x27;s Ladder is a bridleway between the Kinder Scout plateau and the hamlet of Upper Booth in the Vale of Edale. In the 18th century, Jacob Marshall farmed the land at Edale Head, at the top of what became known as Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. He cut steps into this steep section of the route up to the Kinder plateau. The name is a reference to the ladder to heaven that Jacob dreamt about (in the Book of Genesis).

The River Noe (a tributary to the River Derwent) flows alongside the path from its source at Edale Head down the clough (steep valley). At the foot of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder the Noe is crossed by a Grade II listed gritstone packhorse bridge, with a single span. The bridge is on an important medieval packhorse route over the Pennine moorland between Hayfield and Edale. Salt and cheese from Cheshire and cotton from the Lancashire mills were transported to the east, while coal and lead were carried to the west.

The Pennine Way ascends Jacob&#x27;s Ladder just from its start at Edale. The original route of the Pennine Way went up to the Kinder plateau via Grindsbrook Clough. In 1987 the Manpower Services Commission built a stone paved staircase along the path of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. The Jacob&#x27;s Ladder footpath runs across land that is owned and managed by the National Trust. Access to the foot of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder can be made along the Pennine Way trail from Edale railway station or from the public car park at Barber Booth.

===The gritstone edges===
Some of Kinder&#x27;s many gritstone cliffs were featured in the first rock-climbing guide to the Peak District, &quot;Some Gritstone Climbs&quot;, published in 1913 and written by John Laycock.

===Edale Cross===

The Edale Cross lies immediately south of Kinder Scout, under Kinder Low and on the former Hayfield to Edale road. It marks the former junction of the three wards of the Forest of Peak: Glossop and Longdendale, Hopedale and Campagna. The first cross on the site may have been set up by the Abbots of Basingwerk Abbey to mark the southern boundary of their land, granted in 1157. The date of the current cross is unknown, although an adjoining plaque and its listing as a Scheduled Monument date it to the medieval period. At some point it fell down, and was re-erected in 1810, when the date and initials JG, WD, GH, JH and JS were carved into it. These stand for John Gee, William Drinkwater, George and Joseph Hadfield and John Shirt, local farmers of the day who raised the cross.

===Mermaid&#x27;s Pool===

Mermaid&#x27;s Pool, a small pool below Kinder Downfall, is said, according to legend, to be inhabited by a mermaid who will grant immortality upon whoever sees her on Easter Eve.

===Kinder Low===
Kinder Low at above sea level is a subsidiary summit at the south west corner of the plateau. Surmounted by a trig point and with steep slopes to south and west it is often mistaken as the highest point. The true summit, which is higher, is an unmarked point on the flat plateau to the north east. &quot;Low&quot; is an old dialect word meaning &quot;hill top&quot;.

===Kinderlow bowl barrow===
A bowl barrow, thought to be unexcavated and to date from the Bronze Age, stands on Kinder Low, a western projection of the main massif above Hayfield.

==View==
Major English and Welsh peaks visible (in ideal conditions) from Kinder Scout include (clockwise from west) Winter Hill (), Pendle Hill (), Ingleborough (), Whernside (), Pen-y-ghent (), Fountains Fell (), Buckden Pike (), Great Whernside (), Bleaklow (), Margery Hill (), the Weaver Hills (), Axe Edge (), The Roaches (), Shutlingsloe (), Shining Tor (), the Long Mynd (), Stiperstones (), Corndon Hill (), Cilfaesty Hill (), Moel y Golfa (), Plynlimon (), Cadair Berwyn (), Beeston Castle (), Alderley Edge (), Arenig Fawr (), Moel Famau (), Snowdon (), Glyder Fach (), Tryfan (), Y Garn (), Carnedd Llewelyn () and Foel-fras ().

==Tone poem==
The orchestral sketch &quot;Kinder Scout&quot; was composed by Patrick Hadley, written for the Buxton Spa Orchestra and its occasional director George Cathie. It was first performed in Buxton in September 1923. Hadley had an emotional attachment to the Derbyshire peaks, which are also celebrated in his later cantata &quot;The Hills&quot; (1943).

<text>UIQ (formerly known as User Interface Quartz) is a discontinued software platform based upon Symbian OS, created by UIQ Technology AB. It is a graphical user interface layer that provides additional components to the core operating system, to enable the development of feature-rich mobile phones that are open to expanded capabilities through third-party applications.

==History==
UIQ was the result of &#x27;Quartz&#x27;, a user interface for pen PDAs that was one of the three provisional interfaces that were designed by Symbian Ltd. The first three Quartz phones never made it to market, including Psion&#x27;s &quot;Odin&quot; in a joint venture with Motorola, which was cancelled in January 2001, causing Psion&#x27;s shares to deteriorate. Engineers thereafter created a lighter version of the software which was presented in 2002, and first shipped that year with Sony Ericsson P800.

Sony Ericsson was the main OEM using the UIQ platform in its products. Motorola also developed some products using UIQ, but abandoned the platform in 2004 in favour of Linux, along with its stake in Symbian Ltd. In 2007, Motorola returned to UIQ with the launch of Motorola RIZR Z8. Nokia, which was using the competing Series 60 (later S60) platform, created one UIQ device called Nokia 6708, which is a rebadged BenQ P31, and was only released in the Asia-Pacific region.

Sony Ericsson bought UIQ Technology in November 2006, and the next year, Motorola bought half of it.

After the creation of the Symbian Foundation and its favouring of S60 as their user interface of choice, UIQ&#x27;s future was uncertain, as it could no longer develop the software for the Symbian operating system. Many Motorola UIQ devices planned for 2009 were cancelled, including Motorola Razr3, codenamed &quot;Ruby&quot;.

UIQ Technology filed for bankruptcy in January 2009, which effectively ended the UIQ platform. Sony Ericsson moved on to Windows Mobile and the open source Symbian from the Symbian Foundation, whilst Motorola adopted Google&#x27;s Android software.

UIQ 3.3 was the last version of the platform, based upon Symbian OS v9.3. Developers that developed on the UIQ 3.x platform had a much better story than with previous releases, since all UIQ 3.x phones were served by a single, core SDK.

== UIQ programming languages ==
Native applications can be written in C++ using the Symbian/UIQ SDK. All UIQ-based phones (2.x and 3.x) also support Java applications.

UIQ phones employ touch screens with a resolution of 208×320 pixels (UIQ 1.x &amp; 2.x) and 240×320 (UIQ 3.x). Depending on the phone, the color depth is 12-bit (4096 colors), 16-bit (65536 colors), 18-bit (262144 colors), and 24-bit (16,777,216 colors) on some newer phones.

For developers, the significant items are:
* Single SDK model - developers targeting core UIQ features can use the UIQ SDK to target any UIQ 3 device. Extensions targeting specific device features (such as WiFi, etc.) are available from phone manufacturers&#x27; websites.
* Increased tools support - developers can use whichever tools they are familiar with (DevStudio, Eclipse, Carbide, CodeWarrior, NetBeans). Many of these tools are beginning to support extensive RAD features for both C++ and Java developers. Visual Basic programmers can use NS Basic/Symbian OS.
* High volume, mid-range devices are now possible, to significantly increase the potential customer base.

<text>CTV 2 is a Canadian English-language television system owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc. The system consists of four terrestrial owned-and-operated television stations (O&amp;Os) in Ontario, one in British Columbia and two regional cable television channels, one in Atlantic Canada and the other in Alberta (the latter formerly being the provincial educational channel in that province under the name Access Alberta).

The CTV 2 system began in 1995 as NewNet, which was originated from the station CKVR-TV, owned by CHUM Limited, who disaffiliated from the CBC and modeled its format aimed at younger viewers after its Citytv station, CITY-TV in Toronto. The NewNet system expanded with the acquisition of four Baton Broadcasting stations in Southern Ontario, followed by the launch of CIVI-TV in Vancouver Island. NewNet was rebranded to A-Channel in 2005 after acquiring the assets of Craig Media. In 2007, CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia; to comply with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) ownership limits, the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media, while the non-Citytv stations were relaunched as A in 2008 then again as CTV Two in 2011 with two former Astral Media stations in British Columbia joining the system in 2015.

Although patterned after the original station in Barrie and since its acquisition by Bell, CTV 2 provides complementary programming to Bell Media&#x27;s larger CTV network, though since the late 2010s it has increasingly aired repeats in primetime, with only a handful of first-run programs apart from late-night talk shows (simulcast from NBC) and stations&#x27; local newscasts targeting younger demographics. It operates primarily in markets that overlap with the service area of an existing CTV station. CTV 2 broadcast covers all provinces in Canada except Quebec, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan.

==History==

===Beginning as NewNet===

The system began to develop in 1995, at CKVR-TV in Barrie, Ontario. In September of that year, owner CHUM Limited dropped CKVR&#x27;s longtime affiliation with CBC Television and relaunched it as an independent station with a more youthful image in order to generate interest from viewers in the neighbouring Toronto market, where CKVR had long been available on basic cable. This included adopting a news format similar to the &quot;CityPulse&quot; newscasts on sister station CITY-TV, replacing its various classic television shows with more contemporary series, and picking up a package of games for the Toronto Raptors, Toronto&#x27;s then-new NBA franchise. The resulting station became known as &quot;The New VR&quot;.

The experiment was successful enough that CHUM replicated CKVR&#x27;s format on stations it had acquired from Baton Broadcasting in 1997, namely CHRO in Pembroke, CFPL-TV in London, CKNX-TV in Wingham, and CHWI-TV in Windsor. Most of these stations were also former CBC affiliates, and in markets where CKVR&#x27;s sister station, CITY-TV, was already or subsequently became available on basic cable. CIVI-DT in Victoria, British Columbia was added into the system at its launch in October 2001.

CHUM informally referred to these stations as the &quot;NewNet&quot;. That name was never used on-air on any of these stations; rather it served as a common identifier for the stations to advertising buyers (it was also used on news vehicles in Southwestern Ontario). On-air, each station was known as &quot;The New &quot;XX&quot;&quot;, with &quot;XX&quot; representing the last two letters of the station&#x27;s callsign (e.g., &quot;The New WI&quot; for CHWI, &quot;The New RO&quot; for CHRO, &quot;The New PL&quot; for CFPL, etc.)

===A-Channel===

On March 15, 2005, CHUM announced that the NewNet stations would be relaunched as A-Channel by that fall. The rebrand took place on August 2, 2005, the same date that the former A-Channel stations in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Calgary, recently acquired by CHUM from Craig Media, were relaunched as Citytv. The change reflected a shift towards a more traditional broadcasting model at these stations.

On July 12, 2006, Bell Globemedia announced a friendly takeover bid to buy CHUM Limited. The company initially intended to keep CHUM&#x27;s Citytv system, while divesting the A-Channel and Access stations in order for the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to approve the acquisition.

On April 9, 2007, Rogers Communications announced an agreement to purchase the A-Channel stations, along with the CBC Television affiliate in Brandon, Manitoba (CKX-TV) and several cable channels being put up for sale as part of the CTV transaction. The CRTC announced its approval of the purchase of CHUM Limited by what was now known as CTVglobemedia, on June 8 of the same year, but added a condition that CTVgm must sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer. At the same time, it was permitted to keep the A-Channel stations, in effect cancelling the planned sale of A-Channel to Rogers.

On June 22, 2007, CTVglobemedia finalized its purchase of the CHUM Limited stations, while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers. The company initially intended to keep the A-Channel stations&#x27; branding and programming independent from the CTV Television Network. However, as with the relationship between Global and E!, CTV radically adjusted A-Channel&#x27;s announced schedule over the summer of 2007 to make room for several series that could not be accommodated on the main network&#x27;s fall schedule. Notably, A-Channel picked up CTV&#x27;s rights to &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;Jeff Ltd.&quot; In October, CTV also moved &quot;Dirty Sexy Money&quot; and &quot;Big Shots&quot;, both of which had originally premiered on the main network, to A-Channel.

Later in the fall, CTV also replaced A-Channel&#x27;s daily entertainment newscast, &quot;Star! Daily&quot;, with &quot;MTV e2&quot; and strip reruns of &quot;&quot;, although new episodes of that series continued to air on CTV.

On July 26, 2007, CTVglobemedia named Richard Gray the head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV. Gray would report to the CTVgm corporate group, not CTV News, to preserve independent news presentation and management. Gray began to oversee the news departments for CKVR, CHRO, CFPL, CKNX, CHWI, CIVI and CKX.
Shortly after CTV took control of A-Channel and most of the other assets owned by CHUM, media analysts began to speculate that the A-Channel stations would be renamed in 2008. Viewer surveys in 2007 and 2008 suggested that the names &quot;Much TV&quot; and &quot;CHUM TV&quot; were under consideration.

===A===
At its fall upfronts presentation on June 2, 2008, CTV announced that it would reformat the A-Channel stations with a new look and new logo, becoming known as simply &quot;A&quot; (originally stylized as &quot;&#x27;A&#x27;&quot;, then as &quot;/A\&quot; to mimic the visual style of its logo). In anticipation of the format change, A-Channel&#x27;s press materials began using the &quot;A&quot; name that same month, and on-air personalities began referring to the local newscasts as &quot;A News&quot; instead of &quot;A-Channel News&quot;.

The on-air relaunch from A-Channel to A took place on August 11, 2008. On that same date, Atlantic Canada&#x27;s Atlantic Satellite Network also joined the A television system as A Atlantic, and began to carry the entire A program lineup. In addition, Alberta&#x27;s Access also adopted a new A-styled logo and began to feature the A lineup in certain prime time hours.

====Financial problems====
On February 25, 2009, CTV announced that, given what it saw as ongoing structural problems facing the conventional television sector in Canada and the current global economic crisis, it would not seek to renew the licences of Wheatley&#x27;s CHWI-TV (and its rebroadcaster in Windsor) and Wingham&#x27;s CKNX-TV. The stations were not expected to be converted to rebroadcasters of London&#x27;s A station (CFPL) upon the expirations of their existing licences in August 2009; however, CTV had said news coverage for both areas would be provided by CFPL and CKCO. In addition, CTV also announced on February 19, 2009, that it would not apply to renew the licence of Brandon&#x27;s CKX-TV beyond its August 31, 2009 expiration.

CTV announced further cuts on March 3, 2009. The &quot;A Morning&quot; programs produced separately at CKVR and CFPL were cancelled outright effective March 4 and were replaced by repeats of the previous evening&#x27;s newscasts, while CIVI replaced its &quot;A Morning&quot; show with a simulcast of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s Victoria-based radio station CFAX (1070 AM), although those stations retain their evening newscasts. On the other hand, CHRO saw its &quot;A Morning&quot; program expanded from three hours daily to four hours daily, and launched a two-hour Saturday edition of &quot;A Morning&quot;, while cancelling its evening newscasts (which trailed those of CTV network station CJOH-TV). In all, 118 people, or 23% of all A employees, were laid off. No cuts were announced for A Atlantic, which is already tightly integrated with CTV Atlantic.

On April 30, 2009, Shaw Communications announced that it would purchase CKX, CKNX, and CHWI for a dollar each, pending approval by the CRTC. However, it was reported on June 30, 2009, that Shaw had backed out of the deal and declined to complete the purchase, putting the stations&#x27; futures in serious doubt.

On July 8, 2009, CTV announced that it would keep CHWI open after the CRTC announced policy changes to increase funding for small-market television stations, and following lobbying efforts by the Windsor City Council, local Members of Provincial Parliament Sandra Pupatello and Dwight Duncan, and federal Members of Parliament Brian Masse and Joe Comartin to keep the only local privately owned television station in Windsor on air. In the same announcement, CTV indicated its intention to file an application with the CRTC to convert CKNX into a rebroadcaster of CFPL once that station shut down on August 31. On July 16, CTV announced that it would sell CKX-TV to Bluepoint Investment Corporation for a dollar. The deal was expected to close by December 31, 2009, pending CRTC approval; however, it was rejected on October 1, prompting the station to cease operations the following day.

===CTV Two/CTV 2===
On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada announced it re-acquire the assets of CTVglobemedia and the A system for $3.2 billion. The overall deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011 and was finalized on April 1, 2011 when it was relaunched as Bell Media.
On May 30, 2011, Bell Media (in conjunction with its contractor, the Troika Design Group) announced that it would extend the CTV brand to the A television system, for the start of the 2011-12 television season. As such, A was relaunched as CTV Two on August 29, 2011, with local newscasts in most markets rebranded from &quot;A News&quot; to &quot;CTV News&quot;, and the morning shows produced in Ottawa and Atlantic Canada becoming &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;, ending nearly three years of the &quot;A&quot; brand. Additionally, an HD feed for the system launched on August 31, 2011.

As part of the relaunch, Bell expanded the system&#x27;s coverage area. Alberta&#x27;s provincial education channel Access (which had aired a limited amount of A programming) was renamed CTV Two Alberta and began carrying the full CTV Two primetime lineup excluding local CTV News programming. On June 17, 2011, Bell also filed an application with the CRTC and Industry Canada to establish additional repeaters for CKVR-DT to expand its signal farther into the Golden Horseshoe area; on UHF 42 in Fonthill, serving Niagara Falls, Fort Erie and St. Catharines, and a repeater on UHF 35 on CHCH-DT&#x27;s Tower, serving Hamilton, Oakville, Haldimand County, Caledonia, Brantford, Milton and Cambridge. These applications were later approved by the CRTC.

On October 28, 2015, the CRTC made public an application by Bell to disaffiliate CJDC-TV and CFTK-TV from CBC Television effective February 22. Bell and the CBC agreed to an early termination of the affiliation agreements on October 5. Programming from CTV Two began on the date of disaffiliation from CBC.

Beginning the 2018-19 television season, the network re-branded as &quot;CTV 2&quot; under CTV&#x27;s new brand identity.

==Programming==

Aside from a few key genres, such as movies and local news, the types of programming carried by CTV Two has varied significantly over its history.

As NewNet, the system mainly carried programs from what were then the two U.S. &quot;netlets&quot; (The WB and UPN), movies, a few syndicated series, and lower-rated offerings from the U.S. &quot;big four&quot; networks. Certain programs were timeshifted from their original airings on Citytv. During its early years, as with Citytv, NewNet&#x27;s stations lack a no news desk (anchors read the news standing up, or on stools), and cameras are sometimes hand-held which included the concept of videojournalism, where reporters often carry their own camera report and videotape their own stories. The system calls its videojournalists &quot;videographers&quot;, but unlike many stations in American television markets that try to conceal the fact that reporters are so-called &quot;one-man bands&quot;, embraced the use of video journalism by highlighting the use of technology; its videographers often carry a second home video camera to record images of them videotaping on the scene. The low-grade video is then incorporated into the story to show viewers how the story was recorded. 

Throughout most of the network&#x27;s existence, CTV Two has aired NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot; since the mid–1990s under hosts Jay Leno, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. However, &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; aired on CTV for the first two years of its run, but switched places with &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; (which aired on CTV Two since its March 2015 debut) in February 2016. 

Like all other CHUM-owned properties, the system also aired several local programs inherited from Citytv and other CHUM channels such as &quot;CityLine&quot;, &quot;FashionTelevision&quot;, &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, &quot;Speakers Corner&quot;, &quot;MediaTelevision&quot; and &quot;Great Movies&quot;. Late at night, NewNet also aired &quot;Baby Blue Movies&quot;, &quot;SexTV&quot;, &quot;Naked News&quot; and &quot;Ed&#x27;s Night Party&quot;.
After relaunching as A-Channel, the system shifted towards a more traditional mix, including game shows and more traditional U.S. sitcoms and dramas while retaining airings of library of programming from Citytv and its parent CHUM. Some of the American shows aired during this era included &quot;Supernanny&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, as well as &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Late Night&quot;. Notable Canadian shows include &quot;&quot; and &quot;CityLine&quot;. A few original productions, such as &quot;11 Somerset&quot; and &quot;Charlie Jade&quot;, have aired on A-Channel. The drama series &quot;Missing&quot; was carried over from the former Craig Media-owned A-Channel (now Citytv) stations. Following the acquisition by CTVglobemedia, CTV would occasionally bump one of its programs over to A-Channel to make room for a different show; during the summer, A-Channel would often carry repeats of CTV series, freeing up CTV to carry original programming.

For several seasons, CHRO-TV also produced and broadcast 20 regular-season games per year of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Ottawa Senators. These games were generally seen on Thursday nights and were usually among CHRO&#x27;s most popular programmes. These games have been reassigned to the team&#x27;s cable home, Sportsnet, as of the 2008–09 season. Although CHRO no longer airs the games themselves, the station still produces and airs a post-game show.

There may be some confusion about the system&#x27;s launch date due to a celebration of &quot;50 years of local news&quot; held by local CTV and A-Channel stations in April 2008. Neither the system nor any local CTV-owned station launched in 1958, although some of the stations that later joined CTV launched earlier in the decade. The celebration was not timed to any particular anniversary but rather to a CRTC review of regulations for local television stations also held that month.

As A, the network&#x27;s primetime schedule was revamped again, positioning A as the cutting-edge counterpart to the main CTV network. Most of the schedule consisted of anticipated new series such as &quot;Eleventh Hour&quot; and &quot;Fringe&quot;, and critically acclaimed or high-buzz (but lower-rated) sophomore series such as &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, and &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, although a few older holdovers such as &quot;AFV&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; (previously on Citytv) remained in primetime. Talk shows such as &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Late Night&quot; remain, while &quot;Wheel&quot;, which moved to CBC Television, was replaced by &quot;TMZ&quot;.

As part of its relaunch as CTV Two, the primetime schedule focused on highly anticipated new series, including results shows for &quot;The X Factor&quot; (the performance shows aired on CTV), &quot;Up All Night&quot;, and &quot;Man Up!&quot;. Additionally, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; also moved to CTV Two.

Since its acquisition by CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media), the network would also serve as an alternate outlet for CTV programming in the event of scheduling conflicts with other programming, major breaking news, and special events such CTV&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. Conversely, in markets where CTV Two is not available, some CTV affiliates may sometimes carry some CTV Two programming, although this is rare.

<text>Franz Müntefering (; born 16 January 1940) is a German politician. He was Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from 2004 to 2005 and again from 18 October 2008 to 13 November 2009. He served as the minister of Labour and Social Affairs, as well as the vice chancellor of Germany, in the cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2005 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Müntefering was born in Neheim (now part of Arnsberg). He trained as an industrial salesman and worked for local metalwork companies.

==Political career==
Müntefering joined the SPD in 1966. He was a member of the Bundestag from 1975 to 1992 and again since 1998.

From 1992 until 1995, Müntefering served as State Minister of Labor, Health and Social Affairs in the government of Minister-President Johannes Rau of North Rhine-Westphalia. He was a member of the State Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia 1995 to 1998.

Müntefering was &quot;Bundesgeschäftsführer&quot; (executive director) of the national SPD from 1995 to 1998. In this capacity, he managed the 1998 campaign that returned the SPD to power in the federal government after 16 years in opposition.

From 1998 until 1999, Müntefering briefly held the post of Minister of Transportation and Construction in the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. In this capacity, he organized the government&#x27;s move from Bonn to Berlin.

Müntefering was the first to hold the new post of SPD Secretary General from 1999 to 2002, and thereafter became leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag.

===Chairman of the SPD, 2004–2005===
In June 2004 Müntefering was designated to succeed Schröder as party chairman in July 2004.

Following Schröder&#x27;s defeat in the close 2005 elections, Müntefering helped form a grand coalition under the new Chancellor Angela Merkel and her center-right CDU/CSU parties. During the coalition talks, on 31 October 2005, Müntefering&#x27;s favoured candidate for Secretary General of the SPD, Kajo Wasserhövel, was defeated by the left-wing candidate Andrea Nahles in a preliminary internal election. Müntefering subsequently announced his intention to resign as SPD Chairman, and was succeeded by Matthias Platzeck at the next party convention on 15 November 2005.

===Vice Chancellor and Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2005–2007===
Müntefering became Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs and Vice Chancellor in the cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel on 22 November 2005. During his time in office, the government agreed to raise the retirement age in steps to 67 from 65 by 2029.

After two years in those posts, Müntefering&#x27;s spokesman said on 13 November 2007 that Müntefering would resign from them later in the month. The decision was said to be based on &quot;purely familial reasons&quot;. Later in the day, Müntefering said that he would leave his positions in the government on 21 November attributing his decision to the illness of his wife, Ankepetra, who was suffering from cancer. Upon leaving office on 21 November 2007, he was replaced as Vice Chancellor by Frank-Walter Steinmeier and as Minister of Labor by Olaf Scholz, both of whom are also members of the SPD.

===Chairman of the SPD, 2008–2009===
Müntefering&#x27;s wife Ankepetra died on 31 July 2008. Following her death, Müntefering decided to return to active politics and was elected Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany on 18 October 2008. On 7 September 2008, Kurt Beck had resigned as SPD Chairman.

Following the SPD&#x27;s defeat in the federal election of 2009, Müntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party.

==Political positions==
In April 2005, Müntefering criticized the market economy of Germany and proposed more state involvement to promote economic justice. In this speech, he described private equity firms as &quot;locusts&quot;. He subsequently published a &quot;locust list&quot; of companies, which he circulated within the SPD. This began a debate which dominated the national news, being the subject of front-page articles and covered on the main television news broadcasts nearly every day. Müntefering&#x27;s suggestions were criticized by employers and many economists, but met with popular support (up to 75% in some opinion polls). The word has since found its way into German language as an established term for shady financial business practices.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving active politics, Müntefering has held a variety of honorary positions, including the following:
* German Foundation for Active Citizenship and Volunteering (DSEE), Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2020)
* Berlin Demography Forum, chairman of the Advisory Board
* Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), Member
* Witten/Herdecke University, Member of the Board of Trustees (since 2014)
* Herbert and Greta Wehner Foundation, Member of the Board (since 2002)
* Deutsche Hospiz- und PalliativStiftung, Member of the Board of Trustees
* German National Association of Senior Citizens&#x27; Organizations (BAGSO), chairman since 2015

Müntefering was a SPD delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2017.

==Controversy==
In 2002, news surfaced that, while Müntefering was head of the SPD in the North Rhine-Westphalia during the 1990s, local officials in the city of Cologne and possibly elsewhere allegedly engaged in corruption that involved illegal political donations from builders of waste-disposal facilities. Müntefering denied any knowledge of the anonymous donations and launched an internal investigation into all contracts awarded for the construction of waste-disposal facilities in North Rhine-Westphalia in the 1990s. On 22 March, he testified about the affair before Parliament&#x27;s investigative committee.

<text>DASL ([[Datapoint]]&#x27;s Advanced Systems Language) was a programming language and compiler proprietary to Datapoint. Primarily influenced by Pascal with some C touches, it was created in the early 1980s by Gene Hughes.

The compiler output was assembly language, which was typically processed through a peep-hole optimizer before the assembler and linker.

Reflecting its name, DASL was used for systems programming, mainly by the vendor itself.

<doc id="457522" wikidata="Q6605119" url="?curid=457522" title="List of aircraft engines of Germany during World War II">
<text>This is a list of all German motors including all aircraft engines, rocket motors, jets and any other powerplants, along with a very basic description. It includes experimental engines as well as those that made it to production status.

The Reich Air Ministry used an internal designation system that included a prefix number signifying the engine type, 9 for piston engines and 109 for jets and rockets, followed by a manufacturer&#x27;s code, followed by an engine series number. Unlike the 9-prefixed piston engine designations, the 109-series of reaction-thrust, turbojet, turboprop and rocket engine designation numbers&#x27; three-place numerical suffixes had no &quot;firm adherence&quot; to any one manufacturer.

* 090–099 – various minor manufacturers
* 1 – Bayerische Motorenwerke GmbH (BMW); later changed to 800 block
* 2 – Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke A.G.
* 3 – BMW-Flugmotorenwerke Brandenburg GmbH (BMW-Bramo)
* 4 – Argus Motoren GmbH
* 5 – Heinkel Hirth Motoren GmbH
* 6 – Daimler-Benz A.G.
* 7 – Brückner or Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz A.G.
* 8 – Bayerische Motorenwerke GmbH (BMW)

Using this system, the famous BMW engine used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 would be known as the 9-801 (Piston(9)-BMW(8)Number(01)). However, this system was not widely used, even within the RLM, and a common name consisting of the manufacturer&#x27;s name (often abbreviated) followed by the model number was much more common. The list below uses the common BMW 801 instead of the official 9-801.

Engines produced before the RLM&#x27;s designation system was set up are often listed using the same basic terminology. So while the interwar Argus 10 engine can be referred to as the As 10, it is not correct to call it the 9–10, this designation was never applied.

Notable engines:

BMW 003 — 
BMW 801 — 
HWK 109–509
The Luftwaffe also used engines from France, particularly the Gnôme-Rhône 14 cylinder series of radial engines for its Henschel Hs 129 (14M) ground attack aircraft and Messerschmitt Me 323 (14N) &quot;Gigant&quot; transporter.

<text>The serial comma (also referred to as the series comma, Oxford comma, or Harvard comma) is a comma placed after the second-to-last term in a list (just before the conjunction) when writing out three or more terms. For example, a list of three countries might be punctuated with the serial comma as &quot;France, Italy, and Spain&quot; or without it as &quot;France, Italy and Spain&quot;. The serial comma can help avoid ambiguity in some situations, but can also create it in others. There is no universally accepted standard for its use.

The serial comma is popular in formal writing (such as in academic, literary, and legal contexts) but is usually omitted in journalism as a way to save space. Its popularity in informal and semi-formal writing depends on the variety of English; it is usually excluded in British English, while in American English it is common and often considered mandatory outside journalism. Academic and legal style guides such as the APA style, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;, Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, and the &quot;U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual&quot; either recommend or require the serial comma, as does &quot;The Oxford Style Manual&quot; (hence the alternative name &quot;Oxford comma&quot;). Newspaper stylebooks such as the &quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Style Book,&quot; and The Canadian Press stylebook typically recommend against it. Most British style guides do not require it, with &quot;The Economist Style Guide&quot; noting most British writers use it only to avoid ambiguity. 

While many sources provide default recommendations on whether to use the serial comma as a matter of course, most also include exceptions for situations where it is necessary to avoid ambiguity (see ).

==History==
The comma itself is widely attributed to Aldus Manutius, a 15th-century Italian printer who used a mark—now recognized as a comma—to separate words. Etymologically, the word &quot;comma&quot;, which became widely used to describe Manutius&#x27;s mark, comes from the Greek (). The serial comma has been used for centuries in a variety of languages, though not necessarily in a uniform or regulated manner. 

The serial comma is most often attributed to Horace Hart, the printer and controller of the Oxford University Press from 1893 to 1915. Hart wrote the eponymous &quot;Hart&#x27;s Rules for Compositors and Readers&quot; in 1905 as a style guide for the employees working at the press. The guide called for the use of the serial comma, but the punctuation mark had no distinct name until 1978, when Peter Sutcliffe referred to the serial comma as such in his historical account of the Oxford University Press.

Sutcliffe, however, attributed the serial comma not to Horace Hart but to F. Howard Collins, who mentioned it in his 1905 book, &quot;Author &amp; Printer: A Guide for Authors, Editors, Printers, Correctors of the Press, Compositors, and Typists&quot;.

==Arguments for and against==
Common arguments &quot;for&quot; the consistent use of the serial comma are:
*The comma&#x27;s use is consistent with the conventional practice of the region.
*It can resolve ambiguity (see examples below).
*Its use is consistent with other means of separating items in a list (for example, when semicolons are used to separate items, one is always included before the last item).

Common arguments &quot;against&quot; the consistent use of the serial comma are:
*The comma&#x27;s omission is consistent with the conventional practice of the region.
*It can introduce ambiguity
*When space is at a premium, it adds redundancy and unnecessary bulk to the text.

Many sources are against both systematic use and systematic avoidance of the serial comma, making recommendations in a more nuanced way as reflected in recommendations by style guides.

==Ambiguity==

Omitting the serial comma may create ambiguity; writers who normally avoid the comma often use one to avoid this. Consider the book dedication below:
:&quot;To my parents, Mother Teresa and the pope.&quot;
There is ambiguity about the writer&#x27;s parentage as &quot;Mother Teresa and the pope&quot; can be read as a renaming of &quot;my parents&quot;, leading the reader to believe that the writer claims that Mother Teresa and the pope are their parents. A comma before the &quot;and&quot; removes the ambiguity:
:&quot;To my parents, Mother Teresa, and the pope.&quot;
Nevertheless, lists can also be written in other ways that eliminate the ambiguity without introducing the serial comma, such as by changing the word order, or by using other or no punctuation to introduce or delimit them (though the emphasis may thereby be changed):
:&quot;To the pope, Mother Teresa and my parents.&quot;

An example collected by Nielsen Hayden was found in a newspaper account of a documentary about Merle Haggard:
:&quot;Among those interviewed were his two ex-wives, Kris Kristofferson and Robert Duvall.&quot;
A serial comma following &quot;Kris Kristofferson&quot; would help prevent this being understood as Kris Kristofferson and Robert Duvall being the ex-wives in question.

Another example:
:&quot;My usual breakfast is coffee, bacon and eggs and toast.&quot;
It is unclear whether the eggs are being grouped with the bacon or the toast. Adding a serial comma removes this ambiguity:
:&quot;My usual breakfast is coffee, bacon and eggs, and toast.&quot;
In some circumstances, using the serial comma can create ambiguity. If the book dedication above is changed to
:&quot;To my mother, Mother Teresa, and the pope.&quot;
the comma after &quot;Mother Teresa&quot; creates ambiguity about the writer&#x27;s mother because it uses punctuation identical to that used for an appositive phrase, leaving it unclear whether this is a list of three entities (1, my mother; 2, Mother Teresa; and 3, the pope) or of only two entities (1, my mother, who is Mother Teresa; and 2, the pope).

Also:
:&quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid, and a cook.&quot;
This is ambiguous because it is unclear whether &quot;a maid&quot; is an appositive renaming of Betty or the second in a list of three people. On the other hand, removing the final comma:
:&quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid and a cook.&quot;
leaves the possibility that Betty is both a maid and a cook (with &quot;a maid and a cook&quot; read as an appositive phrase). In this case, neither the serial-comma style—nor the no-serial-comma style—resolves the ambiguity. A writer who intends a list of three distinct people (Betty, maid, cook) may create an ambiguous sentence, regardless of whether the serial comma is adopted. Furthermore, if the reader is unaware of which convention is being used, both styles can be ambiguous in cases such as this.

These forms (among others) would remove the ambiguity:
* One person
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, who was a maid and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, both a maid and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty (a maid and cook).&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, their maid and cook.&quot;
* Two people
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty (a maid) and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty—a maid—and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, a maid, and with a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with the maid Betty and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with a cook and Betty, a maid.&quot;
* Three people
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, as well as a maid and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty and a maid and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with Betty, one maid and a cook.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with a maid, a cook, and Betty.&quot;
** &quot;They went to Oregon with a maid, a cook and Betty.&quot;
** &quot;They went with Betty to Oregon with a maid and a cook.&quot;

===In general===
* The list x, y and z is unambiguous if y and z cannot be read as a renaming of x.
* Equally, x, y, and z is unambiguous if y cannot be read as a renaming of x.
* If neither y nor y and z can be read as a renaming of x, then both forms of the list are unambiguous, but if both y and y and z can be read as a renaming of x, then both forms of the list are ambiguous.
* x and y and z is unambiguous if x and y and y and z cannot both be grouped.

Ambiguities can often be resolved by the selective use of semicolons instead of commas when more separation is required. General practice across style guides involves using semicolons when individual items have their own punctuation or coordinating conjunctions, but typically a &quot;serial semicolon&quot; is required.

==Recommendations by style guides==

Lynne Truss writes: &quot;There are people who embrace the Oxford comma, and people who don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ll just say this: &quot;never&quot; get between these people when drink has been taken.&quot;

Omitting a serial comma is often characterized as a journalistic style of writing, as contrasted with a more academic or formal style. Journalists typically do not use the comma, possibly for economy of space. In Australia and Canada, the comma is typically avoided in non-academic publications unless its absence produces ambiguity.

It is important that the serial comma&#x27;s usage within a document be consistent; inconsistent usage can seem unprofessional.

===Mainly American style guides supporting mandatory or typical use===
;The United States Government Printing Office&#x27;s &quot;Style Manual&quot;
:&quot;After each member within a series of three or more words, phrases, letters, or figures used with &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, or &quot;nor&quot;.&quot; It notes that an age (&quot;70 years 11 months 6 days&quot;) is not a series and should not take commas.
;Wilson Follett&#x27;s &quot;Modern American Usage: A Guide&quot; (Random House, 1981), pp. 397–401:
:&quot;What, then, are the arguments for omitting the last comma? Only one is cogent – the saving of space. In the narrow width of a newspaper column this saving counts for more than elsewhere, which is why the omission is so nearly universal in journalism. But here or anywhere one must question whether the advantage outweighs the confusion caused by the omission. … The recommendation here is that [writers] use the comma between all members of a series, including the last two, on the common-sense ground that to do so will preclude ambiguities and annoyances at a negligible cost.&quot;
;&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, 16th edition (University of Chicago Press, 2010), paragraph 6.18
:&quot;When a conjunction joins the last two elements in a series of three or more, a comma … should appear before the conjunction. Chicago strongly recommends this widely practiced usage.&quot; In answer to a reader&#x27;s query, &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style Online&quot; notes that their style guide has been recommending use of the serial comma ever since the first edition in 1906, but also qualifies this, saying &quot;the serial comma is optional; some mainstream style guides (such as the Associated Press) don&#x27;t use it. … there are times when using the comma (or omitting it) results in ambiguity, which is why it&#x27;s best to stay flexible.&quot;
;&quot;The Elements of Style&quot; (Strunk and White, 4th edition 1999), Rule 2
:&quot;In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.&quot; This has been recommended in &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; since the first edition by Strunk in 1918.
;The &quot;American Medical Association Manual of Style&quot;, 9th edition (1998) Chapter 6.2.1
:&quot;Use a comma before the conjunction that precedes the last term in a series.&quot;
;&quot;The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association&quot;, 6th edition (2010) Chapter 4.03
:&quot;Use a comma between elements (including before &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;) in a series of three or more items.&quot;
;&quot;The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers&quot; (Council of Science Editors, 7th edition, 2006), Section 5.3.3.1
:&quot;To separate the elements (words, phrases, clauses) of a simple series of more than 2 elements, including a comma before the closing &#x27;and&#x27; or &#x27;or&#x27; (the so-called serial comma). Routine use of the serial comma helps to prevent ambiguity.&quot;
;&quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, 4th edition (Oxford University Press, 2016), &quot;Punctuation,&quot; § D, &quot;Comma&quot;, p. 748
:&quot;Whether to include the serial comma has sparked many arguments. But it&#x27;s easily answered in favor of inclusion because omitting the final comma may cause ambiguities, whereas including it never will e.g.: &#x27;A and B, C and D, E and F[,] and G and H&#x27;.&quot;
;&quot;MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing&quot; (Modern Language Association 2008), paragraph 3.4.2.b
:&quot;Use commas to separate words, phrases, and clauses in a series.&quot;
;&quot;AAMT Book of Style for Medical Transcription&quot;
:&quot;Medical transcriptionists use the serial comma when two medications or diagnoses must be seen as separate; i.e., for &#x27;The patient was on Aspirin, Coversyl, and Dilaudid&#x27;, the comma is used before &#x27;and&#x27; to avoid the reader erroneously thinking that Coversyl and Dilaudid must be taken together.&quot;
;&quot;AIP Style Manual&quot;, American Institute of Physics, fourth edition, 1990
:&quot;A comma goes before &#x27;and&#x27; or &#x27;or&#x27; in a series of three or more: Sn, K, Na, and Li lines are invisible.&quot;
;&quot;Plain English Handbook&quot;, Revised Edition (McCormick-Mathers Publishing Co., 1959), § 483, p. 78
:&quot;Use commas to separate the items in a series of words, phrases, or short clauses:
:The farmer sold corn, hay, oats, potatoes, and wheat.&quot;

===Mainly American style guides opposing typical use===
;&quot;The New York Times&quot; stylebook
:&quot;In general, do not use a comma before &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; in a series.&quot;
;&quot;The AP Stylebook&quot;
:&quot;Use commas to separate elements in a series, but do not put a comma before the conjunction in a simple series. […] Put a comma before the concluding conjunction in a series, however, if an integral element of the series requires a conjunction: &quot;I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.&quot; Use a comma also before the concluding conjunction in a complex series of phrases: &quot;The main points to consider are whether the athletes are skillful enough to compete, whether they have the stamina to endure the training, and whether they have the proper mental attitude.&quot; In the United States, the choice is between journalistic style (no serial comma) and &quot;literary&quot; style (with serial comma); consistent use of the serial comma is usually recommended for college writing.&quot;

===Mainly British style guides supporting mandatory or typical use===
;&quot;MHRA Style Guide&quot; (Modern Humanities Research Association), 3rd edition (2013)
:&quot;In an enumeration of three or more items, the practice in MHRA journals is to insert commas after all but the last item, to give equal weight to each enumerated element. … The conjunctions &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; without a preceding comma are understood as linking the parts of a single enumerated element&quot;
:But paragraph 5.1 says &quot;The comma after the penultimate item may be omitted in books published by the MHRA, as long as the sense is clear.&quot;

===Mainly British style guides opposing typical use===
;&quot;The Times&quot; style manual
:&quot;Avoid the so-called &quot;Oxford comma&quot;; say &#x27;he ate bread, butter and jam&#x27; rather than &#x27;he ate bread, butter, and jam&#x27;.&quot;
;&quot;The Economist&quot; Style Guide
:&quot;Do not put a comma before &quot;and&quot; at the end of a sequence of items unless one of the items includes another &quot;and&quot;. Thus &#x27;The doctor suggested an aspirin, half a grapefruit and a cup of broth. But he ordered scrambled eggs, whisky and soda, and a selection from the trolley.
:&quot;Sometimes it is essential: compare &#x27;I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling&#x27; with &#x27;I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling&#x27;.&quot;
;University of Oxford Public Affairs Directorate Writing and Style Guide (2016)
:&quot;Note that there is generally no comma between the penultimate item and &#x27;and&#x27;/&#x27;or&#x27; – this is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Oxford comma&#x27;. However, it is essential to use an Oxford comma if required to prevent ambiguity.&quot;

===Mainly British style guides that consider it generally unnecessary but discretionary===
;&quot;The Guardian Style Guide&quot;
:&quot;A comma before the final &#x27;and&#x27; in lists: straightforward ones (he ate ham, eggs and chips) do not need one, but sometimes it can help the reader (he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea).&quot;
;&quot;The Cambridge Guide to English Usage&quot;
:&quot;In British practice there&#x27;s an Oxford/Cambridge divide … In Canada and Australia the serial comma is recommended only to prevent ambiguity or misreading.&quot;
;&quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, 4th edition, 2015
:&quot;The so-called &#x27;Oxford comma&#x27; is an optional comma that follows the penultimate item in a list of three or more items and precedes the word &#x27;and&#x27; … The general rule is that it should be used consistently or not at all … However, the Oxford comma can help to avoid ambiguity, ... and it is sometimes helpful to the reader to use an isolated serial comma for clarification, even when the convention has not been adopted in the rest of the text.&quot;
;&quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot;, 2014
:&quot;The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently. However, the last comma can serve to resolve ambiguity, particularly when any of the items are compound terms joined by a conjunction, and it is sometimes helpful to the reader to use an isolated serial comma for clarification even when the convention has not been adopted in the rest of the text.&quot;

===Australian style guides opposing typical use===
;The Australian Government Publishing Service&#x27;s &quot;Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers&quot;
:&quot;A comma is used before &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, or &quot;etc.&quot; in a list when its omission might either give rise to ambiguity or cause the last word or phrase to be construed with a preposition in the preceding phrase. … Generally, however, a comma is not used before &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; or &quot;etc.&quot; in a list.&quot;

===Canadian style guides opposing typical use===
;Public Works and Government Services Canada Translation Bureau&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing&quot;
:&quot;Items in a series may be separated by commas:
:Complacency, urbanity, sentimentality, whimsicality
:They may also be linked by coordinating conjunctions such as &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or:&quot;
:economists, sociologists or political scientists
:the good, the bad and the ugly
:Opinions differ on whether and when a comma should be inserted before the final &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or&quot; in a sequence. In keeping with the general trend toward less punctuation, the final comma is best omitted where clarity permits, unless there is a need to emphasize the last element in a series.&quot;

==Individual disputes==

===Maine labor dispute===
In the U.S. state of Maine, the lack of a serial comma became the deciding factor in a $13 million lawsuit filed in 2014 that was eventually settled for $5 million in 2017. The U.S. appeals judge David J. Barron wrote, &quot;For want of a comma, we have this case.&quot;

In &quot;O&#x27;Connor v. Oakhurst Dairy&quot;, a federal court of appeals was required to interpret a statute under which the &quot;canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution&quot; of certain goods were activities exempted from the general requirement of overtime pay. The question was whether this list included the distribution of the goods, or only the packing of the goods &quot;for&quot; distribution. The lack of a comma suggested one meaning, while the omission of the conjunction &quot;or&quot; before &quot;packing&quot; and the fact that the &quot;Maine Legislative Drafting Manual&quot; advised against use of the serial comma suggested another. It said &quot;Although authorities on punctuation may differ, when drafting Maine law or rules, don&#x27;t use a comma between the penultimate and the last item of a series.&quot; In addition to the absence of a comma, the fact that the word chosen was &quot;distribution&quot; rather than &quot;distributing&quot; was also a consideration, as was the question of whether it would be reasonable to consider the list to be an asyndetic list. Truck drivers demanded overtime pay; the defense conceded that the expression was ambiguous but said it should be interpreted as exempting distribution activity from overtime pay. The district court agreed with the defense and held that &quot;distribution&quot; was an exempt activity. On appeal, however, the First Circuit decided that the sentence was ambiguous and &quot;because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state&#x27;s wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose&quot;, adopted the drivers&#x27; narrower reading of the exemption and ruled that those who distributed the goods were entitled to overtime pay. Oakhurst Dairy settled the case by paying $5 million to the drivers, and the phrase in the law in question was later changed to use serial semicolons and &quot;distributing&quot; resulting in &quot;canning; processing; preserving; freezing; drying; marketing; storing; packing for shipment; or distributing&quot;.

The opinion in the case said that 43 of the 50 U.S. states had mandated the use of a serial comma and that both chambers of the federal congress had warned against omitting it, in the words of the U.S. House Legislative Counsel&#x27;s Manual on Drafting Style, &quot;to prevent any misreading that the last item is part of the preceding one&quot;; only seven states &quot;either do not require or expressly prohibited the use of the serial comma&quot;.

===British 50p Brexit coin===
In 2020 a commemorative 50p coin was brought into circulation in the United Kingdom to mark &quot;Brexit day&quot;, January 31, 2020, minted with the phrase &quot;Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations&quot;. English novelist Philip Pullman and others criticized the omission of the serial comma, while others said it was an Americanism and not required in this instance.

<doc id="457530" wikidata="Q3155162" url="?curid=457530" title="Parasitic twin">
<text>A parasitic twin, also known as an asymmetrical twin or unequal conjoined twin, occurs when a twin embryo begins developing in utero, but the pair does not fully separate, and one embryo maintains dominant development at the expense of the other. It results from the same processes that also produces &quot;vanishing twins&quot; and &quot;conjoined twins&quot;, and may represent a continuum between the two. In parasitic twins, one ceases development during gestation and is vestigial to a mostly fully formed, otherwise healthy individual twin. The undeveloped twin is termed as &quot;parasitic&quot;, because it is incompletely formed or wholly dependent on the body functions of the complete fetus. The independent twin is called the autosite. The autosite, together with the parasite, are collectively referred to as heteropagus twins.

==Variants==

===TRAP sequence===
The twin reversed arterial perfusion, or T.R.A.P. sequence, results in an &#x27;acardiac twin&#x27;, a parasitic twin that fails to develop a head, arms and a heart. The parasitic twin, little more than a torso with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord-like structure, much like a fetus &quot;in fetu&quot;, except the acardiac twin is outside the autosite&#x27;s body. The blood received by the parasitic twin has already been used by the normal fetus, and as such is already de-oxygenated, leaving little developmental nutrients for the acardiac twin. Because it is pumping blood for both itself and its acardiac twin, this causes extreme stress on the normal fetus&#x27; heart. Many T.R.A.P. pregnancies result in heart failure for the healthy twin. This twinning condition usually occurs very early in pregnancy. A rare variant of the acardiac fetus is the &quot;acardius acormus&quot; where the head is well developed but the heart and the rest of the body are rudimentary. While it is thought that the classical T.R.A.P./Acardius sequence is due to a retrograde flow from the umbilical arteries of the pump twin to the iliac arteries of the acardiac twin resulting in preferential caudal perfusion, &quot;acardius acormus&quot; is thought to be a result of an early embryopathy.

===Others===
Conjoined parasitic twins joined at the head are described as craniopagus or cephalopagus, and occipitalis if joined in the occipital region or parietalis if joined in the parietal region.

Craniopagus parasiticus is a general term for a parasitic head attached to the head of a more fully developed fetus or infant.

Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; sometimes is interpreted as a special case of parasitic twin, but may be a distinct entity.

<text>&quot;Beyond Lies the Wub&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Philip K. Dick. It was his first published genre story, originally appearing in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; in July 1952. It was first collected in &quot;The Preserving Machine&quot; in 1969, and was included in &quot;The Best of Philip K. Dick&quot; in 1977. It was the title story for the first volume of the original edition of Dick&#x27;s collected stories. Translations of &quot;Beyond Lies the Wub&quot; have appeared in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish; and the story has been included in more than a dozen anthologies.

==Plot==
Peterson, a crew member of a spaceship loading up with food animals on Mars, buys an enormous pig-like creature known as a &quot;wub&quot; from a native just before departure. Franco, his captain, is worried about the extra weight but seems more concerned about its taste, as his ship is short of food. However, after takeoff, the crew realizes that the wub is a very intelligent creature, capable of telepathy and maybe even mind control. 

Peterson and the wub spend time discussing mythological figures and the travels of Odysseus. Captain Franco, paranoid after an earlier confrontation with the Wub which left him temporarily paralyzed, bursts in and insists on killing and eating the wub. The crew becomes very much opposed to killing the sensitive creature after it makes a plea for understanding, but Franco still makes a meal out of him. At the dinner table, Captain Franco apologises for the &quot;interruption&quot; and resumes the earlier conversation between Peterson and the Wub - which now has apparently taken over the Captain&#x27;s body.

== Reception and analysis ==
&quot;Beyond Lies the Wub&quot; was Dick&#x27;s first published genre story, originally appearing in &quot;Planet Stories&quot; in July 1952.

Brian M. Stableford observed that this story &quot;already encapsulated the whimsical paranoia that characterizes almost all his work in the genre&quot;. Richard Bleiler likewise concurred that the story was indicative of &quot;the direction that his career was to take&quot;.

==References in other works ==
The theme of the Wub was revisited by Dick in his later short story &quot;Not by Its Cover&quot; (1968), which has been described as a &quot;loose sequel&quot; to the 1952 story.

In &quot;The Zap Gun&quot; the image of a &quot;Venusian wub&quot; is used in a maze game as a creature trapped in a maze to which the player becomes telepathically and empathically connected.

<text>Joan D. Vinge (; born April 2, 1948, as Joan Carol Dennison) is an American science fiction author. She is known for her Hugo Award–winning novel &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; and its sequels, her series about the telepath named Cat, and her &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; books. She also is the author of &quot;The Random House Book of Greek Myths&quot; (1999).

==Biography==
Vinge studied art in college, but eventually changed to a major in anthropology, and received a B.A. degree from San Diego State University in 1971.

Vinge has been married twice: first to fellow science fiction author Vernor Vinge from 1972 to 1979, and currently to science fiction editor James Frenkel since 1980. Vinge and Frenkel have two children, and live in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She has taught at the Clarion Workshop several times, both East and West.

Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot; in part to Joan.

On March 2, 2002, Vinge was severely injured in a car accident that left her with &quot;minor but debilitating&quot; brain damage that, along with her fibromyalgia, left her unable to write. She recovered to the point of being able to resume writing around the beginning of 2007, and her first new book after the accident was the 2011 novelization of the movie &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;.

==Works==
Vinge&#x27;s first published story, &quot;Tin Soldier&quot;, a novella, appeared in &quot;Orbit 14&quot; in 1974. Her stories have also appeared in &quot;Analog&quot;, &quot;Millennial Women&quot;, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;, and several &quot;Best of the Year&quot; anthologies.

Several of her stories have won major awards: Her novel &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; won the 1981 Hugo Award for Best Novel. &quot;Eyes of Amber&quot; won the 1977 Hugo Award for Best Novelette. She has also been nominated for several other Hugo and Nebula Awards, as well as for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. Her novel &quot;Psion&quot; was named a Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association.

<doc id="457539" wikidata="Q4003171" url="?curid=457539" title="Popham Colony">
<text>The Popham Colony—also known as the Sagadahoc Colony—was a short-lived English colonial settlement in North America. It was established in 1607 by the proprietary Plymouth Company and was located in the present-day town of Phippsburg, Maine, near the mouth of the Kennebec River. It was founded a few months after its more successful rival, the colony at Jamestown.

The Popham Colony was the second colony in the region that would eventually become known as New England. The first colony was St. Croix Island, near what is now the town of Calais. (St. Croix Island was settled initially in June 1604, then moved in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain to the Bay of Fundy). Popham was abandoned after only 14 months, apparently more due to the death of patrons and the first colony president than lack of success in the New World. The loss of life of the colonists in 1607 and 1608 at Popham was far lower than that experienced at Jamestown.

The first ocean-going ship built by the English in the New World was completed during the year of the Popham Colony and was sailed back across the Atlantic Ocean to England. The pinnace, named &quot;Virginia of Sagadahoc&quot;, was apparently quite seaworthy, and crossed the Atlantic again successfully in 1609 as part of Sir Christopher Newport&#x27;s nine-vessel Third Supply mission to Jamestown. The small &quot;Virginia&quot; survived a powerful three-day storm en route which was thought to have been a hurricane and which wrecked the mission&#x27;s large new flagship &quot;Sea Venture&quot; on Bermuda.

The exact site of the Popham Colony was lost until 1888 when a plan entitled &quot;The Draught of St Georges fort&quot; was found in Simancas, Spain. This plan exactly matches the location at Sabino Head near Maine&#x27;s Popham Beach State Park. Later archaeology in 1994 confirmed the location and the accuracy of the plan. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Founding===
Popham was a project of the Plymouth Company, which was one of the two competing parts of the proprietary Virginia Company that King James chartered in 1606 to raise private funds from investors in order to settle Virginia. At the time, the name &quot;Virginia&quot; applied to the entire east coast of North America from Spanish Florida to New France in modern-day Canada. That area was technically under the claim of the Spanish crown, but was not occupied by the Spanish.

The Plymouth Company was granted a royal charter and the rights to the coast between 38° and 45° N; the rival London Company was granted the coast between 34° and 41° N. The colonists were to plant first within their respective non-overlapping areas; the overlapping area between 38° and 41° would then go to the first company that proved &quot;strong enough&quot; to colonize it.

===Colonists===
The first Plymouth Company ship, &quot;Richard&quot;, sailed in August 1606, but the Spanish intercepted and captured it near Florida in November.

The next attempt was more successful. About 120 colonists (all men and boys) left Plymouth on May 31, 1607, in two ships. They intended to trade precious metals, spices, furs, and show that the local forests could be used to build English ships. George Popham was president of the colony and captain of &quot;Gift of God&quot;. Raleigh Gilbert—son of Sir Humphrey—was admiral (second in command) of the colony and captain of &quot;Mary and John&quot;. Neither of these men was a mariner and the ship&#x27;s officers of &quot;Mary and John&quot; were Robert Davies and James Davis. The ship&#x27;s log and diary from the voyage and first 6 weeks of the colony is the main contemporary source of the information about the Popham Colony. (It was called &quot;Popham&quot; after its principal financial backer, Sir John Popham.) The diary is kept in Lambeth Museum in London. James Davis was later made captain of the ship built by the colonists, &quot;Virginia&quot;, which made at least two voyages across the Atlantic. Robert and James were most likely from a family of mariners from Devon, England.

Sir John Popham was the Lord Chief Justice of England, while Gilbert was the son of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and half-nephew of Sir Walter Raleigh. Other financiers included Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the military governor of Plymouth. Much of the information about the events in the colony comes from his letters and memoirs. Settlers included the Reverend Richard Seymour, grandson of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the brother of Queen Jane Seymour. Nine council members and six other gentlemen accompanied the expedition, while the rest were soldiers, artisans, farmers and traders.

In August they arrived at Pemaquid, returning a native, Skidwarres, who had been captured by George Weymouth in 1605. The &quot;Gift of God&quot; arrived at the mouth of the Kennebec River (then called the Sagadahoc River) on August 13, 1607. The &quot;Mary and John&quot; arrived three days later. They quickly began construction of large star-shaped Fort St. George.

===Fort St. George===
Fort St. George, named for the patron saint of England, was built on the headland of an area named Sabino, south of what is now Bath, Maine, in the town of Phippsburg.

On October 8, 1607, colonist John Hunt drew a plan of the colony. Hunt was listed in the colony&#x27;s register as &quot;draughtsman&quot;. His plan, titled &quot;The draught of St Georges fort Erected by Captayne George Popham Esquier&quot;, was a surveyed and detailed picture-map showing a star-shaped fort, with ditches and ramparts, and with 18 buildings, including the admiral&#x27;s house, a chapel, a storehouse, a cooperage, and a guardhouse. At Fort St. George it shows nine guns that ranged in size from demi-culverin to falcon. The plan was drafted when work on the site was just beginning, so it is unclear how much was actually built.

As a result of espionage, Hunt&#x27;s map was sold to the Spanish ambassador to England, Pedro de Zúñiga. The map then passed to King Philip III of Spain, in 1608. In 1888, it was discovered in the Spanish General Archives in Simancas, having gone unnoticed by historians for nearly three centuries.

Fort St. George was abandoned after 14 months of occupation. Most of the site is privately owned, but part of it is within the Fort Baldwin State Historic Site. Between 1994 and 2013 a number of archaeological explorations were done at the site. Archaeological excavations show some but not all of the buildings in the plan, and shallow ditches where defensive trenches are shown on the plan. No stonework was found, but many of the defenses are based on the natural geography.

===Troubles begin===
Popham and Gilbert sent survey expeditions up the river and west across Casco Bay and contacted the Abenaki, an Indian tribe belonging to the Algonquian peoples of northeastern North America. In a letter to the King, Popham wrote that the natives had told them that the area was full of easily exploitable resources. However, the colony failed to establish cooperation with the tribe.

Late summer arrival meant that there was no time to farm for food. With inadequate supplies, half of the colonists returned to England in December 1607 aboard the &quot;Gift of God&quot; and almost starved on the return trip and had to sell their cargo in the Azores. Others faced a cold winter during which the Kennebec River froze. Historical records indicate that fire destroyed parts of the storehouse and its provisions, but archaeological excavations indicate that other buildings were burned and not the storehouse. George Popham died on February 5, 1608. He is the only colonist known to have died (in contrast to Jamestown which lost half its population that year) although the Abenaki claimed that they killed eleven colonists and set fire to the site. Raleigh Gilbert became president of the colony at the age of 25.

The colonists completed one major project: the building of a 30-ton ship, a pinnace they named &quot;Virginia&quot;. It was the first English ocean-going ship built in the Americas. The primary purpose of &quot;Virginia&quot; was for use in exploration of the area, but was later refitted and some of the colonists returned to England in it when the colony was abandoned. This was the beginning of a 400-year shipbuilding legacy in the Bath, Maine area.

In May 1608 a supply ship brought a message that Sir John Popham had died. The supply ship returned to England with a cargo. When &quot;Mary and John&quot; returned in September 1608, it brought news that Gilbert&#x27;s elder brother John had died. Gilbert thus inherited the title and the estate of Compton Castle in Devon. He decided to return to England and as no other leader was found, the colony decided to disband and the remaining colonists sailed home in &quot;Mary and John&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot;. (The &quot;Virginia&quot; would make at least one more Atlantic crossing, going to Jamestown the next year with the Third Supply, piloted by Captain James Davis.)

The colony lasted just 14 months. It is likely that the failure of the colony was due to multiple problems: the lack of financial support after the death of Sir John Popham, the inability to find another leader, the cold winter, and finally the hostility of both the native people and the French. Sir Francis Popham (son of Sir John) tried several times to reestablish the colony, but was unable to get the financial backing. The settlement of New England was delayed until it was taken up by refugees instead of adventurers.

===Later developments===

French colonist Jean de Biencourt with Father Pierre Biard visited the abandoned site in 1611. In 1624, Samuel Maverick also visited the site and reported that it was &quot;overgrown&quot; but garden herbs could still be seen. In the 18th century the site was divided into farmland and several houses were built on the site.

During the American Civil War, the Union army built Fort Popham in the area, directly on the Kennebec River at the mouth of Atkins Bay (about 500 meters east of the Popham Colony site). In 1905 the U.S. Army built Fort Baldwin on Sabino Head just west of the site, but parts of the site were used for transport and storage. The state of Maine bought some of the area in 1924. Fort Baldwin was reactivated during World War II. After the war, Fort Baldwin was returned to the state of Maine and is now part of the Fort Baldwin State Historic Site. Much of the Popham Colony Site is privately owned.

==Modern excavations==
The first excavations of the area in the 1960s were unsuccessful. In 1994, Jeffrey Brain of the Peabody Essex Museum confirmed the site of the colony using Hunt&#x27;s plan as a guide, and confirmed the accuracy of the plan. He began a larger excavation in 1997 and later uncovered the Admiral&#x27;s house, the storehouse and a liquor storage building. He also proved that Hunt&#x27;s map was very accurate for those buildings which were actually built. Parts of the fort, probably including the chapel and graveyard, lie on private property not open for digging and the fort&#x27;s southern portion is under a public road. One major find in the later excavations was that iron smelting had been done in the Popham Colony, presumably using local bog iron. This might have been the earliest iron smelting in what is now the United States. The excavation was concluded in 2013.

<text>Bell-Northern Research (BNR) was a telecommunications research and development company established In 1971 when Bell Canada and Northern Electric combined their R&amp;D organizations. It was jointly owned by Bell Canada and Northern Telecom. BNR was absorbed into Nortel Networks when that company changed its name from Northern Telecom in the mid-1990s.

BNR was based at the Carling Campus in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with campuses at locations around the world, including Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Harlow and Maidenhead, United Kingdom. Bell-Northern Research pioneered the development of digital technology, and created the first practical digital PBX, (SL1), and central office (DMS). Under the direction of then Nortel Chief Executive Officer, John Roth, BNR lost its separate identity in the 1990s, and was folded into the Nortel R&amp;D organization.

==History==
For much of its early history, Bell Canada operated as the Canadian division of the Bell System. Development and manufacturing of their various telephony products generally took place in the US, and then, to avoid duty, were manufactured in Canada at their Northern Electric subsidiary (which would later become Nortel Networks), the Canadian analog to the US Western Electric.

===Pre-1970s===
Northern Electric spun off a subsidiary in 1934, Dominion Sound Equipment, originally to develop equipment for sound in movies. Over time, the division evolved in an attempt to use its design talent and manufacturing ability on third party projects. In 1937, this aspect became the Special Products Division. For many years the SPD was used as Bell Canada&#x27;s R&amp;D arm, although as before, most telephony designs were created at Bell Labs in the US.

In 1949, the United States Justice department attempted to force AT&amp;T to divest itself of its Western Electric subsidiary. As a result of this legal action, Western Electric sold its shares in Northern Electric to Bell Canada.
In 1957, Northern Electric started its own research and development labs in Belleville, Ontario. Two years later, Northern Electric created the Northern Electric Research and Development Laboratories in Ottawa.

===1970s===

In 1971, Bell Canada and Northern Electric combined their R&amp;D organizations and formed Bell-Northern Research.

BNR&#x27;s researchers pioneered the view that a telephone switch (PBX or Central Office) was best regarded as a special form of real-time computer, a view that was considered to be highly innovative in the 1970s. Although George Stibitz had foreseen this evolution at AT&amp;T in the 1930s, subsequent generations of engineers, prior to the 1970s, regarded the switch as a piece of hardware, best hard-wired, to handle the basic telephone call where two parties connect, speak and hang up.

In the 1960s, however, this view was coming under a great deal of strain. Increasingly, telephone users wanted to conference call, forward, and record voice greetings, so common today. Such features required more flexibility in the controller, leading to the development of computer-controlled switching machines, notably the Bell Labs − Western Electric 1ESS. These early machines still had an analog, usually electromechanical switching matrix because the technology of the time did not permit the cost-effective dedication of a filter-codec to each subscriber. (Transmission systems had already gone digital, for example the D4 carrier system.)

Northern Electric introduced its first electronic central office system in 1969 with the SP1. The SP1 had a fully computer-based electronic control system, thus the name &quot;SP&quot;, short for &quot;stored program&quot;. Its switching matrix was still electromechanical. Rather than the reed relay matrix of the 1ESS, it used the minibar, a version of the crossbar switch.

BNR was, with Northern Telecom, a part owner of MicroSystems International a semiconductor manufacturer based in Kanata, outside Ottawa.

====The Digital Switch====
BNR introduced the Meridian SL-1 in 1975, the world&#x27;s first all-digital PABX aimed at medium-sized businesses. The SL-1 was fully digital in both control and switching. As such the SL-1 was smaller, much more reliable, and offered many more features than an equivalent electromechanical system. The SL-1 design evolved into Meridian-1, and subsequently the CS1000x as Nortel&#x27;s private network (or enterprise) flagship offering.

The SP-1 design was superseded by the DMS-100 central office switch and other members of the DMS family of products (DMS: digital multiplex switch). DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built.

BNR&#x27;s products were architecturally based on Complex Instruction Set (CISC) architectures prevalent in the 1970s, and on a series of underlying technologies. This was greatly influenced by the late 1970s success of the DEC VAX computer, a highly &quot;elegant&quot; and rather layered technology, realizable in a range of power. In the early 1990s, under Nortel CEO Jean Monty, the software for the flagship DMS product was segmented into layers (&#x27;Base&#x27;, &#x27;Telecom&#x27;, and &#x27;IEC&#x27; or Inter-Exchange Carrier) to improve maintainability of the product. The IEC layers were customer-specific, targeted towards Sprint, MCI, and a large group of small &quot;United Carrier&quot; companies that were subsequently swallowed up by Worldcom. Once the IEC layer was established, customer-specific releases could occur quarterly, whereas Telecom and Base programming was for baked-in code that only had infrequent, maintenance updates.

===1980s===
Through the 1980s attention turned from pure hardware to software development. The BNR Toronto lab introduced Meridian Mail in the 1980s, which went on to be a very successful product and forced the introduction of similar products from other telephony vendors. They later added automatic call distribution and other similar services.

At its zenith in the early 1980s, when it opened R&amp;D centers in Mountain View, Ann Arbor and later in Research Triangle Park and Richardson, Texas, BNR&#x27;s notable American employees included Whitfield Diffie, a noted authority on cryptography, and Robert Gaskins, who invented PowerPoint after leaving BNR, influenced in part by BNR&#x27;s response to the very cumbersome presentation tools used by his department there. J.W.J. Williams, the inventor of Heapsort was also an influential figure in the development of digital switching.

As part of its internal IT infrastructure, BNR also created an email system called COCOS (COrporate COmmunication System), and a powerful relational database system called GERM (General Entity-Relationship Model).

BNR also had labs in Maidenhead, England, Montreal, Quebec, Edmonton, Alberta, Wollongong, Australia, and Tokyo, Japan; as well as Atlanta, Georgia and Ann Arbor, Michigan.

===1990s===
With the formation of Bell Canada Enterprises (later shortened to BCE) in 1983 as the parent company of Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, BNR in Canada was jointly owned 50-50 by Bell Canada and Nortel. Nortel assumed a majority share in BNR in 1996, and BNR was gradually folded into Nortel, which acquired the remainder of BNR when BCE divested itself of Nortel. Unfortunately, the collapse in demand for Nortel products in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble, which occurred after aggressive spending on acquisitions and hiring under CEO John Roth, required Nortel to trim its workforce from 96,000 (in 2001) to 35,000 people (as of 2006).

<text>John Moore (26 April 1730 – 18 January 1805) was an English clergyman who was Archbishop of Canterbury in the Church of England.

==Life==
Moore was the son of Thomas Moore, a butcher, and his wife Elizabeth. He was born in Gloucester and was baptised at St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Gloucester. He was educated at The Crypt School, Gloucester. He was a student at Pembroke College, Oxford (matriculated 1745; BA 1748; MA 1751).

After ordination, he was for some years tutor to Lord Charles Spencer and Lord Robert Spencer, the younger sons of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough. On 21 September 1761, he was preferred to the fifth prebendal stall in the church of Durham and, in April 1763, to a canonry at Christ Church, Oxford. 
On 1 July 1764, he received the degrees of B.D. and D.D. On 19 September 1771, he was made Dean of Canterbury, and on 10 February 1775, Bishop of Bangor.

On the death of Archbishop Frederick Cornwallis, he was translated to the See of Canterbury on 26 April 1783, on the joint recommendation of bishops Robert Lowth and Richard Hurd, both of whom had declined the primacy.
Though not a great ecclesiastic, Moore was an amiable and worthy prelate, a competent administrator, and a promoter of the Sunday-school movement and of missionary enterprise. He appears to have dispensed his patronage with somewhat more than due regard to the interests of his own family.

He died at Lambeth Palace on 18 January 1805 and was buried in Lambeth parish church.

==Family==
Moore was married twice, first to Jane Wright (1736 – about 1765), the sister of Sir James Wright, Resident at Venice on 29 April 1763 at Walcot St. Swithin, Somerset, England; and secondly, on 23 January 1770, to Catherine Eden, daughter of Sir Robert Eden of West Auckland. He left children; one son, Roger Moore, would go on to be a Canon of Canterbury Cathedral.

More than 30 years after his first wife&#x27;s death the Archbishop would officiate at the wedding of her nephew, the later Sir George Wright, 2nd Baronet, to Rebecca Maclane, on 3 June 1796.

==Discovery of his coffin==
In 2017, during the refurbishment of the Garden Museum, which is housed at the medieval church of St Mary-at-Lambeth, 30 lead coffins were found; one with an archbishop&#x27;s red and gold mitre on top of it. A metal plate identified one of these as belonging to Moore, with another being that of his wife Catherine.
