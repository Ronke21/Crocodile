<text>Alfred John Gardyne Drummond de Chastelain (born 30 July 1937) is a Canadian retired army officer and diplomat.

De Chastelain was born in Romania to Scottish and American parents and was educated in England and Scotland before his family emigrated to Canada in 1954. There, de Chastelain became a Militia private and enrolled in the Royal Military College of Canada, going on to pursue a career in the Canadian Army. He was commissioned into Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and rose eventually to be twice Chief of the Defence Staff, with a break of a year during which he served as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United States. In 1995, de Chastelain became active in the Northern Ireland peace process and eventually focused on the disarmament of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.

==Early life and education==
De Chastelain was born in 1937 in Bucharest, Romania, to Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain, a Scottish oil engineer then working in Bucharest for British Petroleum, (later an agent of SOE) and Marion Elizabeth de Chastelain, an American. He was educated in England and later at Fettes College, Edinburgh. The de Chastelain family emigrated to Canada in 1954, and a year later, after finishing his education at Fettes College, De Chastelain joined his family and attended Mount Royal College (now Mount Royal University) in Calgary. He married Mary Ann Laverty.

==Military==

De Chastelain started his military career as a Militia private in the Calgary Highlanders in which he served from January to September 1956. He was enrolled in the Royal Military College of Canada in September 1956 and graduated in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and a commission in Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), two years before he became a naturalized Canadian. Performing regimental duty in Canada, Germany, and Cyprus, de Chastelain subsequently attended the British Army staff college in Camberley in 1966 and was commanding officer of the Second Battalion PPCLI from 1970 to 1972.

As a colonel, he commanded CFB Montreal for a two-year period ending with the 1976 Summer Olympics in that city. He was also Deputy Chief of Staff of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and Commander of the Canadian contingent there. As a brigadier-general, he successively became Commandant of the Royal Military College of Canada in 1977, Commander of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in Lahr, Germany in 1980 and Director General Land Doctrine and Operations at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario in 1982.

As a major-general, de Chastelain was Deputy Commander of the Canadian Army (then called Mobile Command) and Commander of the Mobile Command Division, which was exercised as such in 1985 on Exercise RV &#x27;85. As a lieutenant-general, he became Assistant Deputy Minister for Personnel in 1986 and then Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff in 1988. In 1989, he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed Chief of the Defence Staff.

In 1993, he transferred to the Reserves and was appointed Ambassador to the United States by Brian Mulroney. In 1994, shortly after the election of Jean Chrétien, he was recalled to Regular Force duty and re-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, replacing Admiral Anderson and vacating the office of Ambassador for Raymond Chrétien. de Chastelain served as Chief of Defence Staff until his retirement in December 1995.

==Civilian==
From November 1995, de Chastelain was involved in the Northern Ireland peace process and from 1997 to 2011 he was Chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, which was responsible for ensuring the decommissioning of arms by paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. He has made an impact on the way that Britain has viewed the IRA since the decommissioning has begun. As part of the Good Friday Agreement an independent neutral adjudicator was selected to look over the disarmament of Republican and Loyalist paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland.

==Honours==

In 1985, de Chastelain was appointed Commander of the Order of Military Merit and in 1991, Commander of the Order of St John; in 1993, he received the Commendation Medal of Merit and Honour of Greece, and was appointed Officer of the Order of Canada; in 1995, he was appointed Commander of the Legion of Merit (U.S.A.); in 1999, he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour; and in 2014, he was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada. Archie Cairns composed a jig for bagpipes in his honour in 1992.

He has an honorary Doctor of Military Science degree from the Royal Military College of Canada, an honorary Doctor of Laws (Conflict Resolution) degree from Royal Roads University in British Columbia, an honorary Doctor of Education degree from Nipissing University, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Carleton University, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from Saint Mary&#x27;s University, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Brock University, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Concordia University, an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Mount Allison University and a Doctorate Honoris Causa from the University of Edinburgh, and an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Mount Royal University. He is an Honorary Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. De Chastelain was a recipient of the Vimy Award in 1992.

<doc id="457759" wikidata="Q2014671" url="?curid=457759" title="Acre Sanjak">
<text>The Sanjak of Acre (; ), often referred as Late Ottoman Galilee, was a prefecture (sanjak) of the Ottoman Empire, located in modern-day northern Israel. The city of Acre was the Sanjak&#x27;s capital.

Acre was captured by the Ottoman Sultan Selim I in 1517, but the city fell into disuse soon thereafter and was governed under the Sanjak of Safad during 16th-18th centuries. Acre was the center of the Nahiya of Acre, a subdistrict of the sanjak, which also included the villages of Buqei&#x27;a, Al-Tira, Julis, Kafr Yasif, Kabul and Shefa-&#x27;Amr. Acre was the center of a major economic boom under the leadership of Zahir al-Umar during the late 18th century.

The Sanjak of Acre was created c. early 18th century as a prefecture of the Sidon Eyalet. The Sidon Eyalet later became known as the Acre Eyalet between 1775 and 1841 when Acre was designated as the eyalet&#x27;s capital city. Following the promulgation of the Vilayet Law as per the then-ongoing Tanzimat, or administrative reforms, in 1864, the sanjak of Acre was annexed to the newly created Syria Vilayet. In 1888, the sanjaks of Acre, Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, and Nablus were separated from the Syria Vilayet and transferred to the Beirut Vilayet.

== Subdistricts ==
The sanjak was made up of five districts (kazas):
* Kaza of Acre (Akka)
* Kaza of Haifa (Hayfa)
* Kaza of Safed
* Kaza of Nazareth (Nasıra)
* Kaza of Tiberias (Taberiye)

<text>George F. Jewsbury (born November 26, 1941) is an American historian who has collaborated on several textbooks in the &quot;Civilization: Past &amp; Present&quot; series. He joined authors T. Walter Wallbank, Alastair M. Taylor, and Nels M. Bailkey, beginning with the single volume fifth edition. Jewsbury has also written several books on history, including &quot;Russian Annexation of Bessarabia, 1774–1828&quot;. He was a professor of history at Oklahoma State University, and is a specialist on Russia and the USSR.

Jewsbury is the uncle of author Neal Stephenson, with whom he has collaborated on two different books, &quot;Interface&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Cobweb&quot; (1996). For these books he adopted the pseudonym J. Frederick George, and the two of them then adopted the collaborative pseudonym of Stephen Bury. It was revealed after the books&#x27; publications that Stephen Bury was a pseudonym for Stephenson and his uncle, and it was then further revealed, after several years had passed, that &quot;J. Frederick George&quot; was a pseudonym for George Jewsbury.

<text>Nicolas Michael Angelis (29 April 1944 – 30 May 2020) was an English actor. He was best known for his television roles as Chrissie Todd in &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;, Martin Niarchos in &quot;G.B.H.&quot; and as the longest-running narrator of the British children&#x27;s series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; from 1991 to 2012, as well as several other products and media related to the franchise.

== Early life and career ==
Nicolas Michael Angelis was born on 29 April 1944 in Paddington, London to an English mother, Margaret (née McCulla) (1920–1947), and a Greek father, Evangelos Angelis (1894–1959). He was raised in Dingle, Liverpool. He trained at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Glasgow, where he played roles in, among other works, Brendan Behan&#x27;s &quot;The Hostage&quot; and &quot;The Zykovs&quot; by Maxim Gorky. He was featured in &quot;Boys from the Black Stuff&quot; (1982) and &quot;G.B.H.&quot;. 

Angelis appeared in comedies such as &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; (1975–1978) and &quot;Luv&quot; (1993–1994) and films such as &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; (1979) and &quot;No Surrender&quot; (1985). In 1983, he appeared at the Royal Exchange, Manchester in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot;. He was a villain in the revived television series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; (2002), alongside former fellow &quot;Black Stuff&quot; star Alan Igbon. He narrated the British version of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; from 1991 to 2012, replacing Ringo Starr. 

He narrated John Peel&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Margrave of the Marshes&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005. In 2006 he starred in &quot;Fated&quot;, a film set in Liverpool, and in 2007 he appeared in episodes of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;. In September 2011 he participated in the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;The Reunion&quot;, talking with other cast members about &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;.

==Personal life==
Angelis married three times. His first marriage, in 1971, ended in divorce. He married the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Helen Worth in 1991, although they had been a couple since the mid 1970s. They divorced in 2001, following his much-publicised affair with the woman who would become his third wife, Welsh model Jennifer Khalastchi, whom he married in 2003. He and Worth remained friends.

He was the younger brother of fellow actor Paul Angelis.

==Death==
Angelis died from a heart attack at his home in Thatcham, Berkshire on 30 May 2020, at the age of 76.

<doc id="457771" wikidata="Q558536" url="?curid=457771" title="Sæberht of Essex">
<text>Sæberht, Saberht or Sæbert (d. 616) was an Anglo-Saxon King of Essex (r. 604 – 616), in succession of his father King Sledd. He is known as the first East Saxon king to have been converted to Christianity.

The principal source for his reign is the early 8th-century &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; by Bede (d. 735), who claims to have derived his information about the missionary work of Mellitus among the East Saxons from Abbot Albinus of Canterbury through the London priest Nothhelm, later Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 739). Other sources include the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, an East Saxon genealogy possibly of the late 9th century (British Library Add MS 23211), and a handful of genealogies and regnal lists written down by Anglo-Norman historians.

==Family==
The genealogies and regnal lists are unanimous in describing Sæberht as the son of Sledd, who may have been regarded as the founder of the East Saxon dynasty. According to Bede, Sæberht&#x27;s mother was Ricula, a sister of King Æthelberht of Kent. Bede omits the names of Sæberht&#x27;s three sons, who succeeded him but two, Sexred and Sæward, are named in the genealogy of Add MS 23211.

==Conversion and succession==
In 604, the churchman Mellitus was consecrated by Augustine as bishop in the province of the East Saxons, which had a capital at London, making him the first Saxon Bishop of London. Bede tells that Sæberht converted to Christianity in 604 and was baptised by Mellitus, while his sons remained pagan. Sæberht then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church which was built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht, though a charter which claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a forgery.

==Death and burial==

Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died in 616, leaving the Gregorian mission without strong patrons. Sæberht&#x27;s pagan sons drove Mellitus from London. According to Bede&#x27;s explanation, this happened because Mellitus refused the brothers&#x27; request for a taste of the sacramental bread.

===Westminster Abbey===
Later medieval legend claimed that Sæberht and his wife Ethelgoda had founded a monastery in London dedicated to St Peter at the site of the present Westminster Abbey, and that they had been buried in the church there. In the reign of Henry III, during rebuilding work in 1245-1272, their supposed remains were transferred into a tomb which the king had especially erected for them in the Chapter House, close to the entrance of the Royal Chapels. The King&#x27;s remains were reportedly still clothed in royal robes and a ruby thumb ring was seen. In 1308, the bones were said to have been relocated once again to a marble tomb which still stands today in the south ambulatory. There is no genuine evidence to support this tradition however, and modern scholars cast doubt on the claim that Sæberht&#x27;s bones were ever genuinely entombed here.

===Great Burstead===
There is a local tradition that Sæberht lived, and was buried at Great Burstead in Essex.

===Prittlewell burial===

In 2003 a high-status Anglo-Saxon tomb was discovered at Prittlewell, just north of Southend in Essex. The artefacts found were of such a quality that archaeologists surmised that Prittlewell was a tomb of one of the Kings of Essex, and the discovery of golden foil crosses indicates that the inhabitant was an early Christian. As the initial evidence pointed to an early seventh-century date, Sæberht was considered the most likely candidate for the burial, although other possibilities such as his Christian grandson Sigeberht the Good, or an unknown individual of high status, were not ruled out. However, carbon dating techniques later indicated a revised date in the late 6th century. In May 2019, it was reported that a team of 40 specialists from the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) now believe the tomb could have belonged to Seaxa, Sæberht&#x27;s brother. Carbon dating had indicated that the tomb was built between 575 and 605, at least 11 years before Sæberht&#x27;s death. Further details of the latest research have been published on the MOLA website.

<text>Francisco Anthony &quot;Frank&quot; Lorenzo (born May 19, 1940) is an American businessman. He managed Continental Airlines and Texas International Airlines between 1972 and 1990, through airline deregulation. Lorenzo also led the creation and management of the holding company for the group, Texas Air Corporation, through which New York Air was formed in 1980 and Eastern Air Lines was acquired in 1986, as well as Frontier Airlines and People Express Airlines.

As an airline manager, Lorenzo earned a reputation for low fares and cost cutting, as well as union busting, as he and other airline managers pursued an affordable business model for the newly deregulated aviation era. Lorenzo was esteemed by airline regulators for his commitment to low fares, while others in the industry referred to Lorenzo as &quot;the embodiment of deregulation&quot;. As R. E. G. Davies, the former aerospace historian at the Smithsonian Institution put it, Lorenzo &quot;challenged the entire structure of cost-and-revenue relations that had long existed in a closely protected corporate environment and in doing so generated a cause célèbre of historic proportions&quot;.

Since 1990, Lorenzo has been chairman of Savoy Capital, Inc., an asset management and venture capital firm, and he has served as a trustee for The Hispanic Society of America since 2005.

==Early life==
Born to Spanish immigrants Olegario Lorenzo (died 1980) and Ana (née Mateos, died 2008), Lorenzo grew up in Queens, New York. His father was a long-time beauty salon proprietor in Manhattan; his mother worked as a hairdresser at their salon.

===Public high school, Columbia and Harvard Business School===
Lorenzo attended Forest Hills High School and then worked his way through Columbia University, holding several jobs, including at Macy&#x27;s as a salesperson and Coca-Cola as a truck driver and member of the Teamsters Union. He graduated in 1961 with a B. A. degree in economics, followed by an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1963, as he was turning 23.

===Jobs at TWA, Eastern, and the Army===
Lorenzo&#x27;s first professional jobs, from 1963–1966, were at Trans World Airlines, as a Senior Analyst, and then at Eastern Airlines, as Manager of Financial Analysis. He also spent six months in the Army reserve in 1964, and then returned to his job in New York.

===Lorenzo, Carney &amp; Co.===
He formed Lorenzo &amp; Carney, Inc., a financial advisory firm specializing in airlines, in 1966 with Robert Carney, who had also attended Harvard Business School. Their first offices were atop the Pan Am Building in New York. The firm participated in the establishment of a supplemental airline, Universal Airways, and also in the refinancing of British West Indian Airlines (BWIA).

===Jet Capital===
Lorenzo and Carney later formed Jet Capital Corporation in 1969, initially as an aircraft leasing company. Jet Capital raised $1.5 million in a public stock offering, and was later asked by Chase Manhattan Bank to attempt a refinancing plan for Texas International Airlines (TIA) as an alternative to bankruptcy, as the airline was in default on its aircraft bank loans. Jet Capital put together a refinancing and equity infusion for Texas International Airlines in 1971.

==Early airline career==

===Texas International Airlines===
As part of the refinancing plan for Texas International Airlines (TIA), Jet Capital acquired control of TIA in 1972, and received 26% of TIA&#x27;s equity interest and 59% of its voting power for $1.15 million. Lorenzo became its president and Carney its executive vice president in August 1972. The deal was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry in the United States at the time, after a contentious CAB approval process fought with Howard Hughes, who at the time controlled Hughes Airwest.

When Lorenzo took control of TIA in 1972, it was on the verge of financial collapse, having lost money since 1966. Two years later, Lorenzo&#x27;s management was able to steer the company to break even due to significant streamlining of operations. Some years later an analyst from Oppenheimer &amp; Company, citing Lorenzo and business-partner Carney&#x27;s strategies of substituting obsolete planes with jets, eliminating unprofitable routes in exchange for destinations with higher demand, and instituting half-price &quot;peanut-fares&quot; for the first time in the aviation industry, noted TIA&#x27;s ability to compete and win against much larger and financially stronger companies. TIA also had to compete with a new-at-the-time Texas intrastate airline, Southwest Airlines, which was union-free then and had much lower costs.

Lorenzo&#x27;s management changed the character of the airline, having revamped its fleet, increased utilization, cut costs and dropped many losing routes, while adding flights on strong segments. The average trip distance per passenger boarded jumped 25% from 1972 to 1976. In 1977, the company earned $8 million, and in 1978, TIA&#x27;s reported net income was up to $13.2 million and it was described as an &quot;aggressive, innovative carrier&quot;.

TIA implemented in 1977, just before the advent of airline deregulation, the first unrestricted airline low fares, which were called &quot;Peanut Fares.&quot; The success of this promotion drove major improvement in TIA&#x27;s financial position. In his book on aviation history, author R.E.G. Davies refers to these fares as &quot;...a watershed in airline passenger tariffs.&quot; Also in 1977, TIA was the first to develop and implement a forerunner to the frequent flyer programs of today, which were called Payola Passes - coupons based on flight segments.

===Airline takeover attempts===

====National Airlines====
In 1978, the airline world was astonished to learn that Lorenzo (TIA) had moved to take over National Airlines, a domestic trunk airline three times its size, having purchased 9.2% of the stock of National Airlines, becoming the first airline to buy up shares of another airline as a prelude to a possible takeover.

For several weeks starting in June 1978, Texas International Air had acquired shares of National Airlines, filing documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when its stake reached just short of the 10% that would require prior approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). TIA was reported at the time to be studying the &quot;possibility of seeking control&quot; of National. Several weeks later, TIA announced intentions to buy up to 25% of National&#x27;s stock, and requested approval from the CAB to acquire the stock and direct control of National. TIA&#x27;s attempted takeover of the much larger National &quot;surprised a lot of people&quot;, because National was so much larger than TIA at the time and no airline had ever attempted an &quot;unfriendly&quot; takeover of another airline before. Lorenzo&#x27;s management team viewed National&#x27;s stock as significantly undervaluing the assets of the company, and the move was financial in addition to being strategic and aimed at combining the routes of the two airlines.

A competing offer for control of National was submitted to the CAB by Pan Am, and National ultimately agreed to be acquired by Pan Am; these actions drove up the price of National&#x27;s stock. The CAB gave TIA and Pan Am each permission to acquire up to 25% of National&#x27;s shares, and the two companies acquired 45% of the shares in total. The management and directors of National, as a group, owned less than 5% of the outstanding shares. In December, Eastern Airlines also joined the bidding for National. TIA and Pan Am considered the bid a &quot;ploy to block their own chances&quot; of completing the deal, but Eastern chairman Frank Borman called the offer serious.

In April 1979, the United States Department of Justice and the United States Department of Transportation both announced opposition to a merger of Eastern and National on the grounds that the merger would be anti-competitive. In July, the CAB said it &quot;would not stand in the way of airline mergers that appear to benefit the public&quot;. National accepted the Pan Am offer and did not submit TIA&#x27;s offer to its shareholders, which rendered the TIA offer &quot;effectively dead&quot;. TIA agreed to sell its shares in National to Pan Am, earning TIA a net profit on the merger attempt of approximately $46 million.

====TWA in 1980 and 1985====
With a large amount of cash on hand, observers said that TIA was likely to begin another acquisition attempt quickly, to preclude becoming a takeover target itself. TIA did exactly that, accumulating shares of Trans World Airlines (TWA), an even bigger target than National. TWA had airline revenues about 14 times those of TIA, and the total revenue of TWA&#x27;s parent corporation, Trans World Corp., was 20 times TIA&#x27;s. TIA&#x27;s plan was to merge TIA with the TWA subsidiary of Trans World Corp., providing it with smaller feed aircraft and a feed network.

TWA was opposed to the merger; its board &quot;unanimously affirmed&quot; publicly that TWA was not for sale. After accumulating more than 4% of Trans World&#x27;s stock, TIA eventually backed out of the proposed deal, selling all of its holdings by January 1980.

In 1985, Lorenzo&#x27;s team again sought TWA as a merger partner. This time they were approached by the management of TWA as a &quot;white knight&quot; against the threatened acquisition of TWA by Carl Icahn, who was feared by TWA management and employees. Lorenzo signed a formal contract for the acquisition of TWA in June 1985. However, Icahn pressed on with his acquisition attempt after he received the backing of TWA&#x27;s pilot union who promised major cost cuts.

In August 1985, the TWA board voted to cede the company to Icahn who didn&#x27;t require any government approval, while Lorenzo&#x27;s airline would, since airline acquisitions of another airline still required DOT approval.

===Formation of Texas Air as holding company of group===

Lorenzo restructured TIA in 1980, forming a holding company called Texas Air Corp, which was controlled by Jet Capital, as TIA had been. Texas Air owned TIA and had cash holdings of about $100 million, which Lorenzo said would be used primarily for investments in the airline industry. It was the first airline to restructure into a holding company. Almost all airlines followed.

===Startup of New York Air as separate sub in New York===
Later in 1980, Texas Air formed a new airline, New York Air, with $25 million in capital. Lorenzo was the chairman of the new company, which was to fly shuttle flights between New York La Guardia, the airline&#x27;s hub, and Boston-Logan, and Washington-National Airports. Plans included expansion to several cities in the Northeast.

New York Air planned to win customers by charging lower fares and providing better service and roomier seats than the dominant carrier between New York and Washington, Eastern Airlines, which responded by offering lower fares. Pan Am, which had announced competing service after New York Air&#x27;s formation, also lowered its fares.

The formation of New York Air was opposed by the unions of Texas International Airlines, who were upset that employees were being hired with pay rates substantially lower than union rates at TIA; in the case of pilots, the rate was about half of the union rate. The unions felt the company was set up specifically to &quot;sidestep longstanding labor contracts with organized employees&quot; and that the jobs should have been offered to TIA employees. The pilots&#x27; union planned a $1 million protest campaign and a boycott of companies that did business with Texas Air, the parent company, but the campaign was unsuccessful and was called off because of the 1981 air traffic controllers&#x27; strike.

New York Air, independently managed away from the other airline subs, expanded in the 1980s to new cities and was successful in building a strong presence in the profitable Northeast shuttle markets.

==Continental Airlines==

===Purchase===

Continental Airlines (CAL) had been on TIA&#x27;s potential merger screen for quite a while. CAL had been losing money regularly and seemed not to have developed an effective strategy to deal with airline deregulation and the new competition that it brought. Its western oriented route structure fit well with TIA&#x27;s network. Lorenzo made two attempts to merge the companies on a friendly basis, but was rejected by its long-time Chairman Bob Six.

In January 1981, Texas International Airlines announced an offer to buy Continental. It had already purchased just over 9% of Continental&#x27;s shares, and offered to buy enough to bring its stake to between 35% and 49%, the first airline to seek another through a stock tender offer. Continental already had an agreement to merge with Western Airlines, and Texas Air announced that it would seek to vote its shares to block the merger which it felt was not in the interests of CAL shareholders. As with previous attempts, TIA&#x27;s takeover target was a much larger company than itself.

There was opposition to TIA&#x27;s planned takeover. In particular, unions feared that Lorenzo would lay off workers and that he was anti-union, demonstrated by formation of New York Air as a non-unionized company, charges which Lorenzo denied by making clear the employees had the right to select union representation should they have so desired. While TIA acquired 49% of Continental&#x27;s shares, an employee group attempted to stop the plan through legal maneuvers designed to give them control of the company rather than sell to TIA. Continental&#x27;s chairman, Alvin Feldman, objected to the purchase, telling Lorenzo that he thought the combined company would be &quot;very weak&quot;; as the takeover battle continued, Feldman was described as being &quot;bitterly opposed&quot; to the plan.

The financing for the employee group&#x27;s planned purchase fell through, and as Continental was preparing a public announcement, Feldman committed suicide in his Los Angeles office. TIA received approval for its purchase from the CAB, and President Ronald Reagan did not block the deal. The legal battles between the two companies ended in November, with Lorenzo and two associates elected to the board of directors of Continental.

1981 was a financially difficult year for Texas International, New York Air, and Continental. Lorenzo claimed, and some analysts agreed, that Continental&#x27;s problems were worse than they had appeared before his purchase of the airline. Continental&#x27;s losses for 1981 were over $100 million, and an economic recession further hurt Continental&#x27;s finances. It attempted to renegotiate contracts with several unions.

A series of steps to combine TIA and Continental followed. Lorenzo consolidated the historic TIA Houston as part of a plan to combine the routes of TIA and Continental in a hub and spoke system centered in Houston and Denver. Continental moved its annual meeting from May to March 1982; at that meeting, Lorenzo was named chairman of Continental. In July, Continental and Texas Air approved a &quot;financial merger&quot; of the companies, although operations were still to remain separate. In September, the employees of both Texas International and Continental were informed that there would be &quot;operational and management integration of the two companies effective Oct. 31 [1982]&quot;. Although Texas Air remained the parent company, the combined companies operated under the Continental name, brand, and aircraft livery.

===Strike and bankruptcy===
After 19 months of negotiations, Continental and its mechanics&#x27; union failed to reach a labor agreement, and the mechanics went on strike in August 1983. Continental continued to operate, primarily because a majority of mechanics crossed the picket lines and partially by hiring replacement mechanics. Continental continued to lose money significantly due to its cost structure, and management gave a final proposal to its pilots which provided for ownership by the pilots and other employees of 35% of the company&#x27;s stock, but with the plan rejected, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on Saturday evening, September 24, 1983, laying off 65% of its employees. Following the bankruptcy filing, the pilots&#x27; union went on strike to protest lower wages being offered by the company. The bankruptcy filing allowed Continental to void union contracts. It returned to operating profitability in 1984, but remained under bankruptcy protection until 1986, after working out plans with creditors to repay 100% of its debt over a period of 10 years.

During the bankruptcy, Continental claimed that its labor costs were too high and would force the company out of business completely if left unchanged. The unions claimed the bankruptcy was simply a legal maneuver intended to void contracts. The company trimmed operations and expenses during the reorganization, cutting one-third of its employees, introducing new wage rates and work rules for its employees, thus voiding the old Union contracts. The average salary of Continental&#x27;s pilots after the bankruptcy filing was 30% to 50% lower than before the filing. Senior Management also reduced their salaries to those of the pilots. Continental was the first airline to largely gradually replace a pilot workforce. The pilots eventually voted their union out.

===Expansion after the New Continental is &quot;born&quot;===
The &quot;New Continental&quot; began emerging while in bankruptcy. With its cost structure in line with any post deregulation upstart carrier, the airline began competing effectively with legacy carriers. By May 1984, Continental was operating 83 of its 105 aircraft, which had been mostly grounded upon filing for bankruptcy. Though operating near capacity, it was doing so with nearly half the 12,000 employees, on half the average wage cost, than prior to bankruptcy. By the summer of 1984, the Lorenzo team had filled many of the positions downsized during the strike, and employment had reached 9,000 with a route system that served 67 destinations. Planes were averaging a 67% load factor, amongst the highest in the industry. New Continental&#x27;s low-cost carrier strategy was beginning to bear fruit.

In February 1984, Continental received a favorable ruling from Bankruptcy Judge R.F. Wheless Jr. who ruled that &quot;Continental was justified in rejecting its [pilots’ union] contract it described as burdensome&quot; and that it &quot;had no choice but to file for reorganization.&quot; Continental&#x27;s Lorenzo and his team had successfully argued that labor &quot;costs would force the airline to liquidate.&quot;

In the second quarter of 1984, led by Lorenzo&#x27;s team, Continental&#x27;s restructuring showed more promise. The company reported a net profit of $10.4 million, which was a $36.9 million improvement from the $26.5 million loss during the same time period in 1983.

Further signs that the Lorenzo management team&#x27;s new low-fare, high-frequency business model was working began to show. With all fares initially set at $49, the airline was able to compete with legacy carriers. It also put in place a stock ownership plan with a grant of 1 million shares, profit sharing and other new forms of compensation, including options to buy new stock to reward employees’ loyalty during and after the union strikes. Pioneering innovations in the industry, such as the self-service ticketing Flying Machines and Continental&#x27;s partnership with Federal Express to provide overnight ticket delivery nationwide to customers, proved effective.

===Emergence from Bankruptcy===
By September 1984, Lorenzo&#x27;s team had led the airline to surpass the number of seat miles flown prior to bankruptcy with 25% fewer employees. Though the airline was price competitive with new entry carriers, it still offered full services such as hot meals, checked baggage, a frequent flier program and code-sharing with partner airlines. Record profits of $30.3 million were reported for the third quarter in 1984. Continental had successfully transitioned from &quot;a high-cost airline losing its proverbial shirt to being a low-cost carrier making good profits.&quot; In September 1986, the &quot;New Continental&quot; successfully emerged from bankruptcy as a lean, sustainable and profitable airline. Notably, Lorenzo&#x27;s management team had reached agreement with its creditors to repay them at 100 cents-on-the-dollar with no equity dilution, a rarity in previous bankruptcies. Employees and management were issued equity and equity incentives.

===Growth of Continental in the 1980s===
Continental&#x27;s rapid growth continued through the 1980s. It began service to Europe and added services to Asia, during this period, in addition to growing its operations domestically. In February 1987, Continental merged with the operations of People Express, which had been acquired, and New York Air expanding its route system. Severe service disruptions were experienced during this merger.

In 1987, Continental also inaugurated a major new hub operation at Newark Airport&#x27;s Terminal C, with rights acquired in the People Express acquisition. SAS moved its operations to Newark, from JFK airport, in a joint service arrangement in 1988. Continental also made a major image change, currently in use, and eliminated first class service, giving business class passengers the same first class seats—this service was later to be marketed as Business First.

By 1989, Continental served 133 airports around the world, carried approximately 9% of US commercial air traffic and offered more than 1,250 daily departures.

==Eastern Air Lines==

===Background===

In 1975, Frank Borman became president and CEO of Eastern Air Lines. It was ailing financially, and Borman negotiated concessions from its employees, but he also ordered expensive new airplanes. He also clashed frequently with the head of the machinists&#x27; union, Charlie Bryan. The atmosphere at Eastern was such that &quot;[l]abor brawls struck Eastern with the regularity of tropical storms in Florida&quot;. (The company was later described as having been &quot;anemic for most of the past 20 years&quot; and as having &quot;lurched from one financial crisis to another&quot;.)

===Takeover===
In December 1985, Borman met with Lorenzo to elicit possible Eastern interest. CAL had been looking to gain more critical mass and strategic assets. Then, in January 1986, Eastern faced another financial crisis and sought more concessions from its unions. Borman said that Eastern needed to &quot;either get long term economic relief from its labor unions or enter bankruptcy and impose that relief, just as now-thriving Continental did under Frank Lorenzo in September 1983&quot;, but Eastern&#x27;s machinists&#x27; union refused to renegotiate its contract. After Texas Air made an offer to buy Eastern, despite the unions&#x27; generally negative opinion of Lorenzo&#x27;s tactics, union leader Bryan said, &quot;it might be surprising the relationship that could develop between Lorenzo and our organization&quot;. Eastern established a deadline with its three major unions to grant concessions or have the company sold to Texas Air; when the deadline passed without the concessions, the Eastern sale was signed early Monday morning on March 24, 1986. Although there was more litigation to stop the deal, it was approved by shareholders in November 1986.

Phil Bakes, who had been president of Continental, was named president and chief executive officer of Eastern, in November 1986, and moved his family to Miami to assume direction of the airline. Lorenzo, appointed Chairman, remained in Houston as Continental&#x27;s CEO.

In December 1986, Texas Air also finalized a deal to acquire People Express Airlines, a low-cost airline that had been formed by eight executives who had left Texas Air in 1980. The deal included the assets of the bankrupt Frontier Airlines, which People Express had purchased in 1985. At that point, the combination of the airline companies controlled by Lorenzo through Texas Air accounted for 20% of the airline industry in the United States, and some estimates described it as the largest airline in the Western world, and second only to Aeroflot worldwide.

===Asset transfers; Sale of shuttle to Donald Trump===
In March 1987, Texas Air, realizing that Eastern&#x27;s labor difficulties were hurting its computer system service sales to other airlines and also wanting to combine its other computer system assets, transferred Eastern&#x27;s reservation system to a new subsidiary, System One. The transfer value was set at $100 million based on investment banking opinions, although it was substantially below some value estimates of $200 million to $400 million. Eastern then paid fees to lease back the system. The system was combined with Texas Air&#x27;s other computer system assets and grew to have 5,100 travel agent customers. Texas Air later sold half of its interest in the system to Electronic Data Systems, based on an overall system value of $250 million.

In early 1988, with Eastern&#x27;s cash being consumed by its losses, discussions began with Donald Trump and others to buy the Eastern Shuttle. Lorenzo had contacted Trump as a logical buyer, who importantly wouldn&#x27;t have provided the competitive threat of one of the major airlines—who were not contacted. The negotiations with Trump stretched on for several months, and most all of the negotiations were between Trump and Lorenzo in the Edwardian Room of the Plaza Hotel, in New York, which Trump had just bought in early 1988. An agreement was finally reached in October 1988, for Trump to buy Eastern&#x27;s shuttle service for $365 million, wanting to rebrand it as Trump Shuttle. The deal was closed in June 1989 and Trump went into the airline business.

Donald Trump had much to say about buying the shuttle and negotiations with Lorenzo in his 1990 book: Trump, Surviving at the Top. In it he discussed the union fights at Eastern and the making of Lorenzo as a symbol. He said, &quot;through it all, Frank just kept quiet and took the heat. In life, most people are big talk and no action. Frank is that rare person who is all action and no talk.&quot; Trump also wrote that &quot;the funny thing is, I found Frank, man-to-man to be a very different guy from the reclusive, evil maniac you read about in the business press. I met with him numerous times... and invariably found him relaxed, charming, and compassionate, despite his feelings about the union leaders [at Eastern]. Frank is also a devoted family man who cares very deeply about his wife, Sharon, and their children.&quot; Trump went on to lose the Trump Shuttle in September 1990, when the difficult economic times and large debt positions caused a default on Trump&#x27;s debt to a Citibank led group. The banking group leased the airline to US Air in late 1990, which promptly took off the Trump name.

===Labor strike and resulting decline in service===
Due to management and the unions&#x27; ongoing battle over labor contracts, service at the airline declined resulting in a series of increasingly contentious and politically charged events. In April 1988, the United States Department of Transportation began an inquiry into the financial fitness and safety of Texas Air and Eastern; the inquiry, which was spurred by Eastern&#x27;s pilots union, was announced at the same time as a fine of $823,000 levied by the FAA for safety violations, all of which occurred prior to Texas Air&#x27;s role. Texas Air and Eastern&#x27;s operations were vindicated when the inquiry deemed Texas Air to have passed its tests and added that labor disputes &quot;could endanger safety at Eastern&quot;.

After negotiations with the three unions failed to produce any labor agreements, a mandated 30-day cooling off period began on 1 February 1989. If an agreement could not be reached, strikes would begin on 4 March 1989. During this period, Lorenzo and Phil Bakes, Eastern&#x27;s CEO, met with several potential buyers of Eastern, including Carl Icahn, Jay Pritzker and Peter Ueberroth, but no deal materialized.

On 3 March 1989, President George H. W. Bush issued a statement outlining his decision not to act on a National Mediation Board recommendation to appoint a presidential emergency board to attempt to reach a labor agreement with machinists, which had been impossible for many years before Texas Air&#x27;s acquisition. After the IAM struck, flight attendants, and the pilot union honored the IAM picket lines, and thousands of Eastern flights were canceled, and also thousands of employees were laid off.

===Bankruptcy and shutdown===
Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on 9 March 1989. However, the law had been changed since Continental&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1983 and it was much more difficult to void union contracts in a bankruptcy. Eastern continued to operate a reduced schedule, using pilots who crossed picket lines. By November, it claimed it was back on the road toward profitability and asked for more time to submit a reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court.

After Bush declined to appoint an emergency board to mediate the labor dispute, Congress passed a compromise bill designed to establish a bi-partisan commission specifically to &quot;investigate the labor dispute&quot; at Eastern, but it was vetoed by Bush on 21 November 1989. The following day, the pilots&#x27; union voted to end its strike, after about 800 of its members had crossed picket lines, and many others had taken early retirement or gone to work for other airlines. The flight attendants ended their strike the following day, but the machinists continued to strike.

Although Eastern was still operating, it was still losing money and proposed plans to its unsecured creditors that called for payment of 50% of the debt, and as conditions worsened, only 25% of the debt. Unable to reach agreement with Eastern, creditors requested that a trustee be appointed. The bankruptcy court agreed to the request and named a trustee, Martin Shugrue, to run Eastern in April 1990, with the goal of continuing to operate the company and find a buyer. With the trustee unable to bring the airline to profitability, Eastern ceased operations on 18 January 1991 and its assets were liquidated.

==Airline legacy==
Lorenzo&#x27;s Jet Capital Corporation agreed to sell its controlling stake in Continental Airlines’ holding company to Scandinavian Airlines Systems (SAS) on August 10, 1990, and the Jet Capital officers at Continental stepped down.

&quot;Frank Lorenzo has etched an indelible mark on the U.S. airline business. Whether he is a union buster, an opportunist, or a keen businessman depends on one&#x27;s perspective, but his mark has been deep and may be lasting,&quot; wrote James Ott on Lorenzo&#x27;s departure from Continental.

“When Lorenzo took over the ailing Texas International in 1972, he became the youngest CEO of any airline of substance in the history of air transportation,” according to R.E.G. Davies who has been the Lindbergh Chair of Aerospace history at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and is often considered the dean of aviation history. Davies went on to say that “(Lorenzo&#x27;s) subsequent progress toward greater goals has been marked with no less success and has been just as systematic,…Lorenzo became the most controversial single personality in the airline world…because he challenged the entire structure of cost-and-revenue relations that had long existed in a closely protected corporate environment and in doing so generated a cause célebre of historic proportions.”

Lorenzo has frequently been described as anti-union, particularly after the bankruptcy at Continental, which ended by unionized employees voiding their union contracts in the successful effort to save the airline from liquidation and permanent job losses. Earlier at Texas International Air, the airline sought wage concessions in 1974 to return the company to viability given its competition with low cost Southwest Airlines. After a union went on strike, TIA began hiring replacement workers, and after four months, the unions returned to work and TIA went on to reach profitability in 1976. Before Texas Air&#x27;s takeover of Eastern was completed, their efforts to build a sustainable, profitable airline model were criticized, with opponents saying his companies&#x27; profits were earned &quot;on the backs of broken labor contracts, extremely low wages and harsh work rules.&quot;

==Investment career==

===Departure from Continental and establishment of Savoy Capital===
Lorenzo had been CEO for Continental and Texas International for 18 years, when he sold through Jet Capital his controlling interest in Continental Airlines in 1990 to Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), and stepped down from his CEO role to pursue other entrepreneurial and investment ventures. Lorenzo&#x27;s departure from Continental was a basic part of the deal, required by both Lorenzo and SAS, although he remained a director of Continental for two years afterwards as part of the arrangements with SAS. During his eighteen-year tenure, his airline empire grew from 15 jet aircraft (at Texas International) with revenues of $73 million, to Continental&#x27;s combined fleet of 350 jet aircraft and revenues of over $5 billion.

After the sale of his interest in Continental, Lorenzo founded Savoy Capital, Inc. in 1990 in Houston, TX. Savoy is a private investment firm largely investing for its own account, both on a liquid basis and privately, but which also has invested on behalf of accredited outside investors.

===ATX, Inc.===
In 1992, a company in which Lorenzo was a significant shareholder, but not part of management, ATX Inc., attempted to start a low-cost airline serving the east coast of the United States. A regulatory application by ATX, strongly fought by organized labor, was rejected by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 1993; the agency said that under Lorenzo&#x27;s supervision, Eastern Airlines and Texas Air had &quot;experienced operational, maintenance and labor-related problems that were among the most serious in the history of U.S. aviation.&quot; Lorenzo had previously reduced his stake in the company to 24 percent and said that he would only serve on its board.

==Philanthropy==
Lorenzo is a long-time trustee of The Hispanic Society of America, an institution with a free-entrance museum of art located in New York City. It houses the largest collection of Spanish art outside Spain, with major paintings by Velázquez, Goya, Zurbarán, El Greco, and Sorolla. He is additionally a trustee emeritus of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation located in Princeton, New Jersey. Lorenzo and his wife are involved as a director, donor, or advisor to a number of other arts and charitable organizations.

In 1986, Lorenzo established the Olegario Lorenzo Memorial and Lorenzo Family Scholarship Funds at Columbia College.

==Personal==
Lorenzo married Sharon Neill (née Murray) in 1972, and has four children. His wife is an adjunct professor at University of Pennsylvania law school, where she teaches a course in art law.

<doc id="457777" wikidata="Q703104" url="?curid=457777" title="Henschel Hs 132">
<text>The Henschel Hs 132 was a jet-powered dive bomber and interceptor aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Henschel Flugzeugwerke AG. It was developed during the latter portion of the Second World War with the intention of being adopted by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, but this did not come to fruition.

Work commenced on the Hs 132 in February 1943 in response to a specification issued by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM – the German Aviation Ministry) for a new attack aircraft. Henschel opted for a relatively unorthodox design that, amongst other features, used a top-mounted BMW 003 jet engine (identical in terms of make and position to the powerplant used by the Heinkel He 162), a retractable nosewheel undercarriage and the pilot in a prone position. The aircraft intentionally made as little use of strategic materials as possible, such as its use of wooden wings, and had a relatively simplistic structure despite it being designed to withstand 12 &quot;g&quot;, considerably more than typical dive bombers of the era.

In response to the RLM&#x27;s approval of the project, construction of three prototypes was started during March 1945. However, two months later, Henschel&#x27;s plant at Schönefeld was captured by the advancing Soviet Army; accordingly, all of the incomplete prototypes fell into Soviet hands and their fate thereafter is unknown. At that point, &quot;Hs 132 V1&quot; was scheduled to commence flight testing only one month later.

==Design and development==
===Background===
By the mid point of the Second World War, it had become clear that the dive bombers operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka, were highly vulnerable to high performance Allied fighter aircraft and thus there was great interest in improving Germany&#x27;s bombing capability. The level bombing approach was one option, however, due to Germany&#x27;s lack of suitable bombsights, this was undesirable due to poorer accuracy, especially when flying at increasingly high speeds, achievable via recent advances such as the turbojet. Accordingly, the German aircraft manufacturer Henschel Flugzeugwerke AG conceptualised a turbojet-powered dive bomber.

Separately, there had long been interest in the idea of combat aircraft being flown by pilots in the prone position, which would reduce the effect of &quot;g&quot;-forces during manoeuvring. Several aircraft had already experimented with this layout for various reasons, the Horten IIIf had a prone pilot, but this was primarily to reduce drag in this high-performance glider, while the DFS 228 reconnaissance glider also used a prone pilot to make it easier to seal its pressurized cabin. It was not until the Berlin B9 was built specifically to test this arrangement for improved &quot;g&quot;-load that any serious effort toward development could be carried out.

Starting in early 1943, the Berlin B9 twin-piston engined experimental aircraft demonstrated that it was indeed possible for a pilot to fly the aircraft lying down, and that it did improve his ability to handle high loads. The pilot had an extremely restricted field of view upward or to the rear that made it suitable only for certain roles, including bombers or fighters or interceptors with a major speed advantage over their opposition. Based on this research, several late-war German designs followed the B9&#x27;s lead and used a prone pilot. Better &quot;g&quot;-load performance was not the only reason, however, as this layout also reduced the frontal area of the aircraft. This was a serious concern for interceptors attacking the USAAF&#x27;s Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, as calculations showed that the chance of being hit by its defensive guns was largely a function of frontal area.

===Design effort===
On 18 February 1943, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM – the German Aviation Ministry) released a specification that called for a single-seat shipping attack aircraft to counter an expected Allied invasion of Europe. A piston-engined aircraft was called for at the time, however, the performance requirements motivated the switch to jet power instead. Henschel opted to produce a response to the specification; the design team favoured the high speeds offered by turbojet propulsion as it was felt that survivability, and therefore viability, of the prospective aircraft would be bolstered by using its high speeds to evade interception by Allied defences. Furthermore, as a consequence of these high speed dive attacks, the aircraft would be subject to high g-forces when pulling out; thus, the resulting aircraft was designed to withstand 12 &quot;g&quot; (conventional dive bombers of the era were typically designed to withstand 8 &quot;g&quot;). To enable the pilot to better withstand such g-forces, it was deemed essential for the pilot to by in the prone position.

Several other factors were taken into consideration during the design phase. As Germany&#x27;s position declined sharply during the latter portion of the war, there were shortages of both key materials and skill labourers. Accordingly, the aircraft was intentionally designed to minimise its use of strategic materials and to be as simplistic as possible. The structure was not only designed to be simple but also relatively easy to maintain. The BMW 003 engine that powered the aircraft was mounted on the back of the fuselage above the wing and was positioned at roughly shoulder-height as a result of the low ground height of the aircraft. While this placement of the engine was suboptimal in terms of intake performance, incurring increased drag at high speeds due to interference from the engine-fuselage fairing junctions, the design team were aware that the Heinkel He 162, the winners of the contemporary &quot;Volksjäger&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s fighter&quot;) design competition, had a similar engine layout and thus were encouraged as to its viability.

The Hs 132 had a roughly cigar-shaped fuselage with short-span mid-set wings and a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. The horizontal stabilizer possessed considerable dihedral ending in twin rounded-front vertical stabilizers; this &#x27;butterfly&#x27;-like twin rudder arrangement kept the tail surfaces clear of the jet efflux. The cockpit was completely faired into the fuselage contour along with a rounded clear nosecone on the front of the aircraft. Directly behind was the actual &quot;window,&quot; a large armored-glass plate located some distance behind the extreme nose; the glazing extended almost to the wing root. Every flight control surface was fitted with trim tabs. Due to the intended shallowness of the aircraft&#x27;s dive attack, there were no dive brakes fitted. Despite the similarity of appearance to the He 162, the Hs 132 was intended to perform dive-bombing and ground attack missions rather that fighter duties. In terms of its construction, the airframe made extensive use of non-strategic materials, notably in the wings, which were of wooden construction. The basic Hs 132A carried a single bomb and lacked any other armament. It was to begin its attack in a shallow dive outside the ships&#x27; range of fire, and after reaching a speed of , the pilot would &quot;toss&quot; the bomb at the target using a simple computerized sight, and then climb back out of range. This computerized bombsight was not delivered in time to be fitted to the aircraft.

===Prototypes and envisioned developments===
During April or May 1944, Henschel submitted their proposal to the RLM, by which point wind tunnel testing of the basic layout had already commenced. A contract for six prototypes was approved in May 1944. Construction of three prototypes commenced at the company&#x27;s Schönefeld facility during March 1945. Hs 132 V1 was scheduled to have its first flight in June 1945, however, advancing Soviet forces captured it along with the other two incomplete prototypes during May 1945. Allegedly, while the wings and fuselage of He 132 V1 had been completed, they were never mated and the wings had never been transferred from their factory outside of Dresden.

Several other versions of the basic airframe were proposed by Henschel. The &quot;Hs 132B&quot; was to have been powered by a single Junkers Jumo 004 engine in place of the BMW 003; it also would have added a pair of MG 151/20 cannons. The &quot;HS 132C&quot; was a more extensively modified version that was intended for bomber interception; it featured the larger Heinkel HeS 011 engine, two 151/20s and two MK 103 or MK 108 cannons. The HeS 011, intended to power a wide variety of new and existing &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft (an example of the latter being the proposed D and P series of the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber), was still in the pre-production phase when the conflict ended. It was hoped that by the time the HS 132B became available, the &quot;Panzerblitz&quot; anti-tank missile would be in production and available for use. The &quot;Hs 132D&quot; included a new wing of increased span.

<doc id="457788" wikidata="Q7730028" url="?curid=457788" title="The Devils (band)">
<text>The Devils is the name of an English electronic pop band, formed by Nick Rhodes and Stephen Duffy.

The first incarnation of Duran Duran in 1978 included Rhodes as keyboardist, John Taylor on guitar and Duffy as songwriter/vocalist and bassist (along with Simon Colley). This line-up performed live for almost a year before Duffy and Colley left the band.

Duffy moved on to a solo career and the Lilac Time, and Duran Duran eventually went on to fame with drummer Roger Taylor, guitarist Andy Taylor and singer Simon Le Bon.

In 1999, Duffy came across an old tape recording of a live Duran Duran concert from a 1979 show. Shortly afterwards, Rhodes and Duffy met by chance at a fashion show, and began talking about the old music. They decided it might be fun to re-record some of those original, dark, art-school, pre-Le Bon Duran Duran songs – including &quot;Big Store&quot; which was set in the department store Rackhams and a song eulogising the nightclub Barbarella&#x27;s.

A few months later they took to the studio, using vintage analog instruments but modern production techniques to recreate the early Duran Duran sound. The lyrics remained unchanged.

==&quot;Dark Circles&quot;==
The band played live only two times, in London (19 November 2002), and Cologne (17 February 2003), before both members returned to their normal careers.

In early June 2008, Rhodes and Duffy were interviewed by the music journalist Pete Paphides for BBC Radio 4, and relived the whole &quot;Dark Circles&quot; experience. Duffy also publicly stated through his website that a Devils DVD could be released later.

<text>Alton Crawford Brown Jr. (born July 30, 1962) is an American television personality, food show presenter, food scientist, author, voice actor, and cinematographer. He is the creator and host of the Food Network television show &quot;Good Eats&quot; that ran for 16 seasons, host of the miniseries &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot; and &quot;Feasting on Waves&quot;, and host and main commentator on &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; and &quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot;. Brown is a best-selling author of several books on food and cooking. A recap series titled &quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot; aired on Cooking Channel, and a true sequel series, &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot;, ran from 2019 to 2021 on Food Network.

==Early life==
Alton Brown was born July 30, 1962, in Los Angeles, California. Brown&#x27;s father, Alton Crawford Brown, was a media executive in Cleveland, Georgia; owner of radio station WRWH; and publisher of the newspaper &quot;White County News&quot;. He died on Alton&#x27;s last day of sixth grade from an apparent suicide.

==Career==
Brown studied film at the University of Georgia in the early 1980s, and got his start in television as the cinematographer for music videos, 
including &quot;The One I Love&quot; by R.E.M.

Brown was dissatisfied with the quality of cooking shows airing on American television, so he set out to produce his own show. In preparation, he enrolled in the New England Culinary Institute, graduating in 1997. Brown says he was a poor science student in high school and college, but he focused on the subject to understand the underlying processes of cooking. He is outspoken in his shows about his dislike of single-purpose kitchen utensils and equipment such as garlic presses and margarita machines, although he adapts a few traditionally single-purpose devices, such as rice cookers and melon ballers, into multipurpose tools.

===TV series===

====&quot;Good Eats&quot;====

The pilot for &quot;Good Eats&quot; first aired in July 1999 on the PBS member TV station WTTW in Chicago. Food Network picked up the show in July 1999. Many of the &quot;Good Eats&quot; episodes feature Brown building makeshift cooking devices in order to point out that many of the devices sold at conventional &quot;cooking&quot; stores are simply fancified hardware store items. &quot;Good Eats&quot; was nominated for the Best TV Food Journalism Award by the James Beard Foundation in 2000. The show was also awarded a 2006 Peabody Award. In May 2011, Alton Brown announced an end to &quot;Good Eats&quot; after 14 seasons. The final episode, &quot;Turn on the Dark&quot;, aired February 10, 2012.

On Alton&#x27;s 2017 book tour, he stated that &quot;Good Eats&quot; would have a sequel and that it would be released to the internet in 2018. This was changed in late 2018 when Brown made arrangements with The Cooking Channel to air &quot;revised&quot; versions of several episodes with new recipes titled &quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot;, in which he stated new episodes of &quot;Good Eats&quot; are also in the works. Thirteen episodes of &quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot; aired in late winter and early spring 2019, and were added to the &quot;Good Eats&quot; reruns on The Cooking Channel. It was announced on June 5, 2019, that the new show would be called &quot;Good Eats Returns&quot;; it premiered on the Food Network with the slightly revised title &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; on Sunday, August 25.

====&quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot;====
Brown relaunched the show in two versions: as &quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot; on Cooking Channel (which updates, reworks and adds to original &quot;Good Eats&quot; episodes), and on Food Network as &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; in August 2019 (all-new episodes). New episodes of &quot;Reloaded&quot; premiered in April 2020. New &quot;Return&quot; episodes were in the writing process and planned to be filming over the summer of 2020, but were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These episodes eventually saw release, initially as an exclusive on the new Discovery+ streaming service. In June 2021, the episodes premiered on Food Network as a companion to the &quot;Chopped: Alton&#x27;s Maniacal Baskets&quot; tournament. On July 13, 2021, Brown announced that &quot;Good Eats: The Return&quot; would not be returning for a third season. A third planned season of &quot;Good Eats Reloaded&quot; was also cancelled, but the recipes planned for the series were included as part of Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Eats 4: The Final Years&quot; cookbook.

====&quot;Iron Chef America&quot;====

In 2004, Brown appeared on &quot;Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters&quot;. This was the second attempt to adapt the Japanese cooking show &quot;Iron Chef&quot; to American television (the first being UPN&#x27;s &quot;Iron Chef USA&quot;, which featured William Shatner). Brown served as the expert commentator, a modified version of the role played by Dr. Yukio Hattori in the original show. When the show became a series, Brown began serving as the play-by-play announcer, with Kevin Brauch as kitchen reporter. Brown also served as the host for all five seasons of the spin-off &quot;The Next Iron Chef&quot;.

====&quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot;====

Brown&#x27;s third series, &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot;, explores the history of eating on the move. Brown and his crew traveled around the United States via motorcycle in a four-part miniseries about the history of road food. Brown samples food all along his travel route. He includes a &quot;history of food&quot; segment documenting famous road trips and interviews many of the foodies he meets en route.

The series premiered on Food Network on July 29, 2006. The miniseries was picked up for a second run, &quot;Feasting on Asphalt 2: The River Run&quot;, in 2007. Six episodes were filmed between April and May 2007. The episodes trace the majority of the length of the Mississippi River through Brown&#x27;s travels. The second run of episodes began airing on Food Network on August 4, 2007. The third season uses the title &quot;Feasting on Waves&quot; and has Brown traveling the Caribbean by boat in search of local cuisine.

====&quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot;====

In 2013, Brown began hosting the cooking competition series &quot;Cutthroat Kitchen&quot; on the Food Network. In each episode, four chefs are each given $25,000 with which to bid on items that can be used to hinder their opponents&#x27; cooking, such as confiscating ingredients or forcing them to use unorthodox tools and equipment. Three chefs are eliminated one by one, and the winner keeps their unspent money as the day&#x27;s prize. The series premiered on August 11, 2013.

====&quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot;====

In 2018, Brown hosted Season 18 of &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot; as the blue team mentor. The season debuted on January 5, 2020.

====&quot;Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend&quot;====

In 2022, Netflix rebooted &quot;Iron Chef America&quot; as &quot;Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend&quot;, signing Brown as co-host with Kristen Kish.

===Tours===
====The Edible Inevitable Tour====
In October 2013, Brown launched Alton Brown Live: The Edible Inevitable Tour, his first national tour visiting 46 cities through March 2014. The show included stand-up comedy, talk show antics, a multimedia lecture, live music, and &quot;extreme&quot; food experimentation. After a hiatus of several months while Brown worked on his Food Network shows, the tour resumed in October 2014 and concluded on April 4, 2015, in Houston, Texas, after visiting more than 60 cities.

====Eat Your Science====
Brown mounted a second tour show, Alton Brown Live: Eat Your Science, in 2016. The show toured through the fall of 2017. All totaled, Brown&#x27;s shows have played over 225 dates including Broadway. Both his tours have included &quot;large, unusual and probably dangerous&quot; food demonstrations, audience participation, and even food songs performed by Brown and his combo. Brown has been quoted as saying his final tour will launch in the fall of 2020.

====Beyond the Eats====
Brown&#x27;s third tour titled Alton Brown Live: Beyond the Eats was announced on his Twitter page in March 2021. The tour began in October 2021 and had several &quot;legs&quot; or overall tour runs, the last of which (done with added &quot;holiday&quot; materials) ran from November to December of 2024.

===Awards===
Brown is the recipient of two James Beard Awards. He won the Best Book award in 2003 for his first book, &quot;I&#x27;m Just Here for the Food&quot;, and the Broadcast Media Award in 2011 for TV Food Personality/Host. He has also been nominated four additional times.

===Other appearances===
Brown served as a mentor on Season 8 of &quot;The Next Food Network Star&quot; alongside Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis. During Season 8, each mentor selected and mentored a team of five finalists. Alton&#x27;s finalist, Justin Warner, was the Season 8 winner; however, Brown will not be producing Warner&#x27;s show.

Brown guest-starred in an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; titled &quot;House Fancy&quot; where he provides the voice of Nicholas Withers, the host of the titular show.

Brown appeared on the Travel Channel show &quot;The Layover&quot; with Anthony Bourdain which focused on the city of Atlanta in 2013. In the episode Bourdain takes Brown to the Clermont Lounge.

Brown guest starred as the &quot;Guest Bailiff&quot; and &quot;Expert Witness&quot; in John Hodgman&#x27;s comedy/court show podcast &quot;Judge John Hodgman&quot;.

In October 2017, Brown was featured on the Food Network television show &quot;Chopped&quot; in a five-part series called &quot;Alton Brown&#x27;s Challenge&quot;.

Brown voiced Yum Labouché in &quot;Big Hero 6: The Series&quot;. The character is a judge for an underground cooking competition.

Brown appeared on episode 196 of &quot;MythBusters&quot; titled &quot;Food Fables&quot;.

In June 2022, he appeared on the web series &quot;Good Mythical Morning&quot; episode &quot;Match the Flavor to the Doritos&quot;. He was originally scheduled to appear in a summer 2020 episode, as he revealed in a livestream in March 2020, however did not happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Commercials===
Brown has done commercial work for General Electric products, including five infomercials touting the benefits of GE refrigerators, washers and dryers, water purifiers, Trivection ovens, and dishwashers. The infomercials are produced in the &quot;Good Eats&quot; style, employing the use of unusual camera angles, informational text, props, visual aids, scientific explanations, and the same method of delivery. These infomercials are distributed to wholesale distributors of appliances/plumbing devices.

Brown has also aided GE in developing a new type of oven. He was initially called by GE to help their engineers learn more about the effects of heat on food; that grew into an active cooperation to develop GE&#x27;s Trivection oven.

Brown has promoted Colgate toothpaste, Dannon yogurt, Welch&#x27;s, Shun knives, and Heifer International. In 2010, he endorsed kosher salt use in a campaign for Cargill. In 2020, he began doing commercials for Healthy Choice&#x27;s line of low-fat, low-calorie, vegetable-based &quot;Power Dressings&quot;,

In 2022, he began appearing in commercials for the supplement Neuriva.

===Twitter===
In 2012, Brown gained popularity by pioneering the use of humorous &quot;Analog Tweets&quot;, wherein he posts pictures of hand-drawn Twitter responses on Post-it Notes which he has stuck to his computer monitor.

===&quot;The Alton Browncast&quot;===
On June 28, 2013, Alton Brown joined the Nerdist Podcast Network with his podcast &quot;The Alton Browncast&quot;, covering food news, men&#x27;s style, music and other topics. Through February 15, 2017, 68 episodes have been produced.

===&quot;Pantry Raid&quot; and &quot;Quarantine Quitchen&quot;===
With the COVID-19 quarantine in 2020 and the subsequent delays in production on Season 16 of &quot;Good Eats&quot; (Season 2 of &quot;The Return&quot;), Alton took to YouTube to make two new online cooking series.

Pantry Raid was a series of once-weekly shorts (usually released on Fridays or Saturdays) for making palatable foods while staying safe at home. The episodes were filmed in the &quot;Good Eats&quot; test kitchens at Brain Food Productions and consisted of Alton and a cameraman as the only personnel onsite.

Quarantine Quitchen [aka &quot;QQ&quot;] started as a single livestream titled &quot;The Browns Make Dinner&quot;, referring to Alton and his wife Elizabeth making dinner at their loft apartment in Georgia. After the success of the first such &quot;episode&quot;, the once-weekly series was released live every Tuesday. The series continued off and on while the Browns went on tour in 2022, and only appeared sporadically in 2023. The last episode was live-streamed on July 25, 2023. 

==Personal life==
Brown lives in Marietta, Georgia. He and his former wife DeAnna, an executive producer on &quot;Good Eats&quot;, divorced in 2015. They have one daughter born in 1999. A few members of his extended family appeared on &quot;Good Eats&quot; (such as his late grandmother, his mother, and daughter, who is known on the show as &quot;Alton&#x27;s Spawn&quot;), but most of his &quot;family&quot; portrayed on the series were actors or members of the show&#x27;s production crew.

Brown and Atlanta restaurant designer Elizabeth Ingram became engaged in 2018. Brown posted in September 2018 that he and Ingram had married on a boat in Charleston, South Carolina.

In the fifth episode of Season 18 of &quot;Worst Cooks in America&quot; (2020), Brown referred to his current wife as his third wife.

Brown was once a motorcycling enthusiast, although he no longer owns one. Additionally, Brown is an airplane pilot, and was featured in the aviation magazine &quot;AOPA Flight Training&quot;. He owned two planes, a Cessna 206 and a Cessna 414.

Brown likes vintage watches and wore a different watch for every season of &quot;Good Eats&quot;; this was used in production to quickly identify which season a clip is from. Once, his watch broke midseason, and he continued to wear it for the rest of the season to maintain this system. Twenty years after the Omega Seamaster watch his father left him was stolen, Brown bought it from an eBay seller and had it restored.

Brown changed his eating habits in 2009 in order to lose weight and become healthier, losing over the course of nine months.

Brown discussed his Christian beliefs in a 2010 interview with &quot;Eater&quot;. He said at the time:

Brown said in a December 2014 interview in &quot;Time&quot; that he &quot;could no longer abide the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s indoctrination of children and its anti-gay stance&quot; adding that he is now &quot;searching for a new belief system.&quot;

In November 2020, Brown declared on Twitter that he has almost always voted Republican, but that the 2016 United States Presidential Election was the first time he considered voting for a Democrat since Michael Dukakis in 1988. He supported Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, as well as Democrats running in U.S. Senate races in Georgia.

<text>The Church Brew Works is a brewpub in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, set in the confines of a restored Roman Catholic church (formerly St. John the Baptist Church).

The brewpub is located at 3525 Liberty Avenue in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The church building was originally built in 1902, and had been used as a church until 1993. Its doors opened as The Church Brew Works on August 1, 1996, after the building underwent extensive renovation, necessitated by years of lying dormant after being officially deconsecrated by the Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1993.

In 2012, &quot;Pittsburgh Magazine&quot; named it one of the best breweries in Pittsburgh.

==Beers==
As of September 2007, three flagship brews are locally distributed: Celestial Gold (light lager), Pipe Organ Pale Ale (English pale ale), and Pious Monk Dunkel (Munich-style dark lager). The in-house selection is rounded out by a rotating Stout, four seasonals or specialties, and one varying cask-conditioned ale. Also available are Millennium Trippel, a Belgian Tripel (in champagne bottles and 5L minikegs) and Cherry Quadzilla, a Belgian Quadrupel (champagne bottles only).

The Church&#x27;s beers are brewed on a steam-jacketed 15bbl system built by Specific Mechanical Systems, Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia.

==Awards==
In 2012 the Church Brew Works won the Great American Beer Festival&#x27;s Large Brewpub Brewer of the Year Award.

==Local historic landmark status==
In 2001, the Church Brew Works was listed on the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation&#x27;s List of Historic Landmarks.

<doc id="457795" wikidata="Q4862468" url="?curid=457795" title="Baron Herbert">
<text>Baron Herbert is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by writ in 1461 for William Herbert, who was later made Earl of Pembroke. The second Earl of Pembroke surrendered his earldom in return for the earldom of Huntingdon, which became extinct on his death without male issue. The barony, however, passed to his daughter Elizabeth, who later married the first Earl of Worcester. At Elizabeth&#x27;s death, the title passed to her son, who later inherited his father&#x27;s earldom of Worcester. Later, the fifth Earl was made Marquess of Worcester, and the third Marquess became Duke of Beaufort. Thereafter, the barony and dukedom remained united until 1984 when, upon the death of the tenth Duke without issue, the barony fell into abeyance. Then, in 2002, Queen Elizabeth II terminated the abeyance of the barony of Herbert in favour of the last holder&#x27;s great-nephew, David John Seyfried.

<doc id="457798" wikidata="Q278247" url="?curid=457798" title="Norman Bel Geddes">
<text>Norman Bel Geddes (born Norman Melancton Geddes; April 27, 1893 – May 8, 1958) was an American theatrical and industrial designer, described in 2012 by the New York Times as &quot;a brilliant craftsman and draftsman, a master of style, the 20th century’s Leonardo da Vinci.&quot; As a young designer, Bel Geddes brought an innovative and energized perspective to the Broadway stage and New York’s Metropolitan Opera. In the 1930s he became one of the first to hold the title of Industrial Designer. His futuristic Streamline designs re-envisioned many of the utilitarian objects of the day from airliners and cruise ships to cocktail shakers and circuses. He also conceived and oversaw construction of the Futurama Exhibition at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

==Early life==
Bel Geddes was born Norman Melancton Geddes in Adrian, Michigan, and was raised in New Philadelphia, Ohio, the son of Flora Luelle (née Yingling) and Clifton Terry Geddes, a stockbroker. When he married Helen Belle Schneider in 1916, they combined their names to &quot;Bel Geddes&quot;. Their daughters were actress Barbara Bel Geddes and writer Joan Ulanov.

==Career==

Bel Geddes began his career with set designs for Aline Barnsdall&#x27;s Los Angeles Little Theater in the 1916–17 season, then in 1918 as the scene designer for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He designed and directed various theatrical works, from &quot;Arabesque&quot; and &quot;The Five O&#x27;Clock Girl&quot; on Broadway to an ice show, &quot;It Happened on Ice&quot;, produced by Sonja Henie. He also created set designs for the film &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; (1924), directed by Cecil B. DeMille, designed costumes for Max Reinhardt, and created the sets for the Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot; (1935). 

Bel Geddes opened an industrial-design studio in 1927, and designed a wide range of commercial products, from cocktail shakers to commemorative medallions to radio cabinets. His designs extended to unrealized futuristic concepts: a teardrop-shaped automobile, and an Art Deco House of Tomorrow. In 1929, he designed &quot;Airliner Number 4,&quot; a 9-deck amphibian airliner that incorporated areas for deck-games, an orchestra, a gymnasium, a , and two airplane hangars.

His book &quot;Horizons&quot; (1932) had a significant impact: &quot;By popularizing streamlining when only a few engineers were considering its functional use, he made possible the design style of the thirties.&quot; Bel Geddes was highly inspired by organic forms, like the bodies of birds and fish, which he saw as naturally &#x27;streamlined&#x27; and thus the perfect model for replication in industrial design. Bel Geddes was thus very interested in eugenics and the potentials for the &#x27;streamlining&#x27; of biological organisms, including humans. According to Garth Huxtable, one of Bel Geddes&#x27;s former employees, Bel Geddes often brought up sex and reproduction in casual conversation; Bel Geddes&#x27;s library was filled with many of the most popular books on eugenics at the time, like &quot;The Basics of Breeding&quot; by veterinarian and member of the American Eugenics Society, Leon F. Whitney. He would often contribute articles to popular American periodicals concerned with the future of design and human society.

In the classic science fiction film of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936), he assisted production designer William Cameron Menzies on the look of the world of tomorrow.

Bel Geddes designed the General Motors Pavilion, known as Futurama, for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. For inspiration, Bel Geddes exploited his earlier work in the same vein: he had designed a &quot;Metropolis City of 1960&quot; in 1936. The building, described by Lewis Mumford as &quot;the great egg out of which civilization is to be born,&quot; has been interpreted by historians as potentially promoting subconscious themes of sex and reproduction, in which the feminine was the passive tool with which the masculine used to birth his new world. 

Bel Geddes&#x27;s book &quot;Magic Motorways&quot; (1940) promoted advances in highway design and transportation, foreshadowing the Interstate Highway System, along with aspects of driver assist and autonomous driving.

The case for the Mark I computer was designed by Bel Geddes at IBM&#x27;s expense, and put in place just in time for the machine&#x27;s dedication at Harvard University.

== Death and legacy ==
Bel Geddes died in New York on May 8, 1958. His autobiography, &quot;Miracle in the Evening&quot;, was published posthumously in 1960.

Bel Geddes is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, a distinction he shares with his daughter, actress Barbara Bel Geddes. The United States Postal Service issued a postage stamp honoring Bel Geddes as a &quot;Pioneer Of American Industrial Design&quot;.

The archive of Norman Bel Geddes is held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. This large collection includes models, drafts, watercolor designs, research notes, project proposals, and correspondence. The Ransom Center also holds the papers of Bel Geddes&#x27; second wife, the noted costume designer and producer Edith Lutyens Bel Geddes.

<doc id="457803" wikidata="Q64129" url="?curid=457803" title="Yusuf al-Qaradawi">
<text>Yusuf al-Qaradawi (; or &quot;Yusuf al-Qardawi&quot;; 9 September 1926 – 26 September 2022) was an Egyptian Islamic scholar based in Doha, Qatar, and chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars. His influences included Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Qayyim, Sayyid Rashid Rida, Hassan al-Banna, Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi and Naeem Siddiqui. He was best known for his programme الشريعة والحياة, &quot;al-Sharīʿa wa al-Ḥayāh&quot; (&quot;Sharia and Life&quot;), broadcast on Al Jazeera, which had an estimated audience of 40–60 million worldwide. He was also known for IslamOnline, a website he helped for establishment in 1997 and for which he served as chief religious scholar.

Al-Qaradawi published more than 120 books, including &quot;The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam&quot; and &quot;Islam: The Future Civilization&quot;. He also received eight international prizes for his contributions to Islamic scholarship, and was considered one of the most influential Islamic scholars living. Al-Qaradawi had a prominent role within the intellectual leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian political organization, although he repeatedly stated that he was no longer a member and twice (in 1976 and 2004) turned down offers for the official role in the organization.

Al-Qaradawi was sometimes described as a &quot;moderate Islamist&quot;. Some of his views, such as his condoning of Palestinian suicide bombings against Israelis, caused reactions from governments in the West: he was refused an entry visa to the United Kingdom in 2008, and barred from entering France in 2012.

==Biography==
=== In Egypt ===
Al-Qaradawi was born on 9 September 1926 in Saft Turab rural village in the Nile Delta, now in Gharbia Governorate, Egypt, into a poor family of devout Muslim peasants. He became an orphan at the age of two, when he lost his father. Following his father&#x27;s death, he was raised by his mother and uncle. He read and memorized the entire Quran before he was ten years old.

He then joined the Institute of Religious Studies at Tanta, and graduated after nine years of study. While in Tanta, Al-Qaradawi first encountered Hassan al Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, when al Banna gave a lecture at his school. Al-Qaradawi wrote of the lasting impact of this encounter, describing al Banna as &quot;brilliantly radiating, as if his words were revelation or live coals from the light of prophecy.&quot;

After graduating from the Institute of Religious Studies he moved on to study Islamic Theology at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, from which he graduated in 1953. He earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Literature in 1958 at the Advanced Arabic Studies Institute. He enrolled in the graduate program in the Department of Quran and Sunnah Sciences of the Faculty of Religion&#x27;s Fundamentals (Usul al-Din), and graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in Quranic studies in 1960. In 1962, he was sent by Al-Azhar University to Qatar to head the Qatari Secondary Institute of Religious Studies. He completed his PhD thesis titled &quot;Zakah and its effect on solving social problems&quot; in 1973 with First Merit and was awarded his PhD degree from Al-Azhar.

His connection with the Muslim Brotherhood led to imprisonment under King Farouq in 1949, then three more times during the term of President Gamal Abdul Nasser. He left Egypt for Qatar in 1961, and did not return until the overthrow of the military regime by the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.

=== Based in Qatar ===
In 1977, he laid the foundation for the Faculty of Shari&#x27;ah and Islamic Studies at the University of Qatar and became the faculty&#x27;s dean. In the same year he founded the Centre of Seerah and Sunna Research. He also served at Egypt&#x27;s Institute of Imams under the Ministry of Religious Endowments as supervisor before moving back to Doha as Dean of the Islamic Department at the Faculties of Shariah and Education in Qatar, where he continued until 1990. His next appointment was in Algeria as Chairman of the Scientific Council of Islamic University and Higher Institutions in 1990–91. He returned to Qatar once more as Director of the Seerah and Sunnah Center at Qatar University.

In 1997, Al-Qaradawi helped found the European Council for Fatwa and Research, a council of important and influential Muslim scholars dedicated to researching and writing fatwas in support of Western Muslim minority communities based in Ireland, and he served as its head. He also served as the chairman of International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS).

In the wake of the 2011 Revolution he returned to Egypt for the first time since leaving in 1961.

Al-Qaradawi was a principal shareholder and former Sharia adviser to Bank Al-Taqwa. On 2 August 2010, the bank was removed from a list of entities and individuals associated with Al Qaeda maintained by the United Nations Security Council.

Al-Qaradawi finished third in a 2008 poll on who was the world&#x27;s leading public intellectual. The poll, Top 100 Public Intellectuals, was conducted among readers of &quot;Prospect Magazine&quot; (UK) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (United States).

=== 2011 return to Egypt ===
After the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, Qaradawi made his first public appearance in Egypt after 1981. In Tahrir Square, he led Friday prayers on 18 February, addressing an audience estimated to exceed two million Egyptians. It began with an address of &quot;O Muslims and Copts&quot;, referring to Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christian minority instead of the customary opening for Islamic Friday sermons &quot;O Muslims&quot;. He was reported to have said, &quot;Egyptian people are like the genie who came out of the lamp and who have been in prison for 30 years.&quot; He also demanded the release of political prisoners in Egyptian prisons, praised the Copts for protecting Muslims in their Friday prayer, and called for the new military rulers to quickly restore civilian rule. He referred to Hosni Mubarak as &quot;the tyrannical pharaoh&quot;. In the sermon, Qaradawi called for the immediate release of political prisoners, the dissolution of the cabinet of Mubarak loyalists, and an end to the economic blockade of Gaza.

Brookings Institution member Shadi Hamid said that Qaradawi was in the mainstream of Egyptian society, and that he also had appeal among Egyptians who are not Islamist. He described the sermon as &quot;nonsectarian&quot; and &quot;broadly political&quot;. In the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, Barry Rubin wrote that although he was seen as a moderate by some in the West, he supported the straight Islamist line. Qaradawi was seen as a danger by Rubin because he was a charismatic thinker who could easily mobilise the masses. The author was concerned that Qaradawi would take over Egypt and that this would have had negative consequences for Israel.

On 21 February 2011, Qaradawi issued a fatwa, which is a religious ruling, permitting the killing of Muammar Gaddafi. This was in response to Gaddafi&#x27;s plans to kill protesters in Libya. He also called on Libyan ambassadors around the world to distance themselves from Gaddafi&#x27;s government.

=== Death ===
On the afternoon of 26 September 2022, Qaradawi died in Qatar at the age of 96. After a funeral service attended by thousands of people including the deputy emir of Qatar Abdullah bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, and other Qatari and foreign officials at Imam Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab Mosque, Qardawi was buried at Mesaimeer Cemetery in Doha.

==Views and statements==

===Religious and sectarian views===

====Extremism====
Al-Qaradawi wrote on the danger of extremist groups of Islam, in his dissertation on the subject &quot;Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism&quot;. This dissertation discusses the phenomenon of religious extremism among Muslim youth. He discusses the reasons why young Muslims may resort to extremism, and argues that many of these reasons are due to the hypocrisy and self-contradictions of older Muslims. He advised that the only way to rectify the situation is for older Muslims to reform themselves and their societies according to the actual teachings of Islam.

In 2014, Qaradawi stated that the declaration of an Islamic caliphate by the militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) violates sharia law. Qaradawi said in a statement that the declaration &quot;is void under sharia&quot;. This statement comes after ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on Muslims with military, medical and managerial skills to flock to its newly-declared pan-Islamic state.

====Sufism====
Al-Qaradawi was an avid caller to what he calls &quot;Islamic Sufism&quot;, praising those who practice it as pious.

====Shi&#x27;as====
Qaradawi accused the Shi&#x27;ites of invading Sunni societies, and criticized some aspects of the Shi&#x27;i doctrine. He described them as &quot;heretics&quot; and said that Sunni leaders in the region have voiced concern about a Shiite resurgence.

Qaradawi&#x27;s statements about the Shia sect of Islam have caused controversy and outrage among Shia leaders. His comments are seen as divisive and legitimising anti-Shia rhetoric. The reactions to his statements are politically motivated and could lead to a sectarian conflict.

The Iranian reaction to Qaradawi was particularly intense, with some Iranian officials apologising for the personal attack by Iranian Mehr News Agency, in which before this they described Qaradawi as &quot;a spokesman for international Freemasonry and rabbis&quot;. Qaradawi argues that he was moved by indications of growing Shi&#x27;itization in Egypt and by the lack of awareness on the part of Sunnis and their ulama of that danger.

In May 2013, al-Qaradawi verbally attacked the Alawite sect, which many describe as an offshoot of Shia Islam and of which President Bashar al-Assad is a member, as &quot;more infidel than Christians and Jews&quot; (أكفر من اليهود والنصارى).

====Non-Muslims====
Qaradawi wrote that Islam does not prohibit Muslims from being kind and generous to people of other religions. However, Islam looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard. He suggested that in having dialogue with the Jews and Christians, Muslims should avoid such approaches that may cause bitterness or arouse hostility.

According to Qaradawi, the verses in the Quran that tell Muslims to break ties with Jews and Christians (Al-Maidah 5:54-55) refer to those people who were hostile to Islam and waged war against Muslims. This means that Muslims are not allowed to help or be friends with people who are hostile towards Islam, even if it means going against their own interests.

In his book titled &quot;The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam&quot;, al-Qaradawi wrote, &quot;Islam does not prohibit Muslims to be kind and generous to peoples of other religions, even if they are idolaters and polytheists, ... it looks upon the People of the Book, that is, Jews and Christians, with special regard, whether they reside in a Muslim society or outside it. The Qur&#x27;an never addresses them without saying, &#x27;O People of the Book&#x27; or &#x27;O You who have been given the Book&#x27;, indicating that they were originally people of a revealed religion. For this reason there exists a relationship of mercy and spiritual kinship between them and the Muslims.&quot;

====Jews====

In August 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Dublin-based European Council for Fatwa and Research, of which al-Qaradawi was president, had used the antisemitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion in its theological deliberations. Al-Qaradawi&#x27;s remarks were sharply criticized by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which accused him of inciting violence against Jews.

In a 9 January 2009 sermon during the Gaza War, shown on Al-Jazeera, Qaradawi prayed for Allah to take revenge on the &quot;enemies of Islam&quot;, specifically the Jews, whom he described as treacherous, aggressors who have spread much tyranny and corruption. He asked Allah to annihilate them completely, without sparing any of them.

In his Friday sermon broadcast on &quot;Qatar TV&quot; on 26 April 2013, Qaradawi announced that he would not participate in next year&#x27;s interfaith dialogue if Jews were invited, stating that there should be no debate with those who have committed injustice. He cited a verse from the Quran which says that there should be no debate with the People of the Book except in a way that is best, and went on to say that the Jews have committed great injustice and that &quot;their hands are soiled with blood&quot;.

Qaradawi&#x27;s statements were described as incitement to genocide in a &quot;Jewish Political Studies Review&quot; article, which connected his belief in Jewish conspiracies to the appeals to violence against them. Qaradawi asserted that Hitler meted out divinely sanctioned punishment to the Jews and called for Muslims to impose a similar punishment, calling openly for genocide. His appeals for genocide were coupled with paranoid conspiracy thinking that identifies the Jews as the greatest enemies of Islam; alleging a Jewish plot to take over the entire Middle East, including Mecca and Medina; blaming the Jews for the abolition of the Islamic Caliphate in 1924 and the spread of communism; and accusing the Jews of planning to tear down the al-Aqsa Mosque so as to build a Jewish Temple in its place.

====Apostasy from Islam====
Al-Qaradawi said that apostasy in Islam – Muslims leaving Islam – is a grave danger to the Muslim community and that the duty of all Muslims &quot;is to combat apostasy in all its forms and wherefrom it comes, giving it no chance to pervade in the Muslim world&quot;. In February 2013, Qaradawi stated on Egyptian television that the death penalty is a necessity for those who leave Islam, citing several speeches and writings by Muhammad and his followers. He explains that many hadiths state that any apostate should be killed, and that this is necessary to preserve Islam.

In 2011, Al-Qaradawi wrote that execution is a valid penalty for apostasy, but only in cases where the apostate has also committed another crime. He advocates giving apostates a chance to repent before carrying out the sentence, and says that hidden apostates should not be punished by the Muslim community, but left to the judgement of God.

===Political and views===

====Civil state v. theocracy====
Al-Qaradawi spoke in favor of democracy in the Muslim world, speaking of a need for reform of political climates in the Middle East specifically. On 22 February 2011, he held an exclusive interview with OnIslam.net, dismissing the allegation that he wanted a religious state established in Egypt: &quot;On the contrary, my speech supported establishing a civil state with a religious background, I am totally against theocracy. We are not a state for mullahs.&quot;

====Terrorism====
After the September 11 attacks, al-Qaradawi urged Muslims to donate blood for the victims and said:

He denies that Palestinian suicide bombing attacks constitute terrorism, claiming, &quot;when Palestinians face such unjust aggression, they tend to stem bloodletting and destruction and not to claim the lives of innocent civilians,&quot; but qualifies that with &quot;I do agree with those who do not allow such martyr operations to be carried out outside the Palestinian territories.&quot;

Al-Qaradawi suggested the legitimate use of (defensive) suicide bombings against enemy combatants in modern times if the defending combatants have no other means of self-defense. The Oxford-based Malaysian Islamic Scholar, Dr. Afifi al-Akiti, rules that there is no Islamic legal precedent for this view and that female soldiers can only be killed in direct combat. With regards to suicide bombings he says that they are &quot;breaching the scholarly consensus ... because to endanger one&#x27;s life is one thing and to commit suicide during the attack is obviously another&quot;. With regards to male soldiers he states, &quot;It goes without saying that they are considered combatants as soon as they arrive on the battlefield even if they are not in direct combat – provided of course that the remaining conventions of war have been observed throughout, and that all this is during a valid war when there is no ceasefire.&quot;

Western governments have met al-Qaradawi to request release of European civilians kidnapped in Iraq and have thanked him officially, praising his cooperation. The French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier wrote to al-Qaradawi: &quot;With such a clear condemnation of the abduction of the French hostages you have sent a clear-cut message demonstrating respect for the tenets of Islam.&quot;

====Israeli-Palestinian conflict====
Al-Qaradawi supported suicide attacks on all Israelis, including women since he viewed the Israeli society as a &quot;completely military&quot; society that did not include any civilians. He also considered pregnant women and their unborn babies to be valid targets on the grounds that the babies could grow up to join the Israeli Army.

Defending bombings against Israeli civilians, al-Qaradawi told &quot;BBC Newsnight&quot; in 2005 that:
* &quot;An Israeli woman is not like women in our societies, because she is a soldier.&quot;
* &quot;I consider this type of martyrdom operation as an evidence of God&#x27;s justice.&quot;
* &quot;Allah Almighty is Just; through His infinite Wisdom He has given the weak a weapon the strong do not have and that is their ability to turn their bodies into bombs as Palestinians do.&quot;

In an interview with the newspaper &quot;Al Raya&quot; in April 2001, al-Qaradawi declared that suicide (or &quot;martyrdom&quot;) bombings conducted by Palestinians against Israelis &quot;are not suicide operations. These are heroic martyrdom operations, and the heroes who carry them out don&#x27;t embark on this action out of hopelessness and despair but are driven by an overwhelming desire to cast terror and fear into the hearts of the oppressors.&quot;

On 8 May 2013, Qaradawi visited Gaza and gave a speech in support of Hamas. He asked all of the Palestinian people to work with other Arab people and Muslims around the world to destroy Israel, saying inflammatory things such as &quot;Our wish should be that we carry out Jihad to death&quot; and &quot;We should seek to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, inch by inch.&quot;

An Anti-Defamation League report in 2011 said that al-Qaradawi had voiced his desire to see Jerusalem conquered in a fatwa in which he claimed that it was the Muslims&#x27; duty to &quot;defend&quot; Jerusalem with &quot;their lives, their money and all they possess, or else they will be subject to Allah&#x27;s punishment.&quot;

====Iraq war====

In 2004 the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organization chaired by al-Qaradawi which counts a great number of prominent individuals affiliated to the Muslim Brotherhood and/or Hamas among its members, ruled that &quot;resisting occupation troops in Iraq is a &#x27;duty&#x27; on able Muslims in and outside the war-torn country and that aiding the occupier is impermissible.&quot;

In an address aired on Qatar TV on 5 January 2007, al-Qaradawi questioned the trial of Saddam Hussein under American supervision in Iraq, but agreed to it if it were conducted by the Iraqi people &quot;after liberating Iraq from American colonialism&quot;. He also suggested that the trial was &quot;an act of vengeance by the Americans&quot; for his missile attacks on Israel. He strongly criticized the way Saddam was hanged:

====Hezbollah====
In 2006, in response to Muslim scholar Abdullah Ibn Jibreen&#x27;s fatwa declaring that it was forbidden for Muslims to support or pray for Hezbollah because they are Shia, al-Qaradawi said that supporting Hezbollah is a religious duty for all Muslims and that resistance, whether in Palestine or Lebanon, is the most noble act. He added &quot;Shias agree with the Sunnis in the main principles of Islam while the differences are only over the branches&quot; and also called upon the Sunnis and Shia of Iraq to end the civil war.

Seven years later, during the Syrian Civil War, Qaradawi urged all Sunnis to fight Hezbollah, attacking Hezbollah&#x27;s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran: &quot;The leader of the Party of Satan comes to fight the Sunnis ... Now we know what the Iranians want ... They want continued massacres to kill Sunnis.&quot; Qaradawi also stated that he now regretted having advocated rapprochement between Sunnis and Shias and his 2006 defense of Hezbollah.

====Arab Spring====
Qaradawi declared his support for the rebels led by the National Transitional Council in the 2011 Libyan civil war, urging Arab nations to recognize them and &quot;to confront the tyranny of the regime in Tripoli&quot;. He suggested weapons be sent to the rebels to assist them, and said &quot;Our Islamic nation should stand against injustice and corruption and I urge the Egyptian government to extend a helping hand to Libyan people and not to Gaddafi.&quot;

In response to the 2011 Bahrain protests, Qaradawi was reluctant to give support: &quot;The protests in Bahrain are sectarian in nature. The Shias are revolting against the Sunnis.&quot; He claimed that Shia protesters attack Sunnis and occupied their mosques. He acknowledged that the Shia majority had legitimate concerns in regards to fairness with the Sunnis: &quot;I want them to be real citizens of their country.&quot;

Qaradawi said that all Arabs should back up the protesters in the 2011 Syrian uprising, saying &quot;Today the train of revolution has reached a station that it had to reach: The Syria station,&quot; and &quot;It is not possible for Syria to be separated from the history of the Arab community.&quot; He declared his support for the protests against what he called Syria&#x27;s &quot;oppressive regime&quot;, claiming &quot;atrocities&quot; were committed by it. He called for victory against the ruling Ba&#x27;ath party and claimed the army would be the major factor in the revolt. He claimed that when he offered to mediate negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian government, someone deliberately sabotaged it. Qaradawi also expressed his support for the No Fly zone put in place by western nations over Libya, saying &quot;The operation in Libya is to protect the civilians from Gaddafi&#x27;s tyranny&quot; and slamming Arab League leader Amr Moussa for criticism of it.

===Women, gender and other issues===
Commenting on the role women played in social active issues:

====Views on the Holocaust====
Al-Qaradawi defended the mass murder of millions during the Holocaust as a &quot;punishment.&quot; In a statement that aired on Al-Jazeera TV on 28 January 2009 during the Gaza War, al-Qaradawi said the following regarding Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust (as translated by MEMRI):

====Wife beating====
Al-Qaradawi told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that wife beating was neither &quot;obligatory nor desirable&quot; but that he &quot;accepts it as a method of last resort – though only &quot;lightly&quot;&quot;. He stated on Channel 4 News that it was justifiable in certain circumstances but the &quot;ideal was for Muslim men never to beat their wives, and if husbands wrongly beat their wives, they have the right to fight back&quot;. The British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that al-Qaradawi, in his book &quot;The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam&quot;, stated that wife-beating is permissible after the failure of all other means of persuasion. In such circumstances, a husband may beat his wife &quot;lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive areas&quot;.

====Female genital mutilation (FGM)====
Qaradawi said that female genital mutilation surgery is forbidden in Islam. He called for the termination and ban of &quot;female circumcision&quot; in some parts of the Muslim world, especially in rural Africa where most still practice it. His views were supported by Sheikhs in Al-Azhar.

====Female masturbation====
Qaradawi urged women to not masturbate and stated that it is dangerous to insert things into the vagina.

====Homosexuality====

On 5 June 2006, on the Al Jazeera program &quot;Sharia and Life&quot;, al-Qaradawi (a regular on the program) reiterated orthodox views on homosexuality. When asked about the punishment for people who &quot;practise liwaat (sodomy) or sihaaq (lesbian activity)&quot;, al-Qaradawi replied: &quot;The same punishment as any sexual pervert – the same as the fornicator.&quot; (MEMRI translation). The punishment for fornication is lashing.

In an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Qaradawi said that his attitude towards homosexuality is the same as that found in Christianity. In the interview he stated, &quot;One year ago, there was a demonstration against me in London because I spoke out against homosexuality. People seem to have forgotten that it wasn&#x27;t me who came up with this mindset. It&#x27;s part of God&#x27;s order spoken of by Moses and even mentioned by Jesus.&quot;

Rigorous scholarly debates among the Islamic School of Law (Fiqh) question whether LGBT people are defined by genetic disorders and that it may be permissible or not for those who&#x27;re scientifically medically proven to be part of the LGBT category as with hermaphrodite denoting whether a person is inclined towards the naturality of female or male instinct. Same for Mukhannathun (transgender), in which there are many prophetic Hadith that allow males who have inclinations towards being female (effeminate) that occurred during the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s time and that they were accepted as part of the larger community in Madinah having equal rights. Qaradawi was one of many leading Islamic scholars to weigh in on this ongoing debate.

====Punishment of stoning====

Al-Qaradawi called &quot;stoning&quot; un-Islamic for it has nothing to do with Islam at all but laws made by the religion of Judaism; Jewish Religious Laws. He said there are more than dozens of verses in the Torah that support stoning for adulterers, fornicators, LGBT people, and for many other reasons.

====Honor killing====

Al-Qaradawi said that honor killing is a tradition that was carried out thousands of years ago by ancient civilization; the Romans, the Dark Ages, Chinese Emperors, etc. He said it has nothing to do with Islam; neither Qur&#x27;an nor Sunnah (Prophetic Hadith). He called on those who do it to be punished with death for their crime; a life for a life.

====Mawlid (Muhammad&#x27;s birthday)====

Al-Qaradawi fully supported and advocated Mawlid. He said that to use the birth date of Muhammad in remembrance of his life story is not bid&#x27;ah. In fact, it is encouraged in Islam to do good action (Man Sanna Sunnatun Hassanah) based on a Sahih Hadith. And that Allah (God) himself has said in Al-Qur&#x27;an, Chapter 21, Verse 107:

Al-Qaradawi explained that Allah (God) is talking about Muhammad&#x27;s miracle birth as the verse mentions &quot;sent you&quot;. In other words, his presence, his birth, his coming. A &quot;mercy&quot; (rahmah) to the worlds. Means mercy to all mankind. It means everything; all of his creations (all creatures).

It&#x27;s in this Sahih Hadith that al-Qaradawi emphasizes that &quot;good innovative actions&quot; are strongly encouraged as long as it doesn&#x27;t go against the Sharia. What more involving religion itself than worldly good deeds like holding an old person&#x27;s hand while crossing the road guiding him/her to safety and many more. It&#x27;s encouraging for both. He said these are the true meaning and emphasis of Islam, to be the religion of mercy (rahmah) and to do more good than just good so that others may lead by our good examples and that they may successively follows them till the End of Time.

====Niqab====

Al-Qaradawi said that niqab (veil) is not obligatory in Islam. He pointed out that a woman&#x27;s face is not an awrah. He called those who don the niqabs as following tradition and culture before Islam came to Arabia. Those people, be it male or female at that time, had to cover their faces from the dusty desert and from inhaling dust especially during sandstorms. Al-Azhar&#x27;s Grand Imam, also an Egyptian Grand Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, have also pointed out that niqab has nothing to do with Islam.

====Organ transplantation====

At the same time Qaradawi issued a fatwa (edict) that organ transplantation from a living person to a living person is permissible in Islam but through donation as donation is considered charity. As for a dead person, only when the brain stops, the transplantation can then be carried out.

===Other views===
;Mecca Time
In April 2008, at a conference in Qatar titled &quot;Mecca: the Center of the Earth, Theory and Practice&quot;, al-Qaradawi advocated the implementation of Mecca Time to replace the Greenwich Meridian as the basis of the world time zone system.

;Muhammed cartoon controversy
Al-Qaradawi called for a &quot;Day of Anger&quot; over the cartoons, but condemned violent actions in response to them.

;Amman Message
Al-Qaradawi was one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy.

;Salman Rushdie
Al-Qaradawi said, &quot;Rushdie disgraced the honor of the Prophet and his family and defiled the values of Islam,&quot; but he never backed the fatwa calling for his death.

;Muslim Brotherhood
In 1997, Qaradawi&#x27;s affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood led to his expulsion from Egypt, where the organisation was prohibited at the time.

Al-Qaradawi was a follower of Hasan al-Banna during his youth and a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He twice turned down offers to be its leader. In an interview on the Dream channel, al-Qaradawi stated the following about his relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood (MB):

On 16 May 2015 al-Qaradawi was sentenced to death in absentia by an Egyptian court along with the ousted President Mohamed Morsi and over 100 other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. As reported by the Interpol website, Qaradawi was wanted by the judicial authorities of Egypt for &quot;agreement, incitement and assistance to commit intentional murder, helping prisoners to escape, arson, vandalism and theft.&quot;

;Reality TV
Qaradawi criticised reality television programs, saying that the aim of these is to &#x27;mislead the [Muslim] nation&#x27;.

==Reception in the Muslim world==
Al-Qaradawi was at the forefront of contemporary Muslim thinkers and scholars. His vast contributions include more than 80 books and hundreds of articles on different Islamic issues, ranging from the fundamental principles and laws of Islam to the needs and challenges of modern Muslim societies. His knowledge, intellect, moderation and unrelenting efforts to bring Islam to a larger audience gained him the respect of millions of Muslims and non-Muslims worldwide. His television program &quot;Ash-Shariah wal-Hayat&quot; (&quot;Sharia and Life&quot;) had an estimated 700–800 million viewers worldwide.

In 2012, Qaradawi traded barbs with fellow Muslim cleric Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri due to what Ibn Aqil perceived as hypocritical positions of Qaradawi during the Arab Spring, a charge he denied.

Pakistani scholar, Muhammad Taqi Usmani stated, &quot;There is no doubt that I—as the lowest student of Islamic Fiqh—with my benefitting from the books of the outstanding Dr al-Qaradāwī to a very large extent, and my supreme wonderment at the majority of [his works], have found myself, in some particular issues, not in agreement with him in the results that he has arrived at, but these sorts of differences (ikhtilāf) in views based on juristic judgement (ijtihādī) are natural, and cannot be the [sole] basis for judging [their author] so long as the people of knowledge do not deem [the bearers of such opinions] to be weak intellectually, or in religion, and [in any case] the importance of these books and their value in scholarship and da&#x27;wa are not affected by this to even the slightest, most insignificant degree.&quot;

In addition, he refers to some modern scholars by writing, &quot;What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above the level of the layman&quot; but exempts Qaradawi by saying, &quot;As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [From this] I found him manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dā&#x27;i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist.&quot;

The Doğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı, which supports the Turkistan Islamic Party, attacked al-Qaradawi and called his creed &quot;perverted&quot; and claimed that he was followed by &quot;democratic polytheists&quot;. Qaradawi was attacked by Hani Al-Siba&#x27;i.

==Controversy==

===On Syria and Russia===
Qaradawi stated that Russia was an &quot;enemy of Islam&quot; due to the country&#x27;s military relations with the Syrian regime.

His remarks drew harsh criticism from Muslims in Russia. According to Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, &quot;Qaradawi&#x27;s statements had given rise to amazement among the Muslims of Russia.&quot; Kadyrov asserted that Qaradawi&#x27;s statements were mainly &quot;directed against the Muslims of Russia, who are citizens of this country, were born here and live here, and who care about their country&quot;.

Kadyrov claimed that &quot;It is not Russia that is supplying weapons and money for the thousands of mercenaries from all over the world who have flooded Syria and are committing daily terrorist attacks, in which the blood of women, old people and children is shed.&quot;

===Entry into western countries===
Al-Qaradawi was banned from entering the United States since 1999 and the United Kingdom since 2008, though he visited London in 2004. The lobby group MEMRI said it helped play a role in the measures. In July 2003, he visited Stockholm, Sweden, for a conference at the Stockholm Mosque arranged by the Muslim Association of Sweden. During the conference al-Qaradawi expressed his support for suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, calling the fight against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories a &quot;necessary Jihad&quot;. France announced in March 2012 it will not let him enter.

===Fatwa controversy with MEMRI===
The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) (citing &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot;), alleges that al-Qaradawi issued a Fatwa following the Iraqi insurgency, saying,

All of the Americans in Iraq are combatants, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers, and one should fight them, since the American civilians came to Iraq in order to serve the occupation. The abduction and killing of Americans in Iraq is a [religious] obligation so as to cause them to leave Iraq immediately. The mutilation of corpses is forbidden in Islam.

Al-Qaradawi denied this allegation:

I have not published a Fatwa on this issue. At the Egyptian Journalists&#x27; Union a few days ago I was asked about the permissibility of fighting against the occupation in Iraq, and I answered that it is permitted. Afterwards I was asked concerning the American civilians in Iraq and I merely responded with the question – are there American civilians in Iraq? It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word &quot;killing&quot; but rather I say &quot;struggle&quot;, which is a more comprehensive word than the word &quot;killing&quot; and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. In addition, I have condemned the taking of hostages on a number of occasions in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.

Shaker Al-Nabulsi, a former Muslim who writes for the liberal site Ethal, called for the creation of a petition to the UN calling to put Qaradawi and his like on trial for incitement and support of terrorism.

===Alcohol fatwa controversy===
Al-Qaradawi issued a fatwa in 2008, stating that the consumption of tiny amounts of alcohol (&lt;0.5% concentration or 5/1000, such as found in energy drinks) was acceptable for Muslims, in beverages where the fermentation is natural and unavoidable and is too small to lead to intoxication.

==Terrorist allegations==

In October 2004, according to Saudi Arabian newspaper &quot;Arab News&quot;, based in New York and Jeddah, over 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries signed a petition addressed to the United Nations to raise awareness on the use of religion for incitement to violence. Al-Qaradawi was mentioned among &quot;the sheikhs of death,&quot; as the signatories defined those who manipulate religion to incite violence, for &quot;providing a religious cover for terrorism.&quot; Al-Qaradawi dismissed this charge as baseless and slanderous for his stance was that the self-proclaimed caliphate of the Islamic State was &quot;void under &quot;sharia&quot;&quot;.

Qaradawi was banned from entering the U.S. in 1999. In 2008, the UK Home Office stated that al-Qaradawi was denied a visa to enter Britain for medical treatment because of fears that his preaching &quot;could foster inter-community violence.&quot; In March 2012, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared his decision to block the entry of extremists in the country after the Toulouse attacks, and specifically mentioned al-Qaradawi as one of those barred from entering France.

Qaradawi chaired the Union of Good, a coalition of Islamic charities supporting Hamas&#x27; infrastructure, an organisation on the US State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations. In December 2014 the International Union of Muslim Scholars led by al-Qaradawi was expelled from the Cairo-based International Islamic Council for Da&#x27;wah and Relief based on the allegation that the group mixed religion and politics and supported terrorism.

The &quot;Consortium Against Terrorist Finance&quot; reported that, in 2010, Qaradawi was listed as the chairman of the Sharia supervisory board of Qatar Islamic Bank, one of the Qatari sharia-compliant giants which allegedly had a long history of cooperation with controversial financial entities. He was also a former Sharia adviser and shareholder to Bank al-Taqwa, once listed by the U.S and the UN as a terrorist financier associated with al-Qaeda but delisted in 2010.

==Personal life==
Al-Qaradawi was born in Egypt but lived in Qatar. He had three sons and four daughters, three of whom hold doctorates from British Universities. His daughter, Ilham Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, is an internationally recognized nuclear scientist. His son, Abdulrahman Yusuf al-Qaradawi, is a poet and a political activist in Egypt.

==Awards and recognition==

It also named after him its newly established research centre, The Qaradawi Center for Islamic Moderation and Renewal.

The &quot;State Merit Prize for Islamic Studies&quot; was issued to Qaradawi by the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage of Qatar on 3 November 2009.

Al-Qaradawi was a trustee of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies and was named as the technical consultant for a multimillion-dollar English-language film about Mohammed, produced by Barrie Osborne. A 2008 &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; online poll put him at No.3 in the list of the Top 20 Public Intellectuals worldwide.

==Books==
Al-Qaradawi authored more than 120 books and his academic style and objective thought are considered to be some of the main characteristics of his works. His most famous work is &quot;The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam&quot;. Professor Mustafa al-Zarqa declared that owning a copy of it was &quot;the duty of every Muslim family&quot;.

===&quot;Fiqh al-Zakat&quot;===
His book &quot;Fiqh al-Zakat&quot; is considered by some as the most comprehensive work in the area of zakat. Abul Ala Maududi commented on it as &quot;the book of this century in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh)&quot;.
The prominent Deobandi Islamic scholar Muhammad Taqi Usmani, said this about the work:

The first book that read in its entirety of his works is his valuable book Fiqh al-Zakat, and I benefitted much from this great, encyclopedic, rewarding work through which the author did a great service to the second of the pillars of Islam, in a way that the umma needs today, when it comes to the application of zakat at the level of the individual and the group. Indeed this work manifested the genius of its author, and his inventive methodology, not only in the clarification of issues pertaining to zakat and their compilation, but in stimulating research in contemporary topics that no one before him had touched upon, and basing them upon the principles fiqh and its jurisprudential theory.

===&quot;Fiqh al-Jihad&quot;===
His book &quot;Fiqh al-Jihad&quot; has been widely commented on. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writes:

This book has also been analyzed by University of Southern California professor Sherman Jackson and Tunisian Islamist scholar-politician Rachid Ghannouchi.

His views on jihad have attracted criticism from some hard line groups.

<text>Earl Cadogan is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Great Britain for the Cadogan family. The second creation, in 1800, was for Charles Cadogan, 3rd Baron Cadogan.

==History==
Of Welsh origin, the family name was spelt &quot;Cadwgan&quot; until the early 15th century. According to &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, the family descends from: Rees ap Griffith ap Llewelyn ap Meredith Bengoch ap Howell (Lord of Penbuallt) ap Sitsylt (Lord of Builth) ap Llewelyn (Lord of Builth) ap Cadwgan ap Elystan Glodrydd (&quot;The Renowned&quot;), Prince of Fferreg, of Dol-y-Gaer, Breconshire.

Major William Cadogan (1601–1661) was a cavalry officer in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army. His son Henry Cadogan was a barrister in Dublin. His eldest son William Cadogan was a noted soldier, politician and diplomat. He was a general in the army and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession and also served as Ambassador to the Netherlands and as Master-General of the Ordnance. In 1716, he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Cadogan, of Reading in the County of Berkshire, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1718, he was further honoured when he was made Baron Cadogan, of Oakley in the County of Buckingham, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his younger brother Charles Cadogan and the heirs male of his body, and Viscount Caversham, in the County of Oxford, and Earl Cadogan, in the County of Denbigh, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

Lord Cadogan had two daughters but no sons, so on his death in 1726, three titles—the barony of 1716, the viscountcy, and earldom—became extinct. However, he was succeeded in the barony of 1718 according to the special remainder by his brother Charles, the second Baron. He was a General of the Horse and also represented Reading and Newport, Isle of Wight, in the House of Commons. Cadogan married Elizabeth, second daughter and heiress of the prominent physician and collector Sir Hans Sloane. Through this marriage the Sloane estates in central London came into the Cadogan family, and these have been the basis of the family wealth ever since.

His son, the third Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge and served as Master of the Mint. In 1800 the earldom of Cadogan held by his uncle was revived when he was created Viscount Chelsea, in the County of Middlesex, and Earl Cadogan. These titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. His youngest son, the third Earl (who succeeded his half-brother in 1832), was an admiral in the Royal Navy. In 1831, one year before he succeeded in the earldom, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Oakley, of Caversham in the County of Oxford. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli as whip, Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1866 to 1868.

His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was also a noted Conservative politician. He held office under Disraeli and later Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for War, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Privy Seal and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (with a seat in the cabinet). His second son Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea, heir apparent to the earldom from 1878 to 1908, represented Bury St Edmunds in Parliament as a Conservative, but died in 1908, seven years before his father. His only son Edward, Viscount Chelsea, died in 1910 at the age of seven. Lord Cadogan was therefore succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl. As of 2023, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 2023.

Several other members of the Cadogan family have gained distinction. Lady Sarah Cadogan, daughter of the first Earl of the first creation, married Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and was the mother of the famous Lennox sisters (and also the grandmother of Charles James Fox). Sir George Cadogan, second son of the third Earl, was a general in the army. Two further members represented seats in the House of Commons.
Sir Alexander Cadogan, eighth and youngest son of the fifth Earl, was the most senior civil servant to a troubled government department (Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs) between 1938 and 1946, that of World War II and his personal notes reflect his part in shaping the policies which aided the survival of Britain and its British Empire&#x27;s resources in Asia during that war.

The Earls Cadogan are wealthy landowners, having planned and developed and still owning Cadogan Estates, which covers much of Chelsea and parts of the much smaller area of Knightsbridge, and second only to the Duke of Westminster as Central London&#x27;s richest landlords (whose surname, Grosvenor, is also closely associated with some of the most ornate London architecture).

The family seat was Culford Park, near Culford, Suffolk.

The rampant lion in the Earl Cadogan coat of arms is shown in the badge of Chelsea F.C.

==Horse racing==
In horse racing the family who own horses use the colour Eton blue, which is similar to the turquoise of Cambridge University, registered &quot;c.&quot; 1889.

<doc id="457812" wikidata="Q864961" url="?curid=457812" title="Bi-quinary coded decimal">
<text>Bi-quinary coded decimal is a numeral encoding scheme used in many abacuses and in some early computers, notably the Colossus. The term bi-quinary indicates that the code comprises both a two-state (&quot;bi&quot;) and a five-state (&quot;quin&quot;ary) component. The encoding resembles that used by many abacuses, with four beads indicating the five values either from 0 through 4 or from 5 through 9 and another bead indicating which of those ranges (which can alternatively be thought of as +5).

Several human languages, most notably Fula and Wolof also use biquinary systems. For example, the Fula word for 6, &quot;jowi e go&#x27;o&quot;, literally means &quot;five [plus] one&quot;. Roman numerals use a symbolic, rather than positional, bi-quinary base, even though Latin is completely decimal.

The Korean finger counting system Chisanbop uses a bi-quinary system, where each finger represents a one and a thumb represents a five, allowing one to count from 0 to 99 with two hands.

One advantage of one bi-quinary encoding scheme on digital computers is that it must have two bits set (one in the binary field and one in the quinary field), providing a built-in checksum to verify if the number is valid or not. (Stuck bits happened frequently with computers using mechanical relays.)

==Examples==

Several different representations of bi-quinary coded decimal have been used by different machines. The two-state component is encoded as one or two bits, and the five-state component is encoded using three to five bits. Some examples are:
* Roman and Chinese abacuses
* Stibitz relay calculators at Bell Labs from Model II onwards
* FACOM 128 relay calculators at Fujitsu
===IBM 650===

The IBM 650 uses seven bits: two &quot;bi&quot; bits (0 and 5) and five &quot;quinary&quot; bits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), with error checking.

Exactly one &quot;bi&quot; bit and one &quot;quinary&quot; bit is set in a valid digit. The bi-quinary encoding of the internal workings of the machine are evident in the arrangement of its lights – the &quot;bi&quot; bits form the top of a T for each digit, and the &quot;quinary&quot; bits form the vertical stem.

===Remington Rand 409===
The Remington Rand 409 has five bits: one &quot;quinary&quot; bit (tube) for each of 1, 3, 5, and 7 - only one of these would be on at the time. The fifth &quot;bi&quot; bit represented 9 if none of the others were on; otherwise it added 1 to the value represented by the other &quot;quinary&quot; bit. The machine was sold in the two models UNIVAC 60 and UNIVAC 120.
===UNIVAC Solid State===
The UNIVAC Solid State uses four bits: one &quot;bi&quot; bit (5), three binary coded &quot;quinary&quot; bits (4 2 1) and one parity check bit
===UNIVAC LARC===
The UNIVAC LARC has four bits: one &quot;bi&quot; bit (5), three Johnson counter-coded &quot;quinary&quot; bits and one parity check bit.

<text>The Apprentice is a reality talent game show franchise that originally aired in 2004 in the United States.

Created by American-based British producer Mark Burnett, the show depicts contestants from around the country with various professional backgrounds in an elimination-style competition to become an apprentice to a businessman. The show was originally hosted by real estate magnate and future president Donald Trump, who was also one of the producers. Burnett developed the show after previous success in bringing &quot;Survivor&quot; to the United States. Since its premiere, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; has spawned several licensed international versions as well as unlicensed imitations.

==Format==
The following description of the show is based primarily on the American version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, though the general format applies to all other versions. 

Each season begins with a new group of contestants vying to earn a place in one of the organizations run by the host. The contestants (who are referred to as &quot;candidates&quot;) have come from business backgrounds in various enterprises, including real estate, accounting, restaurant management, management consulting, sales and marketing.

The candidates are divided into two teams or &quot;corporations&quot; within the show. These corporations select a name they are subsequently referred to through the rest of the show. Each week, the teams are assigned a task and required to select one of their members to lead the team as &quot;project manager&quot;, who is to take responsibility for organizing the team and making executive decisions. Tasks are generally business oriented and tend to highlight one of several business skills. Tasks most commonly revolve around sales (selling the most items or earning the most money) and marketing (producing a specific marketing material or campaign that is judged by a company&#x27;s executives). During the tasks, the teams are usually visited by one of the host&#x27;s &quot;advisors&quot; for that week. Tasks typically last for one or two days. In the global &quot;ONE Championship&quot; edition, an additional physical task is added before a business task, with candidates partaking physical challenges for various rewards and advantages, though usually meant to train and showcase candidates of physical prowess.

Business tasks followed with boardroom meetings. At the end of each task, the remaining candidates on both teams gather in the boardroom to be briefed on the task by the host and the advisors. Team members are asked about how the task went and whether there were any strong or weak players. Teams are sometimes asked to comment on materials or products produced by the opposing team. The host or advisors would usually provide future advice to candidates on improvement or address ant criticisms, followed by the results for the task; members from the winning team are immune from elimination and depending on season, are being permitted to view the next stage of the boardroom on the TV in their suite.

Members from the losing team remains in/returns to the boardroom and are confronted with their loss from the hosts, who are then interrogated as to the reasons for their loss and which players contributed to it or failed at the task. The project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting, though in some cases the host can overrule their decision to choose candidates instead if they see fit. These selected teammates then step out of the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with the advisors.

Upon returning to the boardroom for the final stage, the host and the advisors continue interrogating the remaining players on their defeats. The project manager is sometimes further interrogated about their choice of teammates to bring back into the boardroom, and explain their reasons of their choices and any pleas to stay on the competition if required. Usually, the host would eliminate any candidates who have performed poorly in both the task and overall consistency from the show (via its iconic catchphrase of &quot;you&#x27;re fired&quot; or any words or phrases that are synonymous herein) and has broad discretion to eliminate candidates outside of this usual process, including firing multiple candidates at a time and/or firing someone on the spot prior to the final boardroom; occasionally, the host may even cancel any elimination if the candidates performed with satisfactory standards. The eliminated candidates are shown leaving the boardroom with their luggage and entering a taxi cab, during which they are given time to recount on their elimination that is shown over the episode&#x27;s credits; the host would usually explain any reasons for eliminating the candidate before or after their firing if required. 

Numerous weeks (in the case where a &quot;corporation&quot; had uneven number of candidates) may result in a corporate restructuring by reassigning candidates to a different team, which usually determined by the host itself, though in some cases candidates can choose who they want to be transferred with. When no more than five candidates remain (typically three or four depending on season), these candidates go through a final phase of the competition where they would go through a series of small business tasks, unified as a team to work as a whole (as first seen in ONE Championship), and/or faced an interview with the executives, based on various companies interview the finalists and report their assessments to the host. Based on the interviews and tasks, along with the candidate&#x27;s track record, if applicable, the host will select two candidates to compete in the finale.

The final two candidates are then each assigned a different final task. Each is given a support team of previously eliminated candidates. Final tasks generally require the finalists to organize (to various degrees) an event such as a party or a fundraiser which has multiple planning elements. Another boardroom takes place and the candidates had to plead on their case on why they deserve to win. Ultimately, one candidate will be &quot;hired&quot; (named the winner) as the titular &quot;Apprentice&quot;, with the winner offered a starting contract (usually a year valued at $250,000) to work with the company.

==Original series==
The American version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; is the first version of the reality game show franchise. It was broadcast on NBC and billed as &quot;The Ultimate Job Interview&quot;. The show depicted a group of 15–18 businessmen and -women competing in an elimination competition for a one-year, US$250,000 contract to run one of real estate magnate Donald Trump&#x27;s companies.

The first season aired during the winter and spring of 2004, executive-produced by Mark Burnett, Jay Bienstock, and Trump, who also hosts the show. The show led Trump to become known for his fateful catch phrase &quot;You&#x27;re Fired!&quot;. The theme song for the show is &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; by The O&#x27;Jays, and other themes and underscore are written by composers Mark T. Williams and Jeff Lippencott of Ah2 Music.

During Donald Trump&#x27;s reign over the show, the contestants lived communally in a suite at Trump Tower in New York City and the boardroom showdown was with Trump and two of his associates (usually Carolyn Kepcher, former chief operating officer (COO) and general manager for the Trump National Golf Club, and George H. Ross, Executive Vice President and Senior Counsel, The Trump Organization). Season 6 saw the show move to Los Angeles. On May 14, 2007, NBC announced the show was not on its fall 2007 schedule, but that a decision to cancel or renew it had not yet been made. On May 19, 2007, Trump announced that he was &quot;moving on from &quot;The Apprentice&quot;&quot;, effectively ending the series. However, on May 22, NBC responded by saying Trump still had a year left on his contract. On July 16, 2007, NBC renewed the show with a sequel series, &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, The sequel debuted with season seven on January 3, 2008. The eighth season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; premiered on NBC on March 1, 2009. Similar to the previous season, all contestants were celebrities playing for charity. The ninth season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; began in Spring 2010, also featuring a celebrity cast.

In June 2015, Trump announced his campaign to run for President of the United States of America. He was accused of making several racially-charged remarks during his speech and was subsequently fired by NBC. Actor and former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Trump, beginning in Season 15.

==International versions==
There are currently over 70 winners of the format, the first being Bill Rancic of the United States.

====South Africa====
The South African version that aired on SABC3 is hosted by Tokyo Sexwale, a mining magnate. During the live finale 22 September, Sexwale hired the final two—Zanele Batyashe, 24, and Khomotso Choma, 34, which not only elicited anger from viewers, but also resulted in complaints across the country after the announcement was made. Later, US Series 4 winner Randal Pinkett recommended Trump not do so in the finale (See US Series 4) after he pondered hiring the runner-up, something which may have been inspired by this incident. The catch phrase Tokyo Sexwale used was &quot;You&#x27;re dismissed!&quot;

===Asia===
====Pan-Asian====

The Asian version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; was aired on AXN Asia. Tony Fernandes, the entrepreneur behind the successful AirAsia airline carrier, was the host for this version.

====Russia====

The catchphrase is , or &quot;You are fired&quot;.

&quot;Candidate&quot; failed to attract a Russian audience. British TV producer Peter Pomerantsev credited Russian culture with its failure, writing, &quot;The usual way to get a job in Russia is not by impressing at an interview, but by what is known as &quot;blat&quot; – &#x27;connections&#x27;. Russian society isn&#x27;t much interested in the hard-working, brilliant young business mind.&quot;

====Turkey====
Turkey&#x27;s version is hosted by one of that country&#x27;s most successful businessmen, Tuncay Özilhan the CEO of Anadolu Group. The show is titled (&quot;The Apprentice&quot;), and the catchphrase is (&quot;I do not want to work with you&quot;). Ahmet Isik was the winner of the first season.

Entrepreneur and politician Bruno Bonnell is the host. On 17 September 2015, the channel announced the deprogramming of the show after only two episodes aired, due to a lack of viewers. The entire season was, however, made available online.

====Germany====
In September 2004, German TV station ProSieben aired an adaptation of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; called &quot;Hire or Fire&quot;, produced by and starring John de Mol. The show was cancelled after the first episode due to low ratings.

From October 2004 to January 2005, German TV station RTL aired an adaptation of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; called &quot;Big Boss&quot;. The show was hosted by former soccer manager Reiner Calmund, and the winner received a prize of €250,000 ($300,000 at the time) for starting her or his own business. One candidate was eliminated at the end of each episode with the phrase (you are excused). The show scored fair to poor ratings and was not renewed for another season.

====Ireland====
An Irish version began in September 2008 on Irish broadcaster TV3. It is hosted by business mogul Bill Cullen, who has made his fortune from the motor industry, and is the owner of Renault Ireland; his company makes over €350 million annually. At the time of the announcement that Cullen would front the show, many were skeptical, saying that Cullen would not be scary or tough enough on the contestants, but many have praised his handling of the show since then. The show is based in Dublin, and the winner receives a 12-month contract working alongside Cullen with a package worth €100,000. Although TV3 have made home-produced versions of international programmes before such as &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;The Apprentice&quot; is without doubt proving to be the most successful for the broadcaster, attracting large viewing figures, and receiving much attention from the media in Ireland. The show&#x27;s catchphrase is &quot;You are fired!&quot;

The show&#x27;s first scandal involved Joanna Murphy, one of the contestants. She had been in contact with her family between takes, even though it is forbidden according to the rules of the show. She used the project manager laptop to communicate with her husband, and received his help in the hope of winning a task. Her team had to collect electrical equipment, and this would be recycled. The team with the most equipment won the task. It was exposed that Joanna&#x27;s family and friends were actually raiding a recycling centre near Naas Racecourse, and bringing it to her teams &#x27;special recycling centre&#x27; down the road. Each vehicle was driven by her friends and family, but viewers and cameramen were unaware of this. Some vehicles even came in more than once, but changed number registration plates, so as not to be caught by the cameras. This stunt was exposed while in the boardroom; Cullen fired her as a result. The story was in nearly all of the national newspapers in Ireland, and was the first major scandal to hit the show. RTÉ, TV3&#x27;s biggest rivals, have considered the show&#x27;s success, and produced their own version of &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot; as a result, in the hope of also attracting Irish viewers. The Irish &quot;Apprentice&quot; ended on , with Brenda Shanahan winning in the end, after collecting the most money for her charity, and winning 10 out of 11 tasks in the series. Brenda then started working for Bill, as his apprentice.
The success of the first series has led to a second series being produced, which aired on TV3 in 2009. The winner of the 2009 series was Steve Rayner. He won the show despite admitting on the show that he is a recovering alcoholic and gambler.

====Italy====
In 2012 and 2013, Sky Italia aired first on Cielo and then on Sky Uno, two seasons of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, with Flavio Briatore as main host.

====The Netherlands====
In 2005, high-profile lawyer Bram Moszkowicz offered a highly paid position (&quot;the new Moszkowicz&quot;) in his law firm in AVRO&#x27;s show . The show focused much on the character of Moszkowicz, a flamboyant man known for defending a number of very unpopular figures, most notably Desi Bouterse. Eventually Nienke Hoogervorst won out.

In 2011, a new Dutch adaptation of The Apprentice aired, called , closely following the BBC format. This time, the series centered around Dutch entrepreneur Aad Ouborg, known mostly for creating and managing the Princess Household Appliances brand. The phrase used by Ouborg to fire contestants is , which translates as &quot;I&#x27;m not going into business with you&quot;. Key scenes were filmed in Rotterdam, although the Boardroom scenes take place in a theatre in the city of Breda, which is the city where Ouborg&#x27;s HQ.

====Norway====
Produced for network TVNORGE, this was notable for being the first &quot;Apprentice&quot; spinoff in Europe. It is also notable for having the first female host—hairdressing mogul Inger Ellen Nicolaisen hosted the first season of the Norwegian version. The show is titled (&quot;The Candidate&quot;), and the catchphrase is (&quot;you&#x27;re fired&quot;).

====Spain====
The Spanish version of the show, called , premiered in September 2009 on La Sexta. It was hosted by advertising mogul Lluís Bassat.

====Switzerland====
Swiss publishing mogul Jürg Marquard hosts the show, which first aired in April 2005 on SF1. The show is titled (Dream Job), and the catchphrase is (&quot;You are out&quot;). Martin was ultimately hired at the end of the first season.

====United Kingdom====

Alan Sugar, founder of electronics company Amstrad, is the boss on &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in the United Kingdom. He ranks 84th on The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2007 with an estimated worth of around £973m. His catchphrase is &quot;You&#x27;re fired&quot;. Like the US version, the show also has a narrator, Mark Halliley. It has a very different visual and musical style to the US series, and in keeping with BBC guidelines, features no product placement. In later series, Lord Sugar offers the winner an investment, rather than direct employment.

The show started on 16 February 2005 on BBC Two, with the final episode of the first series shown on 4 May 2005. Tim Campbell, a former transport manager for the London Underground, was ultimately hired and as a result, landed a position at Amstrad with an introductory contract of 1 year with a salary exceeding £100,000. Saira Khan was fired on the series finale but has used the show to help launch a media career, including a regular column on the BBC &quot;Apprentice&quot; website and presenter of the enterprise show &quot;Beat the Boss&quot; on CBBC. James Max, a semi-finalist of the show, presents the daily Business Update on Talksport alongside Ian Wright and Adrian Durham he also covers for non-sports presenters on a regular basis. He presents two weekly shows on LBC 97.3 Radio on Saturday and Sunday evenings.

A second series of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; UK began on Wednesday 22 February 2006, with the winner being Michelle Dewberry, chosen over Ruth Badger.

Series three of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; UK began on Wednesday 28 March 2007, &#x27;promoted&#x27; to the more mainstream BBC One channel because of the series&#x27; increasing popularity. The winner was Simon Ambrose who was chosen over Kristina Grimes.

Series four of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; UK began on Wednesday 26 March 2008 on BBC One and ran for twelve weekly episodes. A record 20,000 applications were received. The winner of the 2008 series was Lee McQueen, having beaten Claire Young, Helene Speight and Alex Wotherspoon in the final, which featured four candidates instead of the usual two. The series peaked at 9.7 million viewers during the last episode, an unprecedented figure for the series.

A spin-off show, &quot;The Apprentice: You&#x27;re Fired!&quot;, is shown on BBC Two straight after the BBC One broadcast. The 30-minute programme has a studio audience and interview with the fired apprentice, and Lord Sugar usually appears in the final episode of each series.

The RTL Group holds international licence rights for the show worldwide, and the show is produced by RTL&#x27;s Talkback Thames. The UK opening theme is &quot;Dance of the Knights&quot; from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, with the boardroom music provided by UK artist Dru Masters.

The BBC has also screened series 1–5 of the US version (as of winter 2010), being broadcast some considerable time after the original US airing, and in the graveyard slot (11:00 pm onwards).

The television show inspired recreation of the show in form of competitions amongst student enterprise community and in 2013 has launched as a joint event called National Student Apprentice. A number of university societies organised local &#x27;Apprentice Competitions&#x27;.

In 2011, the 7th series was broadcast, with one major difference: the candidates would be competing for a £250,000 investment into their business for a 50% equity stake from Lord Sugar. In previous years, the prize was a six-figure job at one of Lord Sugar&#x27;s companies. It is widely viewed as the reason that the show has continued to air whilst all other international versions have fallen away.

<doc id="457815" wikidata="Q199862" url="?curid=457815" title="Coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>The coat of arms of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was adopted in 1998, replacing the previous design that had been in use since 1992 when Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence. It follows the design of the national flag. The three-pointed shield is used to symbolize the three major ethnic groups of Bosnia, as well as allude to the shape of the country.

==Historic arms==
One of the early representations of coats of arms attributed to Bosnia come from the Fojnica Armorial, which was completed in 17th century. The Fojnica arms are shown upon a gold shield, two black ragged staffs are crossed in saltire with two Moor&#x27;s heads surmounting the upper portion of each staff. Overall is a red escutcheon that was charged with an eight-pointed star and crescent. In the past centuries, European sources have attributed arms to Bosnia that were close or full analogue to this depiction.
The coat of arms of the Kings of Bosnia, who ruled from 1377 until 1463 over the area that is present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia, consisted of a blue shield with six golden lilies displayed around a white bend, all within a gold bordure; the golden lily is the &quot;Lilium bosniacum&quot;, which is a native lily to the area. The crest is a plume of peacock feathers that sit within a coronet of lilies. The House of Kotromanić reigned until 1463 when the Ottomans conquered the region, ceasing then the use of the royal coat of arms in Bosnia. The heraldic display of the kings would later be the basis for the arms adopted by the republic in 1992. There are ancient artifacts that suggest that the &quot;Lilium bosniacum&quot; has been used as a symbol for Bosnia since the 7th century.

After Herzegovina and Bosnia were occupied by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1878, both condominia received arms from the Empire. The heraldic achievement of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić served as inspiration, who was a fifteenth-century nobleman that ruled over the region as Grand Duke of Bosnia and Herzeg of Split. His armorial bearings displayed both a red armoured arm brandishing a sword and a red lion rampant upon a white shield, with two red bars running across the chief. Herzegovina would be given a red shield with a bare arm holding a broken lance for its coat of arms in this same fashion. The coat of arms of Bosnia would be gold with a red armoured arm issuing out of clouds, brandishing a sword. Though both condominia fell under the crown of Hungary, only Bosnia would be included in the greater arms of the Hungarian Kings.

In the nineteenth century, the nationalist movement that had risen against both the former Ottoman rule and contemporary Austro-Hungarian occupation temporarily revived the arms from the Fojnica armorial.
==Communist era==
The emblem, along with the flag, of the socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted on 31 December 1946. The description of the emblem was similar to the other Yugoslav republics. The device had two crossing stems of wheat in front of the silhouette of the town of Jajce, with two factory chimneys out of which there is smoke. Around the decorative branches and wheat, there is a red track that spirals around. At the top of the emblem is a red star with a golden frame. The red star symbolizes the socialism and communism of Yugoslavia at the time.

The device represents the industry Bosnia and Herzegovina had at the time. The factory chimneys show the industry of several important Bosnian, then Yugoslav, towns and their vital influence towards the economy. All of the Yugoslav republics had similar emblems, but Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only that did not portray nationalistic symbols, representing its multiethnic composition.

The national emblem of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was exactly the same as was the previous device of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and defined in its Constitution. This was the first emblem ever in the history of both the regions of Herzegovina and Bosnia that was specific to the entire modern country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Modern arms==

The coat of arms of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted on 4 May 1992 and is aesthetically similar to that of the Kotromanić dynasty. It had a blue background divided by a diagonal white line (called &quot;bendlet&quot; or &quot;riband&quot; in heraldry). The diagonal white line is supposed to symbolize the sword of Tvrtko and his might as a ruler. The coat of arms was designed in a hurry, right at the beginning of the Bosnian War, which lasted for three years. At the end of the war, there came uproar from the Bosnian Serbs arguing that the coat of arms solely represented Bosniaks. The international community, represented in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, was the instrument to solve the controversy. In early 1998, a commission for the flag change was created and the same year the current coat of arms was adopted in order to help alleviate the tensions among the country&#x27;s various ethnicities.

===Official description===
The official description of the coat of arms is as follows:

&quot;The coat of arms of Bosnia and Herzegovina is blue and in shape of a shield with a pointed end. In the upper right corner of the shield is located a yellow triangle. Parallel to the left side of the triangle stretches a row of white five-pointed stars.&quot;

<text>James Challis FRS (12 December 1803 – 3 December 1882) was an English clergyman, physicist and astronomer. Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy and the director of the Cambridge Observatory, he investigated a wide range of physical phenomena though made few lasting contributions outside astronomy. He is best remembered for his missed opportunity to discover the planet Neptune in 1846.

==Early life==
Challis was born in Braintree, Essex where his father, John Challis, was a stonemason. After attending various local schools, he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1825 as Senior Wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizeman. He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1826 and was ordained in 1830. He held the benefice of Papworth Everard, Cambridgeshire from the college until 1852. In 1831 Challis married Sarah Copsey, &quot;née&quot; Chandler, a widow, and consequently resigned his Trinity fellowship. The couple had a son and a daughter.

==Plumian professor==
In 1836, he became director of the Cambridge Observatory and Plumian Professor, holding the latter post until his death. He lectured in all areas of physics. As examiner for the Smith&#x27;s prize, he appraised the early work of G. G. Stokes, Arthur Cayley, John Couch Adams, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), Peter Guthrie Tait and James Clerk Maxwell. For over a decade, in correspondence and publications, Challis repeatedly disagreed with Stokes&#x27;s conclusions from his research.

Challis was referee for Thomson and for Stokes in their respective applications for chairs at the University of Glasgow, and for Maxwell at Aberdeen. He and Thomson together set and examined the Adams prize topic on Saturn&#x27;s rings, won by Maxwell in 1857.

==Cambridge Observatory==
Challis succeeded George Biddell Airy at the observatory and gradually improved the instrumentation and accuracy of observations. He made some early observations of the fracture of comet 3D/Biela into two pieces on 15 January 1846 and re-observed both fragments in 1852. He published over 60 scientific papers recording other observations of comets and asteroids. He invented the meteoroscope (1848) and the transit-reducer (1849). Challis published twelve volumes of &quot;Astronomical Observations Made at the Observatory of Cambridge&quot;.

He and his wife lived at the observatory as genial hosts for 25 years, though Challis once left his wife to guard an intruder while he summoned assistance. Challis eventually resigned the observatory post because of the chronic stress that his inability to keep up with processing new astronomical observations was causing him. His predecessor Airy had taken a more relaxed attitude. He was succeeded by Adams though he maintained his professorship until his death.

==The search for the eighth planet==

In 1846, Airy finally persuaded a skeptical Challis to join in the search for an eighth planet in the Solar System. Adams had predicted the location of such a planet as early as 1844, based on irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Adams failed to promote his prediction successfully and there was little enthusiasm for a systematic search of the heavens until Airy&#x27;s intervention. Challis finally began his, somewhat reluctant, search in July 1846, unaware that Frenchman Urbain Le Verrier had independently made an identical prediction. German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, assisted by Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest, finally confirmed Le Verrier&#x27;s prediction on 23 September. The planet was named &quot;Neptune&quot;. It soon became apparent from Challis&#x27;s notebooks that he had observed Neptune twice, a month earlier, failing to make the identification through lack of diligence and a current star chart.

Challis was full of remorse but blamed his neglect on the pressing business of catching up on the backlog of astronomical observations from the observatory. As he reflected in a letter to Airy of 12 October 1846:

==Physicist==
Challis also worked in hydrodynamics and in optics where he supported the wave theory of light and advanced the theory of a luminiferous ether as a medium for its propagation. However, he rejected the idea that the ether was an elastic solid, insisting that it was a fluid, bringing him into conflict with Airy and Stokes. Driven by Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s somewhat obscure assertion of &quot;a certain most subtle spirit which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies&quot;, Challis was driven to attempt to derive all physical phenomena from a model of inert spherical atoms embedded in an elastic fluid ether, an enterprise described as an attempt at a &quot;Victorian unified field theory&quot;. His work included a mechanical explanation of gravitation. His ideas won few supporters.

==Theological views==
Challis took issue with Charles Wycliffe Goodwin&#x27;s views on Genesis expressed in &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; (1860). Challis saw Genesis as an &quot;antecedent plan&quot; for creation, rather than a literal chronology, and argued that the biblical account could be reconciled with the geological record. He went on to interpret the word &quot;law&quot;, as used in a spiritual sense by Saint Paul, in the sense of scientific law.

==Assessment==
Challis published 225 papers in mathematics, physics and astronomy. He was re-elected fellow of Trinity in 1870. He died in Cambridge and was buried beside his wife in Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge. His wealth when he died was £781 ().

Despite the embarrassment over Neptune, Challis did make genuine contributions to astronomy. His blend of theology and science was in the spirit of Stokes, and his search for a unified theory akin to the endeavours of Thomson and Maxwell. However, despite his tenacity in advocating his physical and theological theories, they had little impact, and in fact Richard Carrington credited him as his professor with inspiring his decision to pursue astronomy rather than become a clergyman. Olin J. Eggen claimed that &quot;At a later time, or under less amiable circumstances, he would have been branded a charlatan. He would now be as forgotten as his peculiar ideas had not the events surrounding the discovery of Neptune in 1845 given him a genuine opportunity for scientific immortality. But he fumbled it.&quot;

<doc id="457817" wikidata="Q339266" url="?curid=457817" title="Accolade, Inc.">
<text>Accolade, Inc. (later Infogrames North America, Inc.) was an American video game developer and publisher based in San Jose, California. The company was founded as Accolade in 1984 by Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead, who had previously co-founded Activision in 1979. The company became known for numerous sports game series, including &quot;HardBall!, Jack Nicklaus&quot; and &quot;Test Drive&quot;.

By the early 1990s, Accolade saw critical acclaim for &quot;Star Control&quot; (1990), as well as strong sales for &quot;Bubsy&quot; (1993). However, Sega sued Accolade for creating unauthorized Sega Genesis games by reverse-engineering the console&#x27;s boot-protection. Accolade won the case on appeal, overturning an injunction from the lower court that had interrupted their sales and development. The founders soon left the company. The new chief executive, Peter Harris, attracted new investment from Time Warner. The following year, Accolade president Jim Barrett replaced him. He focused on existing franchises hoping to secure the company&#x27;s future. However, technical issues undermined the release of &quot;Bubsy 3D&quot; (1996), and &quot;Jack Nicklaus 5&quot; (1997) was considered a commercial disappointment, despite positive reviews. The company still had modest successes with games such as &quot;Star Control 3&quot; (1996) and (1996), and saw strong sales for both &quot;Test Drive 4&quot; (1997) and &quot;Test Drive: Off Road&quot; (1997).

The French firm Infogrames purchased Accolade in 1999 as part of its strategy to become more global, transforming it into a subsidiary called Infogrames North America. By 2000, it was consolidated into Infogrames, Inc. (the former GT Interactive), marking the end of Infogrames North America as a separate company and what remained of Accolade as an entity. In the years that followed, Infogrames purchased the Atari trademark and rebranded as Atari SA, before declaring bankruptcy in 2013 resulting in the sell-off of some assets. The Accolade assets were purchased by game publisher Tommo, who later resold them to Hong Kong–based holding company Billionsoft as part of a strategy to revive several classic games, however the assets that Billionsoft held were re-acquired by Atari SA in April 2023.

== History ==
=== Origins (1984–1985) ===

Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead founded Accolade in 1984; both had worked previously at Atari. They believed Atari undervalued its programmers, leading them to leave the company and start Activision in October 1979. Activision became the first developer to operate independently of the console companies and one of the few firms to survive the video game crash of 1983, though they still posted a US$18 million loss the following year. After a large devaluation of their stock, Miller and Whitehead left Activision to form Accolade.

Accolade was founded and operated in San Jose, California. Whitehead and Miller focused their game development on home computers such as the Commodore 64, exploring a market for which Activision had not yet created games. This allowed Accolade to take advantage of the new technology of floppy disks, which were less expensive to manufacture than cartridges and did not require licensing fees to be paid to the console companies. Whitehead and Miller were unable to attract investment so soon after the game market had crashed, leading them to self-fund their new venture. The pair hired chief executive officer Tom Frisina to handle managerial duties, and they each began to work on their own launch titles. They also hired Mimi Doggett, a veteran visual artist from Atari, to compete with other developers on graphical detail.Their goal for their first titles was to think beyond the gaming medium and draw inspiration from other forms of popular entertainment, including television and film. Miller&#x27;s first project was &quot;Law of the West&quot; (1985), a &quot;High Noon–&quot;inspired western that mixed gunfights with adventure game elements, pioneering a choice of dialogue options that later became common in games. At the same time, Whitehead had seen success previously with the sports games &quot;Home Run&quot; and &quot;Football&quot; (1979) on the Atari 2600, which led to the baseball game &quot;HardBall!&quot; (1985) as his Accolade debut. The game was the first to emulate the &quot;behind the pitcher&quot; viewpoint seen on television, and introduced new features such as player data and coach mode. It became one of Accolade&#x27;s bestselling games on the Commodore 64 and was considered one of the biggest commercial successes of its time.

=== Success in sports and publishing (1985–1990) ===
Accolade aimed to balance its roles as a developer and publisher. Miller recalled, &quot;we tried to have about half of the original titles done by employee developers and half by external development groups&quot;. Several outside groups would port the games to other hardware so that Accolade could focus their staff on creating original titles. One of their first third-party games was &quot;&quot; (1985) by FTL Games. Accolade recruited Mike Lorenzen from Activision to create the science fiction game &quot;Psi 5 Trading Company&quot; (1985), drawing inspiration from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Other early successes included the boxing game &quot;Fight Night&quot; (1985), developed by Canadian developer Artech Digital Entertainment. Artech also created the combat flight simulation game &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1984), inspired by the eponymous classic war film. This led them to create another combat flight simulator called &quot;Ace of Aces&quot; (1986) with a development cost of US$80,000, which sold 500,000 units and became one of Accolade&#x27;s most successful games. Accolade partnered with other publishing companies such as U.S. Gold to distribute their games in Europe, before later switching to Electronic Arts (EA).
Between 1985 and 1986, Accolade&#x27;s revenues grew from US$1.5 million to US$5 million, thanks to titles like &quot;Ace of Aces&quot;, a golf game called &quot;Mean 18&quot; (1986), and a driving game called &quot;Test Drive&quot; (1987). Distinctive Software, another Canadian developer who had previously ported Accolade&#x27;s games to other computer systems, created &quot;Test Drive&quot;. The game pioneered the concept of driving exotic cars at the risk of being chased by the police and led to a series that would become one of Accolade&#x27;s most successful. In 1987, Frisina left as CEO to found his own game company, Three-Sixty Pacific. Miller briefly took over as CEO until Allan Epstein was hired to lead the company in May 1988.

Accolade continued to enjoy a strong reputation as a publisher and developer of sports games. Their baseball game &quot;Hardball!&quot; became one of their most popular series, with later entries created by outside developers such as Chris Taylor. This allowed Whitehead time to develop original titles like the American football game &quot;4th &amp; Inches&quot; (1987), while the company published Steve Cartwright&#x27;s basketball game &quot;Fast Break&quot; (1989), and Artech&#x27;s tennis game, &quot;Serve &amp; Volley&quot; (1988). Many of these sports titles became commercially and critically successful, with Accolade&#x27;s biggest successes coming from golf. Their first golf game &quot;Mean 18&quot;, developed by Rex Bradford, became the &quot;Jack Nicklaus&quot; series. These games pioneered the &quot;three-click&quot; system seen in most golf games, where the player times their button presses to control their backswing, downswing and follow-through. Accolade outsold other golf game publishers thanks to the Jack Nicklaus license. By 1990, Accolade released &quot;Test Drive III: The Passion&quot; (1990), developing the game in-house as the first game in the series with three-dimensional (3D) polygon graphics.

At the turn of the decade, Accolade tried to diversify outside sports games and into other game genres. Hoping to compete with leading adventure game publishers LucasArts and Sierra, Accolade created their own adventure game engine. Infocom alumni Mike Berlyn created the adventure game &quot;Altered Destiny&quot; (1990), while Cartwright, an Activision veteran, created the &quot;Les Manley&quot; series. Accolade also published the &quot;Star Control&quot; series of games, created by Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford. Released in 1990 and 1992 respectively, both games received awards, and journalists repeatedly ranked them among the best games of all time. Still, Accolade remained focused on their successful sports games, and accidentally placed a sticker on the box of &quot;Star Control&quot; &quot;II&quot; calling it the &quot;Best Sports Game&quot; of 1992.

=== Console and legal challenges (1990–1993) ===
By the early 1990s, Accolade observed the rise of a new generation of gaming consoles, and sought to shift towards a market they had previously abandoned. In 1990, Accolade CEO Allan Epstein expressed his opinion that the growing console market was both an opportunity and a challenge, since both the technology and audience differed from that of the computer.

The company released several games for the Sega Genesis by reverse engineering the console&#x27;s boot-protection. Sega sued Accolade for doing this without their authorization, winning an initial injunction that forced Accolade to stop selling any games for the Genesis. Accolade, however, won on appeal, setting a precedent that became cited in numerous cases about reverse engineering. Accolade later reached an out-of-court settlement with Sega that allowed Accolade to continue building their own Genesis cartridges as an official licensee. One condition of the settlement was that Accolade would develop several games exclusive to Sega consoles, as a way for Sega to maintain an advantage over their rivals.

As Accolade rushed to develop the games promised to Sega, the company saw the departure of co-founder Bob Whitehead, who felt their games were slipping in quality and that the game industry had become tiresome. CEO Allan Epstein also left the company, and Alan Miller once again became the chief executive. By 1993, they had published the commercially successful platform game &quot;Bubsy&quot; (1993), created by Berlyn. Accolade marketed the game to compete with the most recognizable console mascots of the time, namely Nintendo&#x27;s Mario and Sega&#x27;s Sonic the Hedgehog, and Accolade&#x27;s sales benefited from publishing &quot;Bubsy&quot; for both consoles. Accolade also tried to replicate its advantageous golf license in other sports, including their association football game &quot;Pelé!&quot; (1993) and American football game &quot;Mike Ditka Power Football&quot; (1991).

The lawsuit with Sega continued to have serious long-term effects for Accolade. Despite succeeding at the Court of Appeals and negotiating an agreement with Sega, the lower court&#x27;s injunction had interrupted Accolade&#x27;s sales and development for several months in 1992. Alan Miller estimated that &quot;the commercial damage associated with this injunction ultimately proved to be somewhere around US$15 to US$25 million&quot;, leading the company to report major losses in 1993.

=== New leadership (1994–1999) ===
Accolade hired a new CEO in 1994, recruiting the former head of FAO Schwarz, Peter Harris, to help them attract much-needed investment. Alan Miller initially stayed on as chairman and head of product development, but quit the company later in the year to work in medical software, marking the end of the founders&#x27; influence. Harris led the company&#x27;s efforts to build a new management team and secure new financing from Time Warner, before leaving to become CEO of the San Francisco 49ers in 1995.

Accolade president Jim Barnett became the new CEO and largely focused their strategy on extending existing franchises. Sales improved under his management. The company expanded the &quot;Bubsy&quot; series with multiple titles released on several consoles, including Sega, Nintendo, Atari Jaguar, and eventually PlayStation. However, the second and third installments of the &quot;Bubsy&quot; series were commercial disappointments, leading Accolade to ask series creator Mike Berlyn to return as the next game&#x27;s producer. Berlyn worked on &quot;Bubsy 3D&quot; (1996) with a new team, but 3D technology was challenging for the developers. When they requested more time to polish the game, Accolade insisted on keeping the scheduled release date. After its release, the game&#x27;s technical issues hurt the reputation of the &quot;Bubsy&quot; series, as well as that of Accolade as a company.

Accolade asked Ford and Reiche to make a third &quot;Star Control&quot; game at the same budget as &quot;Star Control II&quot;, which they turned down to pursue other projects. Instead, the publisher licensed Reiche and Ford&#x27;s copyrighted character designs to make &quot;Star Control 3&quot; (1996) with a different development team. However, the third game in the series did not live up to Accolade&#x27;s hopes for the franchise, with reviewers noting the series&#x27; change in developer, tone and quality. Still, &quot;Star Control 3&quot; was considered a moderate commercial success for Accolade as a publisher, as was the release of (1996), both released in 1996. Accolade saw &quot;Deadlock&quot; as the start of a potential comeback. Moreover, &quot;Test Drive 4&quot; (1997) and &quot;Test Drive: Off Road&quot; (1997) sold well for both the PC and PlayStation platforms, with sales of more than 850,000 and 500,000 copies respectively, making it the top-selling racing series at the time. &quot;Jack Nicklaus 5&quot; (1997) was also a critical success, but was a commercial disappointment.

Despite Barnett&#x27;s efforts, Accolade was unable to replicate the success of their earlier releases. With the company in need of a broad commercial success, EA invested in Accolade in 1997 and took over their distribution. The success of &quot;Test Drive: Off Road&quot; led the company to focus more heavily on consoles, which meant abandoning a massively multiplayer online game project. Accolade previewed several of their 1998 titles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, with entries in major series such as &quot;HardBall 6&quot; (1998), &quot;Test Drive 5&quot; (1998), &quot;Test Drive: Off Road 2&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Control 4&quot;, as well as two original titles: &quot;Redline&quot; (1999) and &quot;Big Air Snowboarding&quot; (1999). By the end of the year, Accolade released their sequels to &quot;Test Drive&quot; as scheduled, while canceling their plans for a fourth &quot;Star Control&quot; game. Pitbull Syndicate completed the development of &quot;Big Air&quot;, which was released at the start of 1999 after a delay. Development was also completed on &quot;Redline&quot;, and Accolade published the driving-and-shooting game in April 1999.

=== Acquisition and end (1999–2000) ===
French publisher Infogrames purchased Accolade in April 1999, as part of the European company&#x27;s strategy to gain a distribution network in North America. Infogrames paid US$50 million to acquire Accolade&#x27;s workforce of 145 employees, their sports franchises such as &quot;Test Drive&quot; and &quot;Hardball&quot;, and Accolade&#x27;s licensing deals with brands such as Major League Baseball. They retained CEO Jim Barnett to lead a new subsidiary company that became Infogrames North America, combining Accolade&#x27;s workforce with an Infogrames office of 29 employees. As a result, major franchises such as &quot;Test Drive 6&quot; (1999) and &quot;Test Drive: Off-Road 3&quot; (1999) were published under the &quot;Infogrames North America&quot; name starting in 1999. What followed was a series of acquisitions and consolidations, when Infogrames purchased GT Interactive and renamed it Infogrames, Inc. Infogrames later merged Infogrames North America into a subsidiary of Infogrames, Inc. The merger was completed on October 3, 2000.

Later, Infogrames acquired the Atari brand from Hasbro Interactive in 2001, and through the decade slowly re-branded their properties under Atari SA. Atari/Infogrames declared bankruptcy in 2013, and game publisher Tommo purchased the &quot;Accolade&quot; trademark and several related assets. In June 2017, Hong Kong–based holding company Billionsoft announced its acquisition of the &quot;Accolade&quot; trademark, and together with developer Black Forest Games and publisher Tommo, announced it would develop new entries for several Accolade franchises, starting with the &quot;Bubsy&quot; series. In April 2023, it was announced that Atari had re-acquired over 100 different titles from Billionsoft, including select Accolade titles as well as the company&#x27;s trademark and brand. Using this trademark, Atari announced &quot;Accolade Sports Collection&quot;, a compilation of Accolade sports titles developed by QUByte Interactive, in January 2025.

<doc id="457820" wikidata="Q2916792" url="?curid=457820" title="Cosmo Kramer">
<text>Cosmo Kramer, usually referred to simply by his surname, is a fictional character in the American television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–1998) played by Michael Richards.

The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David&#x27;s ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the neighbor of the series&#x27; main character, Jerry Seinfeld, and is friends with George Costanza and Elaine Benes. Of the series&#x27; four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks.

His character is that of a lovable rogue with his trademarks being his upright hairstyle, vintage wardrobe, impractical business ideas and eccentric personality, whose combination led Elaine to characterize him as a &quot;hipster &quot;. He is obsessed with high-quality fresh fruit and occasionally smokes pipes and Cuban cigars. He is also known for his habit of bursting through Jerry&#x27;s apartment door without knocking, and eating Jerry&#x27;s food. His antics include frequent pratfalls and a penchant for noisy, percussive outbursts to indicate skepticism, agreement, irritation and a variety of other feelings. He has been described as &quot;an extraordinary cross between Eraserhead and Herman Munster&quot;.

Kramer appears in all but two episodes: &quot;The Chinese Restaurant&quot; and &quot;The Pen&quot;, in the second and third seasons, respectively. For the pilot episode, Kramer was named &quot;Kessler&quot; to avoid potential legal issues; Kenny Kramer later authorized the use of his name.

==Background and family==
In &quot;The Trip&quot;, Kramer says a man in a park exposed himself to him when he was a young boy. In &quot;The Big Salad&quot; Kramer reveals to Jerry that he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed every night by 9:00PM.

Kramer never completed high school; in &quot;The Barber&quot;, it is revealed that Kramer has a GED.

Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mother, Babs Kramer, who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant. Unlike George and Jerry, Kramer&#x27;s character does not have a well-developed network of family members shown in the sitcom. He is the only main character on the show whose father never makes an appearance; in &quot;The Chinese Woman&quot;, Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family, implying that his father had died. He also mentions in &quot;The Lip Reader&quot; that he has or had a deaf cousin, from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language. Like the other main characters, he has no children.

In &quot;The Strong Box&quot;, it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army, although info about this time is &quot;classified&quot;. In &quot;The Implant&quot;, he says he lived in Los Angeles for three months.

==Personality==

Though eccentric, Kramer is generally caring, friendly and kind-hearted; he often goes out of his way to help total strangers, and tries to get his friends to also help others and to do the right thing even when they do not want to. He is confident in his own unique way of doing things, yet he can be neurotic and highly-strung. His quirkiness, strange body movements and frequent gibberish mutterings have become his trademark. He is also well liked by Jerry&#x27;s parents, whom he calls once a week, as if he were their own son.

Kramer was originally envisioned as a recluse who never left his apartment except to visit Jerry. This was the original reason behind why Kramer helps himself to Jerry&#x27;s possessions and food without any pushback and also why he is absent from the season two episode &quot;The Chinese Restaurant&quot;, which takes place entirely outside of the building. However, in season three Kramer starts to join Jerry, Elaine, and George in various scenes outside of the building. As the series progresses, Kramer completely loses any hints of reclusiveness and becomes one of the most extroverted characters on the show.

Kramer also gets his friends directly into trouble by talking them into unwise or even illegal actions such as parking in a disabled parking space (&quot;The Handicap Spot&quot;), urinating in a parking garage (&quot;The Parking Garage&quot;), committing mail fraud (&quot;The Package&quot;) or even hiring an assassin to get rid of a dog (&quot;The Engagement&quot;). Kramer is also known to off his friends, especially Jerry. Kramer regularly enters and uses Jerry&#x27;s apartment without knocking, and often helps himself to Jerry&#x27;s food. Kramer also uses tools/appliances of Jerry&#x27;s, only occasionally with permission, and often returning them in a state of disrepair (if at all).

Kramer is known for his extreme honesty and lack of tact; in &quot;The Nose Job&quot;, he tells George&#x27;s insecure girlfriend that she needs a nose job. In &quot;The Kiss Hello&quot; Elaine tries to take advantage of this personality quirk by inviting Kramer to meet her friend, Wendy, whose hairstyle she feels is outdated. Kramer rarely gets into trouble for his candor, but his friends often do; in &quot;The Cartoon&quot;, Kramer makes comments to Sally Weaver, who then blames Jerry for &quot;ruining her life&quot; as a result.

In general, Kramer excels at persuading Jerry into doing things against his better judgment. Kramer has displayed an almost unbending loyalty toward Jerry, such as in &quot;The Millennium&quot; and &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;, risking the failure of his own plans for Jerry&#x27;s benefit. Kramer also thought nothing of giving Jerry a large amount of his banked blood in &quot;The Blood&quot;. In the same respect, Jerry has helped Kramer out of good will and always seems to forgive and ultimately accept Kramer&#x27;s mooching tendencies. At times, Jerry is entertained by Kramer&#x27;s antics, which may also be a factor in the friendship&#x27;s endurance. However, Kramer is also quick to assume the worst of Jerry, believing him guilty of everything from sabotaging a Miss America contestant (in &quot;The Chaperone&quot;) to having a double life as a neo-Nazi leader (in &quot;The Limo&quot;), and is often oblivious to his sentiments. In &quot;The Serenity Now&quot;, an emotional Jerry declares a near-brotherly love for Kramer, and Kramer is not even prompted to look away from his current activity, merely responding in a rote tone, &quot;I love you, too, buddy.&quot;

He is close friends with Newman; however, like the other main characters, Kramer and Newman frequently get into conflict with each other, most notably in &quot;The Butter Shave&quot;, in which Newman attempts to eat Kramer alive. Their get-rich-quick schemes appear in &quot;The Old Man&quot; and &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;.

One of Kramer&#x27;s friends, Bob Sacamano, is referred to by Kramer on several occasions, yet never makes an onscreen appearance. Sacamano is used as a source for several weird anecdotes, nutty ideas, or inaccurate information. Lomez is another good friend of Kramer&#x27;s who is mentioned, yet never makes an appearance.

Kramer&#x27;s apartment is the subject of numerous radical experiments in interior design. Oftentimes, the &quot;experiments&quot; never happen due to Kramer&#x27;s inherent short-attention span, including his plan to eliminate all furniture and build &quot;levels... like ancient Egypt&quot; in &quot;The Pony Remark&quot;. He reconstructed the set of &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Inside views of Kramer&#x27;s apartment are seldom seen, but it&#x27;s known that he installed hardwood flooring and woodgrain-like wallpaper to, as he explains to Jerry, &quot;give it the feel of a ski lodge.&quot; The apartment is centered around a large hot tub and couch styled after a 1957 Chevy. The apartment is decorated with many small statues of people, all made entirely out of pasta. Kramer has also experimented with his apartment entrance, including reversing his peephole &quot;to prevent an ambush&quot; in &quot;The Reverse Peephole&quot; and installing a screen door alongside plants and wind chimes in &quot;The Serenity Now&quot;.

Kramer enjoys smoking Cuban cigars. In &quot;The Abstinence&quot; he sets up a smoking club in his apartment, which included a regularly-scheduled &quot;pipe night&quot; for those who preferred pipe tobacco to cigars and/or cigarettes. His face gets ruined after so much smoking and he hires Jackie Chiles to sue the cigarette company, but instead gets his image as the Marlboro Man on the Marlboro billboard in Times Square. He hires Cuban cigar rollers in an attempt to make his own Cuban cigars in &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

Kramer&#x27;s conversation sometimes contains onomatopoeia or nonsensical sounds in order to stress an emotional point or describe earlier actions. He sometimes expresses his agreement with a sentiment or suggestion via the word &quot;&quot;. He indicates pleasure with &quot;Oh, Mama!&quot; and frustration or disgust with &quot;Oh... yeah!&quot;

Of the four main characters, Kramer has the fewest on-screen romantic relationships. He has no trouble attracting women, but interactions with them usually begin and end with purely carnal encounters. What few relationships he has are short-lived.

==Development==
===Inspiration===
The character of Kramer was originally based on the real-life Kenny Kramer, a neighbor of co-creator Larry David from New York. However, Michael Richards did not in any way base his performance on the real Kramer, to the point of refusing to meet him. This was later parodied in &quot;The Pilot&quot; when the actor that is cast to play him in Jerry and George&#x27;s sitcom refuses to base the character on the real Cosmo Kramer. At the time of the shooting of the original &quot;Seinfeld&quot; pilot, &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;, Kenny Kramer had not yet given consent to use his name, and so Kramer&#x27;s character was originally known as &quot;Kessler&quot;.

Larry David was hesitant to use Kenny Kramer&#x27;s real name because he suspected that Kramer would take advantage of this. David&#x27;s suspicion turned out to be correct; Kenny Kramer created the &quot;Kramer Reality Tour&quot;, a New York City bus tour that points out actual locations of events or places featured in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. The &quot;Kramer Reality Tour&quot; is itself spoofed on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;. In the episode, when Kramer&#x27;s real-life stories are used by Elaine to pad the biography of J. Peterman she was ghostwriting, Kramer develops a reality bus tour called &quot;The Peterman Reality Tour&quot; and touts himself as &quot;The Real J. Peterman&quot;.

===Given and surnames===
Kramer was known only as &quot;Kramer&quot; during the show&#x27;s first five seasons (from 1990 to 1994). In &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles&quot;, Jerry referred to him as &quot;Kessler&quot;, which was his original name for the show, until it was changed to &quot;Kramer&quot;. However, in the first draft of the script, he was named &quot;Hoffman&quot;. In a flashback in &quot;The Betrayal&quot;, Kramer says that his name is incorrectly listed as &quot;Kessler&quot; in the apartment building. This retcons the pilot&#x27;s use of &quot;Kessler&quot; as the character&#x27;s name.

George finds out his first name of &quot;Cosmo&quot; through an encounter with Kramer&#x27;s long estranged mom, Babs, in &quot;The Switch&quot;. For the most part, characters continued to call him Kramer for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. The name &quot;Cosmo&quot; was suggested by Larry David; he took the name from a boy who lived in the same apartment building as him and Kenny Kramer.

The episode titled &quot;The Bet&quot; would have revealed Kramer&#x27;s first name as &quot;Conrad&quot;, not &quot;Cosmo&quot;, but it was never filmed.

==Employment==
Despite the failure of the majority of his schemes and his unwillingness to even apply for a normal job, Kramer always seems to have money when he needs it. In &quot;The Visa&quot;, George makes a comment about Kramer going to a fantasy camp, and how Kramer&#x27;s &quot;whole life is a fantasy camp. People should plunk down two thousand dollars to live like him for a week. Do nothing, fall ass-backwards into money, mooch food off your neighbors, and have sex without dating. That&#x27;s a fantasy camp.&quot;

As a younger man, Kramer had several jobs. In the episode &quot;The Strong Box&quot;, Kramer says he was briefly in the US Army and claims the reason for his discharge is classified. In the episode &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, Kramer mentions shaving his chest when he was a lifeguard. His long term unemployed status is explained in &quot;The Strike&quot;, when he goes back to work at H&amp;H Bagels after being on strike since 1985. He is fired by the end of the episode.

In the episode &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, Kramer accidentally begins working for a company called Brandt-Leland. Later in the episode, he is &quot;fired&quot; (without actually having ever been employed) when his &quot;work&quot; is assessed and found to be completely meaningless.

He is a compulsive gambler who successfully avoids gambling for several years until &quot;The Diplomat&#x27;s Club&quot;, in which he bets with a wealthy Texan on the arrival and departure times of flights going into New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport.

A struggling (and terrible) actor, Kramer&#x27;s first gig was a one-line part in a Woody Allen movie in &quot;The Alternate Side&quot; (his line, &quot;These pretzels are making me thirsty&quot;, becomes the show&#x27;s first catchphrase). Although he is fired before completing his scene, he says he &quot;caught the bug&quot; because of it, and briefly moves to Los Angeles to pursue a career in Hollywood, where, in &quot;The Keys&quot;, he appeared on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as Steven Snell, Murphy Brown&#x27;s secretary. After returning to New York, Kramer auditions for the role of &quot;Kramer&quot; in the pilot of a new sitcom called &quot;Jerry&quot;, using his stage name of Martin van Nostrand (&quot;The Pilot&quot;). He is unable to complete the audition due to an intestinal problem. Kramer later works as a stand-in on a soap opera with his friend Mickey Abbott in &quot;The Stand In&quot; and various other low-paying or non-paying theater projects, such as acting out illnesses at a medical school in &quot;The Burning&quot;.

==Inventions, entrepreneurship, and lawsuits==
Kramer shows an entrepreneurial bent with &quot;Kramerica Industries&quot;, for which he devises plans for a pizza place where customers make their own pie (&quot;Male Unbonding&quot;), a bladder system for tankers that will &quot;put an end to maritime oil spills&quot; (&quot;The Voice&quot;), and a product that will put ketchup and mustard in the same bottle.

In &quot;The Friar&#x27;s Club&quot;, he creates a concept restaurant that only serves peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which he calls P.B. &amp; Js.

He also comes up with the idea of a beach-scented cologne in &quot;The Pez Dispenser&quot;, but a marketing executive for Calvin Klein tells him the idea is ridiculous. Despite this, it is revealed in the episode &quot;The Pick&quot; that Calvin Klein began making an ocean-scented cologne. Calvin Klein offers to allow Kramer to be an underwear model, which Kramer accepts.

In &quot;The Doorman&quot;, Kramer and Frank Costanza co-develop a prototype for a bra for men called the &quot;bro&quot; or the &quot;manssiere&quot;.

In &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot;, Kramer initiates The Peterman Reality Bus Tour, charging customers $37.50 for a tour of his life.

Kramer also hatches a scheme to smuggle Cubans to the United States to make Cuban cigars, only to learn the &quot;Cubans&quot; are actually Dominicans (&quot;The English Patient&quot;).

He participates in lawsuits against various people and companies and considers himself &quot;very litigious&quot;. He is always represented in these lawsuits by Jackie Chiles. In &quot;The Maestro&quot;, he settles one such suit (though receiving no monetary compensation) against a coffee company whose beverages are too hot (a reference to the McDonald&#x27;s coffee case). In &quot;The Abstinence&quot;, Kramer sues a tobacco company for the damage its products cause to his appearance, and in &quot;The Caddy&quot;, he sues Sue Ellen Mischke for causing a traffic accident.

===Coffee table book about coffee tables===
A storyline running throughout the fifth season is the development of one of Kramer&#x27;s few successful ideas: a coffee table book about coffee tables. Kramer first thinks of the book in &quot;The Cigar Store Indian&quot;, although he later claims that he first had the idea when skiing. Throughout the season, his quest to get the book published becomes a running gag. Pendant Publishing (where Elaine and Kramer&#x27;s then-girlfriend work) decides to publish it in &quot;The Fire&quot;.

In &quot;The Opposite&quot;, Kramer starts his &quot;book tour&quot; with an appearance on &quot;Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. By accidentally spitting his coffee over Kathie Lee Gifford (&quot;All over my Kathie Lee Casuals!&quot;), his book tour goes down in flames. Elaine inadvertently causes the end of Pendant Publishing and therefore the end of Kramer&#x27;s book. In the episode &quot;The Wizard&quot; it is revealed that the book is being made into a movie. The money Kramer makes allows him to briefly retire to Florida and run for president of the condo board at Del Boca Vista, Phase 3.

The book itself is full of pictures of celebrities&#x27; coffee tables, and even had a pair of foldable wooden legs so that it could itself be turned into a coffee table. He also says that he has plans for a coaster to be built into the cover.

Tom Gammill and Max Pross, writers of &quot;The Cigar Store Indian&quot;, came up with the idea of the book, and Larry David added on the idea of the foldout legs to turn it into a coffee table.

==Physical moments==
Kramer&#x27;s physical eccentricities are a frequent source of humor. His entrance is a recurring gag. He frequently &#x27;slides&#x27; into Jerry&#x27;s apartment, often resulting in applause, as in &quot;The Virgin&quot;. In &quot;The Revenge&quot;, Kramer clumsily carries a dry sack of cement powder to the washing machine. In &quot;The Foundation&quot;, he takes on a group of kids at a karate school, and in &quot;The Van Buren Boys&quot;, after giving his stories to Elaine to write, he slips up on the golf balls and lands on the floor. In &quot;The Subway&quot;, Kramer fights to get a seat with several people on a subway. He falls a couple times and ends up not getting a seat. Kramer and Newman had been playing the game &quot;Risk&quot; for a while. When they were done, Kramer drops the game off at Jerry&#x27;s apartment. Before he puts it onto the table, he clears the table with his leg with papers flying off. When Kramer and Jerry were going to see a movie, Kramer hid his coffee under his shirt due to him not being allowed to bring it in. Kramer then spills the coffee on himself when he was about to sit down, burning himself in the process. Kramer became a model for Calvin Klein when he went to their office. He showed off his buttocks in white underwear in front of a few Calvin Klein executives. Just before they wanted to take him in to their studio, Kramer has a pratfall in the underwear.

==Pseudonyms==
Like the other three characters, Kramer has pseudonyms he uses in various schemes.

Under the name H.E. Pennypacker in &quot;The Puerto Rican Day&quot;, Kramer poses as a prospective buyer interested in an elegant apartment in order to use its bathroom. Kramer also appears as Pennypacker to help Elaine get revenge on a Mayan clothing store, &quot;Putumayo&quot;, by repricing all the merchandise in the store with a pricing gun in &quot;The Millennium&quot;, though due to a mishap with the pricing gun, Pennypacker instead removes the desiccants from clothes in the store in order to render them &quot;noticeably musty in five years&quot;. In this latter capacity, he claims Pennypacker is &quot;a wealthy American industrialist&quot;.

In &quot;The Nose Job&quot;, Kramer uses the pseudonym Professor Peter Von Nostrand to pose as the betrothed son-in-law of an incarcerated man who once stole his jacket in order to retrieve it from the man&#x27;s apartment; Kramer&#x27;s jacket, to which he attributes at least some of his amorous success, is a minor plot point in other episodes until, in &quot;The Cheever Letters&quot;, he trades it to a Cuban embassy official for several boxes of authentic Cuban cigars. Later on, he more famously adopts a similarly named alter-ego, Dr. Martin van Nostrand (in addition to &quot;von&quot; instead of &quot;Van&quot;, &quot;Nostrand&quot; is also pronounced differently in this alias). As Dr. van Nostrand, Kramer tries to get hold of Elaine&#x27;s medical chart to erase the negative comments her doctor has made in &quot;The Package&quot;. He also uses the van Nostrand alias in the episode &quot;The Slicer&quot;, posing as a &quot;Juilliard-trained dermatologist&quot; for a cancer screening at George&#x27;s company, Kruger Industrial Smoothing. Mr. Kruger later recognizes him as Dr. van Nostrand in &quot;The Strike&quot;. Kramer uses the name Martin van Nostrand (without the &quot;doctor&quot; title) while auditioning for the role of himself on the show &quot;Jerry&quot; in &quot;The Pilot, Part 1&quot;.

Kramer is also occasionally called &quot;the K-Man&quot; (&quot;The Barber&quot;, &quot;The Bizarro Jerry&quot;, &quot;The Busboy&quot;, &quot;The Note&quot;, &quot;The Hamptons&quot;, &quot;The Scofflaw&quot; and &quot;The Soup Nazi&quot;).

A derogatory designation for Kramer has been &quot;hipster &quot;, a moniker assigned to him by a woman in a wheelchair he once dated in the episode &quot;The Handicap Spot&quot;, and occasionally directed at him by Elaine, as in &quot;The Glasses&quot;. The nickname was first used in The Atlantic Monthly review of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

==Reception==
Ken Tucker wrote in a 1992 review in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that Kramer is &quot;the most cartoonish, least-defined person in &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Kramer is an earnest dope whose long, gangly body always seems to surprise his mind — he&#x27;s always running, stumbling, bumping into things; he doesn&#x27;t enter Jerry&#x27;s apartment so much as he explodes into it.&quot; In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 36 on its &#x27;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&#x27; list.

==In popular culture==
Paul Buchman, one of the main characters in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mad About You&quot;, apparently sublets his apartment to the Kramer character. Paul and Kramer have a conversation about it in &quot;Mad About You&quot; episode &quot;The Apartment&quot; (Season 1, Episode 8).

Alternative hip hop group Das Racist indirectly reference Kramer by referring to the show &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and the actor Michael Richards who portrays him in the song &quot;Rapping 2 U&quot;. Justin Roiland voices a parody of Kramer known as &quot;Kramer Guy&quot; (originally known as &quot;Kessler Guy&quot;) in the animated series &quot;Solar Opposites&quot;.

<text>Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest (13 August 1822 – 14 June 1875;  ) was a German astronomer, born in Berlin. His name is sometimes given as Heinrich Ludwig d&#x27;Arrest.

== Biography ==
While still a student at the University of Berlin, d&#x27;Arrest was party to Johann Gottfried Galle&#x27;s search for Neptune. On 23 September 1846, he suggested that a recently drawn chart of the sky, in the region of Urbain Le Verrier&#x27;s predicted location, could be compared with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a stationary star. Neptune was discovered that very night.

D&#x27;Arrest&#x27;s later work at the Leipzig Observatory led him, in 1851, to the discovery of the comet named for him (formally designated 6P/d&#x27;Arrest). He also studied asteroids, discovering 76 Freia, nebulae, and galaxies, discovering NGC 1 in 1861 and NGC 26 and NGC 358 in 1865.

In 1864 D&#x27;Arrest made an unsuccessful search for Martian satellites, and posited an upper limit of 70 minutes of arc as the distance from Mars within which a moon should be sought.

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1875.

In 1857, he married Auguste Emilie Möbius, daughter of his then-supervisor, August Ferdinand Möbius. He died in Copenhagen, Denmark.

=== Honours ===
The crater &quot;D&#x27;Arrest&quot; on the Moon, the crater &quot;D&#x27;Arrest&quot; on the Martian satellite Phobos, as well as the asteroid 9133 d&#x27;Arrest were named after him.

<text>Unigov is the colloquial name adopted by the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, to describe its consolidated city–county government. By an act of the Indiana General Assembly, Indianapolis consolidated with the government of Marion County in 1970.

Within Unigov are eleven &quot;included towns&quot;. Under Indiana Code 36-3-1-4 sec. 4(a)(2)), included towns retain their identity as towns under Indiana law and have some limited autonomy. However, they are legally part of the Consolidated City of Indianapolis and are fully subject to the laws and control of the government of Indianapolis. Four other municipalities in Marion County are not part of the Indianapolis government (&quot;excluded cities and towns&quot;), but receive county-level services from Unigov and take part in elections for the Indianapolis City–County Council and mayor.

The area of Marion County not within the included or excluded towns, but including what was the City of Indianapolis prior to the enactment of Unigov, is designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as the &quot;balance&quot;, and its population is usually quoted as the population of Indianapolis for census purposes.

==Background==
Indianapolis was intentionally surveyed and founded as the capital of the U.S. state of Indiana. Given the condition of urban planning in 1821, little thought was given to the growth of the city. Original planners were of the opinion that it would never grow beyond its original square mile (2.6 km²) layout (still known as &quot;the Mile Square&quot;). Contrary to their belief, Marion County soon was filled with small communities with connections to Indianapolis, or with businesses that had formed to take advantage of Indianapolis&#x27;s location midway between Lake Michigan and both Cincinnati, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky. City growth occurred in fits and starts. By the late 1960s, it was possible in some areas to leave and re-enter Indianapolis while traveling in a straight line. The movement of affluent citizens to more fashionable suburbs, especially to the north of the city limits, accelerated into full white flight in the period after World War II. While this sprawl was generally within Marion County, it hastened the decay of the city itself.

Unigov was proposed in the late 1960s by then mayor (and later U.S. Senator) Richard Lugar to address these problems and a number of other related issues. In order to support Unigov, a compromise was arranged. The cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, and Southport, and the town of Speedway each maintained limited autonomy, with their own police forces, school systems, and mayors (except Speedway). In addition, fire service and school districts were maintained at their pre-Unigov borders, and some of the included towns retained independent police forces. Nevertheless, the excluded cities are also part of the consolidated city-county government and are thus represented within the City-County Council. In addition to voting for the mayors and councils of their respective cities and towns, residents are also able to vote for the mayor of Indianapolis, and a district City-County Council member, and, until those positions were abolished by the General Assembly, four at-large council members. A number of services and governmental responsibilities, including road maintenance, natural resource management, zoning, and flood control, are delegated by the state of Indiana to county-level government; As a result, residents of the excluded cities are obligated to pay county-wide taxes, and the powers of the mayor of Indianapolis extend to all of Marion County.

==Included towns==

Several towns that existed outside the city limits were incorporated into Unigov, but elected to retain some measure of autonomy. Most of these towns hold elections for Town Council and Clerk-Treasurer. The town governments have taxing authority, and several continue to appoint their own police departments, maintain their own streets, and perform various other functions independently of the city of Indianapolis. However, they cannot pass any ordinance that conflicts with, or permits a lesser standard than, any City-County ordinance. The included towns are:
* Clermont
* Crows Nest
* Homecroft
* Meridian Hills
* North Crows Nest
* Rocky Ripple
* Spring Hill
* Warren Park
* Williams Creek
* Wynnedale

Cumberland is divided between Marion County and Hancock County. While Cumberland has full governmental autonomy on the Hancock County side of town, it is an included town under Unigov on the Marion County side. For purposes such as rezoning in the portion in Marion County, Indianapolis officials have final say over policy.

==Excluded cities and town==

The cities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, and Southport, and the town of Speedway are known as &quot;excluded cities&quot;, and retain government autonomy in most respects. They elect their own city officials and city councils. Residents also are represented on the City-County Council and vote for the mayor of Indianapolis because these countywide officials have taxing and other powers over the whole county.

==Political implications==
For many years, the incorporation of the city&#x27;s suburbs was seen as working to the political benefit of the Republican Party, which held the mayor&#x27;s office from the election of Richard Lugar in 1967 until the election of Democrat Bart Peterson in 1999. Democrats gained a one-seat majority on the City-County Council for the first time in citywide elections in 2003.

Facing a budget crisis, Peterson made a proposal to further consolidate city and county functions, dubbed &quot;Indianapolis Works!&quot;. He claimed it would eliminate remaining duplication, while opponents saw it as an effort to further consolidate the power of the Democratic Party in Marion County. The extension of city government was now seen as benefiting the Democrats, who had made many gains (as they did nationally) in the inner-ring suburbs, many more of which are included within the boundaries of the city than in many comparable metropolitan areas.

In December 2005, the City-County Council approved a merger of the Indianapolis Police Department and the Marion County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, creating the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, headed by the Marion County Sheriff.

In the 2007 municipal elections, the Republican party, led by Gregory A. Ballard, recaptured the Mayor&#x27;s office and also won back a majority of the City-County Council. One of the planks of Ballard&#x27;s campaign platform was that the police department needed to be under the responsibility of the mayor, and not the sheriff. In February 2008, the new GOP-led council gave the authority over the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department to the mayor, leaving Sheriff Frank J. Anderson with authority over the county jail, protection of City-County buildings and the traditional roles of tax collection and paper serving, but left him as the only sheriff in Indiana without territory to protect.

Democrats won all four citywide council seats for the first time in the 2011 election (and a majority for the second time), prompting Republicans in the Indiana General Assembly to eliminate the at-large seats for the 2015 election.

===Other city–county consolidations===
Under the Unigov provision of Indiana law, city-county consolidation is automatic when a city&#x27;s population exceeds the threshold for qualification as a so-called First Class City. When the Unigov provision was enacted, the First Class City population threshold was 250,000. Indianapolis had a population of over 500,000 people in 1970, more than double the threshold. The next most populous city was Fort Wayne with a population of 174,000; as such, Indianapolis was the only city affected by the legislation.

By 2006, Fort Wayne nearly met the threshold for designation as a First Class City as it annexed the populous portions of Aboite Township. However, a pre-emptive legislative change in 2004 raised the population requirements for a First Class City from 250,000 to 600,000, which ensured Indianapolis&#x27;s status as the only First Class City in Indiana. As a result, any foreseeable city-county consolidation in Indiana will be voluntary rather than automatic.

== Legacy and criticisms ==
Unigov has been praised for its economic impact but has received criticism for both its initial enactment and later impacts on communities – especially on African Americans and those living within pre-Unigov Indianapolis.

Unigov was never put up for a direct referendum. This has led critics during its enactment and thereafter to call the process undemocratic. The closest Indianapolis got to a referendum was the 1967 Indianapolis mayoral election, which Lugar narrowly won.

Due to public push back and lack of political appetite, Unigov left many government services as is and did not integrate them. Most notably, the school districts were not merged. While some services like police were later combined, school districts have remained unmerged. Lugar later said he knew that the Unigov bill would not pass in the Indiana General Assembly if schools were included, but that the merger was worth it despite the impact on schools. The impact on Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) in particular contributed to declines in enrollment and funding over many decades.

African Americans lost substantial political clout following the merger, dropping from 23% of the population to 16%. For decades following the merger, the suburban populations that were added politically dominated Indianapolis. The decline of the IPS heavily affected African American students, who saw negative impacts from falling enrollments and funding to neighboring school districts outside the largely pre-Unigov IPS school district.

The economic impact has received more praise. The consolidated city has a much larger population, tax base, and overall economy. Indianapolis saw substantially less decline than many other cities in the Rust Belt due to deindustrialization, though manufacturing still declined. The city also saw more economic and population growth than comparable cities in the region starting in the 1980s.

Unigov, alongside later developments such as the Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis, contributed to Indianapolis losing the &quot;Naptown&quot; reputation it had developed previously.

<text>Excess-3, 3-excess or 10-excess-3 binary code (often abbreviated as XS-3, 3XS or X3), shifted binary or Stibitz code (after George Stibitz, who built a relay-based adding machine in 1937) is a self-complementary binary-coded decimal (BCD) code and numeral system. It is a biased representation. Excess-3 code was used on some older computers as well as in cash registers and hand-held portable electronic calculators of the 1970s, among other uses.

==Representation==
Biased codes are a way to represent values with a balanced number of positive and negative numbers using a pre-specified number &quot;N&quot; as a biasing value. Biased codes (and Gray codes) are non-weighted codes. In excess-3 code, numbers are represented as decimal digits, and each digit is represented by four bits as the digit value plus 3 (the &quot;excess&quot; amount):
* The smallest binary number represents the smallest value ().
* The greatest binary number represents the largest value ().

To encode a number such as 127, one simply encodes each of the decimal digits as above, giving (0100, 0101, 1010).

Excess-3 arithmetic uses different algorithms than normal non-biased BCD or binary positional system numbers. After adding two excess-3 digits, the raw sum is excess-6. For instance, after adding 1 (0100 in excess-3) and 2 (0101 in excess-3), the sum looks like 6 (1001 in excess-3) instead of 3 (0110 in excess-3). To correct this problem, after adding two digits, it is necessary to remove the extra bias by subtracting binary 0011 (decimal 3 in unbiased binary) if the resulting digit is less than decimal 10, or subtracting binary 1101 (decimal 13 in unbiased binary) if an overflow (carry) has occurred. (In 4-bit binary, subtracting binary 1101 is equivalent to adding 0011 and vice versa.)
==Advantage==
The primary advantage of excess-3 coding over non-biased coding is that a decimal number can be nines&#x27; complemented (for subtraction) as easily as a binary number can be ones&#x27; complemented: just by inverting all bits. Also, when the sum of two excess-3 digits is greater than 9, the carry bit of a 4-bit adder will be set high. This works because, after adding two digits, an &quot;excess&quot; value of 6 results in the sum. Because a 4-bit integer can only hold values 0 to 15, an excess of 6 means that any sum over 9 will overflow (produce a carry-out).

Another advantage is that the codes 0000 and 1111 are not used for any digit. A fault in a memory or basic transmission line may result in these codes. It is also more difficult to write the zero pattern to magnetic media.

==Example==

end architecture dataflow; -- of bcd8421xs3
==Extensions==
* 3-of-6 code extension: The excess-3 code is sometimes also used for data transfer, then often expanded to a 6-bit code per CCITT GT 43 No. 1, where 3 out of 6 bits are set.
* 4-of-8 code extension: As an alternative to the IBM transceiver code (which is a 4-of-8 code with a Hamming distance of 2), it is also possible to define a 4-of-8 excess-3 code extension achieving a Hamming distance of 4, if only denary digits are to be transferred.

<text>The DFS 194 was a rocket-powered aircraft designed by Alexander Lippisch at the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - &quot;German Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;).

==Design and development==
The DFS 194 was based on the Alexander Lippisch &quot;Delta&quot; series of tailless designs. As originally conceived, it would have been a tailless aircraft similar to his DFS 40, powered by a conventional piston engine driving a pusher propeller. The airframe was completed in this configuration in March 1938.

Lippisch&#x27;s designs had attracted the attention of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM - Reich Aviation Ministry) who believed that tailless aircraft were the best basis for a rocket-powered fighter. On January 2, 1939, Lippisch and his team were transferred to the Messerschmitt company to begin work on such an aircraft, under what was known as &quot;Project X&quot;. The DFS-194 was modified to accept a Walter R I-203 rocket engine designed by Hellmuth Walter, and by October, the aircraft was undergoing engine tests at Peenemünde.

These were followed by glide tests in early 1940 leading to the first powered flight in August with Heini Dittmar at the controls. The flight went well, the DFS 194 reaching , bettering the speed of the earlier (20 July 1939), Walter rocket powered Heinkel He 176.

The aircraft proved to have excellent flying characteristics and proved safe to fly at nearly twice the anticipated speed. These results paved the way for the next stage of the project, which now received priority status from the RLM.

His other accolades include five Producers Guild of America Awards, twelve Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards, and ten People&#x27;s Choice Awards. From 2013 to 2017, Burnett was listed on Variety500, an index of the 500 most influential business leaders shaping the global media industry. 

Burnett served as President of United Artists from 2014-2018 and as chairman of MGM Worldwide Television Group from 2018 to 2022. 

He created and or produced the television shows &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?,&quot; &quot;Shark Tank&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;, The Martha Stewart Show and &quot;Generation Gap&quot;.

Burnett first joined MGM in 2013. After his promotion to chairman in 2018, the company expanded its cable television productions through the acquisitions of Evolution Media (&quot;Botched&quot;, &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot;) and of Big Fish Entertainment (&quot;Live PD&quot; and &quot;Black Ink Crew&quot;). Burnett has co-created the Christian media series &quot;The Bible&quot; and &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot;, and produced the feature films &quot;Son of God&quot;, &quot;Little Boy&quot;, &quot;Woodlawn&quot;, and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People&#x27;s Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 &amp; 2012) and the 2011 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries. 

&quot;Variety&quot; recognized Burnett and his wife Roma Downey as &quot;trailblazers&quot;. Both of them were also named among the &quot;Most Influential People&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. In February 2016, Downey and Burnett gave the keynote address at President Obama&#x27;s final National Prayer Breakfast, and Burnett returned the following year to introduce President Trump at his first National Prayer Breakfast.

==Early life==
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motor factory workers, and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic Glaswegian and his mother was a Presbyterian; it is not known in which denomination he was raised. At the age of 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and in the rank of corporal became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978 to 1982 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War and Northern Ireland. After his service, he initially planned to go to Central America and work as a &quot;weapons and tactics adviser&quot;.

==Early career==
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by the boys&#x27; father. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.

In 1991, Burnett and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot;, to America. &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot; launched Burnett&#x27;s career as a television producer.

==Productions==

Burnett first produced the expedition race show &quot;Eco-Challenge&quot; in 1995. This led to the hit reality show &quot;Survivor&quot; which premiered in the summer of 2000, and was the most watched summer series since &quot;Sonny &amp; Cher&quot;. &quot;Survivor&quot; was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.

In 2004, NBC premiered &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and later US President Donald Trump.

Burnett has produced several other television franchises including &quot;Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?&quot;, &quot;Shark Tank&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, &quot;Beat Shazam&quot;, &quot;Coupled&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. 

Past shows include &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (NBC), &quot;Bully Beatdown&quot;, &quot;Combat Missions&quot;, &quot;The Contender&quot;, &quot;The Contender Asia&quot;, &quot;Expedition Africa&quot;, &quot;Expedition Impossible&quot;, &quot;How&#x27;d You Get So Rich?&quot;, &quot;Martha Stewart&quot;, &quot;My Dad Is Better than Your Dad&quot;, &quot;On the Lot&quot; (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), &quot;Pirate Master&quot;, &quot;The Restaurant&quot;, &quot;Rock Star&quot;, &quot;Sarah Palin&#x27;s Alaska&quot;, &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot;, &quot;Starmaker&quot;, &quot;Toughest Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Wedding Day&quot;.

Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced &quot;The Bible&quot;, a ten-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible. &quot;The Bible&quot; became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013 and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain and Portugal. In total, with subsequent airings, &quot;The Bible&quot; was seen by more than 100 million viewers.

After the success of &quot;The Bible&quot;, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot; premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and &quot;The Dovekeepers&quot; miniseries aired on CBS in 2015.

In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media. The two companies were consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group, which was then acquired fully by MGM in 2015.

In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett&#x27;s appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM&#x27;s acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst&#x27;s, Burnett&#x27;s and Roma Downey&#x27;s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which would be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television would now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production, including: &quot;The Voice&quot; (NBC); &quot;Survivor&quot; (CBS); &quot;Shark Tank&quot; (ABC); &quot;Beyond the Tank&quot; (ABC); &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (NBC); &quot;Fargo&quot; (FX); &quot;Vikings&quot; (HISTORY); &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; (MTV); &quot;500 Questions&quot; (ABC); &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice Awards&quot; (CBS); LIGHT TV, &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; (El Rey Network) and &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Makers&quot; (INTEL/Turner). In June 2018, MGM appointed Burnett as Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television.

In 2017, Burnett had timeslot winning shows on six nights out of seven. As Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television, he oversaw scripted television shows including, &quot;Fargo&quot; (FX), &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (Hulu), &quot;Vikings&quot; and &quot;&quot; (Netflix).

As of 2024, Burnett is the executive producer of five network television shows: &quot;Generation Gap&quot; (ABC), &quot;Beat Shazam&quot; (FOX), &quot;Shark Tank&quot; (ABC), &quot;Survivor&quot; (CBS) and &quot;The Voice&quot; (NBC). Burnett is also the executive producer of the cable series &quot;Lucha Underground&quot; (The El Rey Network) and &quot;The Contender&quot; (EPIX).

==Personal life==
Burnett&#x27;s first wife was Kym Gold, but that marriage only lasted about a year. Before that marriage ended he met Dianne J. Burnett (&quot;née&quot; Valentine) and they married in 1992; they have two sons together, James and Cameron. In 2014, Cameron survived a neuroendocrine tumor at the age of 17, had brain surgery and had to learn to walk again. Cameron was awarded the 2015 Courage Award at the Visionary Ball which raises money each year for UCLA&#x27;s Department of Neurosurgery.

The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002, and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003; they divorced in 2006. In January 2004, Burnett began dating Roma Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her. They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey&#x27;s former co-star, Della Reese.

<doc id="457842" wikidata="Q1031775" url="?curid=457842" title="Myrciaria dubia">
<text>Myrciaria dubia, commonly known as camu-camu, caçari, araçá-d&#x27;água, or camocamo, is a species of plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is a small bushy riverside tree from the Amazon rainforest in Peru and Brazil, which grows to a height of and bears a red/purple cherry-like fruit. It is a close relative of the false jaboticaba (&quot;Myrciaria vexator&quot;) and the guavaberry or rumberry (&quot;Myrciaria floribunda&quot;). As much as 2 to 3% of the fresh fruit by weight is vitamin C.

==Description==
Camu-camu has small flowers with waxy white petals and a sweet-smelling aroma. It has bushy, feathery foliage. The evergreen, opposite leaves are lanceolate to elliptic. Individual leaves are in length and wide.

The camu-camu fruit is maroon or purple-black when fully ripe, around 25 mm in diameter, with either sweet or acidic flesh.

==Native range==
The current range of camu-camu consists of the Amazonian lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. Its distribution extends from the center of Pará state, Brazil, along the mid and upper Amazon River to the eastern part of Peru; in the north, it appears in the Casiquiare canal and the upper and middle Orinoco River. In Brazil, it is found in Rondônia along the Maçangana and Urupá Rivers and in Amazonas, in the municipalities of Manaus and Manacapuru and along the Javari, Madeira, and Negro Rivers.

==Harvest==

Long used by native peoples, wild camu-camu fruit is harvested directly into canoes. The fruit has only recently come into large-scale cultivation and sale to the world market, with Japan being the major buyer. The tree is relatively easy to cultivate within certain growing conditions. It survives best in hot, damp, tropical climates, but will grow in the subtropics, surviving temperatures down to just above freezing. It requires copious water. Fair trade is present in low-land production from the Association of Camu Camu Producers of the Peruvian Amazon.

The tree occurs in locally dense populations or even monospecific stands in Amazonian flood plains and riparian vegetation. The plant is extremely tolerant of flooding, withstanding four to five months with the roots and even much of the aerial parts submerged in water. The species propagates through seeds. In cultivation, the tree begins bearing fruits after attaining in stem girth (three years after emergence of the seedling). Plants flower at the end of the dry season and produce fruit at the peak of the rainy season. Observations with both wild and cultivated plants suggest that the trees can remain productive for several decades.

Wild trees have been found to yield of fruit on average. At suggested planting densities of 600–1100 trees per , about fruit may be derived in cultivation from one hectare.

==Nutrition==
Per 100 g of fresh fruit:
* Protein 0.4 g
* Carbohydrates 5.9 g
* Starches 0.44 g
* Sugars 1.28 g
* Dietary Fiber 1.1 g
* Fat 0.2 g
* Calcium 15.7 mg
* Copper 0.2 mg
* Iron 0.53 mg
* Magnesium 12.4 mg
* Manganese 2.1 mg
* Potassium 83.9 mg
* Sodium 11.1 mg
* Zinc 0.2 mg
* Vitamin C: ranges from 1882–2280 mg depending on ripeness.

Camu-camu has an extraordinarily high vitamin C content (on the order of 2–3% of fresh weight). Vitamin C content declines as full maturity is reached, with a trade-off between vitamin C and flavor expression.

The fruit is rich in flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanols, catechins, delphinidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside, ellagic acid, and rutin. Other analysis revealed the presence of gallic and ellagic acids, suggesting that the fruit possesses hydrolyzed tannins (gallotannin and ellagitannins).

==Uses==

Documentation of traditional camu-camu uses is scarce. In traditional Amazonian societies, camu-camu is not likely to have ever been nutritionally relevant except for its vitamin C content. The fruit is extremely acidic and the flavor much like a sour grape with a large pit. The fruit is often used to make a very pink juice with a little sugar (like lemonade). A reddish pigment in the leathery skin of the fruit imparts a pink color on juices extracted from camu-camu. The aroma is subtle, but is not so captivating as in more popular fruits. Recently, camu-camu is used in ice creams and sweets and processed powder from the fruit pulp is beginning to be sold in the west as a health food in loose powder or capsule form.

Native Amazonian groups living on the banks of the Nanay River in the Loreto region of Peru, have been reported as using camu-camu as a traditional remedy for the treatment of malaria.

==Conservation issues==
Overharvesting of wild camu-camu threatens to make it an endangered species. Efforts are underway to encourage commercial growing of camu-camu in the Amazon River basin.

<text>Carmine Caridi (January 23, 1934 – May 28, 2019) was an American film, television and stage actor. He is best known for his roles in the films &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990).

In 2004, Caridi became the first person to be expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

==Life and career==
Caridi&#x27;s most notable film roles are Carmine Rosato in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974) and Albert Volpe in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; (1990). He is one of three actors to play two different roles in the &quot;Godfather&quot; films, the others being Frank Sivero (who played a young Genco Abbandando in &quot;Godfather Part II&quot; and a bystander to the fight between Sonny Corleone and Carlo Rizzi in &quot;The Godfather&quot;), and Sofia Coppola (who played Mary Corleone in &quot;Godfather Part III&quot; and the infant son of Carlo and Connie baptized in the final scenes of &quot;The Godfather&quot; as well as a child on the ship at the beginning of &quot;Godfather Part II&quot;).

According to studio executive Robert Evans in his 1994 memoir &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot;, Caridi was director Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s first choice for the role of Sonny Corleone, but Evans insisted on James Caan because Caridi was too tall to play opposite Al Pacino. However, according to author Mark Seal in his 2022 book &quot;Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli&quot;, Caan had been Coppola&#x27;s choice from the start, who had major battles with Evans over this and other major casting decisions for &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In Mark Seal&#x27;s account, Coppola attended theatre arts school with Caan and directed him, along with actor Robert Duvall, in the film &quot;The Rain People&quot;.

Caridi appeared in the cult movie &quot;Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park&quot; (1978), playing amusement park manager Calvin Richards, and appeared as Sam Giancana in the 1992 film &quot;Ruby&quot;.

On television, he portrayed Dan Valenti on &quot;Phyllis&quot; from 1976-1977. In 1978, he appeared as Di Carlo in the episode &quot;The Intimate Friends of Janet Wilde&quot; of the series &quot;The Eddie Capra Mysteries&quot;. Between 1982 and 1983, Caridi played Angelo Martelli, Bruno Martelli&#x27;s father, in the TV series &quot;Fame&quot;. Caridi played Detective Vince Gotelli in the television series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; from 1993 to 1999.

Caridi&#x27;s final appearance was a small role in the Season 10 episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Insufficient Praise.&quot; Later on the season, Larry David&#x27;s character is accused of allowing Caridi&#x27;s Academy screener DVDs to be pirated.

===Copyright infringement incident===
On January 13, 2004, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that it had identified a copy of the film &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, circulated illegally on the Internet, as carrying markings identifying it as coming from a VHS screener copy sent to Caridi because he was an Oscar voter. Similarly, unauthorized copies of &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;Big Fish&quot; and &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; were said to have been traced to Caridi.

The FBI began an investigation into the affair and later that month charged Russell Sprague of Homewood, Illinois, with criminal copyright infringement. Federal authorities alleged that for at least three years, Caridi had given Sprague his screener copies of approximately 60 movies seeking consideration for the Academy Awards. According to the FBI affidavit, Caridi said that he sent his screeners via FedEx to Sprague, who gave him FedEx boxes, pre-addressed labels, and an account number. Caridi denied receiving money from Sprague, telling the FBI he believed that Sprague was a film buff.

Caridi and Sprague were sued by Sony and Time Warner on civil charges of copyright infringement. The studios filed the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, seeking damages of a minimum of $150,000 per movie, with hundreds of individual violations alleged. While awaiting trial on criminal charges, Sprague died of a suspected heart attack. Caridi was cleared of wrongdoing.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on February 3, 2004, that it was expelling Caridi for violating his agreement to safeguard their screeners, making him the first Academy member to be expelled.

=== Death ===
Caridi was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after suffering from complications due to a fall, where he slipped into a comatose state and died on May 28, 2019.

<text>Baron Willoughby de Broke is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by writ in 1491 for Sir Robert Willoughby, of the manor of Broke, part of Westbury, Wiltshire, who according to modern doctrine was &quot;de jure&quot; 9th Baron Latimer. On the death of his son, the two baronies (the recognised barony of Willoughby de Broke and the &quot;de jure&quot; barony of Latimer) fell into abeyance. Around 1535, the abeyance was naturally terminated when the second Baron&#x27;s granddaughter Elizabeth, who had married Sir Fulke Greville, became the only surviving co-heir, passing her claim to her son Sir Fulke Greville, father of the poet of the same name. The title stayed in the Greville family until after the death of the 5th Baron, when it passed to his sister, Margaret Greville, the wife of a Verney. Thereafter it remained in the Verney family. The Barons Willoughby de Broke remain heirs to the ancient Barony of Latimer (a title which predates their recognised Barony by almost two hundred years).

The current family seat is Ditchford Farm, near Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. A former seat was Compton Verney House.

<text>Traditional medicine (also known as indigenous medicine or folk medicine) comprises medical aspects of traditional knowledge that developed over generations within the folk beliefs of various societies, including indigenous peoples, before the era of modern medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as &quot;the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement and treatment of physical and mental illness&quot;.

In some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs. Traditional medicine is a form of alternative medicine. Practices known as traditional medicines include ancient Iranian medicine, Ayurveda, Ifá, medieval Islamic medicine, Muti, Rongoā, Siddha medicine, traditional African medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Iranian medicine, traditional Korean medicine, and Unani. Scientific disciplines that study traditional medicine include herbalism, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology.

The WHO notes, however, that &quot;inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects&quot; and that &quot;further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety&quot; of such practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems. Its &quot;Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014–2023&quot; said that the WHO would &quot;support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy&quot;.

==Usage and history==

=== Classical history ===

In the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient Sumerians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In Ancient Egyptian medicine, the Ebers papyrus from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices. The Old Testament also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to Kashrut.

Many herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as Charaka and Sushruta during the 1st millennium BC. The first Chinese herbal book was the Shennong Bencaojing, compiled during the Han dynasty but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the &quot;Yaoxing Lun&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs&quot;) during the Tang dynasty. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include Pythagoras and his followers, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dioscorides and Galen.

Roman sources included Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; and Celsus&#x27;s &quot;De Medicina&quot;. Pedanius Dioscorides drew on and corrected earlier authors for his &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, adding much new material; the work was translated into several languages, and Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew names were added to it over the centuries. Latin manuscripts of &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; were combined with a Latin herbal by Apuleius Platonicus (&quot;Herbarium Apuleii Platonici&quot;) and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon codex &quot;Cotton Vitellius C.III&quot;. These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, 980–1037), the Persian Rhazes (Rāzi, 865–925) and the Jewish Maimonides.

Some fossils have been used in traditional medicine since antiquity.

===Medieval and later===

Arabic indigenous medicine developed from the conflict between the magic-based medicine of the Bedouins and the Arabic translations of the Hellenic and Ayurvedic medical traditions. Spanish medicine was influenced by the Arabs from 711 to 1492. Islamic physicians and Muslim botanists such as al-Dinawari and Ibn al-Baitar significantly expanded on the earlier knowledge of materia medica. The most famous Persian medical treatise was Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, which was an early pharmacopoeia and introduced clinical trials. The &quot;Canon&quot; was translated into Latin in the 12th century and remained a medical authority in Europe until the 17th century. The Unani system of traditional medicine is also based on the &quot;Canon&quot;.

Translations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by Hieronymus Bock whose herbal, published in 1546, was called &quot;Kreuter Buch&quot;. The book was translated into Dutch as &quot;Pemptades&quot; by Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), and from Dutch into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526–1609), published by Henry Lyte in 1578 as &quot;A Nievve Herball&quot;. This became John Gerard&#x27;s (1545–1612) &quot;Herball or General Historie of Plantes&quot;. Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.

Women&#x27;s folk knowledge existed in undocumented parallel with these texts. Forty-four drugs, diluents, flavouring agents and emollients mentioned by Dioscorides are still listed in the official pharmacopoeias of Europe. The Puritans took Gerard&#x27;s work to the United States where it influenced American Indigenous medicine.

Francisco Hernández, physician to Philip II of Spain spent the years 1571–1577 gathering information in Mexico and then wrote &quot;Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus&quot;, many versions of which have been published including one by Francisco Ximénez. Both Hernandez and Ximenez fitted Aztec ethnomedicinal information into the European concepts of disease such as &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and &quot;moist&quot;, but it is not clear that the Aztecs used these categories. Juan de Esteyneffer&#x27;s &quot;Florilegio medicinal de todas las enfermedas&quot; compiled European texts and added 35 Mexican plants.

Martín de la Cruz wrote a herbal in Nahuatl which was translated into Latin by Juan Badiano as &quot;Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis&quot; or &quot;Codex Barberini, Latin 241&quot; and given to King Carlos V of Spain in 1552. It was apparently written in haste and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years. Fray Bernardino de Sahagún&#x27;s used ethnographic methods to compile his codices that then became the &quot;Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España&quot;, published in 1793. Castore Durante published his &quot;Herbario Nuovo&quot; in 1585 describing medicinal plants from Europe and the East and West Indies. It was translated into German in 1609 and Italian editions were published for the next century.

===Colonial America===
In 17th and 18th-century America, traditional folk healers, frequently women, used herbal remedies, cupping and leeching. Native American traditional herbal medicine introduced cures for malaria, dysentery, scurvy, non-venereal syphilis, and goiter problems. Many of these herbal and folk remedies continued on through the 19th and into the 20th century, with some plant medicines forming the basis for modern pharmacology.

===Modern usage===
The prevalence of folk medicine in certain areas of the world varies according to cultural norms. Some modern medicine is based on plant phytochemicals that had been used in folk medicine. Researchers state that many of the alternative treatments are &quot;statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments&quot;.

== Knowledge transmission and creation ==
Indigenous medicine is generally transmitted orally through a community, family and individuals until &quot;collected&quot;. Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a shaman or midwife. Three factors legitimize the role of the healer – their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community. When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it – those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.

== Definition and terminology ==
Traditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies and practises passed on and practiced by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the healing modalities, ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.

=== Folk medicine ===

Many countries have practices described as folk medicine which may coexist with formalized, science-based, and institutionalized systems of medical practice represented by conventional medicine. Examples of folk medicine traditions are traditional Chinese medicine, Iranian traditional medicine, traditional Korean medicine, Arabic indigenous medicine, Uyghur traditional medicine, Japanese Kampō medicine, traditional Aboriginal bush medicine, Native Hawaiian Lāʻau lapaʻau, Curanderismo norteño, and Georgian folk medicine, among others.

====Australian bush medicine====

Generally, bush medicine used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia is made from plant materials, such as bark, leaves and seeds, although animal products may be used as well. A major component of traditional medicine is herbal medicine, which is the use of natural plant substances to treat or prevent illness.

==== Native American medicine ====

American Native and Alaska Native medicine are traditional forms of healing that have been around for thousands of years. There are many ethnobotany plants involved in traditional medicine for Native Americans and some are still used today. When it comes to Native American traditional medicine, the ideas surrounding health and illness within the culture are virtually inseparable from the ideas of religion and spirituality. Healers within indigenous communities go by many names ranging from medicine man or woman to herbalist or even shaman and are considered spiritual or religious leaders within their respective tribes. When it comes to healing, tribal healers would look at a plant&#x27;s characteristics to determine its efficacy for the treatment of an illness. Specific plant characteristics such as plant shape, smell, color, and taste could aid in determining how the plant could be used as a remedy. The Meskwaki tribe found they could use the juice from &quot;Arum maculatum&quot; for snakebites. This was inferred from the milky appearance of the juice from the plant which is said to resemble snake venom, and the plant&#x27;s shape resembled the head of a snake. Native Americans used foxglove herb as a treatment for an illness they referred to as dropsy or edema, which is fluid buildup typically in the lower legs, and its common cause is heart failure. In modern medicine, foxglove extract is still used under the name digitalis, and its purpose is to moderate the heart rate. Native Americans were successful with some medical practices, such as treating fevers, gastrointestinal conditions, skin rashes, setting bones, as well as birthing babies, and aiding mothers in healing. A study conducted within an IHS hospital that allows Navajo healers to visit patients found that the hospital had an 80 percent success rate in getting comatose patients back to consciousness, which is higher than the rate of present-day biomedical management hospitals. The plant family &quot;Asteraceae&quot; has been commonly selected for orthopedic aids and pulmonary aids, specifically the species &quot;Achillea&quot; and &quot;Artemisia&quot;. A study conducted amongst 14 different tribes within North America found that &quot;Asteraceae&quot; was the most widely used plant family for its medicinal properties.

==== Nattuvaidyam ====
Nattuvaidyam was a set of indigenous medical practices that existed in India before the advent of allopathic or western medicine. These practices had different sets of principles and ideas of the body, health and disease. There were overlaps and borrowing of ideas, medicinal compounds used and techniques within these practices. Some of these practices had written texts in vernacular languages like Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, etc. while others were handed down orally through various mnemonic devices. Ayurveda was one kind of nattuvaidyam practised in south India. The others were kalarichikitsa (related to bone setting and musculature), marmachikitsa (vital spot massaging), ottamoolivaidyam (single dose medicine or single time medication), chintamanivaidyam and so on. When the medical system was revamped in twentieth century India, many of the practices and techniques specific to some of these diverse nattuvaidyam were included in Ayurveda.

===Home remedies===
A home remedy (sometimes also referred to as a granny cure) is a treatment to cure a disease or ailment that employs certain spices, herbs, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the Internet). Many are merely used as a result of tradition or habit or because they are effective in inducing the placebo effect.

One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of chicken soup as an aid in treating respiratory infections such as a cold or mild flu. Other examples of home remedies include duct tape to help with setting broken bones; duct tape or superglue to treat plantar warts; and Kogel mogel to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic cookbooks are frequently full of remedies for dyspepsia, fevers, and female complaints. Components of the aloe vera plant are used to treat skin disorders. Many European liqueurs or digestifs were originally sold as medicinal remedies. In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal congees (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.

==Criticism==

===Safety concerns===
Although 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them (i.e. zoonosis, mainly as some traditional medicines still use animal-based substances). It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies.

===Use of endangered species===

Endangered animals, such as the slow loris, are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines.

Shark fins have also been used in traditional medicine, and although their effectiveness has not been proven, it is hurting shark populations and their ecosystem.

The illegal ivory trade can partially be traced back to buyers of traditional Chinese medicine. Demand for ivory is a huge factor in the poaching of endangered species such as rhinos and elephants.

Pangolins are threatened by poaching for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional medicine. They are the most trafficked mammals in the world.

<text>Cyberchase is an animated science fantasy children&#x27;s television series that airs on PBS Kids. The series centers around three children from Earth: Jackie, Matt and Inez, who are brought into Cyberspace, a digital universe, in order to protect it from the villainous Hacker (Christopher Lloyd). They are able to foil Hacker&#x27;s schemes by means of problem-solving skills in conjunction with basic mathematics, environmental science and wellness. In Cyberspace, they meet Digit (Gilbert Gottfried for the first thirteen seasons, later Ron Pardo as of the fourteenth), a &quot;cybird&quot; who helps them on their missions.

&quot;Cyberchase&quot; was created by Sandra Sheppard and premiered on PBS Kids on January 21, 2002. In 2010, after the season 8 finale, &quot;Cyberchase&quot; went on hiatus, but it returned in 2013 for a ninth season, followed by a tenth season in 2015, an eleventh season on October 23, 2017, and a twelfth season on April 19, 2019.

A thirteenth season was announced on October 19, 2020, and premiered on February 25, 2022. A fourteenth season premiered on April 21, 2023. A fifteenth season premiered on April 27, 2024.

==Plot==
Motherboard is the &quot;brain of the giant computer system that oversees all of Cyberspace&quot;. Her technician computer scientist, Doctor Marbles, kept her functioning properly until his assistant, The Hacker, turned against them. Marbles drained Hacker&#x27;s battery and banished him to the Northern Frontier, where he formulated a plan to launch a computer virus that would attack Motherboard.

When Jackie, Matt and Inez interact with a library map in the real world, they accidentally allow Hacker access to Motherboard and she becomes infected with the virus. The kids are brought into Cyberspace and join forces with Digit, a creation of the Hacker who escaped his control. Together they protect the world from the Hacker and his clumsy, accident-prone assistants, Buzz and Delete, until they can recover the Encryptor Chip, a device stolen by Hacker that can nullify the virus and bring Motherboard back to full strength.

Cyberspace consists of planet-like bodies called Cybersites, with each site having a theme such as Ancient Egypt, the American frontier, Greek mythology and amusement parks. These sites represent the diversity of websites on the Internet and reflect the many ecosystems and neighborhoods of Earth. The Cybersquad travels to many of these locations in order to protect them from Hacker and each inhabited Cybersite has a unique type of Cybercitizen they interact with.

==Characters==
===CyberSquad===
* Jackie (voiced by Novie Edwards) is a Jamaican-American girl who loves to keep things neat and organized in order to figure things out. Jackie&#x27;s biggest pet peeve is slimy and icky stuff like bugs and many other &quot;gross&quot; things. Like Inez, she was very fond of Slider. In a running gag in Seasons 1 &amp; 4, Jackie freaked out when in crisis, pacing for 2 or 5 seconds while trying to figure out a solution, saying &quot;Make room, I gotta pace!&quot;
* Matt (voiced by Jacqueline Pillon) is an Irish-American boy who likes skateboards and collecting things. He is impulsive, impatient, tells jokes and has a great interest in sports. He has a pig named Sherman on his family&#x27;s farm. Matt&#x27;s backpack contains his many yo-yos, which he is very good at using and often plays with one whenever he is thinking hard about something. He frequently calls Inez by the nickname &quot;Nezzie&quot;, much to her annoyance. It is also shown he can be quite protective of her at times.
* Inez (voiced by Annick Obonsawin) is a Hispanic American girl who has an excellent vocabulary for which the others often tease her. Despite being the youngest human member of the gang, she is the smartest one. Whenever she is thinking up a solution, Inez has a habit of doing headstands to help her concentrate.
* Digit, nicknamed Didge by various people and Didgey by Delete, (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried in seasons 1–13 and Ron Pardo in season 14–present), is a &quot;cybird&quot; (portmanteau of &quot;cyborg&quot; and bird), who works for Motherboard and is the kids&#x27; best friend. He and the kids protect Cyberspace and Motherboard from Hacker. Digit was originally created by Hacker and worked for him along with Buzz and Delete, but escaped after learning of Hacker&#x27;s true intentions. He became one of Motherboard&#x27;s helpers, serving as Dr. Marbles&#x27; assistant. Digit can fly by spinning his tail feathers in a helicopter-fashion or flapping his wings. However, he has a fear of heights and prefers to walk. He is a cook and wrote his popular cookbooks &quot;The Cyber Chef&quot; and &quot;Cookin&#x27; with the Didge&quot;. He carries many objects in his chest, including his miniature doppelgänger, Widget. He can turn his beak into just about anything and bends it on occasion. He also can disguise his voice very well.

===Villains===
* Hacker, also known as The Hacker, (voiced by Christopher Lloyd), is a mad scientist bent on conquering or creating ultimate chaos for Cyberspace, but he is almost always thwarted by the CyberSquad. Hacker was originally created by Doctor Marbles to assist Motherboard, but he rebelled and was exiled to Northern Frontier. Nevertheless, he does have the potential to become good again, as shown in a pair of episodes where he became a peaceful artist and when he helped the CyberSquad protect the trees in the Northern Frontier. He has a pair of cyborg lackeys, Buzz and Delete, whose reliability is quite variable; sometimes, he gets very peeved when he has to do things himself as Buzz and Delete cannot. 
* Buzz, nicknamed &quot;Buzzy&quot;, (voiced by Len Carlson in seasons 1–4, and Philip Williams in seasons 6–15), is one of Hacker&#x27;s henchmen. Buzz is a small spherical cyborg with a large mouth and scrawny limbs. Buzz seems to think he is a big tough guy; however, he can be kind at times and loves doughnuts. In later seasons, he and Delete have been on friendlier terms with the CyberSquad, occasionally joining their team to solve problems.
* Delete, nicknamed &quot;DeeDee&quot;, (voiced by Robert Tinkler), is one of Hacker&#x27;s henchmen. Delete is skinnier and taller than Buzz. Delete is loyal to Hacker for the most part but has occasionally helped the CyberSquad. Unlike Buzz, who is rougher around the edges, Delete is softer and more vulnerable to trickery and deceit. He cares deeply for three things; Buzz, whom he has a brotherly friendship with, his desired pet bunny George and Zanko, his fairy borg father. In later seasons, he and Buzz have been on friendlier terms with the CyberSquad, occasionally joining their team to solve problems.

===&quot;Cyberchase For Real&quot;===
* Harry Wilson (played by Matthew A. Wilson) is a character in the &quot;For Real&quot; segment. He often dresses in a nerdish style and wears horn-rimmed glasses and Converse shoes. In many of the segments, he is easily determined and free spirited yet rather careless, which usually costs him his current job. He is also very creative and thought out when he encounters a problem.
* Bianca DeGroat (played by herself) is a character in the &quot;For Real&quot; segment of the series. She often uses the original plot to solve everyday real world problems. As a character, she is rather absent-minded, arrogant and self-centered and does not think before she acts. She is seen to get carried away very easily.
* Booker Jones (played by Carter Jones)
* Courtney Chu (played by herself)

===Team Motherboard===
* Motherboard (voiced by Kristina Nicoll) is the benevolent ruler of Cyberspace and mentor to the CyberSquad. Her former assistant was Hacker who put a computer virus in her, but because her firewall was not fully uploaded before the virus hit, she was only left weakened. The CyberSquad tries to recover the Encryptor Chip and keep Motherboard safe from Hacker.
* Dr. Marbles (voiced by Richard Binsley) is a smart and brilliant mechanic who serves Motherboard. He is responsible for creating Hacker to help and defend Motherboard, although Hacker would later rebel against Motherboard and try to destroy her. A guilty Marbles would then downgrade Hacker&#x27;s power and banish him to the Northern Frontier for his misdeeds, right after Hacker vowed to return to finish Motherboard and Marbles off before conquering Cyberspace.
* Widget (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried) is a miniature doppelgänger of Digit and can even be stored in his chest. His hat, tail feathers and bow tie are not screwed on properly. He is younger than Digit and helps him when it is necessary.
* Teeny Weeny &quot;TW&quot; Parallini (voiced by Isabel de Carteret) is a young parallelogram who is not scared of Hacker and, despite the fact that her mother would not let her help the CyberSquad, she does help them find her uncle, Diamond Joe.
* Fluff (voiced by Austin Dilulio) is a penguin that plays ice hockey, which is hard in Cyberia. He is logical and does not buy into advertisements. Fluff is determined to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and make his family proud.
* Creech (voiced by Sugar Lyn Beard) is the young ruler of the Cybersite, Tikiville. She became the apparent Big Kahuna after competing in a race with other Tikiville-inhabitants as well as Hacker. Creech is in some ways similar to Inez, helping the two to become friends easily. Both have a fairly similar outlook: optimistic until something goes completely wrong and they both have a large vocabulary. She also is the person in charge of Tikiville&#x27;s Egg of Benedicta.
* Jules (voiced by Miklos Perlus) was first seen as a cave guard in the episode, &quot;Crystal Clear&quot; and is a good friend of the Cybersquad, but is often timid. He appears again in the episode, Jimaya Jam, where Hacker tricks him into pressing the nose of the Jam Master, causing Matt, Jackie, Creech and himself to get sucked into the chamber of Jimaya. He is often trying to find a job, but Hacker continuously tries to ruin it for him.
* Slider (voiced by Tim Hamaguchi) is a serious and James Dean-style 13-year-old skateboarder in Radopolis who builds and repairs skateboards and bikes. Since season 3, he has been a recurring character in the series. According to Slider, his father Coop had abandoned him when he was younger because Hacker had hunted Coop for many years. However, in the episode &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; he finds out that his father abandoned him to protect him and to make sure Hacker does not get an interface card that would allow Hacker to transform into whatever he wishes. If such were to happen, Hacker could cause immense chaos and even rule Cyberspace.

===Minor and guest stars===
&quot;Cyberchase&quot; has had many guest stars over the years, including Jasmine Guy, Tony Hawk, Al Roker and Geoffrey Holder. These guest stars appear as citizens of Cybersites, villains, animals, friends or rulers of the site.

==Episodes==

===Cyberchase For Real===
Each &quot;Cyberchase&quot; episode is followed by &quot;Cyberchase For Real&quot;, a live-action educational supplement linking concepts learned in the show to real life experiences. The actors Bianca DeGroat and Matthew A. Wilson (known as Harry Wilson on the show) are in their 30s, but amusingly act in a manner similar to the age of the target audience. &quot;For Real&quot; is produced by WNET in and around New York City after production is completed on the animated segments. These &quot;For Real&quot; segments are broadcast exclusively on PBS in the United States where the program runs longer and fills the time gap where there might be breaks for &quot;commercials&quot;. Some &quot;For Real&quot; segments can also be viewed online. In 2012, &quot;Oh Noah&quot;, shorts that teach kids to speak Spanish, were used instead of re-running the &quot;For Real&quot; segments. The &quot;For Real&quot; segment returned in season 9. Beginning with Season 11, DeGroat and Wilson were joined by Courtney Chu, who plays Harry&#x27;s niece, and Jaden Michael, who plays Bianca&#x27;s nephew. In later seasons, they assume the role of host for the live-action segments, along with other children, including Violet Tinnirello as Alex.

==Development==
===Conception===
&quot;Cyberchase&quot; was conceived in 1999 as an educational show that aims to show kids that math is everywhere and everyone can be good at it. The series encourages viewers to see, think, and do mathematics in their world. The show and supporting activities have been designed to support math education and reflect the curriculum standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The show&#x27;s philosophy is to foster enthusiasm for math, to model mathematic reasoning, to help children improve their problem-solving skills and to inspire all children to approach math with confidence and a &quot;can-do&quot; attitude. 

Later seasons place less emphasis on math and more on environmentalism and wellness. For example, in season 11, the theme of episode 2 is habitat fragmentation, episode 3 is about the effects of temperature on marine ecology, and episode 4 discusses using plants to improve indoor air quality.

===Production===
Originally, Thirteen produced the show in partnership with Ontario-based Nelvana Limited for PBS Kids. It aired on PBS Kids since 2002, and on V-me (dubbed in Spanish) and PBS Kids Go! from 2004 to 2013. Cyberchase has been animated by Pip Animation Services Inc. since season six; Right Path Pictures did post-production, and Curious Pictures did the original character design. 

Twelfth Root Music produces the sound track for Cyberchase. 

Thirteen/WNET New York and Nelvana Limited produced the first five seasons, while Thirteen, in association with Title Entertainment and WNET.ORG, produced seasons six and on. Seasons 1 to 5 used traditional animation, while the sixth season onward used Flash animation.

===Broadcast syndication===
The show was syndicated worldwide to countries like the United Kingdom until 2004.

===Brand extension===
There are two apps that &quot;Cyberchase&quot; has released to date:
# Cyberchase 3D Builder
# Cyberchase Shape Quest

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On the site &quot;Common Sense Media&quot;, the show was rated four out of five stars. The reviewer, Joly Herman, commented that &quot;the adventures aren&#x27;t scary, violent, or sexually inappropriate&quot; but &quot;require fortitude and brain power&quot;. Proposed discussion points sprouting from the series include &quot;Can your child take the skills learned in each episode and figure out how to apply it to everyday life?&quot; Herman noted that the only downside was that the adventures did not take place in the &quot;real world&quot; but added that the &quot;For Real&quot; segments solved this problem. 

Carey Bryson of &quot;About.com&quot; gave the show a rating of four out of five stars. Bryson noted that the series&#x27; explanations of &quot;simple mathematical idea[s]&quot; are &quot;usually explained well and woven throughout the story in a fun and interesting way&quot;. The review commended the series for its accessibility: &quot;Children can easily learn from the example in the cartoon story&quot; and praised the &quot;Cyberchase For Real segment that follows each episode&quot;. Citing an example from the series using codes, Bryson explained how the show could be used to expand upon the curriculum: &quot;Not only did [her five-year-old] learn about codes, but she also got in a ton of spelling practice&quot;. Bryson commended the series: &quot;Educationally, &quot;Cyberchase&quot; delivers&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Cyberchase&quot; has been nominated for five Daytime Emmys and won in 2007 in the Outstanding Broadband Program category. &quot;Cyberchase&quot; also won a CINE Golden Eagle in 2006.

<text>The Belize dollar (also known as the Belizean dollar) is the official currency in Belize (currency code &quot;BZD&quot;). It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign &quot;$&quot;, or alternatively &quot;BZ$&quot; to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.

It is divided into 100 cents. The official value is pegged at BZ$2 = .

==History==

In 1825, an imperial order-in-council was passed for the purpose of introducing the British sterling coinage into all the British colonies. This order-in-council made sterling coinage legal tender; it set the exchange rate between sterling and the Spanish dollar at = 4s 4d. This exchange rate was supposed to be based on the value of the silver in the Spanish dollars as compared to the value of the gold in the British sovereigns. The realistic exchange rate would have been = £1 (equivalent to = 4s 2d), and so the unrealistic exchange rate that was contained in the 1825 order-in-council led to the initiative being largely a failure. Remedial legislation came about in 1838 with a new order-in-council, which did not apply to the British North American colonies due to minor rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. The 1838 legislation introduced the correct rating of = 4s 2d.

When the original order-in-council of 1825 was introduced in Jamaica, Bermuda, and British Honduras, the local authorities set aside the mistaken rating of = 4s 4d, and they unofficially used the alternative rating of = 4s. The Bahamas would later adopt this same approach. When the 1838 remedial legislation came into force, sterling was well established in these territories, the Spanish dollar had been barred from circulation, and the authorities had no desire to adopt the devaluation that would have been associated with the correct rating of = 4s 2d. The British shilling, referred to locally as a &#x27;Maccaroni&#x27;, was equal to one quarter of a dollar, and the system was working very satisfactorily.

For a period in the middle of the nineteenth century British Honduras operated the British sterling monetary system just like Jamaica and Bermuda. In the wake of the international silver crisis of 1873 the silver peso of neighbouring Guatemala drove the British currency out of circulation. In an attempt to return British Honduras to the gold standard, and influenced by the fact that most imports were coming from New Orleans in the United States, a new currency was introduced into British Honduras based on the US dollar, bringing British Honduras into line with Canada.
At that time, the Canadian dollar was on the gold standard, and one Canadian dollar was equal to one American dollar. This is the point where the currency history of British Honduras diverges from that of the rest of the British West Indies. In 1885, 1 cent coins were issued, followed by higher denominations in 1894. This year also saw the first issue of banknotes by the government and a switch from the silver Guatemalan peso to the gold U.S. dollar as the base for the currency, with = 1 pound. The rate of as opposed to is explained by the fact that when the US dollar was first created in 1792, it was based on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. Hence, the US dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar. Following the introduction of the US dollar gold standard to British Honduras, the 25 cent coins were referred to as shillings due to their closeness in value to shilling sterling.

When the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the British Honduras dollar continued with its attachment to the US dollar and as such it did not become part of the sterling bloc. At the outbreak of the second world war, unlike in the case of Canada, Newfoundland, and Hong Kong, British Honduras did join the sterling area even though it maintained its fixed exchange rate with respect to the US dollar. The sterling bloc should not be confused with the sterling area. The former was a group of countries who pegged their local currencies to sterling when the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 1931, whereas the latter was an exchange control arrangement introduced as an emergency measure at the outbreak of the second world war.

In 1949 the British pound was devalued from to . Since the British Honduras dollar was pegged to the US dollar, this caused a sudden increase in the value of the British Honduran dollar relative to the pound. Protests ensued which led to a devaluation of the British Honduran dollar to a value of 70 U.S. cents (equal to 5 shillings sterling).

Following Harold Wilson&#x27;s devaluation of sterling in November 1967, the British Honduran dollar again devalued in sympathy with the British pound to 60 US cents. In 1978, the link to the British pound of BZ$4 = £1 was abandoned and once again the Belize unit was pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of BZ$2 = . The current rate with the US dollar reflects the devaluation of 50% in relation to the original parity with the US dollar in 1885, which last applied in 1949.

== Coins ==

In 1885, bronze 1 cent coins were introduced, followed by silver 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents in 1894. These coins were minted at the Royal Mint and their style was similar to that of other British colonial dollar fractional coinage used in Hong Kong and Canada. Cupronickel replaced silver in the 5 cents in 1907. This was itself replaced by nickel-brass in 1942.

In 1952, cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 25 cent coins, with the same happening for the 50 and 10 cents in 1954 and 1956, respectively. Following a reduction in size in 1954, the 1 cent coin switched to a scalloped shape in 1956. In 1976, aluminium 1 and 5 cent coins were introduced. A nickel-brass, decagonal 1 dollar coin was introduced in 1990.

== Banknotes ==

The Board of Commissioners of Currency operated from 1894 to 1976. In 1894, the government introduced notes in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dollars. Production of 50 and 100 dollars ceased after 1928. 20 dollar notes were introduced in 1952. British Honduras was officially renamed Belize in 1973, and the following year a new family of notes was introduced with the new country name. On November 1, 1976, the Monetary Authority of Belize was established, and took over note issuance. The first and only notes issued under its name were dated 1ST JUNE 1980, and included a 100-dollar note for the first time. The Central Bank of Belize was established on January 1, 1982, by the Central Bank of Belize Act No. 15 (Chapter 262 of the Laws of Belize Revised Edition 2000).

The first notes issued under its name were dated 1ST JULY 1983. Production of 50 dollar notes recommenced in 1990, the same year that the 1 dollar note was issued for the last time, and then replaced by a coin. On April 30, 2012, the Central Bank of Belize issued a commemorative note dated 01.01.12 (January 1, 2012) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Central Bank. It is similar to the current issue note, but with the addition of the jabiru stork and the commemorative text &quot;30th anniversary Central Bank of Belize&quot;. On the back of the commemorative note is the headquarters of the Central Bank of Belize in Belize City.

The Queen of Belize, Elizabeth II, appeared on all banknotes issued by the Central Bank of Belize. In July 2023 it was decided that future Belizean dollar bills would not feature King Charles III. New bills would instead depict Belizean nationals heroes including the late Right Honourable and Father of Belize’s Independence George Cadle Price and the Father of Democracy, the late Honourable Philip Goldson. The new design was unveiled in January 2025 including modern security features, and national symbols.

<doc id="457870" wikidata="Q1962284" url="?curid=457870" title="Louis Lumière">
<text>Louis Jean Lumière (; 5 October 1864 – 6 June 1948) was a French engineer and industrialist who played a key role in the development of photography and cinema.

==Early life and education==
Lumière was one of four children of Claude-Antoine Lumière, a photographer and painter, and his wife Jeanne-Joséphine (née Costille). At the Martinière Technical School he gained highest marks in his class.

==Career==
At age 17, Lumière invented a new process for film development using a dry plate. This process was significantly successful for the family business, permitting the opening of a new factory with an eventual production of 15 million plates per year. Thomas Edison&#x27;s Kinetoscope inspired his and his brother&#x27;s subsequent work on the cinematograph.

Louis Lumière is most often associated with the name of his brother, Auguste Lumière, under the name of the Lumière brothers. This comparison is a little excessive with regard to the invention of the cinematograph, since in reality, Auguste failed in his attempt to manufacture the first machine, and passed it to his brother who made the invention succeed. On the other hand, Louis was the director of all the first animated photographic views of the Lumière Society, which Auguste sometimes attended only as an amateur actor (&quot;Le Repas de bébé&quot;, &quot;La Pêche aux poissons rouges&quot;, &quot;Démolition d&#x27;un mur&quot;, etc.). But the contract signed between the two brothers provided that they be systematically associated, both morally and financially, in all their work and discoveries.

<text>Auguste Marie Louis Nicolas Lumière (; 19 October 1862 – 10 April 1954) was a French engineer, industrialist, biologist, and illusionist. In 1894 and 1895, he and his brother Louis invented an animated photographic camera and projection device, the cinematograph, which met with worldwide success.

==Life==
Lumière was born in Besançon. He attended the Martinière Technical School and worked as a manager at the photographic company of his father, Claude-Antoine Lumière. He was invited to attend a demonstration of the Kinetoscope invented by Thomas Edison, which inspired his and his brother&#x27;s work on the cinematograph. The brothers screened their first film using this device in December 1895, and following the success of this initial venture opened a number of cinemas worldwide. However, Auguste was skeptical of the potential of the device, remarking &quot;My invention can be exploited... as a scientific curiosity, but apart from that it has no commercial value whatsoever&quot;.

After his work on the cinematograph Lumière began focusing on the biomedical field, becoming a pioneer in the use of X-rays to examine fractures. He also contributed to innovations in military aircraft, producing a catalytic heater to allow cold-weather engine starts. He died in Lyon, aged 91.

<text>Mary Margaret &quot;Mollie&quot; Kaye (21 August 1908 – 29 January 2004) was a British writer. Her most famous book is &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; (1978).

==Life==
M. M. Kaye was born in Simla, British India, and lived in an Oakland, Shimla, a heritage property from 1915 to 1918. She was the elder daughter and one of three children born to Sir Cecil Kaye and his wife, Margaret Sarah Bryson. Cecil Kaye was an intelligence officer in the Indian Army. M. M. Kaye&#x27;s grandfather, brother and husband all served the British Raj. Her grandfather&#x27;s cousin, Sir John William Kaye, wrote the standard accounts of the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and the First Afghan War. At 10, Mollie Kaye, as she was then known, was sent to England to attend boarding school. She subsequently studied children&#x27;s book illustration and earned money by designing Christmas cards. In 1926, she briefly returned to live with her family in India, but after her father&#x27;s death, she was displeased by her mother&#x27;s pressure to find a junior officer to marry and so returned to England living in London on a small pension based on her late father&#x27;s army career, augmented first by earnings from illustrating children&#x27;s books and from 1937 from the publication of children&#x27;s books written by Kaye. Her first adult novel, &quot;Six Bars at Seven&quot;, published in 1940, was a thriller that Kaye had been moved to write by regularly reading that type of books from the Fourpenny Library: &quot;Most of the stuff I was reading was total rubbish, and I used to think I couldn&#x27;t write worse. So I sat down and wrote one.&quot;

The £64 that she received for &quot;Six Bars at Seven&quot; enabled Kaye to return to Simla, where she lived with her married sister, Dorothy Elizabeth Pardey. In June 1941, Kaye met her future husband. The British Indian Army officer, Godfrey John Hamilton was four years her junior and reportedly proposed to Kaye on five days&#x27; acquaintance. Kaye was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s second child when she and Hamilton were able to marry on Armistice Day 1945, Hamilton&#x27;s first marriage having been dissolved. After her second child&#x27;s 1946 birth Kaye returned to writing. (Hamilton&#x27;s first wife, Mary Penelope Colthurst, lived in Ireland with the couple&#x27;s daughter. Kaye would later state of her affair with Hamilton, &quot;We just couldn&#x27;t wait. Had it been peacetime, I wouldn&#x27;t have done it because of the way I had been brought up. But these were the pressures of war&quot;.) After the 1947 dissolution of the British Indian Army because India&#x27;s achieved independence, Hamilton had transferred to the British Army, where his career necessitated him and his family to relocate 27 times over the next 29 years, with Kaye using several of those locales in a series of crime novels. That inaugurated the rise of the pen name M. M. Kaye, the writer&#x27;s previous published works having been credited to Mollie Kaye. Kaye&#x27;s literary agent was Paul Scott, who had been an army officer in India and would find fame as author of &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;. It was with Scott&#x27;s encouragement that Kaye wrote her first historical epic of India &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; published in 1957. The focal background of &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; is the Sepoy Mutiny with which Kaye had been familiarised but stories heard as a child from her family&#x27;s native servants. That early interest being reinforced in the mid-1950s, when Kaye, on a visit to friends, in India chanced on some transcripts of trials attendant on the Sepoy Mutiny in a shed on her friends&#x27; property. Kaye would later state her displeasure over the original published version of &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot; being edited without her knowledge, with sections focused on action, rather than romance, being largely deleted.

Kaye&#x27;s second historical novel, &quot;Trade Wind&quot;, was published in 1963. Kaye, inspired by a visit to India, then planned to commence work on an epic novel with the Second Anglo-Afghan War as its background, but she was diagnosed with lung cancer. The prognosis was later changed to lymphosarcoma; enervated by chemotherapy, she was unable to write until she was back in good health, with a resultant delay in the start of her writing the masterpiece &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;, until 1967, when Kaye and the newly-retired Hamilton became longtime residents of the Sussex hamlet of Boreham Street.

Published in 1978, &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; became a worldwide bestseller on publication and caused the successful republishing of &quot;Shadow of the Moon&quot;, with the previously-deleted sections restored, &quot;Trade Wind&quot; and Kaye&#x27;s crime novels. Kaye also wrote and illustrated &quot;The Ordinary Princess&quot;, a children&#x27;s book that was called &quot;refreshingly unsentimental&quot; by an article in &quot;Horn Book Magazine&quot;. She originally it wrote as a short story, and wrote a half-a-dozen detective novels, including &quot;Death in Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Death in Zanzibar&quot;. Her autobiography has been published in three volumes and was collectively entitled &quot;Share of Summer: The Sun in the Morning, Golden Afternoon,&quot; and &quot;Enchanted Evening&quot;.

In March 2003, Kaye was awarded the Colonel James Tod International Award by the Maharana Mewar Foundation of Udaipur, Rajasthan, for her &quot;contribution of permanent value reflecting the spirit and values of Mewar.&quot;

Widowed in 1985, Kaye lived with her sister in a wing of Kaye&#x27;s older daughter&#x27;s house in Hampshire from 1987. Kaye relocated to Suffolk in 2001 and was residing in Lavenham when she died on 29 January 2004, aged 95. At sunset on 4 March 2006, Kaye&#x27;s ashes were scattered over the waters from a boat in the middle of Lake Pichola. The duty was performed by Michael Ward, the producer of the West End musical version of &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;, and his wife, Elaine. A grandson is the comedian James Bachman.

<doc id="457875" wikidata="Q4862908" url="?curid=457875" title="Baron Wharton">
<text>Baron Wharton is a title in the Peerage of England, originally granted by letters patent to the heirs male of the 1st Baron, which was forfeited in 1729 when the last male-line heir was declared an outlaw. The Barony was erroneously revived in 1916 by writ of summons, thanks to an 1844 decision in the House of Lords based on absence of documentation. As such, the current Barony of Wharton could more accurately be listed as a new Barony, created in 1916, with the precedence of the older (and extinct) Barony.

==The barony of 1544==

The title Baron Wharton was created in 1544 by letters patent for Sir Thomas Wharton, who had previously served as a Member of Parliament for Cumberland, in recognition of his victory at the Battle of Solway Moss. Because of its creation by letters patent, the Barony could only be passed down to male heirs.

The 5th Baron (1648–1715) had a long and distinguished political career, serving at various times as a Member of Parliament, Lord Lieutenant of Oxford and Buckingham, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Privy Seal. He was created Earl of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, and Viscount Winchendon, of Winchendon in the County of Buckingham, in 1706, in the Peerage of England, and in 1715 was further created Marquess of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, and Marquess of Malmesbury, in the County of Wilts, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Later that year, he was also created Marquess of Catherlough, Earl of Rathfarnham, in the County of Dublin, and Baron Trim, in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland. (The Marquessate of Catherlough referred to the town now spelled Carlow.)

His son, the 2nd Marquess (1698–1731), was created Duke of Wharton, in the County of Westmorland, in the Peerage of Great Britain, in 1718, but all the titles were forfeit in 1729 when the Duke of Wharton was declared an outlaw. In any event, since on the Duke&#x27;s death there were no male heirs of the 1st Baron remaining, all the titles would have become extinct at that point.

==The Barony revived, or new Barony created==

In 1844, however, the Barony was claimed by Colonel Charles Kemeys-Tynte, and, since the document creating the peerage had been lost, the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords ruled erroneously that the Barony was created by writ and could therefore be passed down through the female line. As a consequence of their resolution, it was determined that at the death of the Duke of Wharton, the Barony had fallen into abeyance between the Duke&#x27;s sisters, Lady Jane Holt and Lady Lucy Morice. It was further determined that, at Lady Lucy&#x27;s death in 1739, Lady Jane (by now Lady Jane Coke) remained the sole heir, and had been therefore entitled to the Barony. Finally, it was determined that at her death the Barony again fell into abeyance, where it remained in the nineteenth century. The Committee for Privileges, however, also ruled that it did not have the authority to terminate the abeyance because of the existence of a judgement of outlawry against the Duke of Wharton. Thus the matter remained unresolved for 72 years.

On 15 February 1916, the abeyance was terminated by a writ of summons from King George V to Parliament in favour of Charles Theodore Halswell Kemeys-Tynte, who became the 8th Baron. (He should be more properly listed as the 1st Baron Wharton, of the new barony.) At his death, the title was inherited successively by his son and thereafter by his daughter, Elisabeth, who became the 10th Baroness. At her death in 1974, the Barony again fell into abeyance, between her two daughters. It was once again revived in 1990, when the abeyance was terminated in favour of Myrtle Robertson. At her death, the Barony was inherited by her son Myles.

==Early Whartons==
The Wharton baronetcy dates from 6 October 1292 when King Edward I granted to Gilbert de Querton &quot;the Manor of Querton with its appurtenances.&quot; (&quot;Querton&quot; was the earlier Latin spelling of &quot;Wharton&quot;) There de Querton built Lammerside for himself and his wife, Emma de Hastings. (The remains of the building still stand and today resemble a pele tower). Emma was the daughter of Nicholas de Hastings of the family which were the ancestors of the present Earls of Huntingdon and of Pembroke.

The descendants of Sir Gilbert were:
*Sir Henry de Querton (–aft.1343)
*Sir Hugh de Querton (–bef.1389)
*Sir William de Wherton (–bef.1417)
*Sir John de Wharton (–1434)
*Sir Thomas de Wherton ()
*Sir Henry Wharton (–?)
*Sir Thomas Wharton II (1460 or 1465–1531)
*Sir Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton (–1568)

<doc id="457878" wikidata="Q7842556" url="?curid=457878" title="Trinity (role-playing game)">
<text>Trinity Continuum: Æon is a science fiction role-playing game previously published by White Wolf Game Studio in 1997 (and later by the ArtHaus imprint) under the name Trinity. The current game is owned and published by Onyx Path Publishing.

==History==
White Wolf had a hole in their 1997 publishing schedule, so CEO Steve Wieck asked designer Andrew Bates to come up with new a role-playing game, and Bates was able to bring science-fiction game &quot;ÆON&quot; (1997) from idea to publication in only 10 months. &quot;ÆON&quot; was intended to start an entirely new trilogy of games, and while its game rules were a variant of the Storytelling System, &quot;ÆON&quot; was meant to appeal to more action-oriented players than the World of Darkness. &quot;ÆON&quot; ran into problems early in its development when Viacom filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of their trademark for the &quot;Aeon Flux&quot; television series; White Wolf stickered over the names on the first printing of &quot;ÆON&quot; with the new name of the game, &quot;Trinity&quot;. With the success White Wolf was having with its ArtHaus imprint, low-settling games with high acclaim were increasingly added to ArtHaus, which brought &quot;Trinity&quot; to the imprint in 2000. ArtHaus produced d20 &quot;Trinity&quot; books to see how it would sell before trying d20 with the other White Wolf game universes, but &quot;Trinity d20&quot; (2004) did not perform well in a weakened d20 market.

Five years after White Wolf&#x27;s acquisition by CCP Games, CCP decided to shut down their traditional publishing endeavors. White Wolf&#x27;s Creative Director, Richard Thomas, founded Onyx Path Publishing in 2012, and acquired the Trinity Universe, Scarred Lands, and Scion. After several years of publishing licensed material for White Wolf&#x27;s World of Darkness and Exalted settings, the company was deemed stable enough to create a new system (the Storypath System) and new editions of both Scion and the now-renamed Trinity Continuum.

==Description==
&quot;Trinity&quot; was the first installment in the Trinity Universe series of games (the two others being &quot;Aberrant&quot; and &quot;Adventure!&quot;) sharing a common background and developing an alternate history of humanity through two centuries, and allowing players to play almost all genres of science fiction - from comic-book superhero action to cutting edge technothriller, space opera, and old-fashioned pulp standards. Though it had a vocal fanbase the whole game line was discontinued due to low sales in 2001; an adaptation for the d20 system was released in 2004. Onyx Path Publishing acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe in 2012, and released a new edition. The basic rules used for the Trinity Continuum were released in the &quot;Trinity Continuum Core Rulebook&quot;, while the futuristic science-fiction setting was released as an expansion under the name &quot;Trinity Continuum: Æon&quot; in 2019.

== Setting ==
Set in the 22nd century, &quot;Trinity Continuum: Æon&quot; portrays a future Earth slowly recovering from a disastrous war (the origins of which are covered in &quot;Aberrant&quot;) and expanding in space. Former depressed areas such as Africa, South America and Eastern Asia, which suffered moderate traumas during the Aberrant War are now the leading political forces in the international arena, while Europe is a landscape of ruins and hard struggling survivors, and North America is under a fascist regime (the Federated States of America, or FSA). Bio-engineering is the leading technology and psionics are known and studied if not exactly widespread. Alien contact has been made, with mixed results. Characters take the roles of psionic individuals, working for one of the many organizations in the gaming world, and tackling troubles when they arise. The game setting, which is detailed in a number of supplements, allows for a variety of styles, from cyberpunk-like corporate espionage to &quot;Mad Max&quot;-style post-holocaust frontier adventure, to space exploration.

===Orders===
Players have a choice of six &quot;Orders&quot; for their characters to join. Each Order possesses a mastery over a specific &quot;Aptitude&quot;, a category of psionic powers. Each Order is based in a specific geographic location, often the homeland of its founder, and is heavily influenced by local culture. Actually, there are eight &quot;Orders&quot; in the Trinity Universe, but one only became playable after some metaplot hooks made it so, and the other has almost been exterminated by the year where the playable timeline begins.

;The Æsculapian Order
:Based in Europe, this Order is a global medical clinic first and foremost; its members fulfill the roles of combat medics, healers and scientists. They teach the Aptitude of vitakinesis, the usage of the mind to heal the body.

;Interplanetary School for Research and Advancement
:Based on the Moon, this Order is a quasi-monastic school of philosophy associated with the real religion the Baháʼí Faith (see popular media references). Its members learn clairsentience and use their sensory powers to become scouts and detectives.

;The Legions
:Based in Austronesia, these are high tech military corps (similar to that found in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;), using the powers of psychokinesis to protect humanity from extrasolar threats.

;Ministry of Psionic Affairs
:Also called the Ministry of Noetic Affairs, this cloak and dagger spy agency is based in China and a part of the Chinese government. Members are skilled in telepathy and are the most secretive and mistrusted of the Orders for their abilities.

;Nova Força Nacional (Portuguese for &quot;The New National Force&quot;)
:Also known as the &quot;Norça&quot;, this Order takes the form of a vigilante militia, based somewhere in the jungles of South America. They wield the powers of biokinesis, and possess complete biological mastery over their physical forms. They are as widely, if not more, distrusted than the Ministry.

;Orgotek
:A multinational technology corporation headquartered in North America, its members are all employees in some fashion or another. They can control the electromagnetic spectrum with the electrokinesis Aptitude. They often take the role of technical experts and engineers.

;Upeo wa Macho (Swahili for &quot;Horizon&quot;)
:The Upeo are an African trade organization with the teleportation Aptitude. Although they had been missing for six years as of the core rules, they have since returned, although their absence has not altogether been explained to the public. With their return, regular contact with extrasolar colonies is being re-established.

;Chitra Bhanu
:The Chibs are an Indian physics laboratory with the ability to manipulate the nuclear forces of the universe (quantakinesis). They were exterminated because the other Psi Orders claimed that they had an alliance with the monstrous Aberrants, although there have been rumors of survivors either hiding on their own, or working secretly for other orders.

== System ==
The game originally ran on a modified version of the White Wolf Storyteller System. A reprint was announced in late 2003 of the three Trinity Universe games using the Open Gaming License 3.5 rules, also known as the d20 System. The current version, by Onyx Path Publishing, became one of the first games to use the Storypath variant of Storyteller.

== Naming issue ==
&quot;Trinity&quot; was originally to be known as &quot;Æon&quot; (thus leading to all three games in the line having titles starting with an A), and was originally issued under that title in its hardback and deluxe versions. Legal issues arose with the holders of the rights for the animated series &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, which claimed the game challenged their trademarks. The matter was settled by White Wolf choosing to change the name of its game, and leaving &quot;Æon&quot; as the unofficial name for the whole line. Early copies of the game had a sticker with the new &quot;Trinity&quot; logo covering the original &quot;Æon&quot; logo.

Once White Wolf sold the IP to Onyx Path Publishing, the old Æon name returned as Trinity Continuum: Æon.

==Reception==
The reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot; #29 (Jan./Feb., 1998) stated that &quot;Hope. Sacrifice. Unity. Strong words used to define the spirit of &quot;Trinity&quot;, the new science-fiction roleplaying game from White Wolf.&quot;

<text>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA; &quot;気象庁, Kishō-chō&quot;) is a division of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism dedicated to the scientific observation and research of natural phenomena. Headquartered in Minato, Tokyo the agency collects data on meteorology, hydrology, seismology, volcanology, and other related fields. 

The JMA is responsible for collecting and disseminating weather data and forecasts to the public, as well as providing specialized information for aviation and marine sectors. Additionally, the JMA issues warnings for volcanic eruptions and is integral to the nationwide Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system. As one of the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers designated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the JMA also forecasts, names, and distributes warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northwestern Pacific region. This includes areas such as the Celebes Sea, the Sulu Sea, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk.

== Services ==
=== Overview ===
The JMA is responsible for observing, gathering and reporting weather data and forecasts, and warning for earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and volcanic eruptions.

The agency has six regional administrative offices (including five DMOs and Okinawa Meteorological Observatory), four Marine Observatories, five auxiliary facilities, four Aviation Weather Service Centers and 47 local offices composed of the LMOs. These are also used to gather data, supplemented by weather satellites such as &quot;Himawari&quot;, and other research institutes.

In 1968, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) designated the JMA as a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) for Asia. In June 1988, the WMO also assigned the JMA as a RSMC for the Northwestern Pacific under its Tropical Cyclone programme. In July 1989, the RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center was established within the headquarters office, which dealt with the forecasting and dissemination of active tropical cyclones, as well as preparing a summary of each year&#x27;s cyclone activity.

=== Observation and forecast ===
==== Weather ====
===== Land weather =====
Each DMO and LMO issues weather forecasts and warnings or advisories to the general public live in its own area. Weather data used to these forecasts are acquired from the Surface Observation (represented by the AMeDAS), the Radar Observation, the Observation and the Satellite Observation mainly using the &quot;Himawari&quot; series of satellites.

===== Marine weather =====
The Marine Observatories are seated in Hakodate, Maizuru, Kobe, Nagasaki. These stations observe ocean waves, tide levels, sea surface temperatures and ocean currents etc. in the Northwestern Pacific basin, as well as the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and provide marine meteorological forecasts in cooperation with the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department, Japan Coast Guard.

===== Aviation weather =====
In 2005, in accordance with the ICAO&#x27;s new CNS/ATM system, the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism set up the Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) in Fukuoka, where the FIR is fixed. Along with this establishment, JMA placed the Air Traffic Mateorology Center (ATMetC) inside the ATMC.

The agency forecasts SIGMET for aircraft in flight within the Fukuoka FIR airspace, while VOLMET is broadcast by each Aviation Weather Service Center at the airports of Haneda, Narita, Centrair, and Kansai. 

===== Tropical cyclones =====
In the Northwestern Pacific area, the typhoon season ordinarily comes almost from May to November. The JMA forecasts and warns or advises on tropical cyclones to the public in Japan and its surrounding countries as the RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center.

==== Earthquakes ====
The JMA has 624 observation stations across Japan which are set up at intervals of 20 km approximately in order to measure the seismic intensity of earthquakes precisely. The agency also utilizes about 2,900 seismographs owned by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) and local governments. A 24-hour office is housed within the JMA headquarters in Tokyo for monitoring and tracking seismic events in the vicinity of Japan to collect and process their data, which distributes observed earthquake information on its hypocenter, magnitude, seismic intensity and possibility of tsunami occurrence after quakes quickly to the public through the Earthquake Phenomena Observation System (EPOS). The Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system began to work fully for the general public on October 1, 2007.

The agency is one of the representatives of the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction.

==== Tsunamis ====
In case of a possibility of tsunami after an earthquake, JMA issues Tsunami Warning or Advisory for each region in Japan with information of estimated tsunami heights and arrival times within 2 to 3 minutes of the quake.

==== Volcanoes ====
The agency four Volcanic Observations and Information Centers within DMOs in Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Fukuoka. These centers monitor volcanic events on 110 active volcanos in Japan. 47 of these volcanos selected by the Coordinating Committee for Prediction of Volcanic Eruption are under 24-hour observation with seismographs, accelerometers, GPS, air-shock recorders, fixed point observation cameras and other equipment. If it is predicted that a volcanic eruption will affect inhabited areas or around a crater, Volcanic Warnings are issued and supplemented by Volcanic Alert Levels.

<text>Philip Hauge Abelson (April 27, 1913 – August 1, 2004) was an American physicist, scientific editor and science writer. Trained as a nuclear physicist, he co-discovered the element neptunium, worked on isotope separation in the Manhattan Project, and wrote the first study of nuclear marine propulsion for submarines. He later worked on a broad range of scientific topics and related public policy, including organic geochemistry, paleobiology and energy policy.

Abelson served as editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Science&quot; from 1962–84, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1971–78, and president of the American Geophysical Union from 1972-74. His frequent editorials in &quot;Science&quot;, both during and after his term as editor, became known for their strident and thought-provoking views. A collection of 100 of his editorials was published as a book, entitled &quot;Enough of Pessimism&quot;. He may have been the original source of the phrase &#x27;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&#x27;.

==Life==
Abelson was born on April 27, 1913, in Tacoma, Washington, to Norwegian immigrant parents. He attended Washington State University, where he received degrees in chemistry and physics, and the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), where he earned his PhD in nuclear physics. As a young physicist, he worked for Ernest Lawrence at the UC Berkeley. He was among the first American scientists to verify nuclear fission in an article submitted to &quot;Physical Review&quot; in February 1939. From 1939 until 1941, he worked as an assistant physicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. It was while he was here that he worked on a substance that emitted beta rays and was produced by irradiation of uranium with neutrons. After he collaborated with the Nobel Prize laureate Luis Alvarez they isolated the material, and became the co-discoverer of neptunium on 8 June 1940 with Edwin McMillan. McMillan was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery among other elements.

Abelson was a key contributor to the Manhattan Project during World War II, while working with the Naval Research Laboratory. Although he was not formally associated with the atom bomb project, the liquid thermal diffusion isotope separation technique that he invented at the Philadelphia Navy Yard was used in the S-50 plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and proved a critical step in creating the large amount of nuclear fuel required for building atomic bombs.

After the war, he turned his attention under the guidance of Ross Gunn to applying nuclear power to naval propulsion. While not written at an engineering-design level, he wrote the first physics report detailing how a nuclear reactor could be installed in a submarine, providing both propulsion and electrical power. His report anticipated the nuclear submarine&#x27;s role as a missile platform. This concept was later supported by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover and others. Under Rickover, the concept became reality in the form of , the world&#x27;s first nuclear submarine.

In 1946, he returned to work at the Carnegie Institution, which published his report &quot;Atomic Energy Submarine,&quot; in March of that year. From 1953 until 1971 he served as the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington&#x27;s Geophysical Laboratory, and as president from 1971 to 1978, and as a trustee from 1978 on. From 1962 to 1984 he was editor of &quot;Science&quot;, one of the most prestigious academic journals, and served as its acting executive officer in 1974, 1975 and 1984. From 1972 until 1974 he served as the president of the American Geophysical Union.

Abelson was outspoken and well known for his opinions on science. In a 1964 editorial published in &quot;Science&quot; magazine, Abelson identified overspecialization in science as a form of bigotry. He outlined his view that the pressure towards specialization beginning in undergraduate study and intensifying in PhD programs leads students to believe that their area of specialization is the most important, even to the extreme view that other intellectual pursuits are worthless. He reasoned that such overspecialization led to obsolescence of one&#x27;s work, often through a focus on trivial aspects of a field, and that avoidance of such bigotry was essential to guiding the direction of one&#x27;s work.

In a 1965 article he described his work in paleobiology and reported evidence of amino acids recovered from fossils hundreds of millions of years in age and fatty acids in rocks dating over a billion years old. He estimated that based on his experiments alanine would be stable for billions of years.

Abelson may have been the original source of the phrase &#x27;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&#x27;, which he used in 1978 and was subsequently popularised by Carl Sagan.

Perhaps his most famous work from this time period is an editorial entitled &quot;Enough of Pessimism&quot; (&quot;enough of pessimism, it only leads to paralysis and decay&quot;). This became the title of a 100 essay collection.

During the 1970s he became interested in the problem of world energy supplies. Books on the topic include &quot;Energy for Tomorrow&quot; (1975), from a series of lectures at the University of Washington, and &quot;Energy II: Use Conservation and Supply&quot;. He pointed out the possibilities of mining the Athabascan tar sands, as well as oil shale in the Colorado Rockies. In addition, he urged conservation and a change of attitude towards public transit.

After 1984, he remained associated with the magazine. Some have claimed him to be an early skeptic of the case for global warming on the basis of a lead editorial in the magazine dated March 31, 1990, in which he wrote, &quot;[I]f the global warming situation is analyzed applying the customary standards of scientific inquiry one must conclude that there has been more hype than solid fact.&quot; However, this contrasts what is said in a US National Research Council, Energy and Environment report on which his name appears along with Thomas F. Malone over a decade earlier in 1977:

Abelson died on August 1, 2004, from respiratory complications following a brief illness. He was married to Neva Abelson, a distinguished research physician who co-discovered Rh factor testing (with L. K. Diamond). Their daughter, Ellen Abelson Cherniavsky, worked as an aviation researcher for the MITRE corporation in Virginia.

==Awards and legacy==
Abelson received many distinguished awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1987, the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Distinguished Achievement Award, the American Medical Association&#x27;s Scientific Achievement Award, the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award and the Waldo E. Smith Award in 1988. In 1992 he was awarded the Public Welfare Medal, the National Academy of Sciences&#x27;s highest honor. He was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1949 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1961.

The mineral abelsonite is named after Abelson in recognition of his contribution to organic geochemistry.

The Philip and Neva Abelson Hall at Washington State University was named in his honor.

The AAAS Philip Hauge Abelson Prize is named after Philip Abelson.

<text>Alyson Rae Stoner (born August 11, 1993) is an American actor, singer, and dancer. Their film roles include &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; (2005), and the &quot;Step Up&quot; franchise (2006–2014). Their television roles include serving as the host of Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mike&#x27;s Super Short Show&quot; (2001–2007), playing Max in &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; (2005–2007), voicing Isabella Garcia-Shapiro in &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; (2007–2015; 2025–present), and portraying Caitlyn in &quot;Camp Rock&quot; (2008) and &quot;Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam&quot; (2010).

Stoner has been a background dancer for several artists including Missy Elliott, Eminem, Kumbia Kings, Outkast, and Will Smith. They lent their voice to the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; franchise (2008–2020) and the &quot;Holly Hobbie &amp; Friends&quot; series of animated television specials (2006–2008). They also released twelve singles and two extended plays.

==Early life==
Stoner was born in Toledo, Ohio, the child of LuAnne Hodges (née Adams), a former executive secretary at Owens-Illinois, and Charlie Stoner. While growing up in Toledo, Stoner attended Maumee Valley Country Day School and studied ballet, tap dance, and jazz dance at the O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Dance Studio. They also modeled and trained at the Margaret O&#x27;Brien Modeling Studio. They won Best Model of the Year at the International Modeling and Talent Association Convention in New York City under O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s studio in 2000.

==Career==

===Acting===
In 2001, Stoner became the co-host of the Disney Channel &quot;Mike&#x27;s Super Short Show&quot; along with Michael Alan Johnson, an infomercial segment regarding forthcoming Disney releases. In 2003 and 2005, they appeared as Sarah, one of the twelve Baker children, in the successful comedies &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; and &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;. They have also appeared in several television shows aimed at the preteen audience, including &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;.

In 2006, they had a small film role in &quot;Step Up&quot; as Camille, Channing Tatum&#x27;s character&#x27;s younger foster sister. They provided the voice of Isabella Garcia-Shapiro and Jenny (until Season 4) in the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; from 2007 to 2015. In 2008, they starred in the Disney Channel Original film &quot;Camp Rock&quot; as Caitlyn Gellar, an aspiring music producer. Their reception in &quot;Camp Rock&quot; was particularly strong, with various media outlets suggesting it was about time they played a main character role having backed up for other big names such as Will Smith and Eminem. Stoner starred as Alice McKinley in the film &quot;Alice Upside Down&quot;, based loosely on the Alice series, particularly &quot;The Agony of Alice&quot; by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. This was their second starring role and, according to an interview that appears on the direct-to-DVD release, they stated that this was the first time they had to appear in every scene in a film.

In 2010, Stoner appeared in the third &quot;Step Up&quot; film &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; opposite Adam Sevani where they reprised the role. Stoner uploaded a video onto their official YouTube page of her final dance rehearsal which introduced other cast members. The same year, Stoner returned to reprise their role as Caitlyn Gellar in &quot;Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Camp Rock&quot;. Stoner also guest-starred in the television drama series &quot;House&quot; as a skater.

They also appeared in &quot;Wii Fit&quot; related videos on the Nintendo Channel on the Wii video game console demonstrating balance exercises. Stoner replaced Hayden Panettiere as the voice of Kairi in &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories&quot;, Xion in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, and both characters in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. They voiced the character Opal in seasons three and four of &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;.

=== Singing ===
In 2008, they sang two songs, &quot;Lost and Found&quot; and &quot;Free Spirit&quot;, from the soundtrack of &quot;Alice Upside Down,&quot; in which they played the lead role. They have also recorded a cover version of the song &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot; for the 2009 &quot;Space Buddies&quot;. 

On April 4, 2010, Stoner posted a video to their YouTube Channel announcing the release of their debut single &quot;Flying Forward&quot; on April 20, 2010. Stoner released their debut EP entitled &quot;Beat the System&quot; in 2011. Also in 2011, Stoner started working with record producers, songwriters and a vocal coach to change their vocal style from &quot;kiddie-pop&quot; to a more soulful pop vibe with a little alternative edge for their first studio album.

===Dancing===
After choreography training in Los Angeles, Stoner appeared as a backup dancer in several music videos, notably Missy Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Work It&quot;, &quot;Gossip Folks&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Really Hot&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Just Lose It&quot;, and &quot;No Tengo Dinero&quot; by the Kumbia Kings. They have also been a backup dancer for Outkast at the 2004 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and for Will Smith at the 2005 show. Stoner danced with a dancing group called The JammX Kids between 2003 and 2006. They quit the group in early 2006 due to scheduling conflicts, but continued to work with the individual kids on different jobs. They were also one of the dancers in the special features for the &quot;Shark Tale&quot; DVD.

Stoner teaches hip hop classes at the Millennium Dance Complex, and is credited as the youngest person to teach a master class there. They also appeared in Debby Ryan&#x27;s &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; for Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Radio Rebel&quot;. In February 2015, they released a dance tribute video to Missy Elliot featuring a mash up medley of Missy Elliott videos they had danced in when they were younger. Within the first week, it received more than 12 million views. Missy Elliott invited Alyson to perform &quot;Work It&quot; with her at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards.

===Publishing===
Stoner was the &quot;dance editor&quot; for &quot;KEWL Magazine&quot;. In February 2009, Stoner released the &quot;Alyson Stoner Project&quot; described as &quot;a dance video hybrid — melding many styles of entertainment into one package&quot;. It was directed by Kevin Schmidt, their co-star from &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In March 2018, Stoner came out in an article on &quot;Teen Vogue&quot;, stating they were &quot;attracted to men, women, and people who identify in other ways.&quot; Later that year they stated in an interview &quot;I don&#x27;t feel comfortable labeling my sexual orientation or even faith at the moment.&quot; In June 2023, Stoner stated that they use they/them pronouns and they had been fired from a television show after coming out as queer.

Stoner has been open about their struggles with mental health and eating disorders. According to Stoner, they first developed anxiety at age six due to the high-stress environment of working in the entertainment industry with symptoms including heart palpitations, hair loss, and seizures. In 2011, at age 17, they were hospitalized and checked themself into a rehab facility for eating disorders, having struggled with anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder for years. They credit therapy for assisting in their recovery.

<text>TT scale (from &quot;table top&quot;) is a model railroading scale at 1:120 scale with a track gauge of 12mm between the rails. It is placed between HO scale (1:87) and N scale (1:160). Its original purpose, as the name suggests, was to make a train set small enough to assemble and operate on a tabletop.

The scale originated in the USA, but is today widespread mainly in Central Europe, thanks to &quot;Berliner-TT-Bahnen&quot;, a defunct East German manufacturer of train sets in TT. It is the second-most popular scale in Central Europe and Russia, after HO, with several manufacturers based in countries such as Germany and the Czech Republic, and was reintroduced to the United Kingdom in 2022. Adherents to the scale maintain it is the smallest practical scale, especially for those who like to build models from scratch. 

In wargaming, TT scale equals the 15 mm scale where the height of &quot;standard&quot; soldier height is . For British 3mm TT scale, see 3 mm scale.

==History==
TT scale was invented in the United States by Hal Joyce, a former automotive designer. He founded a company, H. P. Products, in 1945, and the first advertisement appeared in 1946. The product line included locomotive kits, passenger and freight car kits, track and detail parts. By the early 1950s, it had a following, offering less detail than HO—considered by some to be an advantage at the time—and a lower price than most other scales. Numerous other companies began offering TT scale trains, track, and accessories as well. In the immediate period afterward, several other American manufacturers also began production of TT items, notably the Kemtron Corporation (founded by Levon Kemalyan), which manufactured metal castings in several scales. 

In Europe, Rokal and Zeuke (which became Berliner-TT-Bahnen and ultimately Tillig) began production in West and East Germany respectively towards the end of the 1950s. British Tri-ang Railways also introduced the scale to the UK, but due to the smaller British loading gauge, the trains were scaled up to 1:101.6 (or 3mm scale) to have room for motors and other electric equipment. For a while the scale enjoyed considerable success, but it was not meant to last.

By the early 1960s, TT had been eclipsed in popularity by N scale, which is even smaller. Tri-ang quit the scale in 1967, and H. P. Products discontinued manufacturing their TT line in 1968. In West Germany, Rokal was sold to competitor Wesa (which marketed their own 13mm-track, 1:100 scale), and production ended in 1969. 

In East Germany, then on the other side of the Iron Curtain, production continued. Berliner-TT-Bahnen, which had superseded Zeuke, widened its offerings and exported trains and tracks over most of the Eastern Bloc. As the range became more and more comprehensive, offering not only trains and tracks but also accessories such as signals, lights and working catenaries, it became a serious contender to HO. During the 1980s, train sets were also exported to the West, offered as simple and cheap entry-models to the hobby and earning East Germany much-needed hard currency.

With the end of the Cold War, the East German economy was liberalised. Berliner-TT-Bahnen started to update their offerings, but soon ran into financial hardship. The company eventually ended up in the hands of Tillig, still today the largest provider of TT equipment. The products were improved, with better technology and more details, to bring them up to date with the offer in other scales.
In the 1990s and 2000s, several other companies started to offer models in TT, including major brands such as Piko and Roco, but these decades also saw the emergence of brands such as Kuehn, Beckmann and Kres, which all have made their mark in the scale. Since then, interest in the scale has grown, and more models are now available than in Z scale, and TT has come close to rivaling N (at least for European models), not the least with the 2022 entry of British Hornby and their new TT:120 range.

There is also a number of Russian manufacturers such as Peresvet (Пересвет) and TT-Model (ТТ-Модель) which produce TT scale locomotives and wagons of various prototypes in many liveries and schemes. With the emergence of 3D modeling software and 3D printing, many modelists in Russia have started to produce a vast variety of rolling stock and locomotives of their own in TT scale. TT is currently the second most popular scale after HO in Russia with a 40.9% market share behind HO with 46.9%.

==British TT 3 mm scale==
Traditional British TT, or TT3, is 3 mm scale; that is, 1:101.6. The reason for the slightly larger scale was that the available motors in the 1950s were too large to fit in the British loading gauge. The simple solution was, just like in choosing OO over HO and as later would happen in N gauge, to make the trains slightly larger but keeping the track at international scale. 

The &quot;Three Millimetre Society&quot; is a British-based society which caters for railway modellers of 3 mm scale. This society was formed in 1965, eight years after Tri-ang Railways, a British railway manufacturer, had introduced their TT locomotives and rolling stock. The aims of the society are to encourage modellers working in this scale, and it produces a quarterly magazine and assists with the production of locomotive and rolling stock kits, components and the supply of secondhand items and spares.

== British TT:120 ==
TT was reduced to a niche scale in Britain with the fall of Tri-ang, and remained so for a long time. In 2022, however, first PECO and then later Hornby announced a return to 12mm track. This time around, though, it was 1:120 scale all the way through without any size compromises (in British terms 2.54mm to the foot or one tenth of an inch to the foot). The news was first announced in June 2022 by PECO. The company launched its new TT:120 scale 12mm gauge code 55 track and UK prototype accessories. Writing in the Peco Publications &amp; Publicity magazine, Railway Modeller, editor Craig Tiley stated, &lt;q&gt;To explain: rather than perpetuating the hybrid combination of 3mm:1ft scale and 12mm gauge track that was adopted by Tri-ang for its TT range during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, Peco has instead chosen the accurate scale and gauge combination of 2.54mm:1ft on 12mm track. This equates to a ratio of 1:120 (hence the term TT:120) which represents a brand new scale for commercial items in British outline.&lt;/q&gt;

On the same date as PECO&#x27;s unveiling of their range, UK-based manufacturer Gaugemaster announced plans to introduce a new range of products for TT:120 scale, which could have included Class 66 locomotives, subject to demand. In their October 2022 newsletter Gaugemaster stated, &quot;Following Hornby’s news that they have developed an expansive range of TT:120 products which they intend to supply exclusively via their own website, it makes little or no commercial sense for us to develop a complimentary range of products in this scale.&quot;

In October 2022, British brand Hornby released its new range of TT:120. Two train sets are being offered, with four series of locomotives and rolling stock available. This range was only available from Hornby&#x27;s own website and it was not available from other retailers in the UK. In Australia it is sold via a third party distributor. Starting in October 2023 TT:120 became available via a number of retail outlets.

==Manufacturers==
Currently Tillig is the largest provider of TT scale models. Most TT scale track sold today is made by Tillig, which offers both standard model railroad track and an integrated roadbed track using Kato&#x27;s Unijoiner system. But the growing interest for the scale has led to more manufacturers during the last few years, and the scale has also attracted some of the big actors within other scales. Roco launched their first TT products in 1998, and has a small but growing line. Smaller producers like Kuehn and BeckmannTT have widened their product lines in recent years, as have Dutch PSK Modelbouw and Czech MTB, which specializes in Czech, Slovak and Polish models. 

Russian Peresvet is another manufacturer who produces TT scale models of mostly Russian prototypes. German large scale manufacturer PIKO has also started with a TT line, focusing mainly on German stock, and offer locomotives, wagons and several EMUs. Arnold launched their first new TT models since being bought by Hornby in 2014, and has a small but growing offer. In 2022 Hornby also announced their new TT programme with British trains, offering a wide range of locomotives, carriages and accessories, reintroducing the scale in Britain. 

There is greater variety in the accessories market, where some companies have a long-time involvement with the scale and others recently started to support it as well. Prototypes are mainly German and Central European, with a wide offering of models from Czech, Slovak, Polish, Swiss and Austrian environments. Suppliers of accessories include Auhagen, Noch and Viessmann. British Triang produced a Continental/French range but it was only made for a very short while.

The scale is uncommon outside Central Europe, with a few manufacturers in other parts of the world. One current producer of British TT is 3 mm Scale Model Railways who supply updated GEM and BEC TT kits as well as a large range of Brass Etch and Resin body kits. American manufacturers include Possum Valley Models (kits), Sleepy Hollow/Gold Coast (ready to run and kits, Costal Engineering (kits) DnS TT Track and others.

==Track systems==
There are several track systems available in the scale. Tillig offers two different tracks: with track bed and without. The latter system is considerably more developed, while the former has a more limited choice but comes with two different kinds of track bed. Most TT modellers use one of these two, partially because of the widespread availability. The smallest recommended turn radius is 310mm, but track with tighter curves, 267mm, is available. Most rolling stock, however, is designed to work on the 310mm curves, and might not work on smaller radii.

German manufacturer Kuehn offered a track system which is now marketed by Roco. The geometry differs slightly from Tillig&#x27;s system, but the two are compatible although with some minor differences. 

With Hornby&#x27;s entry into the scale in 2022, a completely new track system was launched. While having its own distinct appearance, the geometry is in most aspects the same as Tillig&#x27;s track.

There are several other track systems on the market, although with smaller choice of track pieces. German TTFiligran offers very delicate fine-scale track, and the old, u-shaped track of Berliner TT Bahnen is still available used in large quantities. Czech manufacturer DK-Model also offers a limited range of TTe narrow gauge track, consisting of points and flexible track. Moreover, the British manufacturer PECO introduced Streamline Flexible Track and Medium Radius Turn-Outs with code 55 rail in June 2022.

== Standards ==
Standards useful to both manufacturers and modellers are maintained by MOROP in Europe. These standards are generally the same for such elements as track gauge, scale ratio, couplings, and electrical power, and differ for clearances and other factors that are specific to the prototype being modelled. 

TT scale locomotives are powered by DC motors which accept a maximum of 12V DC. In traditional DC control, the speed of the train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Digital train control systems have, just as in other scale, become more and more common. The most popular digital control systems used in TT scale model railways is NMRA-DCC, most commonly using systems from Roco, Uhlenbrock, Kuehn, Piko or Tillig. 

There are several coupler systems used in TT. Rokal and Zeuke had simple hook-and-ring systems for their model, but these are rarely used anymore. Berliner TT Bahnen introduced a modernized coupler in the 70s, and this is still today the standard coupler on models from some manufacturers. The most common today, however, is the Tillig close-coupler system, and most ready-to-run models are equipped with this. There are also different systems for magnetic couplers, permanent couplers and so on, and some modellers also use Kadee-style couplers.

Most TT scale rolling stock made today is equipped with coupling pockets according to the standard NEM358, so all models have interchangeable couplings.

== Gauges ==
According to NEM Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen standards, 1:120 scale trains should use the following gauges:

In New Zealand TTm is known as NZ120, and is growing in popularity as a means of modelling the nation&#x27;s gauge railway network. In Japan TTm is also used to represent gauge railways under the name &quot;TT-9&quot;, and has had limited commercial support from manufacturers such as Tenshodo.

Several scales also use TT gauge but with a larger scale to represent narrow gauge railways. The most common are HOn3½ gauge (which represents 1067mm gauge in 1/87 HO scale) and H0m gauge (representing metre gauge track also for 1/87 HO scale).

<doc id="457905" wikidata="Q472686" url="?curid=457905" title="153 (number)">
<text>153 (one hundred [and] fifty-three) is a natural number and integer following 152 and preceding 154. 

It is the sum of the first 17 integers, and also the sum of the first five positive factorials. It is the 17th triangular number.

==In mathematics==
The number 153 is associated with the geometric shape known as the Vesica piscis or Mandorla. Archimedes, in his &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, referred to this ratio (153/265), as constituting the &quot;measure of the fish&quot;, this ratio being an imperfect representation of formula_1.

As a triangular number, 153 is the sum of the first 17 integers, and is also the sum of the first five positive factorials: formula_2.

The number 153 is also a hexagonal number, and a truncated triangle number, meaning that 1, 15, and 153 are all triangle numbers.

The distinct prime factors of 153 add up to 20, and so do the ones of 154, hence the two form a Ruth-Aaron pair.

Since formula_3, it is a 3-narcissistic number, and it is also the smallest three-digit number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits. Only five other numbers can be expressed as the sum of the cubes of their digits: 0, 1, 370, 371 and 407. It is also a Friedman number, since 153 = 3 × 51.

The Biggs–Smith graph is a symmetric graph with 153 edges, all equivalent.

Another feature of the number 153 is that it is the limit of the following algorithm:

# Take a random positive integer, divisible by three
# Split that number into its base 10 digits
# Take the sum of their cubes
# Go back to the second step

An example, starting with the number 84:

formula_4

There are 153 uniform polypeta that are generated from four different fundamental Coxeter groups in six-dimensional space.

The sum of the first eight Heegner numbers is 153.

==In the Bible==

The Gospel of John (chapter 21:1–14) includes the narrative of the miraculous catch of 153 fish as the third appearance of Jesus after his resurrection.

The number is clearly an intentional detail, given the lack of precision and detail elsewhere in the story. Augustine of Hippo argued that the significance lay in the fact that 153 is the sum of the first 17 integers (i.e. 153 is the 17th triangular number), with 17 representing the combination of divine grace (the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit) and law (the Ten Commandments). Many theologians have lent credence to Augustine&#x27;s numerology simply because it comes from historic rather than contemporary theology. Theologian D. A. Carson discusses this and other interpretations and concludes that &quot;if the Evangelist has some symbolism in mind connected with the number 153, he has hidden it well&quot;, while other scholars note that &quot;no symbolic significance for the number of 153 fish in John 21:11 has received widespread support.&quot;

Jerome reached much the same conclusion as Augustine that the figure is an allegorical representation of totality, but through more straightforward means rather than through numerology. In his &quot;Commentary on Ezekiel&quot; he propounded the hypothesis that 153 was meant to represent the whole universe of fish, citing as proof that contemporary poets, giving Oppian as an example, believed that there were 153 species of fish in the world.
However, Robert M. Grant disproved Jerome&#x27;s hypothesis by noting that Oppian actually enumerated only 149 (as catalogued by Alexander William Mair) fish species in his &quot;Halieutica&quot; (or only 152 &quot;by adding 3 worms&quot;, in Grant&#x27;s words).
What Oppian actually said, moreover, was that only the gods knew the number; and other ancient authors gave different numbers that still were not 153, such as Pliny The Elder in &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (9.43) recording only 74, 104, or 144 (depending from how one counts, and whether one includes hard shelled animals) species of fish, and Quintus Ennius as reported by Apuleius enumerating &quot;countless kinds of fish&quot;.
&quot;Every ancient ichthyologian counted the number of species differently.&quot; stated Grant.

David Strauss had in fact pointed out the same thing about Oppian in his &quot;Leben Jesu&quot; the century before Grant.
From a strictly biological point of view, moreover, only 24 species of fish had been recorded in the Sea of Galilee by the turn of the 20th century.
Theologians have continued to support Jerome&#x27;s hypothesis despite Grant and Strauss, arguing variously that Jerome may have had access to other works of Oppian that are now lost, that Oppian was writing a century after the Gospel of John and at least came close, and that perhaps (despite his having mentioned Oppian by name) Jerome&#x27;s reference to multiple writers actually meant other writers entirely.
Grant himself opined that &quot;there is every reason to suppose&quot; that in fact Jerome had not actually checked Oppian&#x27;s writing directly for this information, but was rather recounting secondhand some earlier Christian commentary on the Gospel of John.

Many other numerological interpretations have been propounded, from adding numerological representations of Simon&#x27;s name to the Greek word for fish through the additions (100+50+7) of Cyril of Alexandria to the multiplications (17×3×3) of Gregory the Great.
Frédéric Louis Godet characterized them as &quot;strange&quot;.
There were at least 18 distinct numerological explanations when John Emerton performed &quot;a quick survey&quot; in 1958.
Emerton proceeded to then add a gematrial explanation, to which 8 others have been added since.
Professor of the New Testament, Craig S. Keener observed in 2010 the several gematrial explanations, critiquing ideas such as reversing the order of the Greek alphabet as being &quot;forced&quot;, noting that a &quot;children of God&quot; reading of the number &quot;import[s] a ministry image from Mark 1:17 that John never mentions&quot;, and commenting on allegorical suggestions linking to Moses that &quot;one wonders whether John could have expected any members of his original audience to catch&quot;; summarizing that gematrial explanations that many scholars have put forward are too complex to be discovered without starting from the answer desired and working backwards from there, and that the plethora of such explanations all distinct from one another itself indicates their weakness.

However, there have been more prosaic and literal explanations, including the simple straightforward one that the detail is simply correct, and 153 is the number of fish caught. John Bernard argued by quoting Edwin Hatch that &quot;The idea that ancient literature consists of riddles which it is the business of modern literature to solve has passed for ever away&quot;, pointing out the irony of a Gnostic-like search for meaning in the tale when John himself was simply being quite literal. Godet, likewise, asserted that it was just &quot;a simple fact recalled to mind&quot;.

R. Alan Culpepper (who was dean of the McAfee School of Theology at Mercer University) observed, in his 2021 overview of seven distinct &quot;classes&quot; of argument about the number, that whilst there are arguments in favour of symbolic interpretations &quot;Nevertheless, the text gives no basis for interpreting the number.&quot; Professor of New Testament Studies Timothy James Wiarda stated that &quot;It is sufficient to note that the text offers the reader no hint concerning any symbolism in the miraculous catch of fish.&quot;. Keener, having discounted gematria, Jerome (per Grant and Strauss), and Augustine (with a simple analysis of how probable it is to pick numbers that have at least &quot;some&quot; special property, be that they are triangular, square, prime, or otherwise), concludes that the straightforward explanation is the more likely one and that &quot;the number could simply stem from an accurate memory of a careful count on the occasion&quot;, quoting Archibald Macbride Hunter in his 1965 &quot;Cambridge Bible Commentaries&quot; that it is &quot;no more symbolical than the hundred yards that Peter swam. It is the remembered number of a &#x27;bumper&#x27; catch.&quot;

Culpepper&#x27;s three other classes (aside from Jerome, literalism, gematria, and Augustine) are algebraic interpretations based on 153 itself, algebraic interpretations based on the number 17, and the hypothesis that the symbolic meaning of the number exists but is no longer discoverable.

Cornelius à Lapide writes that the &quot;multitude of fishes mystically represents the multitude of the faithful which Peter and the Apostles afterwards caught by the net of evangelical preaching, and converted to Christ&quot;.

Writers claiming a major role for Mary Magdalene have noted that in Greek isopsephy her epithet &quot;η Μαγδαληνή&quot; bears the number 8 + 40 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 30 + 8 + 50 + 8 = 153, thus, it is suggested, revealing her importance. Similarly, the phrase &quot;τὸ δίκτυον&quot; (the net) used in the passage bears the number 1224 = 8 × 153, as do some other phrases. The significance of this is unclear, given that Koine Greek provides a choice of several noun endings with different isopsephy values. The number 153 has also been related to the vesica piscis, with the claim that Archimedes used 153 as a &quot;shorthand or abbreviation&quot; for the square root of 3 in his &quot;On the Measurement of the Circle&quot;. However, examination of that work shows this to be only partly correct.

Evagrius Ponticus referred to the catch of 153 fish, as well as to the mathematical properties of the number (153 = 100 + 28 + 25, with 100 a square number, 28 a triangular number and 25 a circular number) when describing his 153-chapter work on prayer. Louis de Montfort, in his fifth method of saying the Rosary, connects the catch of 153 fish with the number of Hail Marys said (3 plus 15 sets of 10), while St Paul&#x27;s School in London was founded in 1512 by John Colet to teach 153 poor men&#x27;s children, also in reference to the catch.

<doc id="457906" wikidata="Q305976" url="?curid=457906" title="Deb (file format)">
<text>deb is the format, as well as filename extension of the software package format for the Debian Linux distribution and its derivatives.

==Design==
Debian packages are standard Unix ar archives that include two tar archives. One archive holds the control information and another contains the installable data.

dpkg provides the basic functionality for installing and manipulating Debian packages. Generally end users don&#x27;t manage packages directly with dpkg but instead use the APT package management software or other APT front-ends such as aptitude (nCurses) and synaptic (GTK).

Debian packages can be converted into other package formats and vice versa using alien, and created from source code using checkinstall or the Debian Package Maker.

Some core Debian packages are available as udebs (&quot;micro debs&quot;), and are typically used only for bootstrapping a Debian installation. Although these files use the &quot;udeb&quot; filename extension, they adhere to the same structure specification as ordinary &quot;deb&quot; files. However, unlike their &quot;deb&quot; counterparts, &quot;udeb&quot; packages contain only essential functional files. In particular, documentation files are normally omitted. &quot;udeb&quot; packages are not installable on a standard Debian system, but are used in Debian-Installer.

==Implementation==
Prior to Debian 0.93, a package consisted of a file header and two concatenated gzip archives. Since Debian 0.93, a deb package is implemented as an ar archive. This archive contains three files in a specific order:
# debian-binary - A text file named codice_1 containing a single line giving the package format version number. (codice_2 for current versions of Debian).
# control archive - A tar archive named codice_3 contains the maintainer scripts and the package meta-information (package name, version, dependencies and maintainer). Compressing the archive with gzip or xz and zstd is supported. The file extension changes to indicate the compression method.
# data archive - A tar archive named codice_4 contains the actual installable files. Compressing the archive with gzip, bzip2, lzma or xz and zstd is supported. The file extension changes to indicate the compression method.

===Control archive===
The control archive contents can include the following files:
* control contains a brief description of the package as well as other information such as its dependencies.
* md5sums contains MD5 checksums of all files in the package in order to detect corrupt or incomplete files.
* conffiles lists the files of the package that should be treated as configuration files. Configuration files are not overwritten during an update unless specified.
* preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm are optional scripts that are executed before or after installing or removing the package.
* config is an optional script that supports the debconf configuration mechanism.
* shlibs list of shared library dependencies.

===Signed packages===
Debian-based distributions support OpenPGP signature verification of signed Debian packages, but most (if not all) have this feature disabled by default. Instead packages are verified by signing the repository metadata (i.e. Release files). The metadata files in turn include checksums for the repository files as a means to verify authenticity of the files. Currently there are two different implementations for signing individual packages. The first is done via the debsigs / debsig-verify toolset, which is supported by dpkg. The second is done through the dpkg-sig program which is not supported by dpkg, so the packages have to be manually checked with the dpkg-sig program. Both formats add new sections to the ar archive to store the signature information, but the formats are not compatible with one another. Neither of the modifications to the package format are listed in the official Debian handbook or man page about the binary package format.

==Adoption==
* Debian packages are used in distributions based on Debian, such as, Linux Mint (LMDE), KDE neon, Ubuntu and many others.
* Fink, a port of dpkg and APT to macOS, uses deb packages.
* Nexenta OS, a discontinued OS based on OpenSolaris, included Debian package management software and the use of deb packages.
* Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, an OS that uses a GNU based userland and the FreeBSD kernel.
* Debian GNU/Hurd.
* Some jailbroken iOS devices (iPhones, iPads and iPods).
* Ipkg and Opkg, which both use .ipk packages that resemble Debian&#x27;s dpkg

* Termux, which is a GNU environment for Android.

<doc id="457907" wikidata="Q3366294" url="?curid=457907" title="Christian Heritage Party of Canada">
<text>The Christian Heritage Party of Canada (), also referred to as CHP Canada, is a minor social conservative and Christian right federal political party in Canada; it was founded in 1987, the brainchild of two couples in British Columbia, namely Bill and Heather Stilwell who were Roman Catholics and Ed Vanwoudenberg and his wife, Reformed Protestants. CHP advocates for Canada to be governed according to Christian principles and ethics. The party&#x27;s stated principle is that &quot;the purpose of civil government is to ensure security, freedom, and justice for all its citizens from conception till natural death, by upholding just laws&quot;. CHP states that, if the party forms government, it hopes to &quot;apply proven Judeo-Christian principles of justice and compassion to Canada&#x27;s contemporary public policy needs&quot;.

Ed Vanwoudenberg was elected its first leader at the 1987 founding convention in Hamilton, Ontario. Jim Hnatiuk led the party from 2008 to early 2014, and Rod Taylor is the leader as of November 7, 2014.

The party nominated candidates for the first time in the 1988 federal election, and ran numerous candidates in the 1993 and 1997 elections. It was unable to field 50 candidates in the 2000 election and was consequently de-registered by Elections Canada, the government elections agency. The party was re-registered in time for the 2004 election. and has run candidates in every subsequent election to that.

Many of its founders had been members of the Social Credit movement. The majority of its members are Dutch Canadians who attend Dutch Reformed Churches.

==Election results==

&quot;The party did not have official status for the 2000 election, but 46 candidates were nominated, listed on the ballot without any affiliation information. These figures represent the 46 &quot;non-affiliated&quot; candidates known to be nominees of the CHP.&quot;

==Party leaders==

===Edward John Vanwoudenberg (November 1987 – 1991)===
Vanwoudenberg was head of the CHP from the party&#x27;s founding convention in 1987 until 1991. From 1991 to 1994, he served as the Executive Director, and from 1994 to 1998, he served as the party&#x27;s vice-president. A resident of Oliver, British Columbia, he ran in the Canadian federal elections of 1988, 1993 and 2000.

===Charles Cavilla (1991–1993)===
Cavilla, of Lethbridge, Alberta, was leader of the CHP from the convention at Ottawa in October 1991 until March 1993. A difference of vision on leadership between Cavilla and the party board resulted in the transfer of leadership on an interim basis to Heather Stilwell.

===Heather Stilwell (1993–1994) (interim)===
===Jean Blaquière (1994–1995)===
Blaquière, a Pentecostal pastor, was a candidate for the CHP in the Canadian federal election of 1993, and won the party leadership in March 1994 at a Vancouver convention, in a race with two other contenders. Blaquière stepped down at the next convention in November 1995 in London, Ontario.

=== Ron Gray (1995–2008)===
Gray was the leader of the CHP from 1995 to 2008. Born and educated in British Columbia, Gray has worked in journalism, public relations, and the federal public service. He began his career at &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; newspaper, and has also worked at community newspapers in BC and in Suva, Fiji; and the &quot;BC Report&quot; magazine. He was a public information officer for a major public utility in BC, and for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

He was a Trade and Commerce Officer attached to the Canadian Consulate in Cleveland, Ohio. He later managed store-front Federal government public information services in Winnipeg and Vancouver. He became Public Information Officer for one of BC&#x27;s first community colleges, and later served 10 years in a similar capacity at Trinity Western University.

In the 1988 federal election, Gray ran in his first election under the Christian Heritage Party banner in the electoral district of Fraser Valley East. On election night, he placed fourth out of six candidates with over eight percent of the popular vote, finishing well behind Progressive Conservative incumbent Ross Belsher.

Gray ran for the CHP in every general election until stepping down as leader in 2008, with the exception of 1993. He has also contested four byelections, including one in Calgary Southwest against Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper. In a 1999 byelection, he finished one vote ahead of the Reform Party candidate in the Quebec riding of Hull—Aylmer.

Gray became the party leader in 1995. His leadership was confirmed at three subsequent CHP conventions. He stepped down in November 2008. Near the end of 2006, a human rights complaint was filed against Ron Gray alleging communication via the Internet messages likely to expose homosexuals to hatred or contempt. By October 24, 2008, the complaint had been dropped and the file closed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.

===Jim Hnatiuk (2008–2014)===
Hnatiuk was elected leader of the CHP in November 2008. As a youth, he attended a boarding school run by Oblate priests. He joined the Canadian Forces. Hnatiuk has served with them for 25 years in the Combat Systems Engineering Department in the Canadian Forces, attaining the rank of Chief Petty Officer 1st Class. He has been involved with various churches and is a deacon at Emmanuel Baptist Church.

Hnatiuk joined the Christian Heritage Party in 2002; he has run as a candidate for the party in Nova Scotia in the 2004, 2006 and 2008 federal elections.

He became deputy leader of the party in 2005 and was elected leader at the party&#x27;s November 2008 convention in London, Ontario defeating Harold Ludwig and Rod Taylor on the first ballot of the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

Hnatiuk was a candidate in the November 9, 2009 by-election in the riding of Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley, to replace independent Member of Parliament Bill Casey. He came in fifth, losing to Scott Armstrong of the Conservative Party of Canada.

Because of a difference in understanding on the leader&#x27;s mandate to innovate in membership qualifications, and a motion by the national board to ask that the leader put promotion of his vision on hold until a full board meeting could discuss the vision, Hnatiuk submitted his resignation as leader effective February 1, 2014, though choosing to continue as a party member.

In his professional life, he operates the largest hunting, fishing and taxidermy business in Nova Scotia.

===David J. Reimer (March 2014 – November 2014) (interim)===
David J. Reimer became a member of the CHP in 1987 while serving as a Pastor in Wetaskiwin, AB. He became active in his riding association and has served the party as candidate in each election since 1988. He served as candidate in the 2014 by-election in Macleod, Alberta.

Until early 2014, Reimer served as interim provincial president for Manitoba, and was appointed as interim national leader to succeed Hnatiuk until the fall 2014 national convention.

===Rod Taylor (2014–present)===

Rod Taylor was born in 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His family was involved in the US civil rights movement in the 1960s and various other social justice issues. He graduated from high school in California and moved with his parents and siblings to British Columbia (BC) in 1968.

Taylor has worked maintaining track and roadbed for the Canadian National Railway, on farms, in the oil and gas fields in Alberta, and in sawmills and forestry work in BC. From 1987 until 2009, Taylor was involved in lumber grading and lumber quality control in Smithers, BC. In 2000 Taylor won the BC Interior Lumber Grading Championship.

In 2001, Taylor ran as a provincial candidate for the British Columbia Unity Party, and in 2004, 2006 and 2008 he represented the CHP in the federal riding of Skeena-Bulkley Valley.

Taylor has served the CHP nationally as Interim President for CHP BC, BC Provincial President, Deputy Leader, Western Regional Development Director and National Development Director. He was named party leader at the 2014 convention in Hamilton, Ontario.

==Provincial branches==
The British Columbia Heritage Party voted to become the BC provincial wing of CHP in 2011, and was renamed as the Christian Heritage Party of British Columbia (CHP-BC) after signing a formal affiliation agreement in 2012. Members of the CHP in Manitoba began efforts around the same time to form a branch in their province, but as of 2015 little progress has been made.

While the parties were not formally connected, the membership of the deregistered provincial New Reform Party of Ontario (formerly the Family Coalition Party of Ontario) overlapped significantly with CHP as the parties shared many socially conservative policies. The same applied to the Family Coalition Party of British Columbia.

<text>USS &quot;Trout&quot; (SS-566), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the trout.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Trout&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation of Groton, Connecticut, on 14 May 1948 and her keel was laid down there on 1 December 1949. She was launched on 21 August 1951, sponsored by Mrs. Albert H. Clark, the widow of Lieutenant Commander Albert H. Clark, the last commanding officer of the previous U.S. Navy ship of the name, . &quot;Trout&quot; was commissioned on 27 June 1952.

==Service history==

===Atlantic Fleet service===
&quot;Trout&quot; operated out of New London, Connecticut, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 10 from 1952 to 1959. During this period, she conducted training and readiness operations with ships of the United States Atlantic Fleet and North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations, operating from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea. She engaged in sonar evaluation tests, antisubmarine warfare exercises, and submerged simulated attack exercises. During submerged exercises in Arctic waters in company with her sister ship , &quot;Trout&quot; transited beneath ice floes off Newfoundland, Canada, setting a submerged distance record for a conventionally powered submarine.

In August 1959, &quot;Trout&quot; shifted her home port to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 4. She deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in September 1959 for her first tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. In December 1959, while returning home, she represented the United States at Bergen, Norway, during the 50th anniversary celebrations commemorating the birth of the Royal Norwegian Navy&#x27;s submarine arm.

In February 1960, &quot;Trout&quot; performed as a test bed for U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships shock tests. She won her first Battle Efficiency Award (Battle &quot;E&quot;) in 1961. In early 1963, she rendered services to the Operational Test and Evaluation Force before commencing a six-month at Charleston in July 1963.

During the remaining years of the 1960s, &quot;Trout&quot; made three more Mediterranean deployments to serve as a unit of the Sixth Fleet. Between deployments, she participated in training and developmental exercises off the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean Sea.

===Pacific Fleet service===
In July 1970, &quot;Trout&quot; was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet. From her new home port at San Diego, California, &quot;Trout&quot; conducted two Western Pacific deployments, one in 1972 and one in 1975, primarily providing submarine services during antisubmarine warfare exercises conducted by warships of the United States Navy, the Republic of Korea Navy, or the Republic of China Navy. Between these deployments, she participated in antisubmarine warfare exercises and conducted local operations off the Southern California coast, punctuating this service with weapons tests in the Pacific Northwest, operating out of Puget Sound in Washington.

After returning from her second Western Pacific deployment to San Diego on 29 January 1976, &quot;Trout&quot; enjoyed a brief unusual duty — repeatedly diving and surfacing while being filmed to portray the fictitious U.S. Navy nuclear submarine USS &quot;Neptune&quot; in the opening credits of the 1978 movie &quot;Gray Lady Down&quot;.

==Decommissioning and transfer to Iran==
&quot;Trout&quot; received orders on 1 December 1976 changing her home port to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1977 and 1978, &quot;Trout&quot; underwent an extensive overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard at Philadelphia in anticipation of a planned transfer to the Imperial Iranian Navy. Upon completion of the overhaul in 1978, &quot;Trout&quot;″s home port was shifted to New London, Connecticut, where a training period for her the Iranian crew ensued. The training program was completed on 19 December 1978, and that day the U.S. Navy simultaneously decommissioned &quot;Trout&quot;, struck her from the Naval Vessel Register, and transferred her to Iran.

The Imperial Iranian Navy renamed her Imperial Iranian Ship (IIS) &quot;Kousseh&quot; (SS 101), meaning &quot;Shark&quot;. Her Iranian crew took control of her at New London in December 1978, but abandoned her there in March 1979 following the Iranian Revolution. &quot;Kousseh&quot; was returned to Philadelphia, where she languished for many years while the United States resolved financial matters related to her abortive transfer to Iran.

==Return to U.S. custody and later use==
&quot;Kousseh&quot; finally was returned officially to U.S. custody in 1992. She was sold at scrap value to the U.S. Navy″s Program Executive Office for Undersea Warfare in 1994. She was towed by the tugboat &quot;Puma&quot; from the Massachusetts Towing Company and moored at Pier 2 at the Naval Station in Newport, Rhode Island. She was then acquired by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Key West Detachment at Key West, Florida, for use by the Naval Air Systems Command Marine and Targets Detachment as a remotely controlled submersible sonar target ship, as an underwater acoustic target for antisubmarine warfare research and development, in operational testing, and for training.

==Disposal==
After completing that service, she was towed to the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, where the U.S. Navy held her for donation to a museum, but all preservation efforts failed. In May 2008 Esco Marine of Brownsville, Texas, was awarded a contract to scrap her, and her scrapping was completed on 27 February 2009.

<text>Barney Kessel (October 17, 1923 – May 6, 2004) was an American jazz guitarist. Known in particular for his knowledge of chords and inversions and chord-based melodies, he was a member of many prominent jazz groups as well as a &quot;first call&quot; guitarist for studio, film, and television recording sessions. Kessel was a member of the group of session musicians informally known as the Wrecking Crew.

==Early life==

Kessel was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma in 1923 to a Jewish family. Kessel&#x27;s father was an immigrant from Hungary who owned and operated a shoe shop. A self-taught guitarist, his only formal musical study was three months of guitar lessons at the age of 12.

==Career==
He began his career as a teenager, touring with local swing bands. When he was 16, he started playing with the Oklahoma A&amp;M band, Hal Price &amp; the Varsitonians. The band members nicknamed him &quot;Fruitcake&quot; because he practiced in excess of 16 hours per day. Kessel gained recognition due in part to his youth, and in part to being the only white musician playing in all-African-American bands at black clubs.

In the early 1940s, he moved to Los Angeles, where for one year he was a member of the Chico Marx big band. Noticed by Norman Granz, he appeared in the 1944 film &quot;Jammin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, which featured Lester Young. Soon after, he played in the bands of Charlie Barnet and Artie Shaw. During the day, he worked as a studio musician and at night played bop-oriented jazz in clubs. In 1947, he recorded with Charlie Parker. He worked in Jazz at the Philharmonic and for one year in the early 1950s he was a member of the Oscar Peterson trio. After leaving the trio, he recorded several solo albums for Contemporary. He recorded a series of albums with Ray Brown and Shelly Manne as &quot;The Poll Winners&quot; because the three of them often won polls conducted by &quot;Metronome&quot; and &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazines. He was the guitarist on the album &quot;Julie Is Her Name&quot; (1955) by Julie London, which includes the standard &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;, selling a million copies and demonstrated Kessel&#x27;s chordal approach to guitar.

During the 1960s, Kessel worked for Columbia Pictures and was a member of a band of session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew. At one point, after a two and a half hour session to record a one-chord song, &quot;The Beat Goes On,&quot; Kessel is reported to have stood up and proclaimed, &quot;Never have so many played so little for so much.&quot; He recorded with pop acts such as The Monkees and The Beach Boys and with jazz musicians Sonny Rollins and Art Tatum. Kessel played the iconic opening notes of the acclaimed Beach Boys&#x27; Pet Sounds album, on the track &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice.&quot; He played a 12-string hybrid mando-guitar, plugged directly into the recording console, at Brian Wilson&#x27;s request. Kessel eventually left studio work to concentrate on his jazz career both onstage and on records. Along with solo work, he formed the ensemble Great Guitars with Charlie Byrd and Herb Ellis.

Kessel was rated the No. 1 guitarist in &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;DownBeat&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine polls between 1947 and 1960.

From 1957 to 1958, Kay Musical Instrument Company manufactured the Kay Barney Kessel signature series guitars (models &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Artist&quot; and &quot;Jazz Special&quot;).

From 1961 to 1974, Gibson Guitars manufactured the Barney Kessel artist signature guitars in Standard and Custom models.

== Artistry and equipment==
Jazz music educator Wolf Marshall said the style that Barney Kessel employed in his music was &quot;the natural outgrowth of the electric guitar tone fostered by Charlie Christian and embraced by virtually every exponent of the post-Christian school&quot;. Kessel&#x27;s signature &quot;warm, clean timbre&quot; was created with hollow-body arch-top electric guitars with the neck pickup activated, played through a tube combo amp. The guitar stylings of Barney Kessel were rooted in 1930s and 1940s jazz, and were influenced by the swing and bebop styles of that time. Kessel was also influenced by post-bop modal jazz, hard bop, and free jazz. Specifically, he named Charlie Parker, Pat Martino, Oscar Peterson, Lester Young and Django Reinhardt as influences on his playing style. Additionally, Kessel&#x27;s music had a strong blues influence &quot;in both chord- and single-note form&quot;. Kessel was known for his chord stylings and single-note solos. Throughout his career, Kessel primarily played a sunburst Gibson ES-350P that was built in either 1947 or 1948, which the guitarist modified extensively. He replaced the original pickup with a &quot;Charlie Christian&quot; bar pickup, replaced the original volume and tone knobs with those taken off of a record player, omitted the pickguard, and installed dot inlays to replace the original fingerboard. Throughout his career, Kessel used various models of combo amplifiers made by Fender, Gibson and Univox. He used a heavy-gauge rounded pick and used medium-gauge Darco-wound polished guitar strings.

==Personal life==

Kessel was married to Gail Genovia Farmer throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Together they had two sons, Dan and David Kessel. Later, he was married to Betty Jane (BJ) Baker for 16 years, divorcing in 1980. His third marriage to Joanne “Jo” Kessel lasted 10 years, and he was married to his fourth wife, Phyllis Kessel, for 12 years. 

Kessel&#x27;s sons Dan Kessel and David Kessel became record producers and session musicians, working with Phil Spector, John Lennon, Cher, Leonard Cohen, The Ramones, Blondie, The Go-Gos and others.

==Death==
Kessel was in poor health after suffering a stroke in 1992, which effectively ended his career. Twelve years later, he died from a brain tumor at his home in San Diego, California, on May 6, 2004, at the age of 80.

<doc id="457913" wikidata="Q388465" url="?curid=457913" title="Castle Falkenstein (role-playing game)">
<text>Castle Falkenstein is a steampunk-themed fantasy role-playing game (RPG) designed by Mike Pondsmith and originally published by R. Talsorian Games in 1994. The game is named for a legendary unbuilt castle in the Bavarian Alps. Players play the roles of gallant adventurers who take on quests of intrigue and derring-do in the spirit of Victorian adventures such as &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;.

== Setting ==
The game is set on an alternate earth, in the steampunk era of Victorian &quot;New Europa&quot; circa 1870. In addition to humans, New Europa is populated by creatures from fantasy such as dragons and faeries. Fictional characters such as Van Helsing can also be encountered.

==Original edition==
The game was designed by Mike Pondsmith and published in 1994 by R. Talsorian Games as a 224-page softcover book. Cover art was by William Eaken and Mark Schumann.

===System===
The game does not use statistics or dice to define a character. Instead, players must choose a general template of a hero (Heroic, Tragic, Flawed, Innocent, Clever, or Fallen). The player then chooses an archetypal career from a long list including Anarchist, Diplomat, Dashing Hussar, Mad Scientist, and Steam Engineer. Each archetype comes with a set of possessions and a few &quot;Strong Suits&quot; (aptitudes) and Skills. The player then starts a character diary to record the details of adventures, beginning with the character’s background and present situation.

Players can also choose to play non-human characters such as dragons, faeries and dwarves, but reviewer Rick Swan noted that &quot;they come with so much baggage, they&#x27;re barely worth the effort.&quot;

Skill resolution is done with an ordinary deck of playing cards rather than dice. At the start of the game, each participant, including the referee, is dealt four cards. When a player wants to test a skill, the referee rates the difficulty of the task from 2 to 12. If the character&#x27;s skill level is higher than the difficulty, the character succeeds. Players can boost a skill level by playing cards from their hands, adding the value of any cards played to the skill level. Likewise, the referee can also increase the difficulty rating by playing their own cards.

Combat operates using the same system.

Spellcasters use a second deck of cards. When the spellcaster wishes to cast a spell, the player must draw cards from the deck, one card per two minutes of game time, until the sum of the cards equals or exceeds the power of the spell. Even then, success is not guaranteed, and a spell can backfire with disastrous consequences.

==Other editions==
In 2000, Steve Jackson Games published &quot;GURPS Castle Falkenstein&quot; under license using the GURPS rule system.

In 2016, Fat Goblin Games signed a deal with R. Talsorian Games to produce new supplements for &quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; using the original rules system. The first of these supplements, &quot;Curious Creatures&quot;, appeared in 2016, and additional supplements were subsequently published.

==Reception==
In the December 1994 edition of &quot;Pyramid&quot;, Scott Haring admired the tenor of the game, saying, &quot;This is not a game of sullen anti-heroes, angst and moral dilemmas; this is a grand game of world-spanning plots, pure heroes and diabolical villains. [Designer Mike] Pondsmith has done a great job of setting the stage for grand dramatic battles between good and evil without once letting it descend into melodrama or parody. This is a game that believes in itself and its premise 100%, but without drowning in pretentiousness or self-importance.&quot; Haring concluded, &quot;Castle Falkenstein is a breath of fresh air in roleplaying, a game where real heroes matter and don’t have to apologize. The book is physically gorgeous, the game mechanics fit the tone of the game world like a glove, the writing is wonderful, and the game world is enchanting.&quot;

In the November–December 1994 edition of &quot;Shadis&quot; (Issue 16), Ken Cox called this &quot;what has to be one of the most exciting games in the industry.&quot; Cox complimented the presentation, commenting, &quot;With its incredible artwork and layout the book fairly transports you into the realms of the world, while not taking away from the exchange of information.&quot; He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;A sure-fire system with a fantastic world of adventure: isn&#x27;t that just what we all have been looking for?&quot;

In the February 1995 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 214), Rick Swan was enthusiastic about the game, calling it &quot;an alternative reality that’s one part fact, ten parts fun house... a crazy quilt of steam-age technology and social anarchy.&quot; He recommended the game, saying, &quot;This is about as good as it gets.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by the British game magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time, &quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; was ranked 45th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;&quot;Castle Falkenstein&quot; is one of those games that people tend to either love or hate. It has a unique atmosphere, combining alternate history, Celtic mythology, steampunk and a somewhat whimsical, fairy-tale feel. Likewise, the rulebook itself is quite different from many, being laid out as a novel, with important information pulled out in sidebars, and the rules coming later. This reflects the main thrust of the system, which is heavily geared towards roleplaying and storytelling over game mechanics and numbers, and drops dice in favour of a couple of packs of playing cards.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;Here be dragons, high adventure, and clear lines between good and evil. In [the 1990s,] a grim and gritty decade of moral dilemmas ... &quot;Falkenstein&quot; is a startling (and perhaps lone) splash of bright, uncomplicated color.&quot; Horvath concluded, &quot;The relatively simple card-based system allows the game to focus on its world and its narrative themes, which ... wind up being some of the few bright and sunny patches in a gritty decade of overcast skies and steady drizzles.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;S-44&quot; (SS-155) was a third-group (&quot;S-42&quot;) S-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-44&quot;′s keel was laid down on 19 February 1921 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was launched on 27 October 1923, sponsored by Mrs. H. E. Grieshaber, and was commissioned on 16 February 1925.

==Service history==

===1924–1941===
&quot;S-44&quot; operated off the New England coast into the summer of 1925. In late August, she departed New London, Connecticut, for Panama and on 5 September arrived at Coco Solo to join Submarine Division (SubDiv) 19. With the division, she conducted training exercises, participated in fleet exercises and joint Army-Navy maneuvers, and made good will visits to various Caribbean and Pacific, Latin American ports until the spring of 1927. From that time to December 1930, she operated out of San Diego with her division, interrupting exercises off southern California twice for fleet problems in Hawaiian waters.

In December 1930, the S-boat was transferred to Hawaii where her division, now SubDiv 11, was home ported for four years. The boats then returned to San Diego, California and in 1937 were shifted back to Coco Solo.

===World War II===
In the spring of 1941, as American involvement in World War II increased, the Panama S-boats were ordered back to the east coast for overhaul. With sister ships and , &quot;S-44&quot; proceeded to New London, Connecticut, and in November went to Philadelphia, where the work was completed.

Trials took &quot;S-44&quot; into the new year, and on 7 January 1942, she got underway for Panama. Arriving on 16 January, she departed Balboa on 24 January with , , and , to conduct a security patrol in the western approaches to the canal. Within a few hours, however, she was engaged in rescue operations for &quot;S-26&quot;, which had been rammed and sunk by submarine chaser &quot;PC-460&quot;.

====First patrol, March 1942====
From Panama, the division (now SubDiv 53) was ordered to the southwest Pacific. Starting across the Pacific in early March, the boats reached Brisbane in mid-April, and within ten days, &quot;S-44&quot; was on her first war patrol. She cleared Moreton Bay on 24 April. Three days later, her port engine went out of commission, but 36 hours of hard work and ingenuity put it back in operation. On 29 April, she began running submerged during the day and surfacing at night to recharge batteries and allow fresh air into the non-air-conditioned boat. By 2 May, she was in her patrol area, New Britain-New Ireland waters. Six days later, she sighted a ship through a haze of rain and launched two torpedoes which missed. She attempted to close the range. However the surface ship easily outdistanced her. The next afternoon, she attempted to close on a Japanese destroyer, east of Adler Bay, but again was easily outrun. On 10 May, off Cape St. George, she closed on another target but was sighted and attacked.

In late afternoon of 12 May, from the cape, she encountered a merchantman and a trawler escort. For the first time, the weather, her position, and the target&#x27;s course were all in her favor. She launched four torpedoes while surfaced and hit with two. She then submerged. &quot;Shoei Maru&quot;, a salvage vessel of over 5,000 tons was sunk. The Japanese escort attacked &quot;S-44&quot; and dropped sixteen or more depth charges, none of which was close. On 14 May, &quot;S-44&quot; headed home, arriving at Brisbane on 23 May.

====2nd patrol, June 1942====
Another overhaul followed, and on 7 June she left of Moreton Bay on a course for the Solomon Islands. Within the week, she was on patrol off Guadalcanal, operating from there to Savo and Florida Island. A few days later, she shifted south of Guadalcanal and on 21 June sank the converted gunboat &quot;Keijo Maru&quot;. At 14:15, &quot;S-44&quot; fired her torpedoes. Just three minutes later the enemy aircraft dropped a bomb which exploded close to the submarine, bending the holding latch to the conning tower and allowing in 30 gallons of sea water. This damaged the depth gauges, the gyrocompass, and the ice machine, besides causing leaks. The number-one periscope was thought to be damaged; but when the submarine surfaced a Japanese seaman&#x27;s coat was found wrapped around its head.

Three days later, &quot;S-44&quot; was in Lunga Roads. On 26 June, poor weather set in and blanketed the area until she turned for home. She departed her patrol area on 29 June and arrived at Moreton Bay on 5 July.

====3rd patrol, July 1942====
&quot;S-44&quot; departed Brisbane on 24 July. Cloudy weather with squalls set in. On 31 July, she commenced patrolling the Rabaul-Tulagi shipping lanes. The next day, she sighted a convoy off Cape St. George, but heavy swells hindered depth control and speed, and prevented her from attacking. From Cape St. George, &quot;S-44&quot; moved up the east coast of New Ireland to North Cape and Kavieng, where she waited.

On 7 August, the American offensive opened with landing of the 1st Marine Division on the beaches of the Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal and Tulagi. On 9 August, off Savo Island, Cruiser Division 6 of the Imperial Japanese Navy had inflicted one of the worst defeats of the war on American and Australian surface ships.
The next morning, the victorious enemy cruisers neared Kavieng, bound for home. At 07:50, &quot;S-44&quot; sighted the formation of four heavy cruisers at less than . At 08:06, she fired four Mark 10 torpedoes at the rear ship, only away. By 08:08, three torpedoes had exploded and the heavy cruiser &quot;Kako&quot; was sinking. &quot;S-44&quot; had claimed the largest Japanese man-of-war in the Pacific War to date.

Three days later, &quot;S-44&quot; was again fighting heavy swells. Her damaged bow planes required three hours to rig out, where they were left. On 23 August, she moored at Brisbane. With one ship sunk on each patrol so far, she set a record no other S-boat would match.

====4th patrol, September 1942====
On 17 September, now in the hands of Reuben Whitaker, &quot;S-44&quot; began her fourth war patrol. The following day, a hydrogen fire blazed in her forward battery compartment, but was extinguished in three minutes. On 22 September, she began surfacing only at night, and, two days later, took patrol station off New Georgia to interdict Japan&#x27;s Faisi-Guadalcanal supply line. During the patrol, her hunting was hindered by Japanese aerial and surface antisubmarine patrols and her own operational capabilities, which were further limited by material defects and damage inflicted during depth chargings.

On the morning of 4 October, she attacked a destroyer, then survived an intensive depth charge attack with seemingly minor damage. When she submerged the next day, however, the submarine began taking water. She surfaced, made repairs, then submerged to . Leaks were found in her motor room and torpedo room flappers. The latter were jacked shut, but the former continued spraying water onto both motors. Within an hour, four Japanese destroyers had moved into the area. &quot;S-44&quot; went to . The leak worsened. The motors were covered in canvas and sheet rubber and the crew waited for the destroyers to pass over her position. As they disappeared, &quot;S-44&quot; moved up to and repairs were made on the flapper. That night, further repairs were made while the ship was surfaced off Santa Isabel Island; and, by midnight, the S-boat was en route back to her patrol area. On 7 October, bad weather set in; and, on 8 October, she departed the area, arriving in Moreton Bay on 14 October.

====Overhaul====
A month later, &quot;S-44&quot; departed Brisbane and headed back to the United States. In early January 1943, she transited the Panama Canal, then moved across the Caribbean Sea and up the Atlantic seaboard to Philadelphia. There, from April to June, she underwent overhaul; and, in July, she retransited the Canal en route to San Diego and the Aleutian Islands.

====Fifth patrol, September 1943====
She arrived at Dutch Harbor on 16 September. On 26 September, she departed Attu on her last war patrol. One day out, while en route to her operating area in the northern Kuril Islands, she was spotted and attacked by a Japanese patrol plane. Suffering no damage, she continued west. On the night of 7 October, she made radar contact with what she thought was a &quot;small merchantman&quot; and closed for a surface attack. Several hundred yards from the target, her deck gun fired and was answered by a salvo. The &quot;small merchantman&quot; in fact was the escort . An emergency dive was ordered, but the submarine failed to submerge. She then took several hits in the control room, below the waterline in the after battery room, and elsewhere.

&quot;S-44&quot; was ordered abandoned. A pillow case was raised from the forward battery room hatch as a flag of surrender, but the Japanese shelling continued. Only two men escaped the sinking vessel. They were taken first to Paramushiro, then to the Naval Interrogation Camp at Ōfuna. The two men spent the last year of World War II working in the Ashio copper mines and survived to be repatriated by the Allies at the end of the war.

<doc id="457921" wikidata="Q1140308" url="?curid=457921" title="Fringe science">
<text>Fringe science refers to ideas whose attributes include being highly speculative or relying on premises already refuted. Fringe science theories are often advanced by people who have no traditional academic science background, or by researchers outside the mainstream discipline. The general public has difficulty distinguishing between science and its imitators, and in some cases, a &quot;yearning to believe or a generalized suspicion of experts is a very potent incentive to accepting pseudoscientific claims&quot;.

The term &quot;fringe science&quot; covers everything from novel hypotheses, which can be tested utilizing the scientific method, to wild ad hoc hypotheses and mumbo jumbo. This has resulted in a tendency to dismiss all fringe science as the domain of pseudoscientists, hobbyists, and quacks.

A concept that was once accepted by the mainstream scientific community may become fringe science because of a later evaluation of previous research. For example, focal infection theory, which held that focal infections of the tonsils or teeth are a primary cause of systemic disease, was once considered to be medical fact. It has since been dismissed because of a lack of evidence.

==Description==
The boundary between fringe science and pseudoscience is disputed. The connotation of &quot;fringe science&quot; is that the enterprise is rational but is unlikely to produce good results for various reasons, including incomplete or contradictory evidence. Pseudoscience, however, is something that is not scientific but is incorrectly characterised as science.

The term may be considered pejorative. For example, Lyell D. Henry Jr. wrote, &quot;Fringe science [is] a term also suggesting kookiness.&quot; This characterization is perhaps inspired by the eccentric behavior of many researchers of the kind known colloquially (and with considerable historical precedent) as mad scientists.

Although most fringe science is rejected, the scientific community has come to accept some portions of it. One example of such is plate tectonics, an idea which had its origin in the fringe science of continental drift and was rejected for decades.

==Examples==
===Historical===
Some historical ideas that are considered to have been refuted by mainstream science are:

*Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s work with orgone, a physical energy he claimed to have discovered, contributed to his alienation from the psychiatric community. He was eventually sentenced to two years in a federal prison, where he died. At that time and continuing today, scientists disputed his claim that he had scientific evidence for the existence of orgone. Nevertheless, amateurs and a few fringe researchers continued to believe that orgone is real.
*Focal infection theory (FIT), as the primary cause of systemic disease, rapidly became accepted by mainstream dentistry and medicine after World War I. This acceptance was largely based upon what later turned out to be fundamentally flawed studies. As a result, millions of people were subjected to needless dental extractions and surgeries. The original studies supporting FIT began falling out of favor in the 1930s. By the late 1950s, it was regarded as a fringe theory.
*The Clovis First theory held that the Clovis culture was the first culture in North America. It was long regarded as a mainstream theory until mounting evidence of a pre-Clovis culture discredited it.

===Modern===
Relatively recent fringe sciences include:

* Aubrey de Grey, featured in a 2006 &quot;60 Minutes&quot; special report, is studying human longevity. He calls his work &quot;strategies for engineered negligible senescence&quot; (SENS). Many mainstream scientists believe his research is fringe science (especially his view of the importance of nuclear epimutations and his timeline for antiaging therapeutics). In a 2005 article in &quot;Technology Review&quot; (part of a larger series), it was stated that &quot;SENS is highly speculative. Many of its proposals have not been reproduced, nor could they be reproduced with today&#x27;s scientific knowledge and technology. Echoing Myhrvold, we might charitably say that de Grey&#x27;s proposals exist in a kind of antechamber of science, where they wait (possibly in vain) for independent verification. SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong.&quot;
* A nuclear fusion reaction called cold fusion, which occurs near room temperature and pressure, was reported by chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in March 1989. Numerous research efforts at the time were unable to replicate their results. Subsequently, several scientists have worked on cold fusion or have participated in international conferences on it. In 2004, the United States Department of Energy commissioned a panel on cold fusion to reexamine the concept. They wanted to determine whether their policies should be altered because of new evidence.
*The theory of abiogenic petroleum origin holds that petroleum was formed from deep carbon deposits, perhaps dating to the formation of the Earth. The ubiquity of hydrocarbons in the solar system may be evidence that there may be more petroleum on Earth than commonly thought and that petroleum may originate from carbon-bearing fluids that migrate upward from the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Abiogenic hypotheses saw a revival in the last half of the twentieth century by Russian and Ukrainian scientists. More interest was generated in the West after the 1999 publication by Thomas Gold of &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot;. Gold&#x27;s version of the theory is partly based on the existence of a biosphere composed of thermophile bacteria in the Earth&#x27;s crust, which might explain the existence of specific biomarkers in extracted petroleum.

===Accepted as mainstream===
Some theories that were once rejected as fringe science but were eventually accepted as mainstream science include:

* Plate tectonics
* The existence of Troy
* Heliocentrism
* Norse colonization of the Americas
* The Big Bang theory
*&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; bacteria as the causative agent of peptic ulcer disease
*The germ theory of disease
*Neanderthal-Homo sapiens hybridization

==Responding to fringe science==
Michael W. Friedlander has suggested some guidelines for responding to fringe science, which, he argues, is a more difficult problem than scientific misconduct. His suggested methods include impeccable accuracy, checking cited sources, not overstating orthodox science, thorough understanding of the Wegener continental drift example, examples of orthodox science investigating radical proposals, and prepared examples of errors from fringe scientists.

Friedlander suggests that fringe science is necessary so mainstream science will not atrophy. Scientists must evaluate the plausibility of each new fringe claim, and certain fringe discoveries &quot;will later graduate into the ranks of accepted&quot; — while others &quot;will never receive confirmation&quot;.

Margaret Wertheim profiled many &quot;outsider scientists&quot; in her book &quot;Physics on the Fringe&quot;, who receive little or no attention from professional scientists. She describes all of them as trying to make sense of the world using the scientific method but in the face of being unable to understand modern science&#x27;s complex theories. She also finds it fair that credentialed scientists do not bother spending a lot of time learning about and explaining problems with the fringe theories of uncredentialed scientists since the authors of those theories have not taken the time to understand the mainstream theories they aim to disprove.

===Controversies===
As Donald E. Simanek asserts, &quot;Too often speculative and tentative hypotheses of cutting edge science are treated as if they were scientific truths, and so accepted by a public eager for answers.&quot; However, the public is ignorant that &quot;As science progresses from ignorance to understanding it must pass through a transitional phase of confusion and uncertainty.&quot;

The media also play a role in propagating the belief that certain fields of science are controversial. In their 2003 paper &quot;Optimising Public Understanding of Science and Technology in Europe: A Comparative Perspective&quot;, Jan Nolin &quot;et al.&quot; write that &quot;From a media perspective it is evident that controversial science sells, not only because of its dramatic value, but also since it is often connected to high-stake societal issues.&quot;

<doc id="457922" wikidata="Q2045429" url="?curid=457922" title="Pachuco">
<text>Pachucos are male members of a counterculture that emerged in El Paso, Texas, in the late 1930s. Pachucos are associated with zoot suit fashion, jump blues, jazz and swing music, a distinct dialect known as &quot;caló&quot;, and self-empowerment in rejecting assimilation into Anglo-American society. The pachuco counterculture flourished among Chicano boys and men in the 1940s as a symbol of rebellion, especially in Los Angeles. It spread to women who became known as pachucas and were perceived as unruly, masculine, and un-American. 

Some pachucos adopted strong attitudes of social defiance, engaging in behavior seen as deviant by white/Anglo-American society, such as marijuana smoking, gang activity, and a turbulent night life. Although concentrated among a relatively small group of Mexican Americans, the pachuco counterculture became iconic among Chicanos and a predecessor for the cholo subculture which emerged among Chicano youth in the 1980s.

Pachucos emerged in Los Angeles, California, among a group of it may have roots in Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico, where loose-fitting clothing was popular among men. It later spread throughout the Southwest into Los Angeles, where it developed further. In the border areas of California and Texas, a distinct youth culture known as &quot;pachuquismo&quot; developed in the 1940s and has been credited as an influence to &quot;Chicanismo&quot;. In LA, Chicano zoot suiters developed their own cultural identity, &quot;with their hair done in big pompadours, and &#x27;draped&#x27; in tailor-made suits ... They spoke caló, their own language, a cool jive of half-English, half-Spanish rhythms ... Out of the zoot-suiter experience came lowrider cars and culture, clothes, music, tag names, and, again, its own graffiti language.&quot;

Pachucos were perceived as alien to both Mexican and Anglo-American culture–a distinctly &quot;Chicano&quot; figure. In Mexico, the pachuco was understood &quot;as a caricature of the American&quot;, while in the United States he was perceived as so-called &quot;proof of Mexican degeneracy.&quot; Mexican critics such as Octavio Paz denounced the pachuco as a man who had &quot;lost his whole inheritance: language, religion, customs, belief.&quot; In response, Chicanos heavily criticized Paz and embraced the oppositional position of the pachuco as an embodied representation of resistance to Anglo-American cultural hegemony. To Chicanos, the pachuco had acquired and emanated self-empowerment and agency through a &quot;stylized power&quot; of rebellious resistance and spectacular excess.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;pachuco&quot; is uncertain, but one theory connects it to the city of El Paso, Texas, which was sometimes referred to as &quot;Chuco Town&quot; or &quot;El Chuco&quot;. People migrating to El Paso from Ciudad Juarez would say, in Spanish, that they were going &quot;pa&#x27; El Chuco&quot;. Some say &quot;pa El Chuco&quot; comes from the words &quot;Shoe Co.&quot;, a shoe company that was located in El Paso in the 1940s during the war. The majority of Mexican migrants would cross the border in order to work for this famous shoe company in El Paso. Throughout the years the term &quot;pa El Chuco&quot; was used when Mexican immigrants were heading to El Paso looking for a job. In order to cross the American border with success the migrants would have to dress nice and look nice other wise they would get rejected at the border. These migrants became known as pachucos.

&quot;Pachuco&quot; could also have derived from the name of the city of Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico, as the majority of Mexican migration to the United States came from the Central Plateau region, of which Hidalgo is a part.

Connections have also been found between &quot;Pachucos&quot; and mixed civilians who lived near the Mexican–American border during the turn of the century, and between &quot;Pachucos&quot; and the poor soldiers who fought in the Mexican Revolution in the armies of Pancho Villa.

== Style ==

Pachuco style was a dominating trend among Mexican-American youth in the 1930s-40s. Pachucos became known for their distinguished look, dialogue, and actions. Pachucos dressed in recognizable Zoot suits, and often styled their hair into ducktails. Things like decorative chains and tattoos were also sometimes part of the pachuco look. The unique speech of pachucos was a very important element of their defined style. Consisting of creative phrases and some English words, Caló was a very popular form of speech among pachucos. Pachucos were seen as gangsters in the eyes of conservative Americans with ethnic prejudices.

==Culture==
The Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz writes in the essay, &quot;The &quot;Pachuco&quot; and Other Extremes&quot; that the Pachuco phenomenon paralleled the zazou subculture in World War II-era Paris in style of clothing, music favored (jazz, swing, and jump blues), and attitudes. Although there was no known link between the two subcultures, they both are most certainly derivative localized blends of American pop culture in the United States.

While he was not the first Mexican comedian to perform as a Mexican American zoot suiter, Mexican comedian and film actor German Valdés better-known by his artistic name &quot;Tin-Tan&quot; is Mexico&#x27;s most famous and celebrated pachuco.

Pachuco culture in America was at its height during World War II. The Wartime Productions Board in 1942 thought it necessary to cut back on fabric consumption, so they enacted regulations on the amount of fabric used for suits. This enactment targeted Pachucos in particular because of the excess fabric used in their zoot suits. Pachucos boldly chose not to follow these regulations, demonstrating rebellious attitudes and pride in their culture. Pachucos continued to flaunt zoot suits, now attained through bootleg tailors. As a result, these flashy zoot suits were seen as unpatriotic by other Americans. This controversial series of events helped shape Pachuco culture, and zoot suits became a symbol of cultural pride among Mexican-Americans. It didn&#x27;t all end well, however, as this also led to rising tension between Pachucos and other Americans, playing a part in the start of the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots.

The pachuco subculture declined in the 1960s, evolving into the Chicano style. This style preserved some of the pachuco slang while adding a strong political element characteristic of the late 1960s American life.

==La Pachuca==
The &quot;Pachuca,&quot; the female counterpart of the Pachuco, had an aesthetic sensibility as strong as the male zoot suiter. The Pachuca&#x27;s hairstyle tended to be a high &quot;coif&quot; or bouffant, with the hair put up in some way (a more pronounced version of the typical hair style of the time) by ratting their hair or affixing hair rats. Their makeup was heavy, particularly using a red colored lipstick. The preferred colors of clothing were black and gray. Some pachucas wore the traditionally male zoot suit, albeit with modifications to fit the female form. Sometimes, she donned the standard heavy gold pocket chain. Another variation involved a sweater or coat - often a variant on the male zoot-suit finger-tip jacket - over knee-length skirts, plus fishnet stockings or bobby socks and platform shoes.

== Costa Rica ==
In Costa Rica the term &quot;pachuco&quot; refers to someone who has common habits and who is often very rude.

<doc id="457924" wikidata="Q324028" url="?curid=457924" title="John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute">
<text>John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, (12 September 1847 – 9 October 1900) was a Scottish landed aristocrat, industrial magnate, antiquarian, scholar, philanthropist, and architectural patron.

When Bute succeeded to the marquisate at the age of just six months, his vast inheritance reportedly made him the richest man in the world. He owned 116,000 acres mostly in Glamorgan, Ayrshire and Bute. His conversion to Catholicism from the Church of Scotland at the age of 21 scandalised Victorian society and led Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli to use the Marquess as the basis for the eponymous hero of his novel &quot;Lothair&quot;, published in 1870. Marrying into one of Britain&#x27;s most illustrious Catholic families, that of the Duke of Norfolk, Bute became one of the leaders of the British Catholic community. His expenditure on building and restoration made him the foremost architectural patron of the 19th century.

Lord Bute died in 1900, at the age of 53; his heart was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. He was a Knight Grand Cross of the Holy Sepulchre, Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great and Hereditary Keeper of Rothesay Castle.

==Early life==

The future Marquess was born at the family seat of Mount Stuart, on the Isle of Bute in Scotland, to John, 2nd Marquess of Bute, and Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, daughter of The 1st Marquess of Hastings. At birth, he was known by the courtesy title Earl of Dumfries. 

The 2nd Marquess was an industrialist and began, at great financial risk, the development of Cardiff as a port to export the mineral wealth of the South Wales Valleys. Accumulating major debts and mortgages on his estates, the Marquess rightly foresaw the potential of Cardiff, telling his concerned solicitor in 1844, &quot;I am willing to think well of my income in the distance.&quot; The following fifty years saw his faith vindicated, but the ensuing riches were to be enjoyed, and spent, by his son, &quot;the richest man in the world&quot;, rather than himself.
The 2nd Marquess died in 1848 and his son succeeded to the Marquessate when less than six months old. He was educated at Harrow School, and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1865. His mother died when he was 12. Bute had been attracted to the Roman Catholic Church since childhood, and the efforts of his guardians to weaken this attraction only added to it. He was never a member of the Church of England, despite efforts by Henry Parry Liddon to attract him to it. Bute&#x27;s letters to one of his very few intimate friends during his Oxford career show with what conscientious care he worked out the religious question for himself. On 8 December 1868, he was received into the Church by Monsignor Capel at a convent in Southwark, and a little later was confirmed by Pius IX in Rome, resulting in a public scandal. His conversion was the inspiration for Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s novel, &quot;Lothair&quot;.

==Interests==

The Marquess&#x27;s vast range of interests, which included astrology, medieval art, religion, medievalism, the occult, architecture, travelling, linguistics, and philanthropy, filled his relatively short life. A prolific writer, bibliophile and traveller, as well as, somewhat reluctantly, a businessman, his energies were on a monumentally Victorian scale. &quot;A liturgist and ecclesiologist of real distinction&quot;, he published on a wide range of topics. But at a distance, just over one hundred years from his death, it is his architectural patronage as &quot;the greatest builder of country houses in nineteenth-century Britain&quot; that creates his lasting memorial.

In 1865, the Marquess met William Burges and the two embarked on an architectural partnership, the results of which long outlasted Burges&#x27; own death in 1881. Bute&#x27;s desires and money allied with Burges&#x27; fantastical imagination and skill led to the creation of two of the finest examples of the late Victorian era Gothic Revival, Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch. The two buildings represent both the potential of colossal industrial wealth and the desire to escape the scene of that wealth&#x27;s creation. The theme recurs again and again in the huge outpouring of Bute&#x27;s patronage, in chapels, castle, abbeys, universities and palaces. Bute&#x27;s later buildings are hardly less remarkable than his collaborations with Burges. Robert Rowand Anderson rebuilt the Georgian Mount Stuart House for him, and Bute worked in collaboration with many of Burges&#x27;s colleagues, including William Frame and Horatio Walter Lonsdale, on the interiors. John Kinross was Bute&#x27;s architect for the sympathetic and creative reworking of the partially ruined Falkland Palace. Kinross also restored Greyfriars in Elgin for Bute.

As a burgess of Cardiff, the Marquess accepted the invitation to be mayor of Cardiff for the municipal year from November 1890.

==Patronage==

The Marquess&#x27;s patronage was extensive, with a particular enthusiasm for buildings of religion and academia. Whilst Rector of the University of St Andrews, he provided the university with a new home for its Medical School and endowed the Bute Chair of Medicine. A supporter of education for women, he also paid for St Andrews University&#x27;s first female lecturer, who taught anatomy to women medical students when Professor James Bell Pettigrew refused to do so. At the University of Glasgow, he gifted the funds required to complete the university&#x27;s huge central hall, named the Bute Hall in his honour, and he is commemorated both at the university&#x27;s Commemoration Day and on its Memorial Gates. He was made the Honorary President () of the Highland Society of the University of Edinburgh.

Between 1868 and 1886 he financed the rebuilding of St Margaret&#x27;s Parish Church, Roath, Cardiff, creating a new mausoleum for the Bute family with sarcophagi in red marble.

In 1866 he donated a site in Cardiff Docks for the &quot;Hamadryad&quot; Hospital Ship for sick seafarers and, on his death in 1900, bequeathed £20,000 towards the cost of a new bricks-and-mortar hospital, which became the Royal Hamadryad.

==&quot;The Marquess of Bute&#x27;s Case&quot;==
The Marquess was involved in a notable company law case, known as &quot;the Marquess of Bute&#x27;s Case&quot;, reported on appeal in 1892, called &quot;Re Cardiff Savings Bank&quot; [1892] 2 Ch 100. The Marquess had been appointed to the board of directors of the Cardiff Savings Bank as &quot;President&quot;, at the age of six months, in effect inheriting the office from his father. He attended only one board meeting in the next 38 years. When the bank became insolvent following a fellow director&#x27;s fraudulent dealing, Stirling J held that the Marquess was not liable as he knew nothing of what was going on. It was not suggested that he ought to have known what was going on or that he had a duty of care to inform himself as to the affairs of the bank. The case set a famous legal precedent, now superseded, for the minimal view of the duties of company directors. It was naturally a considerable embarrassment for the Marquess although he escaped legal blame.

==Family life==
John, 3rd Marquess of Bute, married the Hon.Gwendolen Mary Angela Fitzalan-Howard (daughter of The 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and granddaughter of The 13th Duke of Norfolk) in 1872 and had four children:

*Lady Margaret Sophia Crichton-Stuart (24 December 1875 – 6 June 1954)
*John, 4th Marquess of Bute (20 June 1881 – 16 May 1947)
*Lord Ninian Edward Crichton-Stuart (15 May 1883 – 2 October 1915)
*Lord Colum Edmund Crichton-Stuart (3 April 1886 – 18 August 1957)

==Death==
Lord Bute died on 9 October 1900 after a protracted illness (Bright&#x27;s disease), his first stroke having occurred in 1896, and was buried in a small chapel on the Isle of Bute, his ancestral home. His heart was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.

In his will he left £100,000 to each of his children, with the exception of his eldest son, who inherited the Bute estates including Cardiff Castle and the family seat, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, and Dumfries House in Ayrshire.

<doc id="457926" wikidata="Q183206" url="?curid=457926" title="B vitamins">
<text>B vitamins are a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism and synthesis of red blood cells. They are a chemically diverse class of compounds. 

Dietary supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamins are referred to by B-number or by chemical name, such as B1 for thiamine, B2 for riboflavin, and B3 for niacin, while some are more commonly recognized by name than by number, such as pantothenic acid (B5), biotin (B7), and folate (B9). B vitamins are present in protein-rich foods, such as fish, poultry, meat, dairy products, and eggs; they are also found in leafy green vegetables, beans, and peas. Fortified foods, such as breakfast cereals, baked products, and infant formulas, may contain B vitamins.

Each B vitamin is either a cofactor (generally a coenzyme) for key metabolic processes or is a precursor needed to make one.

==List of B vitamins==

Note: Other substances once thought to be vitamins were given B-numbers, but were disqualified once discovered to be either manufactured by the body or not essential for life. See #Related compounds for numbers 4, 8, 10, 11, and others.

==Sources==
B vitamins are found in abundance in meat, eggs, and dairy products. Processed carbohydrates such as sugar and white flour tend to have lower B vitamin content than their unprocessed counterparts. For this reason, it is common in many countries (including the United States) that the B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid are added back to white flour after processing. This is referred to as &quot;enriched flour&quot; on food labels. B vitamins are particularly concentrated in meat such as turkey, tuna and liver.

Sources for B vitamins also include spinach, legumes (pulses or beans), whole grains, asparagus, potatoes, bananas, chili peppers, breakfast cereals. 
The B12 vitamin is not abundantly available from plant products (although it has been found in moderate abundance in fermented vegetable products, certain seaweeds, and in certain mushrooms, with the bioavailability of the vitamin in these cases remaining uncertain), making B12 deficiency a legitimate concern for those maintaining a vegan diet. Manufacturers of plant-based foods will sometimes report B12 content, leading to confusion about what sources yield B12. The confusion arises because the standard US Pharmacopeia (USP) method for measuring the B12 content does not measure the B12 directly. Instead, it measures a bacterial response to the food. Chemical variants of the B12 vitamin found in plant sources are active for bacteria, but cannot be used by the human body. This same phenomenon can cause significant over-reporting of B12 content in other types of foods as well.

A common way to increase vitamin B intake is by using dietary supplements. B vitamins are commonly added to energy drinks, many of which have been marketed with large amounts of B vitamins.

Because they are soluble in water, excess B vitamins are generally readily excreted, although individual absorption, use and metabolism may vary. The elderly and athletes may need to supplement their intake of B12 and other B vitamins due to problems in absorption and increased needs for energy production. In cases of severe deficiency, B vitamins, especially B12, may also be delivered by injection to reverse deficiencies. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetics may also be advised to supplement thiamine based on high prevalence of low plasma thiamine concentration and increased thiamine clearance associated with diabetes. Also, folate deficiency in early embryo development has been linked to neural tube defects. Thus, women planning to become pregnant are usually encouraged to increase daily dietary folate intake or take a supplement.

==Molecular functions==
To the right, a diagram of some of the major B vitamins (2, 3, 5, 9, and 12) are shown as precursors for certain essential biochemical reactants (FAD, NAD+, coenzyme A, and heme B respectively). The structural similarities between them are highlighted, which illustrates the precursor nature of many B vitamins while also showing the functionality of the end product used by essential reactions to support human, animal, or cellular life.

FAD, NAD+, and coenzyme A are all essential for the catabolic release of free energy (dG) to power the activity of the cell and more complex life forms. See the article on Catabolism for more details on how these three essential biochemical reactants help support life.

Tetrahydrofolate is a necessary co-reactant for synthesizing some amino acids, such as glycine. Heme B is the porphyrin derivative macrocycle molecule that holds the iron atom in place in hemoglobin, allowing for the transportation of oxygen through blood.

==Deficiencies==

Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B vitamins. Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease.

==Side effects==

Because water-soluble B vitamins are eliminated in the urine, taking large doses of certain B vitamins usually only produces transient side effects (only exception is pyridoxine). General side effects may include restlessness, nausea and insomnia. These side effects are almost always caused by dietary supplements and not foodstuffs.

==Discovery==

==Related compounds==

Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins as they were once believed to be vitamins. They are no longer considered as such, and the numbers that were assigned to them now form the &quot;gaps&quot; in the true series of B-complex vitamins described above (for example, there is no vitamin B4). Some of them, though not essential to humans, are essential in the diets of other organisms; others have no known nutritional value and may even be toxic under certain conditions.
* Vitamin B4: can refer to the distinct chemicals choline, adenine, or carnitine.
** Choline is synthesized by the human body, but not sufficiently to maintain good health, and is now considered an essential dietary nutrient.
** Adenine is a nucleobase synthesized by the human body.
** Carnitine is an essential dietary nutrient for certain worms, but not for humans.
* Vitamin B8: adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also known as adenylic acid. Vitamin B8 may also refer to inositol.
* Vitamin B10: &quot;para&quot;-aminobenzoic acid (pABA or PABA), a chemical component of the folate molecule produced by plants and bacteria, and found in many foods. It is best known as a UV-blocking sunscreen applied to the skin, and is sometimes taken orally for certain medical conditions.
* Vitamin B11: pteroylheptaglutamic acid (PHGA; chick growth factor). Vitamin Bc-conjugate was also found to be identical to PHGA. Derivative of folate (&quot;pteroylmonoglutamic acid&quot; in this nomenclature).
* Vitamin B13: orotic acid.
* Vitamin B14: cell proliferant, anti-anemia, rat growth factor, and antitumor pterin phosphate, named by Earl R. Norris. Isolated from human urine at 0.33ppm (later in blood), but later abandoned by him as further evidence did not confirm this. He also claimed this was not xanthopterin.
* Vitamin B15: pangamic acid, also known as pangamate. Promoted in various forms as a dietary supplement and drug; considered unsafe and subject to seizure by the US Food and Drug Administration.
* Vitamin B16: dimethylglycine (DMG) is synthesized by the human body from choline.
* Vitamin B17: pseudoscientific name for the poisonous compound amygdalin, also known as the equally pseudoscientific name &quot;nitrilosides&quot; despite the fact that it is a single compound. Amygdalin can be found in various plants, but is most commonly extracted from apricot pits and other similar fruit kernels. Amygdalin is hydrolyzed by various intestinal enzymes to form, among other things, hydrogen cyanide, which is toxic to human beings when exposed to a high enough dosage. Some proponents claim that amygdalin is effective in cancer treatment and prevention, despite its toxicity and a lack of scientific evidence.
* Vitamin B20: -carnitine.
* Vitamin Bf: carnitine.
* Vitamin Bm: &quot;myo&quot;-inositol, also called &quot;mouse antialopaecia factor&quot;.
* Vitamin Bp: &quot;antiperosis factor&quot;, which prevents perosis, a leg disorder, in chicks; can be replaced by choline and manganese salts.
* Vitamin BT: carnitine.
* Vitamin Bv: a type of B6 other than pyridoxine.
* Vitamin BW: a type of biotin other than d-biotin.
* Vitamin Bx: an alternative name for both pABA (see vitamin B10) and pantothenic acid.

<doc id="457930" wikidata="Q2825388" url="?curid=457930" title="Adventure!">
<text>Adventure! is a pulp action role-playing game originally printed by White Wolf Game Studio, the third and last book in the Trinity Universe line of games. The game, printed in black and white on pulp-like sepia paper to resemble a period piece, was conceived as a one-book game line, and was never supported by official supplements. Despite having a vocal fanbase, the Trinity Universe line was discontinued shortly after the game&#x27;s publication; a d20 system version was released in 2004, but quickly discontinued. In 2002, &quot;Adventure!&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Role-Playing Game of 2001&quot;. Onyx Path Publishing has recently acquired the rights to the Trinity Universe and has announced its intention to release a new edition of &quot;Adventure!&quot;

==Setting==
The game is set in the 1920s and therefore at the origin of the Trinity Universe timeline. The release of unknown Telluric energy has led to the appearance of a number of particularly gifted characters, whose actions have the potential for shaping the future history of the world. The Aeon Society for Gentlemen, founded by philanthropist Maxwell Mercer, is trying to bring together as many &quot;Inspired&quot; characters as possible, supporting and coordinating them in their effort for the betterment of all of humanity. But darkness lurks, and Mercer&#x27;s champions will have to face it in the most unlikely locales. There are three archetypes (&quot;character classes&quot;) for players to choose from:

*Daredevils - whose only &quot;powers&quot; revolve around luck and incredible skill.
*Mesmerists - the precursors to Trinity&#x27;s Psions, masters of the powers of the mind.
*Stalwarts - the precursors of Aberrant&#x27;s Novas, capable of superhuman feats.

==Game system==
Set to emulate the exploits of Saturday matinee serials and pulp magazine action, &quot;Adventure!&quot; uses a very loose and flexible variant of the White Wolf proprietary Storyteller System. &quot;Adventure!&quot; adds significantly to the Storyteller System in three areas: Knacks, Inspiration and Super-Science.

===Knacks===

Knacks are powers that differentiate adventurers and villains from normal human beings.

* Heroic powers enhance a human&#x27;s natural ability, but don’t appear supernatural. Examples include Lightning Reflexes, Amazing Resilience or Eagle Eyes.
* Psychic powers manipulate the mind and include telekinesis, telepathy and mind control.
* Dynamic powers are more obvious superhero style powers including flight, exceptional strength and supernatural toughness.

===Inspiration===

Inspiration is used to activate knacks, alter the story significantly (either as an instantaneous feat or by altering a potential cliffhanger to better suit the player) increase the number of dice you roll for an action or gain intuitive knowledge to move the story along. There are three facets, and associated traits, to Inspiration, each with their own advantages:

* Intuitive – Quicker reactions and better mental agility.
* Reflective – Increased patience and bonuses to extended actions.
* Destructive – Additional damage and concept damage.

<doc id="457932" wikidata="Q7764704" url="?curid=457932" title="The Sky So Big and Black">
<text>The Sky So Big and Black is a science fiction novel by John Barnes that was published in 2002. The title itself refers to the clear sky as seen from the surface of Mars, to the nearness of the Martian horizon because Mars is a much smaller planet, and to the abrupt absence/darkness of many overhead satellites that occurs at a key point in the story. The whole story takes place on Mars, which was first settled around 2030 in the timeframe of this series (see Barnes&#x27;s novels &quot;Orbital Resonance&quot; and &quot;Kaleidoscope Century&quot;). This novel takes place in (the mid-to-late 2090s) when humans have settled en masse, in at least three large waves of settlement.

==Plot summary==

This story alternates between the point of view of Terpsichore Melpomene Murray (&quot;Teri&quot;), an ecoprospector who&#x27;s approaching adulthood on Mars and seeks to follow in her father&#x27;s footsteps, and the unnamed psychiatrist who is listening to her story. Several decades earlier, refugees from Earth fled to join a pre-existing human colony on Mars to escape the domination of &quot;One True&quot;, a massively parallel/cellular automata program that runs on the interconnected brains of most of the human beings on Earth; the program in the individual human brain is called Resuna, probably a contraction from the Latin for One Thing. If a human mind has a copy of Resuna, it may remain dormant until a human speaks the trigger phrase &quot;let overwrite, let override.&quot;

The first half of the novel is mostly backstory in Teri&#x27;s voice, leading up to the day when she passed her test for &quot;full adulthood&quot;, a legal status that can apparently be reached at any age by passing an educational and psychiatric exam, which gives her the right to marry, hold property, vote, and so forth. Teri hopes to be an ecospector (eco-prospector) like her father Telemachus, living on the surface in a pressure suit most of the time; but because in the last generation the colonists decided to forgo terraforming Mars to suit human life and instead adapt humans to suit the Martian environment, the future of ecospecting doesn&#x27;t look good to Telemachus; he thinks the future of Mars is with the &quot;Nations&quot; of Mars-formed humans. It&#x27;s estimated that modifying people can be done in just two to three generations, whereas terraforming Mars might take thousands of years. Thus he wants her to get an advanced degree and go into some always-needed occupation like science or medicine.

When they strike a &quot;scorehole&quot;, a very large deposit of methane and water, their fortune seems assured, and Teri expects to marry the boy she has been courting; when it turns out he has married someone else, she grumpily agrees to one more year of school at least, and she and Telemachus take on the job of shepherding a group of younger children to the school at Red Sands City. While the party are in the roundings (the frontier, bush, or outback—possibly from &quot;surroundings&quot; or &quot;roundabouts&quot;?) a major solar flare occurs, and because Mars&#x27; thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field provide less protection against high-energy particles than on Earth, this event overloads many electronics systems on Mars, as well as damaging the &quot;exosuit&quot; (space suit) systems of many people who are outdoors and otherwise unprotected, so that several members of the party are killed, including Telemachus. Furthermore, the GPS-like navigation system Teri has used all her life is permanently down.

Teri and Alik, a boy in the party, re-invent celestial navigation and reach the nearest railhead, where there is a working phone, only to find that the disaster is planetwide and help will not be coming soon. Worse yet, a group of Marsform humans are stranded farther up the track and in danger of starving due to their ultrafast metabolisms. Despite her bigotry against the Nations, Teri tries to take food to them in a backpack, but collapses and breaks her leg. A mysterious voice on her suit radio soothes and comforts her, takes over her body, and causes her to wreck her body getting food to the Marsforms; she has been taken over by Resuna. We now learn why the psychiatrist himself has been listening to her story; they are recording it so she can have some idea of what happened in the big gaps he is going to create in her memory while erasing Resuna. He himself has had this process twice.

Further, we learn that this is all information from the past, that in fact he has been re-infected with Resuna, and so has Teri, and that they will both lose all memory of each other and of the many events, including much of her last memories of her father. So although they have been close friends, in the last chapter they are re-introduced to each other for the first time. The novel ends with their working as ecospecting partners, as Mars rebuilds.

==Reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; recommended the novel to &quot;anyone interested in vivid near-future worlds, engaging characters and moral questions with no simple answers.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; stated: &quot;Thoughtful and absorbing, to begin with; and just when you feel you&#x27;ve had enough of Teri and her problems, the Sunburst propels the story into entirely different dimensions. A winner.&quot; Don D&#x27;Ammassa of the &quot;Science Fiction Chronicle&quot; wrote that it &quot;is one of a growing number of recent novels to deal realistically with the colonization of that planet, and it&#x27;s one of the better ones.&quot;

The EP is a concept album based on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which is retold in an urban setting. Several tracks from the EP also sample music from the 1978 film &quot;The Wiz&quot;, another urban reimagining of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. A song with the same title had previously been released on the album &quot;Carnival of Carnage&quot;.

==Plot==
Violent J takes on the role of this story&#x27;s version of Dorothy, making his way through this strange new land to get back to his home. Along the way, he meets the Scarecrow (Twiztid&#x27;s Monoxide), who only needs somebody to smoke with, the Tin Man (Twiztid&#x27;s Jamie Madrox), who wants a &quot;gat&quot;, and the Lion (Blaze Ya Dead Homie), who wants some &quot;hoes&quot;. Anybody Killa has a brief cameo as a guard in the Wizard&#x27;s palace as well as fellow Insane Clown Posse member Shaggy 2 Dope appears as the Wizard.

==Release==
The EP contains nine story tracks and two &quot;bonus tracks&quot;. It was also released in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; tin which featured two different bonus tracks and a package of &quot;Violent Joint&quot; rolling paper. In an early 2014 interview Violent J said that he would like to do a Wizard Of The Hood show. During ICP&#x27;s 2014 GOTJ seminar he said that it may happen very soon. On July 24, 2015 during ICP&#x27;s seminar Violent J said that he would like to do a Wizard of the Hood full album set at the 2016 GOTJ if Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie are down to do it also. Violent J announced in October, 2015 that they will be performing the whole Wizard of the Hood setlist for GOTJ 17 (2016) complete with changing sets and Twiztid and Blaze Ya Dead Homie will be on stage to do their parts.

<doc id="457941" wikidata="Q5446022" url="?curid=457941" title="Feudal (game)">
<text>Feudal is a chess-like board wargame for 2–6 players on two or four opposing sides. It was originally published by 3M Company in 1967 as part of its bookshelf game series, and was republished by Avalon Hill after they purchased 3M&#x27;s game division. The object of the game is to either occupy one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s castle or to capture all of one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s royalty. There are six sets of plastic pieces in three shades each of blue and brown. Each set consists of thirteen mobile figures with differing methods of movement and attack, and a stationary castle piece. The play area consists of four plastic peg boards depicting empty, rough, and mountainous terrain.

==History==
&quot;Feudal&quot; was originally published by 3M in 1967 as part of its bookshelf game series and later reissued by 3M in 1969 and 1973. It was reissued in 1976 and 1981 by Avalon Hill. A new German edition was issued in 1979 by Schmidt International, though the first German edition was issued by 3M in 1967.

==Setting==
The game takes place in the Middle Ages, where two fictional feudal kingdoms—one led by Ethelred the Great, the other by Aelfric the Barbaric—vied for control of territory which lay between their borders. Each had called upon his son, the prince, and his brother, the duke, to help command his army. The feud had lasted generations but on this day both kings had come to the conclusion that the only way to settle the dispute was to conquer their rival&#x27;s kingdom. To this end, both kings, each supported by their respective prince and duke, prepared to invade and conquer the enemy. It is at this point that gameplay begins.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Feudal&quot; is won by either capturing your opponent&#x27;s castle or slaying all of his royalty (i.e. King, Prince, and Duke). Each of the six armies contains a castlepiece, one each of the royalty, one Squire, one Archer, two Knights, two Sergeants, and four Pikemen. The castlepiece has two parts, the castle and the castle green (entrance), each of which takes up one board space. To capture the castle, a figure must first be moved onto the green and wait one turn before moving into the castle proper. A player may defend his/her castle by placing a figure (except the archer or squire) inside.

===Two-player game===
In a two-player game, one player takes a blue army and the other takes a brown army. The players toss a coin; the winner of the toss moves first and the loser of the toss may select two adjoining quadrants of the board on which to set up his forces. A divider screen is placed across the board and both players set up their pieces in secret. Once both players are ready the screen is removed and play begins. A player may move any number of pieces during his/her turn but he/she must move at least one.

===Team play (3–6 players)===
In team play a captain is chosen for both the blue and brown armies. The captain selects an army complete with castle and royalty; his teammate(s) select another army of the same color but do not receive a castle or royalty. Instead, the captain grants his/her teammate(s) his prince and/or duke to &quot;lead&quot; their forces. If there is an odd number of players, the captain of the short team gains the use of an additional army (minus castle and royalty) so that each side remains even. Gameplay otherwise resembles a two-player game.

===Alternate 4-player game===
Rather than a team format, four players may each select their own army and take a single quadrant of the board for their own. This game plays as a free-for-all. However, unlike two-player or team play, the only way to eliminate an opponent is by capturing their castle. When a player&#x27;s castle is captured, it is removed from the board along with any remaining royalty. Additionally, any of the player&#x27;s remaining pieces fall under the command of the conquering player on his/her next turn.

==Figures==
==Board layout==
The board is made up of four square panels, each comprising 12 x 12 movement spaces. The mountains and rough terrain are scattered throughout the board space. The separability of the four panels allows a variety of board layouts, as each may be freely turned to change the landscape of the board.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Feudal&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, calling it a &quot;chess-like game&quot; and noting that &quot;The initial set-up is done simultaneously and secretly, so you face different types of strategic problems each game.&quot;

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Feudal&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting that &quot;the initial set-up is done secretly, so the game is constantly surprising&quot;.

&quot;Games &amp; Puzzles&quot; felt that the ideal version of the game was the two-player version with each player having two armies, but concluded that there was &quot;very little classifiable strategy&quot;. &quot;The Playboy Winner&#x27;s Guide to Board Games&quot; thought that the game was not &quot;entirely successful&quot;, with the fact that players moved all of their pieces each turn reducing the gambit and planning aspect of chess.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine gave it 5/5 for originality and replayability.

&quot;Feudal&quot; has received 950 ratings with an average rating of 5.92 (on a 1–10 scale) on Board Game Geek. Detractors complain that the game&#x27;s complexity lends to an in-game analysis time that can potentially exceed opponents&#x27; span of interest; though the same can be said of the game of chess.

<text>The Comacine masters (&quot;magistri comacini&quot;) were early medieval Lombard stonemasons working in a region of excellent building stone who gave to Lombardy its preeminence in the stone architecture that preceded Romanesque style.

==Comacini==
Their masons&#x27; marks have suggested arcane meanings for some enthusiasts. The name &quot;comacini&quot; Romantic historians of the nineteenth century traced to the location where they supposedly had their headquarters, the minute Isola Comacina in Lake Como, alleged to have been a safe haven during the Lombard invasion; a more inventive etymology derives from a supposed Latin expression &quot;cum machinis&quot;, referring to their tools.

The first mention of Comacine masters was in an edict of 643 of the Lombard king Rothari, which concerned itself in Lombard fashion mainly with the indemnity that would be due should a house collapse which had been built by a &quot;magister comacinus&quot; for a patron &quot;ad opera dictandi&quot; (&quot;commissioning the works&quot;). The reference has been interpreted as granting certain privileges to &quot;magistri comacini&quot;, but the context shows that modern readers are correct in interpreting the key word &quot;comacini&quot; simply as &quot;masons&quot;. &quot;Comacini&quot; are also mentioned in a passage in the &quot;Memoratorium&quot; of Liutprand the Lombard.

The survival of brotherhoods of the &quot;comacini&quot; are based on the hypothesis that the Roman secrets of masonry construction were never utterly lost in Italy but were passed on by the mason brotherhoods, which were supposed to be among the numerous documented &quot;collegia&quot; in which workingmen joined together for mutual protection, fraternal banqueting and eventual support of their widows throughout the Roman Empire, sometimes associated together as masters of the &quot;arcana&quot; or &quot;mysteries&quot; of their craft. Each such confraternity was composed of men (never women) located in a single town, and was made up of men of a single craft or those worshipping a single deity, free, freedmen and slaves together, forming a bond very like the image of a city, always under the uneasy surveillance of officialdom. Such, it supposed, were the &quot;comacini&quot; whose geographical center in the Early Middle Ages originated in Lombardy, in Como and Pavia.

If mason&#x27;s marks were the sign of the &quot;comacini&quot;, then evidence of their work has been found in several parts of Europe, as far as the capitals of the crypt in the cathedral of Lund. The &quot;Como-Pavian&quot; architectural sculpture is recognized in the cathedral of Modena and its Torre della Ghirlandina, in central and southern Italy, west across Languedoc to Iberian Peninsula, across southern Germany as far as Hungary, and even in England.

In the Middle Ages, artists did not customarily sign their work, so to detect the work of this corporation, historians look to masons&#x27; marks inscribed in the stonework; in this way historians have traced comacine master&#x27;s influence as far as Sweden and Syria. Freemasons claimed descent from the guilds of &quot;comacini&quot;.

The efflorescence of a &quot;Como-Pavian&quot; school of sculptural decoration on pulpits and portals that surfaced in the area of Como in the late eleventh century and developed luxuriously to enrich facades in Pavia in the 1130s, then were disseminated more widely in the twelfth and thirteenth century, doubtless by travelling groups of artisans, is traditionally ascribed to a surfacing of a long-buried tradition of &quot;comacini&quot; sculptors, who were influenced by the animal interlaces of Lombard metalwork. In this &quot;corrente comasca&quot; that spread on the periphery of Romanesque and Early Gothic art, geometric interlaces are peopled with sleek monsters and figures that seem to synthesize some very disparate and distant influences: barbaric Longobard metalwork, Ottonian illuminations, Byzantine silk patterns, Islamic patterning, Coptic reliefs, have all been compared to the &quot;Como-Pavian&quot; current of sculpture.
Another notable group of medieval stoneworkers were maestri Campionesi from Campione, not far from Como.

<doc id="457947" wikidata="Q334739" url="?curid=457947" title="Jehoram of Israel">
<text>Jehoram or Joram () was the ninth king of the northern Kingdom of Israel according to 2 Kings 8:16 and 2 Kings 8:25–28. He was the son of King Ahab and Jezebel and brother to Ahaziah and Athaliah.

According to 2 Kings 8:16, in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel, a different Jehoram became king of Judah. The author of the Books of Kings speaks of both Jehoram of Israel and Jehoram of Judah in the same passage. They were brothers-in-law since Jehoram of Judah married Athaliah, sister of Jehoram of Israel.

==Biblical narrative==
Jehoram began his reign in the 18th year of Jehoshaphat of Judah and ruled 12 years according to 2 Kings 3:1. William F. Albright dated his reign to 849–842 BCE, whereas E. R. Thiele proposed 852–841 BCE.

Unlike his predecessors, Jehoram did not worship Ba&#x27;al. He removed the &quot;pillar of Baal&quot; according to 2 Kings 3:2, probably a special pillar that Ahab had erected near his palace at the then-capital of Jezreel. However, the writer of 2 Kings says that he still &quot;followed in the ways of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who led the Israelites to sin.&quot; With Jehoshaphat of Judah, Jehoram attacked Moab, which was ruled by Mesha. In the war between Aram-Damascus and Israel, Elisha the prophet befriended Joram, revealing to him the plans of the enemy. Subsequently, when Ben-hadad of Aram-Damascus besieged Samaria, the capital of Israel, it reduced the city almost to starvation and cannibalism. As a result, Jehoram sought to behead Elisha. The latter, however, foretold that a period of plenty was imminent; the siege was soon lifted, the city&#x27;s food supplies were replenished, and the old relation between the king and the prophet was restored.

When Hazael, king of the Arameans, violently revolted in Damascus, as Elisha had predicted in , Jehoram allied with his nephew Ahaziah, king of Judah. The two kings set forth to take Ramoth-Gilead from Aram-Damascus. The battle failed; Jehoram was wounded in the fighting and withdrew to Jezreel to recover. His defeat at Ramoth-Gilead was likely a disaster. As a result, while Jehoram was recuperating at Jezreel, his general, Jehu, incited a revolt. Jehu executed Jehoram by shooting him in the back with an arrow and had his body thrown into the field of Naboth as punishment for his parents&#x27; sin in illegally stealing Naboth&#x27;s land. Jehoram and his other family members died, and the Omride dynasty ended. Jehu claimed the throne of Israel as his own.

==Archaeology==
The author of the Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE, found in 1993 and 1994) claimed to have slain both Ahaziah of Judah and Jehoram of Israel. Most scholars identify Hazael of Aram-Damascus (c. 842 – 806 BCE) as the author. The coalition that had been forged between Ahab and Hadadezer, who had provided the main force that stopped the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar, had fallen apart under their successors and in the succeeding war between Israel and Judah against Aram-Damascus the kings of Israel and Judah were killed. Jehu, an important military leader, became king after this event.

On the Mesha Stele, which is dated to ca. 840 BCE, King Mesha of Moab claimed an important victory against Israel after having been oppressed by Omri and his son (not mentioning anyone specifically) for forty years, retaking several towns and many prisoners of war. The biblical story claims this revolt started during the short rule of Ahaziah of Judah and continued until the reign of Jehoram in 2 Kings 3. The reference to Omri&#x27;s &quot;son&quot; has been understood by some scholars to refer to a second or third-generation descendant of Omri (either Ahaziah or Jehoram) rather than a direct son.

<doc id="457948" wikidata="Q841198" url="?curid=457948" title="Cephalotaxaceae">
<text>Cephalotaxaceae is a small family of conifers. It is often treated as a monophyletic family including only the single genus &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot;, while others have also included &quot;Torreya&quot; and &quot;Amentotaxus&quot; in the family. Cephalotaxaceae is closely allied to the yew family Taxaceae, and is often included in a wide interpretation of Taxaceae, based on phylogenetic evidence and close morphological similarities between them. Included species were restricted to east Asia, except for two species of &quot;Torreya&quot; found in the southwest and southeast of the United States; fossil evidence shows a much wider prehistorical Northern Hemisphere distribution. The most notable differences between Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae concerned the cone aril, which fully encloses the seeds of Cephalotaxaceae, the longer maturation of Cephalotaxaceae seeds and the larger size of the mature seeds.

When considered as a distinct family, members of Cephalotaxaceae are much branched, small trees and shrubs. The leaves are evergreen, spirally arranged, often twisted at the base to appear biranked. They are linear to lanceolate, and have pale green or white stomatal bands on the undersides. The plants are monoecious, subdioecious, or dioecious. The male cones are 4–25 mm long, and shed pollen in the early spring. The female cones are reduced, with one to a few ovuliferous scales, and one seed on each ovuliferous scale. As the seed matures, the ovuliferous scale develops into a fleshy aril fully enclosing the seed. The mature aril is thin, green, purple or red, soft and resinous. Each ovuliferous scale remains discrete, so the cone develops into a short stem with one to a few berry-like seeds. They are probably eaten by birds or other animals which then disperse the hard seed undamaged in their droppings, but seed dispersal mechanisms in the family are not yet well researched.

<doc id="457949" wikidata="Q313215" url="?curid=457949" title="Jehoram of Judah">
<text>Jehoram of Judah (, ) or Joram (; ; ), was the fifth king of Judah, and the son of king Jehoshaphat. Jehoram rose to the throne at the age of 32 and reigned for 8 years (, ), although he was ill during his last two years ().

==Name==
The name &quot;Jehoram&quot; is confusing in the biblical account. The author of Kings speaks of both Jehoram of Israel and Jehoram of Judah in the same passage, and both reigned at the same time. Both Jehorams are also referred to as Joram, even in the same translation in the same breath. For example, reads:

:5 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead; and the Arameans wounded Joram.
:6 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

Likewise, the king of Judah is referred to as Jehoram or Joram in a single translation. For example, uses the name Joram while , which describe the same event in almost identical words, uses the name Jehoram. This episode is described in the Tel Dan stele, likely erected by Hazael.

==Reign==
According to , Jehoram became king of Judah in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel, when his father Jehoshaphat was (still) king of Judah, indicating a coregency. Jehoram took the throne at the age of 32 and reigned for 8 years. To secure his position Jehoram killed his six brothers, who were named as Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah in .

His father, Jehoshaphat, had allied with the Kingdom of Israel, and one of the terms of this alliance was that Jehoram married Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab. Despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, Jehoram&#x27;s rule of Judah was shaky. Edom, then ruled by a viceroy of the king of Judah, revolted, and when Jehoram marched against this people, his army fled before the Edomites. He was forced to acknowledge their independence. The town of Libnah revolted during his reign according to 2 Chronicles 21:10 because he &quot;had abandoned Yahweh, God of his fathers&quot;.

Jehoram took to wife Athaliah, his namesake&#x27;s sister and daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, &quot;and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab&quot; (II Kings viii. 18, 27). His wickedness would have brought his people to destruction, except for the promise to David &quot;to give him always a light, and to his children&quot; (ib. viii. 19; comp. I Kings xi. 36, xv. 4). The Edomites, who had been subservient to Judah since David&#x27;s day (II Sam. viii. 14), revolted. Jehoram&#x27;s attempt to force them to submit almost resulted in a fatal disaster for his troops. His army was surrounded but, under cover of night, succeeded in cutting its way out and retreating to its territory. About the same time, Libnah revolted, and the Philistines and Arabians invaded the land of Judah, captured and sacked Jerusalem, and carried off all the royal household except Jehoahaz (Ahaziah; II Chron. xxi. 16, 17). During this time, he received a letter from the prophet Elijah, warning him God would put a plague on the land and smite him for his poor ruling (). After this, God smote Jehoram with an illness that made &quot;his bowels fall out,&quot; and he died two years later (). Jehoram&#x27;s idolatry, viciousness, and general wickedness brought upon him an incurable disease. At the end of two years of intense suffering he died, unmourned, and despised by his people. They &quot;made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers,&quot; and &quot;they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings&quot; (ib. xxi. 19). Modern scholars debate whether this illness was a form of colorectal cancer, or some other issue resulting in rectal prolapse.

==Chronological notes==
William F. Albright has dated his reign to 849–842 BCE. Edwin Thiele placed a coregency of Jehoram with his father Jehoshaphat, starting in 853/852 BCE, with the beginning of his sole reign occurring in 848/847 and his death in 841/840 BCE. As explained in the Rehoboam article, Thiele&#x27;s chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency that later scholars corrected by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Jehoram&#x27;s dates are taken as one year earlier in the present article: coregency beginning in 854/853, sole reign commencing in 849/848, and death in 842/841 BCE.

The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jehoram, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the first year of his sole reign to some time between Nisan 1 of 848 BCE and the day before Tishri 1 of the same BCE year. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 849/848 BCE, or more simply 849 BC. His death occurred at some time between Nisan 1 and the day before Tishri 1 of 841 BCE, i.e. in 842/841 BCE according to the Judean calendar. For calculation purposes this can be written in the simpler form 842 BCE, even though Jehoram&#x27;s death occurred in the next BCE year. This potential confusion is because of expressing dates in a January-based (Roman) calendar; a better notation would be something like 842t, the &quot;t&quot; standing for Tishri, indicating that the year crossed over into the two years 842 and 841 of the modern calendar.

Dates in the present article are one year earlier than those given in the third edition of Thiele&#x27;s &quot;The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot;, thereby correcting an internal consistency that Thiele never resolved, as explained in the Rehoboam article. According to McFall&#x27;s revision of Thiele&#x27;s chronology, the phrase &quot;second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah&quot; in 2 Kings 1:17 is the period of &quot;co-regency&quot; on the throne of Judah with his father Jehoshaphat, who was then in his 18th year of sole reign as noted in 2 Kings 3:1. In Thiele-McFall&#x27;s calculation, this time point falls between April and September 852 BCE. In 2 Kings 8:16, the phrase &quot;fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab&quot; (following &quot;non-accession year method&quot; fell between April and September 848 BCE) Jehoram became the sole king of Judah after being &quot;co-regent&quot; with his father (as the text indicated: &quot;Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah&quot;) since September (Tishrei) 854 BCE.

Thiele showed that for the reign of Jehoram, Judah adopted Israel&#x27;s non-accession method of counting the years of reign, meaning that the first partial year of the king&#x27;s reign was counted as his first full year, in contrast to the &quot;accession&quot; method previously in use whereby the first partial year was counted as year &quot;zero&quot;, and &quot;year one&quot; was assigned to the first full year of reign. Thiele attributed this change to the rapprochement between Judah and Israel, whereby Jehoshaphat, Jehoram&#x27;s father, made common cause with Ahab at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and chose a daughter for his son from the house of Ahab (1 Kings 22:1–38, 2 Kings 8:18). This convention was followed in Judah for the next three monarchs: Ahaziah, Athaliah, and Jehoash, returning to Judah&#x27;s original accession reckoning in the time of Amaziah. These changes can be inferred from a careful comparison of the textual data in the Scripture, but because the Scriptural texts do not state explicitly whether the reckoning was by accession or non-accession counting, nor do they indicate explicitly when a change was made in the method, many have criticized Thiele&#x27;s chronology as being entirely arbitrary in its assignment of accession and non-accession reckoning. The arbitrariness, however, apparently rested with the ancient kings and their court recorders, not with Thiele. The official records of Tiglath-Pileser III show that he switched (arbitrarily) to non-accession reckoning for his reign, in contrast with the accession method used for previous kings of Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser left no record explaining to modern historians which kind of method he was using, nor that he was switching from the method used by his predecessors; all of this is determined by a careful comparison of the relevant texts by Assyriologists, the same as Thiele did for the regnal data of Judah and Israel.

<text>Heather Pamela McKay (née Blundell) (born 31 July 1941) is an Australian retired squash player, who is considered by many to be the greatest female player in the history of the game. She dominated the women&#x27;s squash game in the 1960s and 1970s, winning 16 consecutive British Open titles from 1962 to 1977, and capturing the inaugural women&#x27;s World Open title in 1976, while remaining undefeated during that period. She was also a top-level player of other sports, including field hockey and racquetball.

==Career==
McKay was born in 1941 as Heather Blundell in Queanbeyan. She came from a family of eleven children. Her father was a baker and her mother a stay-at-home parent. The entire family was athletic, with some members competing at a high level. Her parents encouraged McKay to play tennis in the summer and hockey in the winter. It wasn&#x27;t until she was eighteen years old that she encountered squash as a way to improve her fitness. Initially, she did this non-professionally and without formal coaching, until a friend suggested she compete in the &quot;New South Wales Country Championship&quot;. There, she won the junior and women&#x27;s titles.

Her success at that championship was noticed by the president of the Australian Squash Association. On his recommendation, McKay participated in the 1960 &quot;New South Wales Championships&quot; in Sydney. She won the junior tournament but lost in the quarterfinals of the women&#x27;s tournament to Yvonne West. After this tournament, she shifted her focus from tennis to squash, although she did not completely give up other sports. Her potential was also noticed by squash champion, and the patriarch of the Khan squash family of Pakistan, Hashim Khan, who told the press in Canberra, &quot;this girl could be very good&quot;.

In 1960, she won the Australian title for the first time, which she would win thirteen more times consecutively. She also won the New South Wales and Victoria championships between 1961 and 1973. Supported by sponsors, she then moved to Sydney to further her career. There, she met Brian McKay, whom she married in 1965 and whose surname she took.

In 1962, she lost to Fran Marshall at the Scottish Championship. This was her second loss in her professional career, and the last until her retirement in 1979. That same year, she participated for the first time in the &quot;British Open Squash Championship&quot;, known until 1976 as the unofficial world championship. She won this tournament and the following fifteen times.

Meanwhile, McKay remained interested in other sports from her youth. She represented Australia in hockey in 1967 and 1971.

In 1976, she won the first World Open Squash for women, although it is disputed whether this tournament was an official world championship. McKay moved to Toronto in 1975 and competed in the US squash championship in 1977, which she won. In 1979, she competed again in the World Open Squash, this time officially undisputed, and won it again.

At the age of 38 McKay retired from squash. McKay wrote a book, &quot;Heather McKay&#x27;s Complete Book of Squash&quot;, which was released in 1979. After her retirement she took up racquetball, in which she was also successful. As early as 1977, she won the US Amateur Racquetball Championship. In 1980, she won the Canadian Racquetball Championship, which she won again from 1982 to 1985. In 1980, 1981, and 1984, she won the US Professional Racquetball Championship.

In 1985, she moved back to Australia. That year, she became an assistant coach for squash at the Australian Institute of Sport in Brisbane, with Geoff Hunt as head coach. In that role, she coached Michelle Martin, Natalie Grinham, and Rachel Grinham. Besides coaching, she also won the &quot;World Masters Squash Championships&quot; four times during that period: in 1987 and 1990 in the over-45 category and in 1993 and 1995 in the over-50 category. She stopped coaching in 1999 and ended her involvement in squash. She then moved to Canberra.

Since the late 1990s, she has participated in senior tennis tournaments, both singles and doubles. In 2001, she won the World Senior Championships and the team event, the &quot;Alice Marble Cup&quot;. In 2016, her partner passed away, which prompted her to move back to Queanbeyan in 2018.

<doc id="457968" wikidata="Q1754646" url="?curid=457968" title="Power strip">
<text>A power strip (also known as a multi-socket, power board and many other variations) is a block of electrical sockets that attaches to the end of a flexible cable (typically with a mains plug on the other end), allowing multiple electrical devices to be powered from a single electrical socket. Power strips are often used when many electrical devices are in proximity, such as for audio, video, computer systems, appliances, power tools, and lighting. Power strips often include a circuit breaker to interrupt the electric current in case of an overload or a short circuit. Some power strips provide protection against electrical power surges. Typical housing styles include strip, rack-mount, under-monitor and direct plug-in.

== Control ==

Some power strips include a master switch to turn all devices on and off. This can be used with simple devices, such as lights, but not with most computers, which must use shutdown commands from the software first. Computers may have open files, which may be damaged if the power is simply turned off.

Some power strips have individually switched outlets.

&quot;Master/slave&quot; strips can detect one &quot;master&quot; device being turned off (such as the PC itself in a computer setup, or a TV in a home theatre) and turn everything else on or off accordingly.

Remote control strips are used in data centers, to allow computer systems or other devices to be remotely restarted, often over the Internet (although this leaves them vulnerable to outside attacks).

== Indication ==
Many power strips have a neon or LED indicator light or one per output socket to show when power is on. Better-quality surge-protected strips have additional lights to indicate the status of the surge protection system, however these are not always reliable as an indicator.

== Energy-saving features and standby power ==
Some power strips have energy-saving features, which switch off the strip if appliances go into standby mode. Using a sensor circuit, they detect if the level of power through the socket is in standby mode (less than 30 watts), and if so they will turn off that socket. This reduces the consumption of standby power used by computer peripherals and other equipment when not in use, saving money and energy Some more-sophisticated power strips have a master and slave socket arrangement, and when the &quot;master&quot; socket detects standby mode in the attached appliance&#x27;s current it turns off the whole strip.

However, there can be problems detecting standby power in appliances that use more power in standby mode (such as plasma televisions) as they will always appear to the power strip to be switched on. When using a master–slave power strip, one way to avoid such problems is to plug an appliance with a lower standby wattage (such as a DVD player) into the master socket, using it as the master control instead.

A different power strip design intended to save energy uses a passive infrared (PIR) or ultrasonic sound detector to determine if a person is nearby. If the sensors don&#x27;t detect any motion for a preset period of time, the strip shuts off several outlets, while leaving one outlet on for devices that should not be powered off. These so-called &quot;smart power strips&quot; are intended to be installed in offices, to shut down equipment when the office is unoccupied.

It is recommended that appliances that need a controlled shutdown sequence (such as many ink-jet printers) &quot;not&quot; be plugged into a slave socket on such a strip as it can damage them if they are switched off incorrectly (for example the inkjet printer may not have capped the print head in time, and consequently the ink will dry and clog the print head.)

Within Europe, power strips with energy-saving features are within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC and require a CE mark.

== Socket arrangement ==
In some countries where multiple socket types are in use, a single power strip can have two or more kinds of sockets. Socket arrangement varies considerably, but for physical access reasons there are rarely more than two rows. In Europe, power strips without surge suppression are normally single row, but models with surge suppression are supplied both in single and double row configurations.

If sockets on a power strip are grouped closely together, a cable with a large &quot;wall wart&quot; transformer at its end may cover up multiple sockets. Various designs address this problem, some by simply increasing the spacing between outlets. Other designs include receptacles which rotate in their housing, or multiple short receptacle cords feeding from a central hub. A simple DIY method for adapting problematic power strips arrangements to large &quot;wall warts&quot; is to use a three-way socket adapter to extend the socket above its neighbors, providing the required clearance.

== Surge protection and filtering ==

Many power strips have built-in surge protectors or EMI/RFI filters: these are sometimes described as surge suppressors or electrical line conditioners. Some also provide surge suppression for phone lines, TV cable coax, or network cable. Unprotected power strips are often mistakenly called &quot;surge suppressors&quot; or &quot;surge protectors&quot; even though they may have &quot;no ability to suppress surges&quot;.

Surge suppression is usually provided by one or more metal-oxide varistors (MOVs), which are inexpensive two-terminal semiconductors. These act as very high speed switches, momentarily limiting the peak voltage across their terminals. By design, MOV surge limiters are selected to trigger at a voltage somewhat above the local mains supply voltage, so that they do not clip normal voltage peaks, but clip abnormal higher voltages.

Mains electrical power circuits are generally grounded (earthed), so there will be a live (hot) wire, a neutral wire, and a ground wire. Low-cost power strips often come with only one MOV mounted between the live and neutral wires. More complete (and desirable) power strips will have three MOVs, connected between each possible pair of wires. Since MOVs degrade somewhat each time they are triggered, power strips using them have a limited, and unpredictable, protective life. Some power strips have &quot;protection status&quot; lights which are designed to turn off if protective MOVs connected to the live wire have failed, but such simple circuits cannot detect all failure modes (such as failure of a MOV connected between neutral and ground).

The surge-induced triggering of MOVs can cause damage to an upstream device, such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), which typically sees an overload condition while the surge is being suppressed. Therefore, it is recommended not to connect a surge-protected power strip to a UPS, but instead to rely solely on surge protection provided by the UPS itself.

More-elaborate power strips may use inductor-capacitor networks to achieve a similar effect of protecting equipment from high voltage spikes on the mains circuit. These more-expensive arrangements are much less prone to silent degradation than MOVs, and often have monitoring lights that indicate whether the protective circuitry is still connected.

In the European Union, power strips with surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the (LVD) Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-11:2002+A1. The standard covers both the performance of the surge suppression circuit and their safety. Likewise, power strips with telecoms surge suppression circuits can demonstrate compliance with the LVD by complying with the requirements of EN 61643-21:2001.

=== Daisy chaining and surge protection ===
Connecting MOV-protected power strips in a &quot;daisy chain&quot; (in a series, with each power strip plugged into a previous one in the chain) does not necessarily increase the protection they provide. Connecting them in this manner effectively connects their surge protection components in parallel, in theory spreading any potential surge across each surge protector. However, due to manufacturing variations between the MOVs, the surge energy will not be spread evenly, and will typically go through the one that triggers first.

Daisy chaining of power strips (known in building and electric codes as multi-plug adapters or relocatable power taps), whether surge protected or not, is specifically against most codes. As an example, the International Code Council&#x27;s &quot;International Fire Code 2009 Edition&quot; in 605.4.2 states, &quot;Relocatable power taps shall be directly connected to permanently installed receptacles.&quot;

== Overload protection ==
Where the current rating of the socket outlet, plug and lead of the power strip is equal to the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, additional overload protection for the power strip is unnecessary, since the existing circuit breaker will provide the required protection.
However, where the rating of a socket outlet (and, hence, the plug and lead of the power strip) is less than the rating of the circuit breaker supplying the circuit concerned, overload protection for the power strip and its supply cable is necessary.

In the UK, standard BS 1363 plugs and sockets are rated at 13 A but are provided on circuits protected by circuit breakers of up to 32 A.
However, UK Consumer Protection legislation requires that plug-in domestic electrical goods must be provided with plugs to BS 1363, which include a fuse rated at not more than 13 A.
Hence, in the UK and in other countries using BS 1363 plugs, this fused plug provides overload protection for any power strip. The fuse must be replaced if the power strip is overloaded, causing the fuse to operate.
In Australia and New Zealand the rating for a standard socket outlet is 10 Amperes but these outlets are provided on circuits usually protected by circuit breakers of 16 or 20 A capacity. Also, it is possible to insert an Australian/NZ 10 A plug into socket outlets rated at up to 32 A.
Hence, all power strips sold in Australia and New Zealand with three or more 10A socket outlets are required to have overload protection so that if the total current drawn exceeds 10 A the inbuilt circuit breaker will operate and disconnect &quot;all&quot; connected devices.
These power strips have a reset button for the circuit breaker, which is used to return the strip to service after an overload has caused it to trip.

On some power strips, the red, lighted rocker switch actually controls a thermal circuit breaker which flips to off when tripped. Resetting is done by flipping the switch back on.

== Safety ==

Electrical overloading can be a problem with any sort of power distribution adapter. This is especially likely if multiple high-power appliances are used, such as those with heating elements, like room heaters or electric frying pans. Power strips may have a circuit breaker integrated to prevent overload. In the UK, power strips are required to be protected by the fuse in the BS 1363 plug. Some also feature a 13A BS1362 fuse in the socket end.

Power strips are generally considered a safer alternative to “double adapters”, “two-way plugs”, “three-way plugs”, or “cube taps” which plug directly into the socket with no lead for multiple appliances. These low-cost adapters are generally not fused (although more modern ones in the UK and Ireland are). Therefore, in many cases the only protection against overload is the branch circuit fuse which may well have a rating higher than the adapter. The weight of the plugs pulling on the adapter (and often pulling it part way out of the socket) can also be a problem if adapters are stacked or if they are used with brick-style power supplies. Such adapters, while still available, have largely fallen out of use in some countries (although two- and three-way adapters are still common in the US, UK, and Ireland).

When plugging a device into a power strip, a buildup of carbon or dust can cause sparking to occur. This generally doesn&#x27;t pose much of a risk in a non-explosive atmosphere, but explosive atmospheres (for example, near a gasoline refueling station or a solvent cleaning facility) require specialized explosion-proof sealed electrical equipment.

=== US regulations ===
* Underwriters Laboratories standard 1363 contains requirements for &quot;relocatable power taps&quot;. Included in the scope section of the standard is the statement: 
* National Electrical Code recognizes power strip as Multioutlet Assembly in Article 380.

=== EU and UK regulations ===
In Europe, plugs and sockets without additional control or surge protection circuits are outside the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and controlled by National regulations, and therefore must not be CE marked. In the UK the legal requirements for plugs and sockets are listed in Statutory Instrument 1994 No. 1768, The Plugs and Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994. This regulation lists the requirements for all domestic plugs and sockets; including socket outlet units (power strips), see Electrical Equipment - Requirements for Plugs &amp; Sockets etc. - Guidance notes on the UK Plugs &amp; Sockets etc. (Safety) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/1768).

The regulation requires all socket outlet units to comply with the requirements of BS 1363-2 Specification for 13A switched and unswitched socket-outlets and with the requirements of BS 5733 Specification for General requirements for electrical accessories. Sockets and socket outlets do not require independent approval under the regulations. Any plug fitted to the socket outlet unit must comply with the requirements of BS 1363-1 Specification for rewirable and non-rewirable 13A fused plugs. Plugs must also be independently approved and marked in accordance with the requirements of the regulation.

If a socket outlet unit contains additional control circuits or surge protection circuits they will fall within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC and must be CE marked. Socket outlet units with control circuits also fall within the scope of the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC.

== History ==
Outlet multipliers with the same purpose as power strips go back at least to the early 1920s. However, these were usually not in a long &quot;strip&quot; like in modern devices. Examples of power strips exist in the U.S. patent system dating back as far as 1929, starting with the creation of Carl M. Peterson&#x27;s &quot;Table Tap&quot;. Another early example was created by Allied Electric Products in 1950.

Perhaps the first modern designs for the power strip were created by the U.S. firm Fedtro, which filed two patents in 1970 for designs that were close to designs used in the modern day.

One early iteration, called a &quot;power board&quot;, was invented in 1972 by Australian electrical engineer Peter Talbot working under Frank Bannigan, managing director of Australian company Kambrook. The product was hugely successful, however, it was not patented and market share was eventually lost to other manufacturers.

<doc id="457970" wikidata="Q157160" url="?curid=457970" title="Podocarpaceae">
<text>Podocarpaceae is a large family of mainly Southern Hemisphere conifers, known in English as podocarps, comprising about 156 species of evergreen trees and shrubs. It contains 19 genera if &quot;Phyllocladus&quot; is included and &quot;Manoao&quot; and &quot;Sundacarpus&quot; are recognized. The family achieved its maximum diversity in the Cenozoic, making the Podocarpaceae family one of the most diverse in the southern hemisphere.

The family is a classic member of the Antarctic flora, with its main centres of diversity in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and to a slightly lesser extent Malesia and South America (primarily in the Andes Mountains). Several genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. &quot;Podocarpus&quot; reaches as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and &quot;Nageia&quot; into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread &quot;Podocarpus&quot; and the endemic &quot;Afrocarpus&quot;.

&quot;Parasitaxus usta&quot; is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, &quot;Falcatifolium taxoides&quot;.

The genus &quot;Phyllocladus&quot; is sister to the Podocarpaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. It is treated by some botanists in its own family, the Phyllocladaceae.

==Taxonomy==
The Podocarpaceae show great diversity, both morphologically and ecologically. Members occur mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, with most genetic variety taking place in New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Species diversity of &quot;Podocarpus&quot; is found mainly in South America and the Indonesian islands, the latter also being rich in &quot;Dacrydium&quot; and &quot;Dacrycarpus&quot; species.

&quot;Podocarpus&quot; (with 82 to 100 species) and &quot;Dacrydium&quot; (with 21 species) are the largest genera. A few genera are common to New Zealand and South America, supporting the view that podocarps had an extensive distribution over southern Gondwanaland. The breaking up of Gondwanaland led to large-scale speciation of the Podocarpaceae.

Until 1970, only seven Podocarpaceae genera were recognized: &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, &quot;Dacrydium&quot;, &quot;Phyllocladus&quot;, &quot;Acmopyle&quot;, &quot;Microcachrys&quot;, &quot;Saxegothaea&quot;, and &quot;Pherosphaera&quot;. All four of the African species fell under &quot;Podocarpus&quot; – &quot;P. falcatus&quot;, &quot;P. elongatus&quot;, &quot;P. henkelii&quot;, and &quot;P. latifolius&quot;. Taxonomists divided &quot;Podocarpus&quot; species into eight species groups based on leaf anatomy: &quot;Afrocarpus&quot; J.Buchholz &amp; N.E.Gray, &quot;Dacrycarpus&quot; Endl., &quot;Eupodocarpus&quot; Endl., &quot;Microcarpus&quot; Pilg., &quot;Nageia&quot; (Gaertn.) Endl., &quot;Polypodiopsis&quot; C.E.Bertrand (non &quot;Polypodiopsis&quot; Carriére nom. rej. prop. 6), &quot;Stachycarpus&quot; Endl. and &quot;Sundacarpus&quot; J.Buchholz and N.E.Gray.

Studies of embryology, gametophyte development, female cone structure, and cytology led to the belief that the eight categories probably deserved generic status. Researchers agreed on the need to recognize &quot;fairly natural groupings which prove to have good geographic and probably evolutionary cohesion&quot; and took the necessary steps to raise each section to generic status.

In 1990, a treatment of the Podocarpaceae recognized 17 genera, excluding &quot;Phyllocladus&quot; from the family, while recognizing &quot;Sundacarpus&quot;, but not &quot;Manoao&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Manoao&quot; was segregated from &quot;Lagarostrobus&quot;, based on morphological characteristics. In 2002, a molecular phylogenetic study showed &quot;Sundacarpus&quot; is embedded in &quot;Prumnopitys&quot; and the monophyly of &quot;Lagarostrobos&quot; is doubtful if &quot;Manoao&quot; is included within it. More recent treatments of the family have recognized &quot;Manoao&quot;, but not &quot;Sundacarpus&quot;.

== Evolution ==
Molecular evidence supports Podocarpaceae being the sister group to the Araucariaceae, and having diverged from it during the late Permian. While some fossils attributed to the family have been reported from the Late Permian and Triassic, like &quot;Rissikia&quot;, these cannot be unambiguously assigned to the family. The oldest unambiguous members of the family are known from the Jurassic period, found across both hemispheres, such as &quot;Scarburgia&quot; and &quot;Harrisiocarpus&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of England, as well as unnamed species from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Patagonia. Modern genera of the family first appeared during the Early Cretaceous, with the family probably reaching an apex of diversity during the early Cenozoic.

== Genera ==
Studies based on anatomical, biogeographical, morphological, and DNA evidence suggest these relationships:

<text>Phyllocladus, the celery pines, is a small genus of conifers, now usually placed in the family Podocarpaceae.&quot; &quot;Species occur mainly in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Malesia in the Southern Hemisphere, though &quot;P. hypophyllus &quot;ranges into the Philippines, a short way north of the equator.

==Characteristics==
They are small to medium-sized trees, reaching 10–30 m tall, or sometimes small shrubs. The main structural shoots are green for 2–3 years, then turn brown as the bark thickens. The leaves are sparse, tiny, scale-like, 2–3 mm long, and only green (photosynthetic) for a short time, soon turning brown. Most photosynthesis is performed by highly modified, leaf-like short shoots called phylloclades; these develop in the axils of the scale leaves, and are simple or compound (depending on species). Simple phylloclades are rhombic, 2–5 cm long, and compound phylloclades are up to 20 cm long and subdivided into five to 15 leaflet-like phylloclades 1–3 cm long. The seed cones are berry-like, similar to those of several other Podocarpaceae genera, notably &quot;Halocarpus&quot; and &quot;Prumnopitys&quot;, with a fleshy white aril; the seeds are dispersed by birds, which digest the soft, fleshy aril as they pass the hard seeds in their droppings.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Phyllocladus&quot; is sufficiently morphologically distinct from the other Podocarpaceae genera that some botanists have treated them separately in their own family, Phyllocladaceae. However, while at least one molecular phylogenetic analysis found &quot;Phyllocladus&quot; to be sister to &quot;Podocarpus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and another was equivocal on its position relative to Podocarpaceae s.s., two more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have placed &quot;Phyllocladus&quot; within Podocarpaceae as a sister taxon to &quot;Lepidothamnus&quot;. Morphological analysis supports this placement, and therefore it has been suggested that the distinctive phylloclades in the genus are a synapomorphy.

The five species are genetically distinct, and probably arose between 5 and 7 million years ago.

==Species==

* &quot;Phyllocladus alpinus&quot; (&quot;P. trichomanoides&quot; var. &quot;alpinus&quot;) - mountain toatoa (New Zealand)
* &quot;Phyllocladus aspleniifolius&quot; - celery-top pine (Tasmania)
* &quot;Phyllocladus hypophyllus&quot; - Malesian celery-pine (New Guinea to Borneo and Philippines)
* &quot;Phyllocladus toatoa&quot; - toatoa (New Zealand)
* &quot;Phyllocladus trichomanoides&quot; - tanekaha (New Zealand)

<text>Micropaleontology (American spelling; spelled micropalaeontology in European usage) is the branch of paleontology (palaeontology) that studies microfossils, or fossils that require the use of a microscope to see the organism, its morphology and its characteristic details.

== Microfossils ==

Microfossils are fossils that are generally between 0.001mm and 1 mm in size, the study of which requires the use of light or electron microscopy. Fossils which can be studied by the naked eye or low-powered magnification, such as a hand lens, are referred to as macrofossils.

For example, some colonial organisms, such as Bryozoa (especially the Cheilostomata) have relatively large colonies, but are classified by fine skeletal details of the small individuals of the colony.

In another example, many fossil genera of Foraminifera, which are protists are known from shells (called &quot;tests&quot;) that were as big as coins, such as the genus &quot;Nummulites&quot;.

Microfossils are a common feature of the geological record, from the Precambrian to the Holocene. They are most common in deposits of marine environments, but also occur in brackish water, fresh water and terrestrial sedimentary deposits. While every kingdom of life is represented in the microfossil record, the most abundant forms are protist skeletons or cysts from the Chrysophyta, Pyrrhophyta, Sarcodina, acritarchs and chitinozoans, together with pollen and spores from the vascular plants.

In 2017, fossilized microorganisms, or microfossils, were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting &quot;an almost instantaneous emergence of life&quot; (in a geological time-scale sense), after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. Nonetheless, life may have started even earlier, at nearly 4.5 billion years ago, as claimed by some researchers.
== Areas of study ==

Micropaleontology can be roughly divided into four areas of study on the basis of microfossil composition: (a) calcareous, as in coccoliths and foraminifera, (b) phosphatic, as in the study of some vertebrates, (c) siliceous, as in diatoms and radiolaria, or (d) organic, as in the pollen and spores studied in palynology.

This division reflects differences in the mineralogical and chemical composition of microfossil remains (and therefore in the methods of fossil recovery) rather than any strict taxonomic or ecological distinctions. Most researchers in this field, known as micropaleontologists, are typically specialists in one or more taxonomic groups.

=== Calcareous microfossils ===
Calcareous (CaCO3) microfossils include coccoliths, foraminifera, calcareous dinoflagellate cysts, and ostracods (seed shrimp).

=== Phosphatic microfossils ===
Phosphatic microfossils include conodonts (tiny oral structures of an extinct chordate group), some scolecodonts (&quot;worm&quot; jaws), shark spines and teeth, and other fish remains (collectively called &quot;ichthyoliths&quot;).

=== Siliceous microfossils ===
Siliceous microfossils include diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, phytoliths, some scolecodonts (&quot;worm&quot; jaws), and sponge spicules.

=== Organic microfossils ===
The study of organic microfossils is called palynology. Organic microfossils include pollen, spores, chitinozoans (thought to be the egg cases of marine invertebrates), scolecodonts (&quot;worm&quot; jaws), acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts, and fungal remains.

== Methods ==
Sediment or rock samples are collected from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted by a variety of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.

== Application of micropaleontology ==
Microfossils are specially noteworthy for their importance in biostratigraphy. Since microfossils are often extremely abundant, widespread, and quick to appear and disappear from the stratigraphic record, they constitute ideal index fossils from a biostratigraphic perspective. Also, the planktonic and nektonic habits of some microfossils give them the bonus of appearing across a wide range of facies or paleoenvironments, as well as having near-global distribution, making biostratigraphic correlation even more powerful and effective.

Microfossils, particularly from deep-sea sediments, also provide some of the most important records of global environmental change on long, medium or short timescales. Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20–50 million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past.

In addition to providing an excellent tool for sedimentary rock dating and for paleoenvironmental reconstruction – heavily used in both petroleum geology and paleoceanography – micropaleontology has also found a number of less orthodox applications, such as its growing role in forensic police investigation or in determining the provenance of archaeological artefacts.

Micropaleontology is also a tool of geoarchaeology used in the archaeological reconstruction of human habitation sites and environments. Changes in the microfossil population abundance in the stratigraphy of current and former water bodies reflect changes in environmental conditions. Naturally occurring ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. When correlated with other dating techniques, prehistoric environments can be reconstructed. Work on Lake Tanganyika provided a profile of human-induced environmental changes of a 4,000-year period.

Similar work in the arid American Southwest has provided information on irrigation canals used by prehistoric peoples from 2100 B.C. to 500 B.C. Other archaeological work in arid climates throughout the Americas has incorporated Micropaleontological analysis to build a more complete picture of prehistoric climate and human activity.

<text>Logan Botanic Garden is a botanical garden near Port Logan on the Rhins of Galloway, at the south-western tip of Scotland. It is operated as part of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh&#x27;s Living Collection. It has been described as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s most exotic garden.&quot;

The Garden adjoins the Logan Estate and Category A-listed House, which remain in private ownership.

==History==
The Botanic Garden was established in 1869 and was gifted to Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1969. The gardens were built around the ruins of Balzieland Castle.

A new glasshouse was built at Logan in 2014. The building was designed as a Victorian architecture conservatory. It is the first public glasshouse in the UK that is entirely heated by energy sources that are renewable/green. These include solar panels and air-source heat pumps that maintain a temperature of 18°C for the plant collection inside the glasshouse.

In July 2019, the Garden celebrated 50 years since becoming part of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

In February 2021, the garden was badly affected by severe flooding.

==Location==
The area has a mild climate, with mild winters, due to the influence of the North Atlantic Current and the Gulf Stream. The combination of this, acidic soils and the sheltered aspect of the gardens enables plants to be cultivated which would not normally survive outdoors in Scotland, with species from as far away as Chile, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand all thriving in Logan&#x27;s borders. Features of Logan include a sizeable Walled Garden complete with formal fish pond, an eco-Conservatory housing a variety of South African plants, Tasmanian Creek area, and Discovery Centre which houses various exhibitions throughout the seasons.

==Collections==
Logan Botanic Garden has some 2,500 species in total and 120 species that are threatened with extinction. The road approach to the garden is notable for its mature collection of Trachycarpus fortunei (Chusan Palms) that line the road as an avenue.

The garden is also home to Plant Heritage&#x27;s National Plant Collections of Gunnera, Griselinia and Leptospermum. It also has a significant collection of palm trees and tree ferns, most of which are typically found in sub-tropical gardens. These include Dicksonia antarctica and Cordyline australis dating to the 1870s.

The Garden has a collection of Wollemia, unusual in Europe, being conserved and grown from Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan.

The Garden is home to several Rhododendron species including the Rhododendron kanehirai which is extinct in the wild. The garden also has a collection of Rhododendrons of the subsection Maddenia which are able to grow outdoors in Scotland at Logan due to the relatively mild climate of the area.

The Garden has a Puya alpestris plant donated by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 2013. In July 2024, the flowers, which take up to ten years to form, bloomed over two weeks.

The Garden has a collection of plants from Vietnam and has also been actively involved in botanical missions to the country, collecting research data and seeds.

<doc id="457988" wikidata="Q1805119" url="?curid=457988" title="Wight">
<text>A wight is a being or thing. This general meaning is shared by cognate terms in Germanic languages, however the usage of the term varies greatly over time and between regions. In Old English, it could refer to anything in existence, with more specific usages arising in Middle English, perhaps due to the term of similar meaning in Anglo-Norman, . The term is widely used in modern fantasy, often to mean specifically a being which is undead.

==Etymology==
Modern English &quot;wight&quot; is descended from or , from , from Proto-West Germanic &#x27;*wihti&#x27; from from Proto-Indo-European: &#x27;*wekti&#x27; (&quot;cause, sake, thing&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*wekʷ-&quot; (&quot;to say, tell&quot;). &quot;Wight&quot; is further cognate with , , , and , the ancestor of , and . A dialect form in Swedish is , which, similar to the other form, is descended from Old Swedish: &quot;vætter&quot;.

==Medieval period==
===Old English===

In Old English, has been variously translated as &quot;wight&quot;, &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;being&quot;. The term is found in the compound words (&quot;all beings&quot;) and (&quot;aught&quot;, &quot;anything&quot;). is often used as the subject of riddles, such as riddle 86 from the Exeter Book, in which it has been interpreted as referring to a person selling vegetables, likely garlics. The term is also used to refer to beings such as the dwarf which is the focus of the XCIIIB charm, and the eoten Grendel and the dragon in Beowulf.

The word began to acquire the sense of supernatural or unearthly beings, included in the 8th century Lindisfarne Gospels.

===Middle English===
====Connotations and scope====
When was borrowed from Anglo-Norman around 1300 CE, it was possibly wholly synonymous with , however over time the words became differentiated by speakers. The exact usage of the term varies between works but it broadly is used in one of five loose categories that blur between themselves:
* a &quot;living creature&quot;, an element of the earthly world
* a generic being, with few connotations
* an enemy or social inferior that is seen as other
* as beloved, often gendered 
* a being connected to the spiritual realm, either good or bad

The term is used to refer to a range of positive beings with supernatural aspects such as saints, Jesus, and his mother, Mary. It has been argued that the term could be used for anything other than God the Father, as he himself was not created in Christian theology. It has been noted, however, that it is stated in the Man of Law that Daniel in the lion&#x27;s den was saved by &quot;No wight but God&quot;, showing it was possible to use the term to refer to a class of beings that includes both man and the Christian god. Though there are no extant texts in Middle English that refer to God the Father directly as a .

The most common use of the term, however, is to refer to everyday corporeal beings as these are much more represented in normal conversation. is commonly found with adjectives, such as , , or . The phrase &quot;&quot; is notable, occurring frequently and often in gendered and romantic contexts.

====Examples====

* Geoffrey Chaucer
: &quot;&quot;, (1387–1400), line 4236:
:: &quot;For [Aleyn] had swonken al the longe nyght, 
:: And seyde, &#x27;Fare weel, Malyne, sweete wight!&#x27;&quot;
: &quot;&quot;, (1387–1400), line 380:
:: &quot;She kept her maidenhood from every wight
:: To no man deigned she for to be bond.&quot;
:&quot;&quot;, (1387–1400), line 579:
:: &quot;Worste of alle wightes.&quot;
: &quot;&quot;, (1387–1400), line 72–73:
:: &quot;Ne neuere yet no vileynye he sayde
:: In al his lyf vnto no manere wight.
:: He was a verray parfit gentil knyght.&quot;
: &quot;&quot;, (1379–1380), line 1830–1831:
:: &quot;We ben shrewes, every wight,
:: And han delyt in wikkednes.&quot;
===Old Norse===
As with &quot;wight&quot;, () means a being, especially a supernatural being. It occurs in compound nouns such as (&quot;evil wight&quot;), (&quot;guardian spirit of a country&quot;), (&quot;witch wight&quot; or &quot;sorceress&quot;) and (&quot;helping sprite&quot;).

==Modern period==
===Modern English===
====Modern Fantasy====
Wights feature in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s world of Middle-earth, especially in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and in George R. R. Martin&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; and HBO television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Since its 1974 inclusion in the RPG &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D), it has become a recurring form of undead in other fantasy games and mods, such as &quot;&quot;. and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

====Examples of usage====

* Edmund Spenser, &quot;&quot;, (1590–1596), I.i.6.8–9:
*: &quot;That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,
*: And this fair couple eke to shroud themselues were fain.&quot;
* William Shakespeare, &quot;&quot;, (c. 1602), Act I, Sc. III:
*: &quot;O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?&quot;
* William Shakespeare, &quot;&quot;, (c. 1603), Act II, Sc. I:
*: &quot;She was a wight, if ever such wight were&quot;
* John Milton, &quot;&quot;, (1626), verse vi:
*: &quot;Oh say me true if thou wert mortal wight...&quot;
* Church of Scotland, &quot;Scots Metrical Psalter&quot;, (1650), Psalm 18 verse xxvi:
*: &quot;froward thou kythst unto the froward wight...&quot;
*William Wordsworth, &quot;To the Daisy&quot; (1802) line 28:
*: Whole Summer-fields are thine by right;
*: And Autumn, melancholy wight!
*: Doth in thy crimson head delight
*: When rains are on thee.
* John Keats, &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Merci&quot;, (1820):
*: Ah what can ail thee, wretched wight,
*: Alone and palely loitering;
* Washington Irving, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1820):
*: &quot;In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, &quot;tarried,&quot; in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity.&quot;
* George Gordon, Lord Byron (1812–1816), &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage &quot;Canto 1, verse :
*: Ah, me! in sooth he was a shamles wight ...&quot;.
* Edwin Greenslade Murphy, &quot;Wot Won the Larst?&quot;, in &quot;Dryblower’s Verses&quot;, (1926):
*: From weedy little wights whose cigarettes 
*: Recall a badly-disinfected drain
* W.S. Gilbert, &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, (1883), a song sung by the character King Gama: 
*: &quot;Now when a wight sits up all night, ill natured jokes devising,&lt;br&gt;and all his wiles are met with smiles, it&#x27;s hard, there&#x27;s no disguising!&quot;
===German===
A similar change of meaning can be seen in the German cognate &quot;Wicht&quot;, meaning a living human being, generally rather small, poor or miserable man (not woman). The word is somewhat old-fashioned in today&#x27;s language, but it is still used and readily recognized in everyday speech.

The diminutive &quot;Wichtel&quot; refers to beings in folklore and fantasy, generally small, and often helpful, dwelling in or near human settlements, secretly doing work and helping the humans, somewhat similar to the more specific &quot;Heinzelmännchen. Wichtel&quot; in this sense is recorded since the Middle Ages. Today, &quot;Wichtel&quot; is more often used than &quot;Wicht&quot;.

===Dutch===
The word &quot;wicht&quot; can be used to refer, to any woman, often with negative connotations. It is not used to refer to men.

&quot;Booswicht&quot; (literally evil-being) matching &#x27;villain&#x27;, can be used to describe both men and women.

===North Germanic languages===
In Danish, the term and the Norwegian cognate typically refer to supernatural beings from folklore or a lesser god, especially those that live underground or near the home, such as dwarfs and nisser. In Swedish, similarly typically refers to supernatural beings, often those that are small and resembling humans.

<text>Paleoecology (also spelled palaeoecology) is the study of interactions between organisms and/or interactions between organisms and their environments across geologic timescales. As a discipline, paleoecology interacts with, depends on and informs a variety of fields including paleontology, ecology, climatology and biology.

Paleoecology emerged from the field of paleontology in the 1950s, though paleontologists have conducted paleoecological studies since the creation of paleontology in the 1700s and 1800s. Combining the investigative approach of searching for fossils with the theoretical approach of Charles Darwin and Alexander von Humboldt, paleoecology began as paleontologists began examining both the ancient organisms they discovered and the reconstructed environments in which they lived. Visual depictions of past marine and terrestrial communities have been considered an early form of paleoecology. The term &quot;paleo-ecology&quot; was coined by Frederic Clements in 1916.

== Overview of paleoecological approaches ==

* Classic paleoecology uses data from fossils and subfossils to reconstruct the ecosystems of the past. It involves the study of fossil organisms and their associated remains (such as shells, teeth, pollen, and seeds), which can help in the interpretation of their life cycle, living interactions, natural environment, communities, and manner of death and burial. Such interpretations aid the reconstruction of past environments (i.e., paleoenvironments). Paleoecologists have studied the fossil record to try to clarify the relationship animals have to their environment, in part to help understand the current state of biodiversity. They have identified close links between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity, that is, between the diversity of animals and the niches they occupy. Classical paleoecology is a primarily reductionist approach: scientists conduct detailed analysis of relatively small groups of organisms within shorter geologic timeframes.
* Evolutionary paleoecology uses data from fossils and other evidence to examine how organisms and their environments change throughout time. Evolutionary paleoecologists take the holistic approach of looking at both organism and environmental change, accounting for physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere across time. By studying patterns of evolution and extinction in the context of environmental change, evolutionary paleoecologists are able to examine concepts of vulnerability and resilience in species and environments.
* Community paleoecology uses statistical analysis to examine the composition and distribution of groups of plants or animals. By quantifying how plants or animals are associated, community paleoecologists are able to investigate the structures of ancient communities of organisms. Advances in technology have helped propel the field, through the use of physical models and computer-based analysis.

== Major principles ==
While the functions and relationships of fossil organisms may not be observed directly (as in ecology), scientists can describe and analyze both individuals and communities over time. To do so, paleoecologists make the following assumptions:

*All organisms are adapted and restricted to a particular environment, and are usually adapted to a particular lifestyle.
*Essentially all organisms depend on another organism, whether directly or indirectly.
*The fossil or physical records are inherently incomplete - the geologic record is selective and some environments are more likely to be preserved than others. Taphonomy, affecting the over- and underrepresentation of fossils, is an extremely important consideration in interpreting fossil assemblages.
*Uniformitarianism is the concept that processes that took place in the geologic past are the same as the ones that are observed taking place today. In paleoecology, uniformitarianism is used as a methodology: paleoecologists make inferences about ancient organisms and environments based on analogies they find in the present.

==Paleoecological methods==

The aim of paleoecology is to build the most detailed model possible of the life environment of previously living organisms found today as fossils. The process of reconstructing past environments requires the use of &quot;archives&quot; (e.g., sediment sequences), &quot;proxies&quot; (e.g., the micro or mega-fossils and other sediment characteristics that provide the evidence of the biota and the physical environment), and &quot;chronology&quot; (e.g., obtaining absolute (or relative) dating of events in the archive). Such reconstruction takes into consideration complex interactions among environmental factors such as temperatures, food supplies, and degree of solar illumination. Often much of this information is lost or distorted by the fossilization process or diagenesis of the enclosing sediments, making interpretation difficult.

Some other proxies for reconstructing past environments include charcoal and pollen, which synthesize fire and vegetation data, respectively. Both of these alternates can be found in lakes and peat settings, and can provide moderate to high resolution information. These are well studied methods often utilized in the paleoecological field. 
The environmental complexity factor is normally tackled through statistical analysis of the available numerical data (quantitative paleontology or paleostatistics), while the study of post-mortem processes is known as the field of taphonomy.

==Quaternary==
Because the Quaternary period is well represented in geographically extensive and high temporal-resolution records, many hypotheses arising from ecological studies of modern environments can be tested at the millennial scale using paleoecological data. In addition, such studies provide historical (pre-industrialization) baselines of species composition and disturbance regimes for ecosystem restoration, or provide examples for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem change through periods of large climate changes. Paleoecological studies are used to inform conservation, management and restoration efforts. In particular, fire-focused paleoecology is an informative field of study to land managers seeking to restore ecosystem fire regimes.
