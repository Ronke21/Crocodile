<text>David Wilshire (16 September 1943 – 31 October 2023) was a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Spelthorne in Surrey from 1987 to 2010. Wilshire was considered to be to the right of the party&#x27;s mainstream.

Wilshire introduced Section 28 legislation in 1988. In 2009 he was implicated in the parliamentary expenses scandal.

== Outside Parliament ==
Wilshire was educated at Kingswood School, Bath, and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he received an MA in Geography in 1965. He was a councillor on Wansdyke District Council from 1976 to 1987 and served as leader from 1981 to 1987. He was elected as councillor on Avon County Council from 1977 to 1981. He also worked for Conservative MEPs from 1979 to 1985.

As well as building up his own group of small businesses and working as a personnel officer and a schoolteacher, he was a partner with Western Political Research Services (1979–2000), the co-director of Political Management Programme, Brunel University (1985–1990), and became a partner of Moorlands Research Service in 2000.

Wilshire was separated with one son. In 1982 his daughter died, aged 12, after choking at school. His main home was in Somerset, where he lived with his partner Ann Palmer.

== Parliamentary career ==
=== Section 28 and sexual orientation issues ===
Shortly after being elected as an MP in 1987, Wilshire saw a copy of the book &quot;Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin&quot;, about two gay men and their daughter, a copy of which was stocked in an Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) teachers&#x27; resource centre. Wilshire said of it: &quot;[The book] portrays a child living with two men... [and] clearly shows that as an acceptable family relationship.&quot; As a result, with the support of Jill Knight, Wilshire introduced Section 28 as an amendment to the Local Government Bill at the committee stage. The amendment made it illegal for local authorities to &quot;promote homosexuality or ... promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality&quot;.

Section 28 became a major political issue. In April 1988, a national demonstration of more than 30,000 was held in London. &quot;Stop the Clause&quot; groups sprang up in most cities, which organised local protests to complement national action. One evening, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; headlines were disrupted by shouts of &quot;Stop Clause 28!&quot; and when the clause was debated in the Lords, protesting lesbians abseiled from the public gallery down to the floor of the House. The actor Ian McKellen described Wilshire and Knight as the &quot;ugly sisters&quot; of a political pantomime. In 2003, in a rare public speech about his role in Section 28, Wilshire stated: &quot;Little did I realise what I was unleashing... I got a fair amount of hate mail and a fair amount of publicity, most of it unflattering.&quot; He claimed that the bill had always been about misuse of taxpayers&#x27; money, and not bigotry.

The ban was eventually reversed by Parliament in 2003. Wilshire was one of 76 MPs to vote against the repeal.

In 2000 Wilshire voted to prohibit teachers from introducing steps to prevent bullying on the grounds of homosexuality in a later Local Government Bill. Wilshire voted against homosexual couples being allowed to adopt children in 2002, against the Civil Partnership Bill of 2004, which granted a legal relationship for same-sex couples, and against Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) in 2007, which outlawed discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education and public functions on the grounds of sexual orientation. In each case Wilshire&#x27;s vote was in the minority.

=== Political views ===
Wilshire voted against bans on hunting and smoking, and voted both for and against the Iraq War.

Wilshire opposed the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and was one of the first Conservative MPs to declare that he would never support UK entry into a single European currency.

In 1995 Wilshire protested to the then prime minister, John Major, about the government&#x27;s proposals to allow people from Hong Kong to live in the UK. He received criticism for stating: &quot;It&#x27;s not acceptable to the British people to let in one more... this country is full up.&quot;

Wilshire voted against the introduction of the National Minimum Wage in 1999 by opposing the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. In 2009 he became one of 11 MPs
to back the Employment Opportunities Bill, which aimed to abolish the minimum wage, but was defeated in Parliament.

Wilshire opposed the idea that MPs should not have second jobs and stated that &quot;state employed parliamentarians&quot; would be something that &quot;Stalin would applaud&quot;. He combined being an MP with being the partner of Moorlands Research Service for eight years and from 1987 to 1990 combined being an MP with two other jobs. He was one of 21 Conservative MPs to vote in favour of keeping the additional costs allowance for MPs&#x27; second homes, despite the Conservative Party leader David Cameron&#x27;s calls for it to be reformed.

Wilshire went against the official Conservative Party line and supported the construction of a third runway at Heathrow Airport, which, although it lies just outside the Spelthorne constituency, nevertheless provides employment for a considerable number of people locally. Wilshire described those that opposed the expansion as the &quot;anti-brigade&quot;, which included David Cameron, whom he accused of peddling a &quot;lie&quot; that transit passengers at Heathrow spent almost nothing.

=== Expenses scandal ===
In 2009, Wilshire was among a number of MPs exposed in the expenses scandal, and faced considerable hostility from his constituents.

Wilshire was originally questioned by his local newspaper, the &quot;Staines Informer&quot;, about why he had claimed the maximum allowance for a second home in London when his constituency home was in a commuter belt. During the interview he stated: &quot;In 22 years of living in London, I have always furnished the flat out of my own pocket.&quot; However, four days later &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed that Wilshire had an unusual arrangement whereby he claimed thousands of pounds of taxpayers&#x27; money for monthly payments towards the cost of interior decoration for his London flat, even though he did not have to provide any receipts for the work. Wilshire was questioned about this by his local newspaper again, in which he said he was &quot;embarrassed, sad and sorry&quot;, but he revealed that he had not spent the money allocated to him for decoration on this yet, but would do in the future, and therefore he refused to pay the money back or resign.

It later emerged that Wilshire had spent over £1,000 of taxpayers&#x27; money on furniture in 2004, which contradicted his previous claims. When challenged on this, he refused to give an interview but sent an email to the local press in which he stated that: &quot;I obtained the cheapest self-assembly replacement available from MFI.&quot; However, even this email caused him more problems, as in it he stated that he had bought the flat in 1983four years before he had become an MP and four years before when he previously revealed he had bought it. He later wrote a letter to the paper stating that he did buy the flat in 1987 and that the paper&#x27;s journalists had been forgetful about facts he had told them, and had confused &quot;furnishing a property with repairing it&quot;. The newspaper replied that it stood by what it had reported. When local demands grew for Wilshire to meet his constituents over the claims, Wilshire expressed that he would only meet them one-to-one, and would not hold a public meeting.

As a result, the Conservative Anti-Corruption Group was formed, which aimed to oust Wilshire at the 2010 general election. One of its members included a former Conservative councillor and canvassing partner of Wilshire. Shortly afterwards, at a Spelthorne Conservative Association meeting, six members of the Conservative Party announced they were prepared to stand against him at the 2010 general election.

Following further investigation by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, on 14 October 2009, Wilshire asked the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner to investigate his office expenses. Wilshire admitted using parliamentary expenses to pay £105,000 over three years to Moorlands Research Services, a company he set up and owned with his partner Ann Palmer to run his office, but insisted it was approved by the authorities. Parliamentary expenses rules forbid MPs from entering into arrangements which &quot;may give rise to an accusation&quot; of profiting from public funds. Wilshire told the BBC that he had referred himself to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner as the only way to answer the questions about his expenses, and that the company had never made a profit and had been wound up. Moorlands Research Services was never registered with Companies House, and never filed public accounts. The following day, Wilshire announced that he would stand down as an MP, saying that he was reluctant to do this, but accepted it was the &quot;sensible&quot; thing to do. On 2 November 2009, when the Parliamentary Standards Commission ended its probe into him without producing any results, Wilshire apologised for equating his treatment over expenses to the Holocaust.

=== 2010 visit to Georgian separatist outpost ===
On 20 April 2010, as Co-rapporteur of the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) he held a meeting with a member of the Georgian separatist government of South Ossetia in the self-proclaimed Embassy of the Republic of South Ossetia in Moscow. The Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that: 

=== Other activities ===
In 2000 Wilshire threatened to sue a Labour Party member for defamation who had written in the &quot;Heathrow Villager&quot; that Wilshire was scaremongering and misleading the public about the only hospital remaining in his seat. Wilshire received criticism as the author of the piece was a cancer-suffering pensioner who was being treated at the hospital. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which had previously been compared to the Third Reich by Wilshire, described him as &quot;Britain&#x27;s stupidest MP&quot; as a result.

Wilshire was among opponents to the proposal that Princess Diana speak to MPs about outlawing landmines in 1997, following an invitation from the newly elected Labour government. She ultimately decided not to speak, following the opposition.

In 2008 he was the subject of a parliamentary enquiry after it was claimed that he raised thousands of pounds for his local party by hosting constituents on visits to the House of Commons. The enquiry cleared him of any wrongdoing.

Wilshire joined Margaret Thatcher in calling for the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to be released, when he was under house arrest in London in 1998.

In 2003 he pushed successfully to have Council of Europe officials look into the UK to assess whether it is necessary to officially monitor the UK&#x27;s voting procedures. He said the then government had failed to put its &quot;house in order&quot; to prevent fraudulent voting and accused the government of &quot;systematically ignoring&quot; pleas from the Electoral Commission. &quot;If the British government won&#x27;t put its own house in order, you mustn&#x27;t be surprised if there are some of us who will try to find someone else who will make them put their house in order,&quot; he told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;World at One&quot; programme. He also opposed the introduction of identity cards and called for the &quot;removal of innocent children&quot; from the United Kingdom National DNA Database.

Wilshire was parliamentary private secretary to Alan Clark in 1991, the PPS to Peter Lloyd from 1992 to 1994, and was a Conservative whip in the House of Commons from 2001 to 2005. He was a member of the Northern Ireland Select Committee (1994–1997), a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee (1997–2000) and became a member of the Transport Select Committee and of the Chairman&#x27;s Panel in 2005. He was also elected on to the executive of the Conservatives&#x27; 1922 Committee in 2005.

== Death ==
Wilshire died in Somerset, on 31 October 2023, aged 80.

<doc id="449360" wikidata="Q767696" url="?curid=449360" title="Bill Rammell">
<text>William Ernest Rammell (born 10 October 1959) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Harlow from 1997 until 2010, and served as a Minister of State in several departments from 2002. From August 2012 to December 2019 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire. He was chair of the university consortium MillionPlus from June to December 2019. In August 2021 he became president of the University of Kurdistan Hewler in Iraqi Kurdistan.

==Political career==
Rammell joined Tony Blair&#x27;s government in October 2002 as an assistant whip but was promoted two weeks later to be a spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Rammell, a pro-European, was supportive of joining the Euro, and until 2002 he was Chair of Labour Movement for Europe. In September 2004, he was the first British government minister to visit North Korea.

In the 2005 general election, Rammell held his seat with the third smallest majority of any Labour MP, at just 97 votes. The result was not declared until two days after voting, following four recounts.

In May 2005, Rammell was made Minister of State for Higher Education. He was strongly supportive of top-up fees, arguing in 2005 that without such fees it would be necessary to put &quot;3p or 4p on the standard rate of tax&quot;. In September 2007, he withdrew funding from some courses teaching English as a second or foreign language.

In February 2008, Rammell announced plans to create a national database of children&#x27;s school records and exam results which would make up a publicly owned CV. The CV and &quot;Learner Number&quot; would stay with the child throughout adult life until retirement and only the British government would be able to remove records from their database entry. The plan would only have applied to English children, with education being a devolved matter.

In October 2008, Rammell returned to the Foreign Office as Minister of State, and in June 2009, was moved again to the Ministry of Defence as Minister of State for the Armed Forces. He defended the Brown government&#x27;s levels of spending on equipment in Afghanistan, following a soldier&#x27;s death because of a lack of available helicopters.

In September 2009, Rammell confirmed he had told Libya that the Prime Minister did not want to see convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who had been serving a life sentence, die in prison.

In October 2009, following Sir Thomas Legg&#x27;s audit, Rammell was ordered to repay £2,782 of wrongful expenses claims.

In the 2010 general election, Rammell was defeated in Harlow by Conservative candidate Robert Halfon, who gained the seat with a majority of 4,925 votes.

In August 2012, Rammell was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire. He held the position until 2019. He had previously worked for Plymouth University as Deputy Vice-Chancellor with responsibility for student experience and internationalisation.

<text>A book cipher is a cipher in which each word or letter in the plaintext of a message is replaced by some code that locates it in another text, the key.

A simple version of such a cipher would use a specific book as the key, and would replace each word of the plaintext by a number that gives the position where that word occurs in that book. For example, if the chosen key is H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, the plaintext &quot;&quot;all plans failed, coming back tomorrow&quot; could be encoded as &quot;335 219 881, 5600 853 9315&quot; — since the 335th word of the novel is &quot;all&quot;, the 219th is &quot;plans&quot;&quot;, etc. This method requires that the sender and receiver use exactly the same edition of the key book.

This simple version fails if the message uses a word that does not appear in the text. A variant that avoids this problem works with individual letters rather than words. Namely each letter of the plaintext message would be replaced by a number that specifies where that letter occurs in the key book. For example, using the same &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; book as the key, the message &quot;no ammo&quot; could be encoded as &quot;12 10 / 50 31 59 34&quot; since the words with those positions in the novel are &quot;nineteenth&quot;&quot;, &quot;of&quot;&quot;, &quot;almost&quot;&quot;, &quot;mortal&quot;&quot;, &quot;might&quot;&quot;, and &quot;own&quot;&quot;. This method was used in the second Beale cipher. This variant is more properly called a substitution cipher, specifically a homophonic one.

Both methods, as described, are quite laborious. Therefore, in practice, the key has usually been a codebook created for the purpose: a simple dictionary-like listing of all the words that might be needed to form a message, each with the respective code number(s). This version is called a code, and was extensively used from the 15th century up to World War II.

== Choosing the key ==
The main strength of a book cipher is the key. The sender and receiver of encoded messages can agree to use any book or other publication available to both of them as the key to their cipher. Someone intercepting the message and attempting to decode it, unless they are a skilled cryptographer (see Security below), must somehow identify the key from a huge number of possibilities available.
In the context of espionage, a book cipher has a considerable advantage for a spy in enemy territory. A conventional codebook, if discovered by the local authorities, instantly incriminates the holder as a spy and gives the authorities the chance of deciphering the code and sending false messages impersonating the agent. On the other hand, a book, if chosen carefully to fit with the spy&#x27;s cover story, would seem entirely innocuous.
The drawback to a book cipher is that both parties have to possess an identical copy of the key. The book must not be of the sort that would look out of place in the possession of those using it, and it must be of a type likely to contain any words required. Thus, a spy wishing to send information about troop movements and numbers of armaments would be unlikely to find a cookbook or romance novel useful keys.

== Using widely available publications ==

=== Dictionary ===
Another approach is to use a dictionary as the codebook. This guarantees that nearly all words will be found, and also makes it much easier to find a word when encoding. This approach was used by George Scovell for the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s army in some campaigns of the Peninsular War. In Scovell&#x27;s method, a codeword would consist of a number (indicating the page of the dictionary), a letter (indicating the column on the page), and finally a number indicating which entry of the column was meant. However, this approach also has a disadvantage: because entries are arranged in alphabetical order, so are the code numbers. This can give strong hints to the cryptanalyst unless the message is superenciphered. The wide distribution and availability of dictionaries also present a problem; it is likely that anyone trying to break such a code is also in possession of the dictionary which can be used to read the message.

=== Bible cipher ===
The Bible is a widely available book that is almost always printed with chapter and verse markings making it easy to find a specific string of text within it, making it particularly useful for this purpose; the widespread availability of concordances can ease the encoding process as well.

== Security ==
Essentially, the code version of a &quot;book cipher&quot; is just like any other code, but one in which the trouble of preparing and distributing the codebook has been eliminated by using an existing text. However this means, as well as being attacked by all the usual means employed against other codes or ciphers, partial solutions may help the cryptanalyst to guess other codewords, or even to break the code completely by identifying the key text. This is, however, not the only way a book cipher may be broken. It is still susceptible to other methods of cryptanalysis, and as such is quite easily broken, even without sophisticated means, without the cryptanalyst having any idea to what book the cipher is keyed.

== Examples ==
* A famous use of a book cipher is in the Beale ciphers, of which Document No. 2 uses (a variant printing of) the United States Declaration of Independence as the key text.
* In the American Revolution, Benedict Arnold used a book cipher, sometimes known as the Arnold Cipher, which used Sir William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; as a key text.
* Book ciphers have consistently been used throughout the Cicada 3301 mystery.

=== In fiction ===

* In &quot;Colony&quot;, a television series, the resistance movement uses a book cipher to communicate between members of the cells.
* In the novel &quot;Monsieur Lecoq&quot;, published in 1868, Monsieur Lecoq finds that a prisoner is communicating with his confederate using a double book cipher. Since the prisoner has only one book, &quot;The songs of Béranger&quot;, the solution is easily discovered.
* In &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, Sherlock Holmes decrypts a message enciphered with a book cipher by deducing which book had been used as a key text.
* The name of Ken Follett&#x27;s World War II thriller &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; refers to a German spy in Cairo using Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; as the basis of a code.
* In &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot;, Lord Peter Wimsey, on assignment for British Intelligence in World War II Nazi-occupied Europe, uses a code based on the works of John Donne. The Germans break the code, coming near to catching Wimsey and Bunter. Wimsey then improvises a new code, based on an unpublished text known only to himself and his wife.
* Graham Greene&#x27;s protagonists often use book codes. In &quot;The Human Factor&quot;, several books are used, and an edition of Charles Lamb&#x27;s &quot;Tales from Shakespeare&quot; is used in &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot;.
* A book cipher plays an important role in the TV version of &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Sword&quot;. The key text is Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;.
* In the 2004 film &quot;National Treasure&quot;, a book cipher (called an &quot;Ottendorf cipher&quot;) is discovered on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, using the &quot;Silence Dogood&quot; letters as the key text.
* The protagonists of the Matthew Reilly novel &quot;The Six Sacred Stones&quot; used a book cipher to send confidential messages to each other. The key text was the Harry Potter books, but the messages were sent &quot;via&quot; a &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; forum to make the key text harder to identify.
* In &quot;Lost: Mystery of the Island&quot;, a series of four jigsaw puzzles released in 2007, a book cipher was used on each puzzle&#x27;s box to hide spoilers and reveal information about the show to the fans.
* &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, a two-part episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, features a book cipher brought to the Behavioral Analysis Unit by the UNSUB via Agent Hotchner&#x27;s wife. The cypher was part of a larger puzzle to find a girl who had been missing for two years. The key text was &quot;The Collector&quot; by John Fowles.
* &quot;Burn Notice&quot; (episodes &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke&quot; and &quot;Center of the Storm&quot;, 2010): Michael Westen steals a Bible from a safe deposit box that is the code book of Simon. This becomes part of the season plot to track an organization starting wars for profit as Michael tries to arrange an interview with Simon.
*In the episode &quot;The Blind Banker&quot; of the BBC series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, Sherlock Holmes searches for a book that is the key to a cipher being used by Chinese Tong smugglers to communicate with their agents and with each other through graffiti messages. He eventually finds it: the London A-Z.
* In the film &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011), Prof. Bressler&#x27;s passwords are obscured by a book cipher.
* In &quot;The Unit&quot; episode &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Jonas Blane (a.k.a. Snake Doctor) uses a book code from the poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; to communicate to his wife, Molly, that he has arrived safely in Panama.
* In &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; by Jaroslav Hašek, the officers in Švejk&#x27;s battalion attempt to use a book cipher. Their attempts are undone, however, when it is revealed that the novel in question is composed of two volumes, and Švejk has delivered the first volume to the officers, thinking that they intended to read the novel, rather than the second, which is used for the cipher. Furthermore, the key to the cipher is identical to an example given in a published military textbook.
* In &quot;An Instance of the Fingerpost&quot;, a historical mystery by Iain Pears, a book cipher conceals one character&#x27;s family history and its relationship with the English Civil War.
* In John Le Carre&#x27;s &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot;, the protagonist Magnus Pym uses a book cipher based on the German text Simplicissimus.
* In the book &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, Hannibal Lecter uses a book code to encrypt a message to the Tooth Fairy killer, with the message containing the home address of Will Graham, who is investigating the case, and the message, &quot;Save yourself. Kill them all&quot;, with the intent of having Will and his family fall victim to the killer. In the 1986 film adaptation Manhunter, the book used is mentioned to be a list of statues in the state of Maryland. In the 2002 adaptation Red Dragon, the book is changed to the French cooking encyclopedia Larousse Gastronomique to fit in with that movie&#x27;s depiction of Lecter.
* In &quot;The Darwin Code&quot; by J D Welch, Jess uses a Shakespearean speech to construct a book cipher to communicate with an enemy who may or may not be an ally.
*In Bitterblue by Kristin Cashore, Bitterblue uses a book(?) code to unlock secrets of her father&#x27;s reign as king.
*In the TV series &quot;Deutschland 83&quot;, protagonist Martin Rauch&#x27;s East German handlers use a book cipher to communicate with him while he is undercover in West Germany.
*In the series 2 finale of the BBC TV show &quot;Luther&quot;, two brothers use a book cipher. Luther determines they must be using a book that is readily available in case the book is lost and/or so the users can always have it to hand. This leads him to discovering the book cipher is using Gideon&#x27;s Bible.

<doc id="449364" wikidata="Q557781" url="?curid=449364" title="Horseshoe map">
<text>In the mathematics of chaos theory, a horseshoe map is any member of a class of chaotic maps of the square into itself. It is a core example in the study of dynamical systems. The map was introduced by Stephen Smale while studying the behavior of the orbits of the van der Pol oscillator. The action of the map is defined geometrically by squishing the square, then stretching the result into a long strip, and finally folding the strip into the shape of a horseshoe.

Most points eventually leave the square under the action of the map. They go to the side caps where they will, under iteration, converge to a fixed point in one of the caps. The points that remain in the square under repeated iteration form a fractal set and are part of the invariant set of the map.

The squishing, stretching and folding of the horseshoe map are typical of chaotic systems, but not necessary or even sufficient.

In the horseshoe map, the squeezing and stretching are uniform. They compensate each other so that the area of the square does not change. The folding is done neatly, so that the orbits that remain forever in the square can be simply described.

For a horseshoe map: 
* there are an infinite number of periodic orbits;
* periodic orbits of arbitrarily long period exist;
* the number of periodic orbits grows exponentially with the period; and
* close to any point of the fractal invariant set there is a point of a periodic orbit.
== The horseshoe map ==
The horseshoe map is a diffeomorphism defined from a region of the plane into itself. The region is a square capped by two semi-disks. The codomain of formula_1 (the &quot;horseshoe&quot;) is a proper subset of its domain formula_2. The action of is defined through the composition of three geometrically defined transformations. First the square is contracted along the vertical direction by a factor . The caps are contracted so as to remain semi-disks attached to the resulting rectangle. Contracting by a factor smaller than one half assures that there will be a gap between the branches of the horseshoe. Next the rectangle is stretched horizontally by a factor of ; the caps remain unchanged. Finally the resulting strip is folded into a horseshoe-shape and placed back into .

The interesting part of the dynamics is the image of the square into itself. Once that part is defined, the map can be extended to a diffeomorphism by defining its action on the caps. The caps are made to contract and eventually map inside one of the caps (the left one in the figure). The extension of &quot;f&quot; to the caps adds a fixed point to the non-wandering set of the map. To keep the class of horseshoe maps simple, the curved region of the horseshoe should not map back into the square.

The horseshoe map is one-to-one, which means that an inverse &quot;f−1&quot; exists when restricted to the image of under .

By folding the contracted and stretched square in different ways, other types of horseshoe maps are possible.
To ensure that the map remains one-to-one, the contracted square must not overlap itself. When the action on the square is extended to a diffeomorphism, the extension cannot always be done in the plane. For example, the map on the right needs to be extended to a diffeomorphism of the sphere by using a “cap” that wraps around the equator.

The horseshoe map is an Axiom A diffeomorphism that serves as a model for the general behavior at a transverse homoclinic point, where the stable and unstable manifolds of a periodic point intersect.

==Dynamics of the map==
The horseshoe map was designed to reproduce the chaotic dynamics of a flow in the neighborhood of a given periodic orbit. The neighborhood is chosen to be a small disk perpendicular to the orbit. As the system evolves, points in this disk remain close to the given periodic orbit, tracing out orbits that eventually intersect the disk once again. Other orbits diverge.

The behavior of all the orbits in the disk can be determined by considering what happens to the disk. The intersection of the disk with the given periodic orbit comes back to itself every period of the orbit and so do points in its neighborhood. When this neighborhood returns, its shape is transformed. Among the points back inside the disk are some points that will leave the disk neighborhood and others that will continue to return. The set of points that never leaves the neighborhood of the given periodic orbit form a fractal.

A symbolic name can be given to all the orbits that remain in the neighborhood. The initial neighborhood disk can be divided into a small number of regions. Knowing the sequence in which the orbit visits these regions allows the orbit to be pinpointed exactly. The visitation sequence of the orbits provide a symbolic representation of the dynamics, known as symbolic dynamics.

===Orbits===
It is possible to describe the behavior of all initial conditions of the horseshoe map. An initial point &quot;u&quot;0 = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) gets mapped into the point &quot;u&quot;1 = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;0). Its iterate is the point &quot;u&quot;2 = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;1) = &quot;f&quot; 2(&quot;u&quot;0), and repeated iteration generates the orbit &quot;u&quot;0, &quot;u&quot;1, &quot;u&quot;2, ...

Under repeated iteration of the horseshoe map, most orbits end up at the fixed point in the left cap. This is because the horseshoe maps the left cap into itself by an affine transformation that has exactly one fixed point. Any orbit that lands on the left cap never leaves it and converges to the fixed point in the left cap under iteration. Points in the right cap get mapped into the left cap on the next iteration, and most points in the square get mapped into the caps. Under iteration, most points will be part of orbits that converge to the fixed point in the left cap, but some points of the square never leave.

===Iterating the square===

Under forward iterations of the horseshoe map, the original square gets mapped into a series of horizontal strips. The points in these horizontal strips come from vertical strips in the original square. Let be the original square, map it forward &quot;n&quot; times, and consider only the points that fall back into the square , which is a set of horizontal stripes 
:formula_3
The points in the horizontal stripes came from the vertical stripes 
:formula_4,
which are the horizontal strips mapped backwards &quot;n&quot; times. That is, a point in will, under &quot;n&quot; iterations of the horseshoe, end up in the set of vertical strips.

===Invariant set===
If a point is to remain indefinitely in the square, then it must belong to a set that maps to itself. Whether this set is empty or not has to be determined. The vertical strips map into the horizontal strips , but not all points of map back into . Only the points in the intersection of and may belong to , as can be checked by following points outside the intersection for one more iteration.

The intersection of the horizontal and vertical stripes, , are squares that in the limit converge to the invariant set (this set is an intersection of a Cantor set of vertical lines with a Cantor set of horizontal lines). The structure of this set can be better understood by introducing a system of labels for all the intersections—a symbolic dynamics.
===Symbolic dynamics===

Since , any point that is in under iteration must land in the left vertical strip of , or on the right vertical strip . The lower horizontal strip of is the image of and the upper horizontal strip is the image of , so &quot;H&quot;1 = &quot;f(A)&quot; ∪ &quot;f(B)&quot;. The strips and can be used to label the four squares in the intersection of and :

:formula_5

The set consist of points from strip that were in strip in the previous iteration. A dot is used to separate the region the point of an orbit is in from the region the point came from.

The notation can be extended to higher iterates of the horseshoe map. The vertical strips can be named according to the sequence of visits to strip or strip . For example, the set &quot;ABB&quot; ⊂ &quot;V&quot;3 consists of the points from that will all land in in one iteration and remain in in the iteration after that:

:formula_6

Working backwards from that trajectory determines a small region, the set &quot;ABB&quot;, within &quot;V&quot;3.

The horizontal strips are named from their vertical strip pre-images. In this notation, the intersection of &quot;V&quot;2 and &quot;H&quot;2 consists of 16 squares, one of which is

:formula_7

All the points in ΛAB•BB are in and will continue to be in for at least one more iteration. Their previous trajectory before landing in &quot;BB&quot; was followed by .

===Periodic orbits===
Any one of the intersections of a horizontal strip with a vertical strip, where &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are sequences of &quot;A&quot;s and &quot;B&quot;s, is an affine transformation of a small region in &quot;V1&quot;. If &quot;P&quot; has &quot;k&quot; symbols in it, and if and intersect, the region will have a fixed point. This happens when the sequence &quot;P&quot; is the same as &quot;F&quot;. For example, has at least one fixed point. This point is also the same as the fixed point in ΛAB•AB. By including more and more &quot;AB&quot;s in the &quot;P&quot; and &quot;F&quot; part of the label of intersection, the area of the intersection can be made as small as needed. It converges to a point that is part of a periodic orbit of the horseshoe map. The periodic orbit can be labeled by the simplest sequence of s and s that labels one of the regions the periodic orbit visits.

For every sequence of s and s there is a periodic orbit.

<text>Martha Ellis Gellhorn (8 November 1908 – 15 February 1998) was an American novelist, travel writer, and journalist who is considered one of the great war correspondents of the 20th century. She reported on virtually every major world conflict that took place during her 60-year career. 

She was the third wife of American novelist Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945. 

She died in 1998 by apparent suicide at the age of 89, ill and almost completely blind. 

The Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism is named after her.

==Early life==
Gellhorn was born on 8 November 1908, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Edna Fischel Gellhorn, a suffragist, and George Gellhorn, a German-born gynecologist. Her father and maternal grandfather were Jewish, and her maternal grandmother came from a Protestant family. Her brother Walter became a noted law professor at Columbia University, and her younger brother Alfred was an oncologist and dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

At age 7, Gellhorn participated in &quot;The Golden Lane,&quot; a rally for women&#x27;s suffrage at the Democratic Party&#x27;s 1916 national convention in St. Louis. Women carrying yellow parasols and wearing yellow sashes lined both sides of a main street leading to the St. Louis Coliseum. A tableau of the states was in front of the Art Museum; states that had not enfranchised women were draped in black. Gellhorn and another girl, Mary Taussig, stood in front of the line, representing future voters.

In 1926, Gellhorn graduated from John Burroughs School in St. Louis, and enrolled in Bryn Mawr College, several miles outside Philadelphia. The following year, she left without having graduated to pursue a career as a journalist. Her first published articles appeared in &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In 1930, determined to become a foreign correspondent, she went to France for two years, where she worked at the United Press bureau in Paris, but was fired after she reported sexual harassment by a man connected with the agency. She spent years traveling Europe, writing for newspapers in Paris and St. Louis and covering fashion for &quot;Vogue&quot;. She became active in the pacifist movement, and wrote about her experiences in her 1934 book &quot;What Mad Pursuit&quot;.

Returning to the United States in 1932, Gellhorn was hired by Harry Hopkins, whom she had met through her friendship with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The Roosevelts invited Gellhorn to live at the White House, and she spent evenings there helping Eleanor Roosevelt write correspondence and the first lady’s “My Day” column in &quot;Women&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;. She was hired as a field investigator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), created by Franklin D. Roosevelt to help end the Great Depression. Gellhorn traveled around the United States for FERA to report on how the Depression was affecting the country. She first went to Gastonia, North Carolina. Later, she worked with Dorothea Lange, a photographer, to document the everyday lives of the hungry and homeless. Their reports became part of the official government files for the Great Depression. They were able to investigate topics that were not usually open to women of the 1930s. She drew on her research to write a collection of short stories, &quot;The Trouble I&#x27;ve Seen&quot; (1936). In Idaho doing FERA work, Gellhorn convinced a group of workers to break the windows of the FERA office to draw attention to their crooked boss. Although this worked, she was fired from FERA.

==War in Europe and marriage to Hemingway==

Gellhorn met Ernest Hemingway during a 1936 Christmas family trip to Key West, Florida. Gellhorn had been hired to report for &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on the Spanish Civil War, and the pair decided to travel to Spain together. The seven dispatches she sent from the Spanish battlefront from July 17, 1937 to November 1938, mostly dealt with the condition and anguish suffered by the civilians. Gellhorn and Hemingway celebrated Christmas of 1937 in Barcelona. In Germany, she reported on the rise of Adolf Hitler; in the spring of 1938, months before the Munich Agreement, she was in Czechoslovakia. After the outbreak of World War II, she described these events in the novel &quot;A Stricken Field&quot; (1940). She later reported the war from Finland, Hong Kong, Burma, Singapore, and England.

In June 1944, Gellhorn applied to the British government for press accreditation to report on the Normandy landings; her application, like those of all female journalists, was refused. Lacking official press credentials, she drove to the south coast of England and, claiming to be a nurse, was allowed onto an American hospital ship about to depart for France. She promptly locked herself in a bathroom and crossed the Channel as a stowaway. Upon landing two days later, near Omaha Beach, she went ashore with a medical team to help recover wounded soldiers. For breaching military regulations, Gellhorn was subsequently arrested and stripped of her war correspondent accreditation. This did not stop her hitching a flight to Italy and then continuing to file reports throughout the war for Collier&#x27;s. Later she recalled, &quot;I followed the war wherever I could reach it.&quot; She was the only woman to land at Normandy on D-Day on 6 June 1944. She was among the first journalists to report from Dachau concentration camp after it was liberated by U.S. troops on 29 April 1945.

Gellhorn and Hemingway lived together off and on for four years, before marrying in November 1940. (Hemingway had ostensibly lived with his second wife, Pauline Pfeiffer, until 1939). Increasingly resentful of Gellhorn&#x27;s long absences during her reporting assignments, Hemingway wrote to her when she left their Finca Vigía estate near Havana in 1943 to cover the Italian Front: &quot;Are you a war correspondent, or wife in my bed?&quot; Hemingway, however, would later go to the front just before the Normandy landings, and Gellhorn also went, with Hemingway trying to block her travel. When she arrived by means of a dangerous ocean voyage in war-torn London (he had landed there eleven days before her, via an RAF flight on which she had arranged a seat for him), she told him she had had enough. She had found, as had his other wives, that, as described by Bernice Kert in &quot;The Hemingway Women&quot;: &quot;Hemingway could never sustain a long-lived, wholly satisfying relationship with any one of his four wives. Married domesticity may have seemed to him the desirable culmination of romantic love, but sooner or later he became bored and restless, critical and bullying.&quot; After four contentious years of marriage, they divorced in 1945.

The 2012 film &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot; is based on these years. The 2011 documentary film &quot;No Job for a Woman: The Women Who Fought to Report WWII&quot; features Gellhorn and how she changed war reporting.

==Later career==
After the war, Gellhorn worked for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, covering the Vietnam War and the Arab-Israel conflicts in the 1960s and 70s. She passed her 70th birthday in 1979 but continued working in the following decade, covering the civil wars in Central America. As she approached 80, Gellhorn began to slow down physically, although she still managed to cover the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. In 1990, she went door to door in the slum areas of Panama City to report on civilian casualties resulting from the U.S. invasion. She finally retired from journalism as the 1990s began. An operation for cataracts was unsuccessful and left her with permanently impaired vision. Gellhorn announced that she was &quot;too old&quot; to cover the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s. She did manage one last overseas trip to Brazil in 1995 to report on poverty in that country, which was published in the literary journal &quot;Granta&quot;. This last feat was accomplished with great difficulty as Gellhorn&#x27;s eyesight was failing, and she could not read her own manuscripts.

Gellhorn&#x27;s books include a collection of articles on war, &quot;The Face of War&quot; (1959); &quot;The Lowest Trees Have Tops&quot; (1967), a novel about McCarthyism; an account of her travels (including one trip with Hemingway), &quot;Travels with Myself and Another&quot; (1978); and a collection of her peacetime journalism, &quot;The View from the Ground&quot; (1988).

Peripatetic by nature, Gellhorn reckoned that in a 40-year span of her life, she had created homes in 19 locales.

==Personal life==
Gellhorn&#x27;s first major affair was with the French economist Bertrand de Jouvenel. It began in 1930, when she was 22 years old, and lasted until 1934. She would have married de Jouvenel if his wife had consented to a divorce.

She met Ernest Hemingway in Key West, Florida, in 1936. They married in 1940. Gellhorn resented her reflected fame as Hemingway&#x27;s third wife, remarking that she had no intention of &quot;being a footnote in someone else&#x27;s life.&quot; As a condition for granting interviews, she was known to insist that Hemingway&#x27;s name not be mentioned. As she put it once, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a writer for over 40 years. I was a writer before I met him and I was a writer after I left him. Why should I be merely a footnote in his life?&quot;

While married to Hemingway, Gellhorn had an affair with U.S. paratrooper Major General James M. Gavin, commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division. Gavin was the youngest divisional commander in the U.S. Army in World War II.

Between marriages after divorcing Hemingway in 1945, Gellhorn had romantic liaisons with &quot;L,&quot; Laurance Rockefeller, an American businessman (1945); journalist William Walton (1947) (no relation to the British composer); and medical doctor David Gurewitsch (1950). In 1954, she married the former managing editor of &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, T. S. Matthews. She and Matthews divorced in 1963. She stayed in London for some time before moving to Kenya and then to Kilgwrrwg near Devauden in Gwent, South Wales, She was very taken by the niceness of the Welsh people and lived there from 1980 to 1994 before finally returning to London because of her ill health.

In 1949, Gellhorn adopted a boy, Sandro, from an Italian orphanage. He was formally renamed George Alexander Gellhorn, and widely called Sandy. Gellhorn was reportedly a devoted mother for a time but was not by nature maternal. She left Sandy in the care of relatives in Englewood, New Jersey, for long periods as she travelled, and he eventually attended boarding school. Their relationship was said to have become embittered.

Gellhorn and the writer Sybille Bedford met in Rome in 1949 and developed a strong platonic friendship. It long survived volatility on both sides and entailed much moral, creative and financial support for her friend on Gellhorn&#x27;s part until she ended the friendship in the early 1980s.

Regarding sex, in 1972 Gellhorn wrote:
If I practised sex out of moral conviction, that was one thing; but to enjoy it ... seemed a defeat. I accompanied men and was accompanied in action, in the extrovert part of life; I plunged into that ... but not sex; that seemed to be their delight, and all I got was a pleasure of being wanted, I suppose, and the tenderness (not nearly enough) that a man gives when he is satisfied. I daresay I was the worst bed partner in five continents.

On her relationship with Hemingway, she said &quot;My whole memory of sex with Ernest is the invention of excuses, and failing that, the hope that it would soon be over.&quot;

However, the legacy of Gellhorn&#x27;s personal life remains shrouded in controversy. Supporters of Gellhorn say her unauthorized biographer, Carl Rollyson, is guilty of &quot;sexual scandal-mongering and cod psychology.&quot; Several of her prominent close friends (among them the actress Betsy Drake, journalist John Pilger, writer James Fox, and Martha&#x27;s younger brother Alfred) have dismissed the characterizations of her as sexually manipulative and maternally deficient. Her supporters include her stepson, Sandy Matthews, who describes Gellhorn as &quot;very conscientious&quot; in her role as stepmother; and Jack Hemingway once said that Gellhorn, his father&#x27;s third wife, was his &quot;favorite other mother.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
In her last years, Gellhorn was in frail health, nearly blind and suffering from ovarian cancer that had spread to her liver. On 15 February 1998, she died by suicide in London apparently by swallowing a cyanide capsule.

The Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism was established in 1999 in her honor.

In 2019, a blue English Heritage plaque was unveiled at Gellhorn&#x27;s former London home, the first to feature the dedication of &quot;war correspondent&quot;.

In 2021 a Purple Plaque was placed on the cottage she lived in near Kilgwrrwg, north-west of Chepstow, as part of a national effort to commemorate remarkable women.

==In popular culture==
On 5 October 2007, the United States Postal Service announced that it would honor five 20th-century journalists with first-class rate postage stamps, to be issued on 22 April 2008: Martha Gellhorn; John Hersey; George Polk; Ruben Salazar; and Eric Sevareid. Postmaster General Jack Potter announced the stamp series at the Associated Press Managing Editors Meeting in Washington, D.C.

In 2011, Gellhorn was the subject of an hour-long episode of the World Media Rights series &quot;Extraordinary Women&quot;, which airs on the BBC, and periodically in the United States on PBS.

In 2012, Gellhorn was played by Nicole Kidman in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s film, &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot;.

Martha Gellhorn&#x27;s relationship with Ernest Hemingway is the subject of Paula McLain&#x27;s 2018 novel, &quot;Love and Ruin&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Hemingway&quot;, a three-episode, six-hour documentary recapitulation of Hemingway&#x27;s life, labors, and loves, aired on PBS. It was co-produced and directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. It contains considerable footage and photographs of Gellhorn, who is voiced by Meryl Streep, and recollections of those who knew her and her life with Hemingway first-hand.

In her collection of short stories called “Old babes in the wood”, Margaret Atwood briefly recalls Martha Gellhorn’s reporting from the Second World War, notably her article on the breaking through the Gothic Line and the capturing of the Fortunato Ridge in 1944.

<doc id="449367" wikidata="Q257800" url="?curid=449367" title="John Randall, Baron Randall of Uxbridge">
<text>Alexander John Randall, Baron Randall of Uxbridge, (born 5 August 1955) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge from 1997 to 2010 and for Uxbridge and South Ruislip until 2015, before being awarded a life peerage in 2018. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Government Deputy Chief Whip from May 2010 and October 2013, as well as Environment Adviser to Theresa May from 2017 to 2019.

Lord Randall is a trustee and Vice-Chair of the Human Trafficking Foundation and in February 2016 was appointed Special Envoy on modern slavery to the Mayor of London, alongside Anthony Steen.

==Early life==

Randall&#x27;s family have lived in Uxbridge for many years. The family owned the major local department store Randalls of Uxbridge on Vine Street, which was founded by his great-grandfather Philip Randall in 1891, and closed in 2015.

Born in Uxbridge, Randall was educated at Rutland House School, an independent school in Hillingdon in the west of Greater London and at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in Moor Park, Hertfordshire. In 1979, he graduated from the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (which is now part of University College London) with an Upper Second Class Honours BA degree in Serbo-Croatian language and literature.

Randall later became managing director of Randall&#x27;s and one of three shareholders in the business. In 1994, he became Honorary Treasurer of Uxbridge Conservative Association, which later elected him Chairman.

He announced in 2014 that the family store would close, citing decreased turnover and competition from online shopping as causes. Speaking about the closure, he criticised other employers for using zero-hours contracts to cut their costs.

==Parliamentary career==
===House of Commons===
Randall was elected Member of Parliament for Uxbridge in a by-election following the death of Sir Michael Shersby in the wake of the Labour Party&#x27;s 1997 landslide election victory. Randall had been an election agent for Shersby throughout the 1997 General Election campaign. He became the first Conservative candidate to win a parliamentary by-election since the party&#x27;s recently elected leader William Hague&#x27;s victory in Richmond in 1989.

During his political career he has sat on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee and its Environment Sub-Committee. He is strongly against the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

In 1999 he was appointed as an Opposition Whip, but, due to his opposition to Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War, he resigned as a matter of conscience in March 2003. He was later reappointed as a Whip in 2003. At the end of 2005 he was promoted to Conservative Assistant Chief Whip. In 2010 he was appointed the joint Deputy Chief Whip and Treasurer of Her Majesty&#x27;s Household in the Coalition Government.

He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 9 June 2010.

He resigned from the government with praise to David Cameron on 6 October 2013, amid a cabinet reshuffle. On 21 October 2013 it was announced that he was to receive a knighthood, having the accolade bestowed by The Prince of Wales on 12 February 2014. On 10 July 2014, Randall announced that he would not be standing as a parliamentary candidate for the seat at the 2015 general election.

===House of Lords===
On 18 May 2018, it was announced he would be elevated to the House of Lords. On 25 June, he was created a life peer as Baron Randall of Uxbridge, of Uxbridge in the London Borough of Hillingdon.

==Outside Parliament==
In February 2016 he was appointed Special Envoy on Modern Slavery to the Mayor of London, alongside Anthony Steen CBE.
He is President of the Colne Valley Regional Park.

==Personal life==

Lord Randall married Katherine Frances Gray in 1986; the couple have two sons and a daughter. Randall is a keen supporter of Uxbridge Football Club and Saracens Rugby Club.

<text>Sydney Norman John Rapson (born 17 April 1942) is a British former Labour politician who served as the MP for Portsmouth North from 1997 to 2005.

== Early life ==
Rapson moved with his family to the Paulsgrove area of Portsmouth as a young child, where he attended Paulsgrove Modern (now King Richard School). After leaving school he worked in the aeronautical industry for nearly forty years and became a long serving councillor, serving as Lord Mayor of Portsmouth in 1990.

== Political career ==
Rapson was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Portsmouth North at the 1997 general election until he retired in 2005. He was succeeded by Sarah McCarthy-Fry.

Rapson stood for union improvement. He had stronger trade union credentials than many of the 1997 intake, having spent many years as an Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union activist and convener, which also gave him the strong interest in defence, the hallmark of his parliamentary career. He joined the Commons Defence Select Committee after the 2001 election. He sat for four years on the Accommodation and Works Committee.

In 2001, Rapson was one of a number of MPs stung by the satirical Channel 4 documentary series &quot;Brass Eye,&quot; which filmed him for its controversial &quot;Paedogeddon!&quot; episode. He was filmed describing &quot;trust-me trousers&quot;, which were supposedly worn by paedophiles and inflated to hide an erection. The programme-makers also persuaded him to say that paedophiles were using &quot;an area of internet the size of Ireland&quot;. The MP complained to the Broadcasting Standards Commission that he had been duped into appearing on the show and that it had infringed his privacy. The BSC ruled against him, saying the means used to deceive the MPs &quot;were justified in the context of the serious issues raised by the programme&quot; and in particular &quot;the dangers of people in the public eye speaking with apparent authority about matters they do not understand&quot;.

Rapson led the team that headed the development of Portsmouth City&#x27;s Gunwharf Quays, a large leisure and retail center located near the famous Portsmouth docks and the district of Portsea. The &#x27;Quays&#x27; saw huge success, becoming the tourist capital of the city.

In 2018, Rapson was awarded the key of the city for his contributions and accomplishments in regard to representation and contributions for the city. This award was last given in 2008 and is only held by 32 others over a century of Portsmouth&#x27;s history.

Rapson retired in 2005 and still lives in Portchester and Portsmouth to this day, with his wife Phyllis. He has two children and four grandchildren.

<doc id="449373" wikidata="Q4761216" url="?curid=449373" title="Andy Reed (politician)">
<text>Andrew John Reed (born 17 September 1964) is a British Labour Co-operative politician who was the Member of Parliament for the key marginal Constituency of Loughborough from 1997 to 2010. 
Reed was awarded the OBE in June 2012 for service to the community and sport in Leicestershire.

He is a notable sports enthusiast, a fortuitous coincidence as &quot;Loughborough is home to the most comprehensive sports development programme of any University,&quot; as well as being headquarters for Team GB&#x27;s 2012 Olympic preparation, whose requirements Reed became familiar with under the Parliamentary Sports Fellowship Scheme. Although regarded as a loyal MP, Reed was the first member of the Government to resign over the invasion of Iraq.

==Background==
Reed was brought up and educated in Leicestershire spending the first two years of his life on the Netherhall Estate in Leicester before moving to Birstall. He attended Riverside Junior School (now a primary school), Stonehill High School and Longslade Community College, all in Birstall, Charnwood and then completed a BA (Hons) degree in Public Administration at Leicester Polytechnic (now called De Montfort University).

He joined the Labour Party in 1983/84, and was elected in 1987 as a Parish Councillor, a position held until 1991. 
Reed worked as a Parliamentary assistant to Keith Vaz from 1987 until 1988 when he joined Leicester City Council, working first in Urban Regeneration on the Inner Area Programme and later as a Project Officer for Recreation &amp; Arts. He joined Leicestershire County Council in 1990 as an Employment Officer in the Employment Initiatives Team moving to the Economic Development Section where he dealt with voluntary sector employment projects before becoming European Affairs Officer in 1994–97. Reed was East Midlands coordinator for John Smith&#x27;s 1992 leadership campaign. He was elected to the Sileby Ward of Charnwood Borough Council in May 1995.

In the late 1980s/early 1990s, he served as a School governor first at Stonehill High Birstall, then at Highgate Primary School in Sileby.

He married Sarah Elizabeth Chester in August 1992 at Glenfield Methodist church Leicestershire and lives in Quorn in the Loughborough constituency with Sarah and their son James Kyran (born March 1999) and daughter Emily Grace (born March 2002).

==Career as an MP==
Reed first stood for Loughborough in 1992. His 1997 election followed boundary changes which saw the previous incumbent, Conservative Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell move with his key rural voters to the newly created Charnwood constituency.

Prior to the 2001 election Reed served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Culture, Media and Sport ministerial team, working with Chris Smith, Alan Howarth, Janet Anderson and Minister for Sport Kate Hoey. In 2001 he was returned with an increased majority of 6,300 and became the PPS to Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett, but resigned in 2003 in protest at the Government&#x27;s decision to support a US-led invasion of Iraq without a United Nations resolution.

He retained his seat in the 2005 election but with a reduced majority of 1,996, and was recalled to the Government to be a PPS to the Treasury ministerial team, working with the Paymaster General, Dawn Primarolo.

He stood down from the role of PPS in 2007 when Gordon Brown became Leader of the Labour Party to return to the backbenches as a member of parliament. Reed said that he would not seek Ministerial Office again.

Reed was a member of various All-Party Parliamentary Groups and was an officer in the following: Bermuda–Britain (Secretary), Athletics (Treasurer), Balanced and Sustainable Communities (Treasurer), Christians in Parliament (Vice Chair), Debt, Aid &amp; Trade (Treasurer/Secretary), East Midlands Rail Franchise (Treasurer), Health and Wellbeing in Schools (Vice Chair), Hockey (Vice Chair), Leisure (Vice Chair), Rugby Union (joint vice-chair), Scout (Vice Chair), and Sports (Secretary). He was also Chair of the Sports Caucus, a small group of MPs with a common interest in sport. He captained the winning House of Commons swimming team in the Lords vs. Commons swimming gala in 2000, 2002 and 2004.

According to TheyWorkForYou, in his last year in Parliament Reed had spoken in an &quot;above average&quot; number of debates, voted an &quot;above average&quot; number of times in the 2005–2010 parliament and replied &quot;within 2 or 3 weeks&quot; to a &quot;high number of messages&quot; during 2008. His most frequent questions related to the Olympics, Hearing Impairment, Physical Activity, Education Funding and Sunday Trading. Sport was referred to over 100 times, often in relation to young people and a healthy lifestyle.

===Party loyalty===
In &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Andrew Roth described Reed as an &quot;Over eager Blair loyalist and stooge questioner&quot; and his Parliamentary voting record -as would be expected from a &quot;largely loyal&quot; MP -has generally been in support of the Government.

His overall record at the Public Whip shows he &quot;occasionally rebels&quot;, with 26 votes out of 2791 being deemed against the party whip.

===Iraq===
In February 2003, he voted both ways, a common method of showing active abstention, to amend a motion which supported Government policy on Iraq so that it also state that the case for military action against Iraq was as yet unproven.

On 9 March, he resigned over the imminent invasion of Iraq though his website made it clear that he supported continued efforts to find a solution through the United Nations.

In the final vote of the House of Commons on 18 March 2003, Reed abstained on an amendment declaring &quot;that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established, especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation&quot;, but then went on to support the Government motion which declared that the United Nations authority to use force had revived and supporting &quot;the decision of Her Majesty&#x27;s Government that the United Kingdom should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction&quot;.

This was his last rebellion on this issue. On 9 March 2004 he voted to reject the motion calling for immediate publication of all advice prepared by the Attorney-General, it was subsequently published in April 2005 and in March 2008 he voted to delay an inquiry whilst important operations were underway. The Iraq Inquiry was announced in June 2009.

===Gurkhas Settlement Rights===
In April 2009, Reed voted against the Government for a motion supporting the Gurkhas&#x27; rights to settle in the UK on which the Government was defeated.

===Expenses claims===
Reed&#x27;s total 2008–2009 constituency expenses of £159,409 were the 204th highest out of 647 MPs. Over 75% of this was staff and office costs. In 2008–09 the total cost of Reed&#x27;s &quot;Staying away from main home&quot; was £20,387, the 299th highest.

Reed &quot;came through the scandal ..over MPs&#x27; expenses unscathed&quot;, although in May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrongly implied a discrepancy between claims for Reed&#x27;s second home in Westminster and what he told constituents.&quot;Andy Reed has a flat as second home in Westminster. In 2007, claimed £1,180 for the flat but this fell to £727 for a mortgage interest payment in 2008. Website states he claims about £450 per month in mortgage interest payments.&quot;

A &quot;Loughborough Echo&quot; investigation showed Reed lived &quot;in a small one bedroom flat&quot; and the difference was due to utility bills, council tax and a quarterly service charge, a total cost of £807 per month and already well within the £1,450 a month limit introduced a year later in the wake of the scandal. &quot;The Echo&quot; revealed that Reed had claimed £991 for home entertainment equipment. Reed told the paper, &quot;Is it necessary? Probably not, but at the time it is what I had... In hindsight, would I do it in today&#x27;s climate? No.&quot;
The &quot;Legg Report&quot; showed that 343 MPs had been asked to repay some money, including several from Leicestershire.

In Reed&#x27;s case it was because of an accounting error by the Fees office and the amount was outstanding at publication on 4 February 2010.
Reed told the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;: &quot;The Fees Office made a mistake in the past and paid my service charge twice – so I have paid back £891. The problem arose when they wrote and said they would withhold a proportion of my expenses for a month because they had lost an invoice for the service charge.&quot;

==Sports==
Reed has a keen interest in playing sport and encouraging others to do so, the &quot;sports mad MP&quot; persuaded MPs to run a mile in support of Sport Relief.
He is the President of Birstall Rugby union Club based at Longslade Community College where he still plays rugby regularly. He chaired East Midlands Sport in 2000–3. He has been chair of the board of the County Sports Partnership for Leicestershire since 2004 and also Chairs the National Strategic Partnership for Volunteers in Sport.

<text>Andrew Robert George Robathan, Baron Robathan, (born 17 July 1951) is a British Conservative Party politician, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Leicestershire (previously Blaby) in Leicestershire as well as a government minister.

In September 2014 Robathan announced he would stand down at the 2015 general election, and was nominated for a life peerage in 2015 Dissolution Honours, being created Baron Robathan, of Poultney in the County of Leicestershire, on 13 October 2015.

==Early life==
Robathan was born on 17 July 1951. He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, an all-boys public school in Northwood, London. He went up to read Modern History at Oriel College, University of Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1973, later proceeding Master of Arts.

==Military career==
Robathan was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards as a Second Lieutenant (on probation) (University Candidate) on 6 October 1974. He was given the service number 498738. His commission was confirmed and he was given seniority as a Second Lieutenant from 6 April 1971. He was promoted to lieutenant, back dated to 6 October 1974, with seniority from 6 April 1973. Having attended the Staff College, Camberley, he was promoted to major on 30 September 1984. He served for a period of time with the Special Air Service (SAS), and retired on 27 August 1989 being appointed to the Reserve of Officers.

He worked for BP from 1991 to 1992, but volunteered to return to the Army between January and April 1991 during the First Gulf War, serving as Chief of Staff of the Prisoner of War Guard Force in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait.

==Parliamentary career==
Robathan was elected to Hammersmith and Fulham Council in May 1990, defeating the then-Labour Mayor in the Eel Brook Ward.

He resigned as a Councillor in late 1991 to fight the 1992 general election, elected as MP for Blaby in 1992 succeeding Nigel Lawson, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. Blaby had a 37% Conservative majority in 1992, but it was considerably reduced by the national swing against the Conservatives and major boundary changes in 1997, creating a rise in Labour support within the constituency. Following a public enquiry by the Electoral Commission and submissions from the public including Robathan, the Blaby constituency was reconfigured as South Leicestershire.

Robathan served four years on the Defence Select Committee between 1997 and 2001; he was also Chairman of the All-Party Cycling Group, and Vice-Chairman of the All-Party Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group, whilst an MP.

Robathan was John Redwood&#x27;s Parliamentary Private Secretary to Iain Sproat, Minister for Sport, in the Major administration before returning to the backbenches when the Conservatives lost the 1997 general election. He returned to the front-bench as Trade and Industry Spokesman in 2002.

In the 2001 Conservative Party leadership election, Robathan was a notable supporter of Michael Portillo. After six months on the backbenches, Robathan was appointed Commons Liaison to the Lords and then a Defence Spokesman in which capacity he fought the 2005 general election.

In the 2005 Conservative leadership election, Robathan was one of the first MPs to declare his support for David Cameron being rewarded with one of only five paid posts as Opposition Deputy Chief Whip.

In May 2010, he was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence with responsibility for Welfare and Veterans.

In 2011, he was a member of the Special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011.

In December 2011, campaigners called for him to be sacked after he compared the medal claims of 66,500 veterans of the Arctic convoys of World War II to the proliferation of honours made by &quot;authoritarian regimes&quot; and &quot;dictators&quot;:
: &quot;One can look, for instance, at North Korean generals who are covered in medals or Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein... We have taken the view in this country, traditionally, that medals will only be awarded for campaigns that show risk and rigour.&quot;
Some 3000 sailors died on the convoys - which Winston Churchill described as the &quot;worst journey in the world&quot;. Portsmouth MPs described his behaviour as &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;sickening&quot;.

In October 2012 Robathan was told to calm down by Lindsay Hoyle, the Deputy Speaker, after complaining about noise levels from the public gallery. Soldiers from the &quot;historic&quot; 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who face being disbanded were &quot;politely applauding MPs who spoke up on their behalf&quot;. A former captain contrasted MoD advice that they went to Afghanistan and Iraq to help democracy with the reality of their own threatened ejection from Parliament.

===Expenses===
Robathan claimed the maximum second home entitlement of £24,006 in the period 2008–09 though he was not one of the 343 MPs required to repay money by the Legg Report. 
He was one of 177 MPs listed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; who employed family members. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority report published two years later, whilst tightening the rules, confirmed that a member may employ one relative subject to general conditions relating to expenses. Robathan&#x27;s expenses were generally in the bottom half of all MPs.

On 24 August 2009, he was quoted in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper suggesting that MP&#x27;s salaries be increased to £110,000. These comments were heavily frowned upon by his colleagues in Parliament and the media.

On 4 November 2013, it was reported in &quot;The Leicester Mercury&quot; newspaper and on &quot;BBC Radio Leicester&quot; that Robathan had claimed £4,587 expenses to pay for energy bills for his second home.

==Personal life==
Robathan married Rachael Maunder in December 1991 in Westminster. They have a son (born December 1996), and daughter (born July 1999). Rachael has been a Conservative councillor on Westminster City Council since 2010, representing Knightsbridge and Belgravia ward. In 2020, she became Leader of the Council.

Robathan speaks French and German, and has been admitted as a Freeman of the City of London.

<doc id="449378" wikidata="Q1628993" url="?curid=449378" title="Democratic Union of Catalonia">
<text>The Democratic Union of Catalonia (; , UDC), frequently shortened as Union (; ), was a regionalist, Christian-democratic political party in the Catalonia region of Spain existing between 1931 and 2017. Together with Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC), they formed the Convergence and Union (CiU) alliance and federation from 1978 until its dissolution in 2015, under which they would rule the government of Catalonia for almost three decades during the recent Spanish democratic period.

It described itself as Catalan nationalist and Christian-democratic and was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). It advocated for centrist and moderate Catalanism without explicitly renouncing independence, aiming for the constitution of a confederal state in Spain made up of sovereign entities (including Catalonia) that could become independent but rejecting unilateralism as a viable political philosophy.

After the breakup of CiU, a party split that took away half of its membership, and UDC&#x27;s failure in securing parliamentary representation in the 2015 Catalan and Spanish general elections, the party&#x27;s mounting debts brought it to bankruptcy, leading to its dissolution on 24 March 2017.

==History==
===Transition to democracy===
Ahead of the 1977 Spanish general election, Unió joined the Union of the Centre and Christian Democracy of Catalonia (UCiDCC) alliance together with the Catalan Centre (CC) for the Congress of Deputies, which received the support of the Christian Democratic Team of the Spanish State (EDCEE). Both parties also joined the Democracy and Catalonia coalition for the Senate, whereas talks for Unió to join the Democratic Front coalition formed by Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) and Democratic Left of Catalonia (EDC) failed to materialize. Election results were disappointing: the UCiDCC secured only two seats in Congress, one for each party, and the platform&#x27;s nationwide referent the EDCEE failed to gain any parliamentary representation. This led to both Unió and CC breaking their alliance and going into different parliamentary groups.

After the election, an internal party crisis ensued as Unió found itself in need of seeking collaboration with other political parties to ensure its electoral viability in the future, with the question on the direction of such alliances dividing the party in two sectors: a more Catalan nationalist and progressive, centre-left one, and another more conservative one, attracted to the UCD&#x27;s government halo and sympathetic to a merger with their former ally CC. The internal support for each position would be revealed ahead of the 6th Unió congress in September 1977, with the pro-UCD sector being in the minority, resulting in a group of 17 members led by Josep Miró i Ardèvol splitting into the Union of the Christian Democrats of Catalonia–Jacques Maritain Club, which would merge with other parties into the Union of the Centre of Catalonia (UCC) in March 1978 to join into a joint platform with the UCD. However, and despite the 6th congress resulting in a reinforcement of the party&#x27;s identity as well as its more progressive turn, the internal crisis continued as Unió deputy in Congress Antón Cañellas kept advocating for a &quot;large Catalan centre&quot; that included the UCD. This position—which only garnered the support of about 15–20% of party members—was in clear contrast with the majority position of favouring a centre-left federation of parties that included CDC while rejecting any kind of election agreement with the regional branches of national parties.

In September 1978, Unió would sign an agreement with CDC to form Convergence and Union (CiU), an alliance initially appealing to the Catalan centre-left that would end up becoming a big tent platform lasting for the next 37 years. The CiU negotiations had seen political clashing ensue between Unió and Cañellas because of the latter&#x27;s courtship of the UCD–UCC platform. In the 7th Unió congress held in November 1978, Cañellas was expelled from the party, prompting him together with other party members to establish the Democratic Union–Broad Centre (UDCA), an instrumental party that would join the UCD and UCC into the newly established Centrists of Catalonia coalition.

===CiU breakup and dissolution===
From 2013 and until 2015 tensions within the two parties forming the Convergence and Union (CiU) federation reached an all-time high over differences between the positions of the UDC leadership and Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) leader Artur Mas over the sovereignty process, as well as on the opportunity of forming a joint, pro-independence electoral list with Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC). CDC was in favour of outright independence even if it meant breaking the established Spanish legality, while UDC was against doing it without agreement with the Spanish government.

As a result, a referendum of UDC members was held on 14 June 2015, asking whether UDC should commit itself to continue with the process but with under certain conditions, including not violating the legality in force through unilateral independence declarations or starting a constituent process at the margin of Spanish legal norms. Such a position, supported by UDC leaders and contrary to the signed agreements between CDC, ERC and sovereignty entities, was approved by UDC members with an adjusted 50.9%. After this, meetings between CiU leaders led to an ultimatum from CDC to UDC for the latter to decide within &quot;two or three days&quot; whether it committed itself to the independence plan. This led to UDC withdrawing all three of its members from Mas&#x27;s cabinet, although they agreed to maintain parliamentary stability until the end of the legislature. That CDC leadership subsequently confirmed in a press conference the next day that UDC and CDC would not stand together in the 2015 Catalan regional election, and that the political project of the CiU federation was over, signalling the end of 37 years of cooperation between both parties.

Later in July 2015, a pro-independence faction within UDC—including historical members Antoni Castellà, Núria de Gispert, Rosa Maria Carrasco Azemar and Joan Rigol—broke away from the party to found the Democrats of Catalonia (DC), and by August the new DC party claimed to have taken away 1,600 UDC volunteers, 23 out of the 43 UDC city mayors and 118 out of UDC&#x27;s 191 city councillors. In the regional election held on 27 September, UDC would fall short of the 3% threshold to secure parliamentary representation, meaning the party was to be expelled from the Parliament of Catalonia for the first time since 1980. The party would also fail in its attempt to maintain its presence in the Cortes Generales in the 2015 Spanish general election, with party&#x27;s spokesman Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida losing his seat.

On 24 March 2017, UDC was dissolved by its last secretary general, Ramon Espadaler, because of mounting economic debts and the lack of public funding resulting from UDC&#x27;s various election defeats bringing the party to bankruptcy. Some of its former members, including Espalader, founded a new catalanist political party called United to Advance, which eventually joined an electoral alliance with the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (PSC) in order to contest the 2017 Catalan regional election.

<doc id="449380" wikidata="Q16848268" url="?curid=449380" title="Interstate compact">
<text>In the United States, an interstate compact is a pact or agreement between two or more states, or between states and any foreign sub-national government. 

== Description ==
Most early interstate compacts resolved boundary disputes, but since the early 20th century, compacts have increasingly been used as a tool of state cooperation and mutual recognition on infrastructure, services and professional licensing, often to ease administrative barriers and reduce costs and litigation. In some cases, an agreement will create a new multi-state governmental agency which is responsible for administering or improving some shared resource such as a seaport or public transportation infrastructure. Compacts may also be limited to a certain multi-state region, may be open to all states and insular areas, or may be open to subnational governments in other countries. 

Interstate compacts are distinct from, but may involve aspects of, the following: 

* Model acts, which are proposed statutes produced by non-governmental bodies of legal experts to be passed by state legislatures independently, rather than constituting an agreement among multiple states; 
* executive agreements between governors or statewide executive officers of states, which may or may not have the backing of statute or state constitutional law;
* State-level trigger laws which provide for an automatic action if another one or more states, or the federal government, perform a specified action; or
* State-level laws mandating, permitting or prohibiting state cooperation with another state government or the federal government regarding certain actions.

=== Interstate agencies ===
Several interstate compacts may establish multi-state agencies in order to coordinate policy between, or perform tasks on behalf of, member states. Such agencies may take the form of commissions, with at least one representative from a member state with a voting role in the commission. Alternatively, member states to a compact may opt for cooperation with a single independent non-profit organization which carries out designated tasks without government funding. Actions or rules changes taken by commissions or non-profits may require ratification by the member states to take effect, depending often on whether such actions may alter the terms of the compact. 

== Legal background ==
The Compact Clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 3) of the United States Constitution provides that &quot;No State shall, without the Consent of Congress... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power...&quot;

However, in a report released in October 2019 about the proposed National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) cited the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Virginia v. Tennessee&quot; (1893)—reaffirmed in &quot;U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Commission&quot; (1978) and &quot;Cuyler v. Adams&quot; (1981)—that ruled that explicit congressional consent of interstate compacts is not required for agreements &quot;which the United States can have no possible objection or have any interest in interfering with&quot; (in addition to ruling that the words &quot;agreement&quot; and &quot;compact&quot; used in the Compact Clause are synonyms). Instead, the Court required explicit congressional consent for interstate compacts that are &quot;directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States&quot;—meaning where the vertical balance of power between the federal government and state governments is altered in favor of state governments, while the report references &quot;U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Commission&quot; as stating that the &quot;pertinent inquiry [with respect to the Compact Clause] is one of potential, rather than actual, impact on federal supremacy&quot; in noting that the potential erosion of an enumerated power of the United States Congress by an interstate compact can arguably require explicit congressional approval. The CRS report cites the Supreme Court&#x27;s rulings in &quot;Florida v. Georgia&quot; (1855) and in &quot;Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado&quot; (2018) as recognizing that explicit congressional consent is also required for interstate compacts that alter the horizontal balance of power amongst state governments.

Citing &quot;Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc.&quot; (1991) as stating that if an enumerated power under the Constitution is legislative, then &quot;Congress must exercise it in conformity with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of Article I, Section VII&quot;, and noting that the Republican River Compact was initially vetoed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, the CRS report states that if an interstate compact requires explicit congressional approval, it must be approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President in order to become law. In &quot;Cuyler v. Adams&quot;, the Court held that congressional approval of interstate compacts makes them federal laws. The CRS report cites the Court&#x27;s opinions in &quot;Virginia v. Tennessee&quot; and &quot;Northeast Bancorp v. Federal Reserve Board of Governors&quot; (1985) as stating that any agreement between two or more states that &quot;cover[s] all stipulations affecting the conduct or claims of the parties&quot;, prohibits members from &quot;modify[ing] or repeal[ing] [the agreement] unilaterally&quot;, and requires &quot;&#x27;reciprocation&#x27; of mutual obligations&quot; constitutes an interstate compact. Additionally, the CRS report cites the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Northeast Bancorp&quot; as suggesting that a requirement of a new interstate governmental entity is a sufficient condition for an agreement to qualify as being an interstate compact under the Compact Clause. The CRS report stated that there were approximately 200 interstate compacts in effect in 2019.

The timing for Congressional consent is not specified by the Constitution, so consent may be given either before or after the states have agreed to a particular compact. The consent may be explicit, but it may also be inferred from circumstances. Congress may also impose conditions as part of its approval of a compact. Congress must explicitly approve any compact that would give a state power that is otherwise designated to the federal government.

==History==
Treaties between the states, ratified under the Articles of Confederation during the period after American independence in 1776 until the current U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1789, are grandfathered and treated as interstate compacts. This includes agreements like the Treaty of Beaufort, which set the boundary between Georgia and South Carolina in 1787, and is still in effect.

Prior to 1922, most interstate compacts were either border agreements between states or advisory compacts, the latter of which are tasked with conducting joint studies to report back to the respective state legislatures. With the creation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1922, administrative compacts began to develop as a third, more-empowered type of interstate compact, in which persistent governance structures are tasked by member states with conducting designated services.

Today, Virginia is a member of the most interstate compacts at 40, while Hawaii is a member of the fewest at 15.

<doc id="449388" wikidata="Q480148" url="?curid=449388" title="Laurence Robertson">
<text>Laurence Anthony Robertson (born 29 March 1958) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tewkesbury from 1997 to 2024. A member of the Conservative Party, he chaired the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for seven years, from 2010 to 2017.

==Early life and education==
Laurence Robertson was born on 29 March 1958 in Bolton, Lancashire. His father was a miner, a postman, a delivery man then a milkman. His mother was an office worker in Manchester.

He was educated at St James&#x27;s C.E. Secondary Modern School and at Farnworth Grammar School, both located in Farnworth. He the studied at Bolton Institute of Higher Education (now the University of Bolton), gaining a diploma in Management Services. 

==Early career==
Before entering Parliament, Robertson held a number of roles which included him working as a charity fundraiser, public relations consultant, company director, factory owner from 1987 to 1988, industrial management consultant from 1983 to 1989, and work study engineer from 1977 to 1983.

From 1988 to 1991, Robertson was Chairman of Governors of a primary school, a visitor for Victim Support Scheme, and the area chairman for the Campaign for Law and Order.

==Political career==
Robertson was an unsuccessful candidate when he stood for Bolton Council in the Derby ward in 1983 and in the Burnden ward in 1986. At the 1987 general election, Robertson stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate in Makerfield, finishing second with 27.3% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Ian McCartney. Robertson also stood unsuccessfully in Ashfield at the 1992 general election, finishing second with 32.6% of the vote behind the Labour candidate Geoff Hoon.

== Parliamentary career ==

=== 1st parliament (1997–2001) ===
At the 1997 general election, Robertson was elected as the Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury, winning with 45.8% of the vote and a majority of 9,234. Robertson stood on &quot;an unashamedly British ticket, fighting against European federalism and stressing the need for and benefits of preserving the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&quot; He made his maiden speech n 21 May 1997, during the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill, in which he spoke out against devolution.

In May 2001, Robertson ignored James Cran&#x27;s advice not to publicly express support for John Townend. Robertson endorsed Townend&#x27;s controversial remarks about race on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; saying that Townend&#x27;s remarks were &quot;basically true&quot; and &quot;having too many people in different multi-racial groups makes society very difficult to manage, especially in certain parts of the country. It is not that easy to manage that kind of society&quot;. Robertson was forced to apologise after being given an ultimatum to either apologise, retract his remarks, and promise not to repeat them or to be stripped of the Conservative party whip. He was reported to have told colleagues that he received a lot of support, and was told by the chairman of his Tewkesbury constituency that he should not have backed down.

=== 2nd parliament (2001–2005) ===
At the 2001 general election, Robertson was re-elected as MP for Tewkesbury with an increased vote share of 46.1% and a decreased majority of 8,663 votes. After the election, Robertson was appointed an Opposition Whip. 

In June 2003, he was made Shadow Minister for Trade and Industry. In November 2003, Robertson was appointed a Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs and from May 2005, he served as the Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland. He was not given a ministerial position in the 2010 Parliament, but served as chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee until July 2017 when Andrew Murrison succeeded Robertson as chair.

Between 2004 and 2005, Robertson led a successful campaign to save Alderman Knight, a local special needs school for children additional learning difficulties, complex needs and Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from closure.

On 24 March 2005, the Schools Adjudicator ruled that Alderman Knight would close. During a question to the Minister of Education on the matter of special schools in the House of Commons that day, Robertson accused Minister for Children, Young People and Families Margaret Hodge of providing an &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;dishonest&quot; answer after failing to mention the school in her figures. When ordered by Speaker Michael Martin to withdraw the remark, Robertson declined, stating: &quot;Mr Speaker, I am here to represent my constituents. I will not withdraw that remark.&quot; He was therefore asked to leave the chamber.

=== 3rd parliament (2005–2010) ===
Robertson was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with an increased vote share of 49.1% and an increased majority of 9,892 votes.

Following the 2007 floods in Tewkesbury, Robertson spoke out against building on flood plains. An issue that Robertson raised once again to Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in February 2020 following heavy flooding in his constituency. Robertson is Vice Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Flood Prevention, and continues to lobby the government on the issue of flooding.

=== 4th parliament (2010–2015) ===
At the 2010 general election, Robertson was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 47.2% and a decreased majority of 6,310 votes. After the election, Robertson served as chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee until July 2017.

During the expenses scandal, it was flagged that between 2001 and 2011, Robertson had claimed more than £1 million in MP&#x27;s expenses and criticised plans to overhaul the system of claims for MPs. 

In December 2014, Robertson along with six other male Conservative Party MPs voted against the Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill which would require all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries.

=== 5th parliament (2015–2017) ===
At the 2015 general election, Robertson was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 54.5% and an increased majority of 21,972 votes.

In March 2016, Robertson was accused of &quot;cash for access&quot; after it was reported that he sponsored a parliamentary pass for a lobbyist, Jennifer Bryant-Pearson, in 2014 whose company paid him £7,500 for consultancy advice in 2009 and 2010. Robertson was paid between £9,000 and £10,000 a year by the environmental services company Veolia, which is among Bryant-Pearson&#x27;s major clients. Robertson went onto clarify: &quot;I received and registered payments from Westminster Parliamentary Research, the last of which was received by me on 28th May 2010. Jennifer Bryant-Pearson held a Parliamentary pass through me from 6th January 2014 to 30th March 2015. There was therefore a gap of almost four years between the ending of my consultancy work with the company and her obtaining a pass&quot;. 

=== 6th parliament (2017–2019) ===

At the snap 2017 general election, Robertson was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 60% and an increased majority of 22,574 votes. 

In 2019, Robertson along with his colleagues, led a successful campaign to save Cheltenham&#x27;s Accident and Emergency Department from closure.

=== 7th parliament (2019–2024) ===
At the 2019 general election, Robertson was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 58.4% and a decreased majority of 22,410 votes.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cheltenham A&amp;E was temporarily closed. On 30 September 2020, Robertson brought the issue to light during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, asking the prime minister to ensure the return of the A&amp;E at Cheltenham General Hospital, to which the Prime Minister confirmed that the closure was a &quot;temporary measure&quot;.

In October 2020, Robertson spoke out against the IPSA proposed pay rise for Members of Parliament in a statement on his website.

Robertson began a job at the Betting and Gaming Council in October 2020 as the parliamentary advisor on sport and safer gambling. He is paid £2,000 for 10 hours of work a month, equivalent to £24,000 a year. He lost his Tewkesbury seat at the 2024 general election to the Liberal Democrat candidate, Cameron Thomas.

=== Northern Ireland ===
Robertson notes that although &quot;the events in the Province [Northern Ireland] didn&#x27;t immediately affect me, they had an impact on my thinking and ended up having an enormous influence on my career.&quot;

In Parliament, Robertson was Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee between 2010 and 2017. The committee contained 13 members, including members from the Conservative and Labour Parties, the DUP, UUP, and SDLP. During his time as chair, the subjects of the inquiries and reports included the Saville Inquiry (Bloody Sunday), the Letters of Comfort Inquiry, Corporation Tax, Banking, Leaving the EU and others.

Robertson was also Chairman of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly between 2012 and 2016. This group included MPs and Lords, as well as TDs and Senators, from both British and Irish Parliaments, as well as members of the devolved administrations.

In 2017, Robertson received a Metropolitan Police shield for his work championing IRA bomb victims. Robertson continues to lead calls for compensation to be given to victims of IRA attacks that used Libyan explosives.

Robertson created the All-party parliamentary group on the Union in September 2019 which seeks &quot;To promote the economic, social, cultural and constitutional benefits of the union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; To foster good relations between the four countries of the UK and their devolved administrations; and for connected purposes&quot;. He is chairman of the group.

=== Brexit ===
A strong Eurosceptic, Robertson campaigned for John Redwood in the Conservative leadership contest in 1995 and as of 2012 was active in the EU pressure group Better Off Out. He is a member of the pressure group The Freedom Association.

In mid-November 2018, following publication of the draft UK Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Robertson submitted to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee of the Conservative Party a letter confirming he had no confidence in the Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister Theresa May. Robertson became the first of a long list to confirm his letter, after the government announced details of its draft Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.

===Africa ===
Throughout his life, Robertson has had a particular interest in Africa.

He is a member of multiple All-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) for African nations, including: Chairman of the APPG for Ethiopia and Djibouti, Vice Chairman of the APPG for Angola and Vice Chairman of the APPG for Nigeria.

As Chairman of the APPG for Ethiopia, Robertson has worked with the Ethiopian Embassy, committing to further strengthen Ethio-UK relations in the UK.

=== UK–Africa trade ===

In October 2020, Robertson was appointed as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Trade Envoy to Angola and Zambia. Robertson is one of 29 trade envoys covering 67 markets who are appointed by the Prime Minister to promote trade and encourage investment within the UK. 

Before being appointed, Robertson led trade missions across the African continent. Notable trips include his missions to Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda and Ethiopia and Djibouti.

Outside of Parliament, Robertson is chairman of the Westminster Africa Business Group, who bring together both business and political activities across Africa to encourage trade relationships.

The group regularly hold events at the House of Commons, including lunches, receptions and other meeting attended by businesses, ministers, MPs, ambassadors and High Commissioners from both the UK and Africa.

<doc id="449390" wikidata="Q396287" url="?curid=449390" title="Encomienda">
<text>The encomienda () was a Spanish labour system that rewarded conquerors with the labour of conquered non-Christian peoples. In theory, the conquerors provided the labourers with benefits, including military protection and education. In practice, the conquered were subject to conditions that closely resembled instances of forced labour and slavery. The &quot;encomienda&quot; was first established in Spain following the Christian Reconquista, and it was applied on a much larger scale during the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the Spanish East Indies. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the Spanish monarch. The Crown awarded an &quot;encomienda&quot; as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the early sixteenth century, the grants were considered a monopoly on the labour of particular groups of indigenous peoples, held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the &quot;encomendero&quot;; starting from the New Laws of 1542, the encomienda ended upon the death of the &quot;encomendero&quot;, and was replaced by the repartimiento.

Encomiendas devolved from their original Iberian form into a form of communal slavery. In the &quot;encomienda&quot;, the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labour. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilising the assessed tribute and labour. In turn, &quot;encomenderos&quot; were to ensure that the &quot;encomienda&quot; natives were given instruction in Catholicism and the Spanish language, to protect them from warring tribes or pirates; to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. The natives provided tributes in the form of metals, maize, wheat, pork, and other agricultural products.

With the ousting of Christopher Columbus in 1500, the Spanish Crown had him replaced with Francisco de Bobadilla. Bobadilla was succeeded by a royal governor, Fray Nicolás de Ovando, who established the formal &quot;encomienda&quot; system. In many cases natives were forced to do hard labour and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted. However, Queen Isabella I of Castile forbade slavery of the native population and deemed the indigenous to be &quot;free vassals of the crown&quot;. Various versions of the Laws of the Indies from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the Real Audiencias for relief under the &quot;encomienda&quot; system.

&quot;Encomiendas&quot; have often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in New Spain, the &quot;encomienda&quot; ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives remained in their settlements with their families.

== History ==
The meaning of &quot;encomienda&quot; and &quot;encomendero&quot; stems from the Spanish verb &quot;encomendar&quot;, &quot;to entrust&quot;. The &quot;encomienda&quot; was based on the &quot;reconquista&quot; institution in which &quot;adelantados&quot; were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other peasants in areas that they had conquered and resettled.

The &quot;encomienda&quot; system traveled to America with the implantation of Castilian law in Spanish territories. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the &quot;reconquista&quot;. This system originated in the Catholic south of Spain to extract labour and tribute from Muslims (Moors) before they were exiled in 1492 after the Moorish defeat in the Granada War. It was a method of rewarding soldiers and moneymen who defeated the Moors. The &quot;encomienda&quot; established a system similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The &quot;encomienda&quot; system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The &quot;encomenderos&quot; did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the &quot;encomendero&quot;; native lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the New World belonged to this crown and not to the Catholic monarchs as a whole.

==&quot;Encomenderos&quot;==

The first grantees of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system, called &quot;encomenderos&quot;, were usually conquerors who received these grants of labour by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving &quot;encomiendas&quot; in New Spain (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the &quot;encomenderos&quot; of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of Hernán Cortés&#x27; original expedition, calling them &quot;first conquerors&quot;, and those who were members of the later Narváez expedition, calling them &quot;conquerors&quot;. The latter were incorporated into Cortes&#x27; contingent. Himmerich designated as &quot;pobladores antiguos&quot; (old settlers) a group of undetermined number of &quot;encomenderos&quot; in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.

In the New World, the Crown granted &quot;conquistadores&quot; as &quot;encomendero&quot;, which is the right to extract labour and tribute from natives who were under Spanish rule. The &quot;encomienda&quot; system was established on the island of Hispaniola by Nicolás de Ovando, the third governor of the Spanish colony, in 1502.

Some women and some indigenous elites were also &quot;encomenderos&quot;. Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of Marina and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father&#x27;s &quot;encomiendas&quot;. Two of Moctezuma&#x27;s daughters, Isabel Moctezuma and her younger sister, Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive &quot;encomiendas&quot; in perpetuity by Hernán Cortés. Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the &quot;encomiendas&quot; to her daughter by her second husband. Vassal Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted &quot;encomiendas&quot;.

The &quot;encomienda&quot; was essential to the Spanish crown&#x27;s sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil. Initially, the &quot;encomienda&quot; system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of Peru and Upper Peru. The &quot;encomienda&quot; lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.

Philip II enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the &quot;encomienda&quot; in the Philippines, where he made grants to the local nobles (&quot;principalía&quot;). They used the &quot;encomienda&quot; to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as Makati) continue to be owned by affluent families.

== Establishment ==
In 1501 Isabella I of Castile declared Native Americans as subjects to the Crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except under very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of &quot;encomiendas&quot;, since the &quot;encomienda&quot; bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown. In 1503, the crown began to formally grant &quot;encomiendas&quot; to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of &quot;encomiendas&quot; was aided by the crown&#x27;s organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as &quot;reducciones&quot;, with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each &quot;reducción&quot; had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the labourers in his community. The &quot;encomienda&quot; system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers&#x27; acquisition of land. As initially defined, the &quot;encomendero&quot; and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major Crown reform in 1542, known as the New Laws, &quot;encomendero&quot; families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the Crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the Crown, killing the viceroy, Blasco Núñez Vela.

In Mexico, viceroy Antonio de Mendoza decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, &quot;I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order.&quot; The &quot;encomienda&quot; system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The &quot;encomenderos&quot; were then required to pay remaining &quot;encomienda&quot; labourers for their work.

The &quot;encomiendas&quot; became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the &quot;adelantado&quot; of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion. Upon hearing this, the &quot;adelantado&quot; captured the &quot;caciques&quot; involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named Guarionex laid havoc to the countryside before an army of about 3,090 routed the Ciguana people under his leadership. Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders sought to join the Spanish forces. They helped the Spaniards deal with their ignorance of the surrounding environment.

As noted, the change of requiring the &quot;encomendado&quot; to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labour or power. According to the &quot;Codice Osuna&quot;, one of many colonial-era Aztec codices (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in Nahuatl, there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual &quot;encomenderos&quot; and those held by the Crown.

==Reform and abolition==
===Initial controversies===
The &quot;encomienda&quot; system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an Hispaniola &quot;encomendero&quot; named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno &quot;cacique&quot; Enriquillo rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, Emperor Charles V, realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of people labouring in the &quot;encomiendas&quot;. Conceding to Las Casas&#x27;s viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Taínos and the &quot;audiencia&quot; was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also actively prosecuted abuses of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system, through the Laws of Burgos (1512–13) and the New Laws of the Indies (1542).

The priest of Hispaniola and former &quot;encomendero&quot; Bartolomé de las Casas underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people. He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the &quot;encomienda&quot; system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an important debate, where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the &quot;encomienda&quot; system. The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the Viceroyalty of Peru. When Blasco Núñez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the &quot;encomienda&quot;, many of the &quot;encomenderos&quot; were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
When the news of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the New Laws were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, in 1542, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.

The liberation of thousands of Native Americans held in bondage throughout the Spanish empire by the new viceroy, Blasco Núñez Vela, on his journey to Peru, led to his eventual murder and armed conflict between the &quot;encomenderos&quot; and the Spanish crown which ended with the execution of those &quot;encomenderos&quot; involved.

===Final abolition===
In most of the Spanish domains acquired in the 16th century the &quot;encomienda&quot; phenomenon lasted only a few decades. However, in Peru and New Spain the &quot;encomienda&quot; institution lasted much longer.

In Chiloé Archipelago in southern Chile, where the &quot;encomienda&quot; had been abusive enough to unleash a revolt in 1712, the &quot;encomienda&quot; was abolished in 1782. In the rest of Chile it was abolished in 1789, and in the whole Spanish empire in 1791.

==&quot;Repartimiento&quot;==
The &quot;encomienda&quot; system was generally replaced by the crown-managed &quot;repartimiento&quot; system throughout Spanish America after mid-sixteenth century. Like the &quot;encomienda&quot;, the new &quot;repartimiento&quot; did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the Crown, who, through a local Crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The &quot;repartimiento&quot; was an attempt &quot;to reduce the abuses of forced labour&quot;. As the number of natives declined and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the hacienda, or large landed estates in which labourers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (&quot;hacendados&quot;), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labour.

==Deaths, disease, and genocide==
Raphael Lemkin (coiner of the term genocide) considered Spain&#x27;s abuses of the native population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright genocide, including the abuses of the &quot;encomienda&quot; system. He described slavery as &quot;cultural genocide par excellence&quot; noting &quot;it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocializing human beings&quot;. Economic historian Timothy J. Yeager argued the &quot;encomienda&quot; was deadlier than conventional slavery because of an individual labourer&#x27;s life being disposable in the face of simply being replaced with a labourer from the same plot of land. University of Hawaii historian David Stannard describes the &quot;encomienda&quot; as a genocidal system which &quot;had driven many millions of native peoples in Central and South America to early and agonizing deaths&quot;.

Yale University&#x27;s genocide studies program supports this view regarding abuses in Hispaniola. The program cites the decline of the Taíno population of Hispaniola in 1492 to 1514 as an example of genocide and notes that the indigenous population declined from a population between 100,000 and 1,000,000 to only 32,000, a decline of 68% to over 96%. Historian Andrés Reséndez contends that enslavement in gold and silver mines was the primary reason why the Native American population of Hispaniola dropped so significantly, as the conditions that native peoples were subjected to under enslavement, from forced relocation to hours of hard labour, contributed to the spread of disease. For example, according to anthropologist Jason Hickel, a third of Arawak workers died every six months from forced labour in the mines.

=== Denial toward accusations of genocide ===
Denial towards accusations of genocide linked to the &quot;encomienda&quot; and the Spanish conquest and settlement of the Americas typically involve arguments like those of Noble David Cook, who posits that accusations of genocide are a continuation of the Spanish Black Legend. Writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Americas, Cook wrote, &quot;There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact&quot; and instead suggests the near total decimation of the indigenous population of Hispaniola as mostly having been caused by diseases like smallpox. He argues that the Spanish unwittingly carried these diseases to the New World. However, there is growing evidence that purposefully infecting Indigenous populations was not an obscure policy, being attempted multiple times across the Americas. With the American Society of Microbiology stating that &quot;[the settlers demonstrated] depraved indifference, if not intentional genocide&quot;.

<text>Zakir Husain Khan (8 February 1897 – 3 May 1969) was an Indian educationist and politician who served as the vice president of India from 1962 to 1967 and president of India from 13 May 1967 until his death on 3 May 1969.

Born in Hyderabad in an Afridi Pashtun family, Husain completed his schooling in Etawah and went on to study at the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh and the University of Berlin from where he obtained a doctoral degree in economics. A close associate of Mahatma Gandhi, Husain was a founding member of the Jamia Millia Islamia which was established as an independent national university in response to the Non-cooperation movement. He served as the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor from 1926 to 1948. In 1937, Husain chaired the Basic National Education Committee which framed a new educational policy known as Nai Talim which emphasized free and compulsory education in the first language. He was opposed to the policy of separate electorates for Muslims and, in 1946, the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah vetoed a proposal by the Indian National Congress to include Husain in the Interim Government of India.

Following Independence and the Partition of India Husain stayed on in India and, in 1948, was appointed Vice Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which he helped retain as a national institution of higher learning. For his services to education, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1954 and was made a nominated member of the Indian Parliament during 1952 to 1957. Husain served as Governor of Bihar from 1957 to 1962 and was elected the Vice President of India in 1962. The following year, he was conferred the Bharat Ratna. He was elected president in 1967, succeeding Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and became the first Muslim to hold the highest constitutional office in India. He was also the first incumbent to die in office and had the shortest tenure of any Indian president. His mazar lies in the campus of the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi.

An author and translator of several books into Urdu and a prolific writer of children&#x27;s books, Husain has been commemorated in India through postage stamps and several educational institutions, libraries, roads and Asia&#x27;s largest rose garden that have been named after him.

Husain was born in Hyderabad in 1897 and was of Afridi Pashtun descent, his forefathers having settled in the town of Qaimganj in the Farrukhabad district of modern Uttar Pradesh. His father, Fida Husain Khan, moved to the Deccan and established a successful legal career in Hyderabad where he settled in 1892. Husain was the third of seven sons of Fida Khan and Naznin Begum. He was homeschooled in the Quran, Persian and Urdu and is thought that he had his primary school education at the Sultan Bazaar school in Hyderabad. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1907 Husain&#x27;s family shifted back to Qaimganj and he was enrolled at the Islamia High School in Etawah. Husain&#x27;s mother and several members of his extended family died in a plague epidemic in 1911. 

Having matriculated in 1913, he joined the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh and later, in preparation for a medical degree, at the Lucknow Christian College enrolling for a Bachelor of Science degree. A bout of illness led to him having to discontinue his studies and a year later he rejoined the college at Aligarh. Husain graduated in 1918 with philosophy, English literature and economics. He was elected vice president of the college&#x27;s students&#x27; union and won prizes for his debating skills. Husain pursued the disciplines of law and economics for his post-graduate studies. Having obtained his master&#x27;s degree in 1920, he was appointed as a lecturer at the college.

In 1915, while still pursuing his graduation, Husain married Shahjahan Begum with whom he had two daughters, Sayeeda Khan and Safia Rahman. Safia married Zil-ur-Rahman, a professor of physics at the Aligarh Muslim University while Sayeeda married Khurshed Alam Khan who served as a Union Minister and Governor. Their son Salman Khurshid became India&#x27;s External Affairs Minister in 2012.

Of Husain&#x27;s six brothers, Yusuf Husain became a historian and a winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award who served as Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University. Mahmud Husain was closely associated with the Pakistan Movement, becoming Minister of Education in the Government of Pakistan and Vice-Chancellor at Dhaka and Karachi Universities. His nephew, General Rahimuddin Khan went on to become Pakistan&#x27;s Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and later Governor of Balochistan and Sindh. Masud Husain, the nephew from his eldest brother, became Professor Emeritus in Social Sciences at the Aligarh Muslim University and later Vice Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia.

==Career==
===Sheikh-ul-Jamia, Jamia Millia Islamia (1926–1948)===
In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi visited the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh where he urged non-cooperation with the British Raj. In response to Gandhi&#x27;s appeal, a group of students and faculty joined the Non-Cooperation Movement. In October 1920 they established the Independent National University aimed at imparting education free from colonial influence. Later renamed the Jamia Millia Islamia, it shifted in 1925 from Aligarh to Delhi. Husain was one of the founders of this private university which had Maulana Muhammad Ali as its first &quot;Sheikh-ul-Jamia&quot; (vice-chancellor) and Hakim Ajmal Khan as the first &quot;Amir-i-Jamia&quot; (chancellor). Jamia, as the Turkish educationist Halide Edib noted, had two purposes: &quot;First, to train the Muslim youth with definite ideas of their rights and duties as Indian citizens. Second, to coordinate Islamic thought and behaviour with Hindu. The general aim is to create a harmonious nationhood without Muslims losing their Islamic identity. In its aim, if not always in its procedure, it is nearer to Gandhian Movement than any other Islamic institution I have come across.&quot; In its early years, Jamia faced shortage of funds and its continued existence was uncertain especially after the Non-Cooperation Movement and the Khilafat Committee closed down.

Husain left for Germany in 1922 to do a doctorate in economics from the University of Berlin. Supervised by Werner Sombart, his thesis on the agrarian structure in British India was accepted summa cum laude in 1926. During his time in Berlin, Husain collaborated with Alfred Ehrenreich to translate into German thirty-three of Gandhi&#x27;s speeches which were published in 1924 as &quot;Die Botschaft des Mahatma Gandhi&quot;. Husain got published the &quot;Diwan-e-Ghalib&quot; in 1925 and the &quot;Diwan-i-Shaida&quot;, a collection of poetry by Hakim Ajmal Khan in 1926. He returned to India in 1926 and succeeded Abdul Majeed Khwaja as &quot;Sheikh-ul-Jamia&quot;. He was joined by Mohammad Mujeeb and Abid Hussain – the latter becoming the university registrar. Husain travelled across India soliciting funds for the Jamia and got financial support from Mahatma Gandhi, the Bombay philanthropist Seth Jamal Mohammed, Khwaja Abdul Hamied the founder of the pharmaceutical firm Cipla and the Nizam of Hyderabad among others.

In 1928, a National Education Society was established to manage the affairs of the Jamia. Zakir Husain became its secretary. To be a life member of the society, members pledged their services to it for 20 years with a salary that could not exceed Rs.150. Husain was one of the 11 initial members who took the pledge. The society adopted a constitution for the university which stipulated that the Jamia would neither seek nor accept any help from the colonial administration, and that it would treat all religions impartially. Husain himself identified the aim of the Jamia as being to &quot;keep alive Islamic culture and education and also help in the realization of the ideal of a common nationhood and the achievement of the freedom of the country […] [and that] the Jamia&#x27;s objectives are Islamic education, the love of independence and service to Urdu&quot;.

Husain remained the Jamia&#x27;s vice chancellor until 1948. In the 1940s he built his home, the Zakir Manzil, on the Gulmohar Avenue in Jamia Nagar. Husain was opposed to the policy of separate electorates for Muslims and was a political opponent of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, who vetoed the Congress proposal to include Husain as a member of the Interim Government in 1946. Husain however convinced Jinnah to attend the Jamia&#x27;s silver jubilee celebration on 17 November 1946. At a time of rising animosity between the Congress and the Muslim League and worsening inter-communal relations, the celebration was attended by Jinnah, his sister Fatima and Liaquat Ali Khan from the Muslim League and Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Azad and C. Rajagopalachari of the Congress. In a plea to the assembled leaders, Husain said

&quot;You, gentlemen, are the stars of the political firmament. You have a secure place in the hearts of millions of people. Taking advantage of your presence here, I wish to submit in great sorrow a few words for your consideration on behalf of the educational workers. The fire of hatred is fast spreading which makes it seem mad to tend to the garden of education. This fire is burning in a noble and humane land. How will the flowers of nobility and sensibility grow in its midst? How will we be able to improve human standards which lie today at a level far lower than that of the beasts? How shall we produce new servants devoted to the cause of education? How can you protect humanity in a world of animals? ... . An Indian poet has remarked that every child who comes to this world brings along the message that God has not yet lost faith in man. But have our countrymen so completely lost faith in themselves that they wish to crush these innocent buds before they blossom?

For God&#x27;s sake sit together and extinguish this fire of hatred. This is not the time to ask who is responsible for it and what is its cause. The fire is raging. Please extinguish it. For God&#x27;s sake do not allow the very foundations of civilised life in this country to be destroyed.&quot; 

=== Basic National Education Committee (1937)===
In October 1937, an All-India National Education Conference was held at Wardha under Mahatma Gandhi which sought to establish a policy for basic education in India. The conference appointed a Basic National Education chaired by Husain (also known as the Zakir Husain committee) which was tasked with preparing the detailed scheme and syllabus for this policy. The committee submitted its report in December 1937 and formulated the Wardha Scheme of Basic National Education or Nai Talim. 
The policy, inter alia, proposed teaching craft work in schools, instilling ideals of citizenship, and its establishment as a self-supporting scheme. It proposed seven years of free and compulsory basic education in the mother tongue, the teaching of crafts, music and drawing and learning the Hindustani language. It also proposed a comprehensive plan for the training of teachers and framed its curriculum.

The Congress party in its Haripura session of 1938 accepted the scheme and sought to implement it nationwide. An All-India Education Board (the Hindustani Talimi Sangh) was established to implement the scheme under Husain and E.W. Aryanayakam with Gandhi as its overall supervisor. Husain remained the President of the Hindustani Talimi Sangh from 1938 to 1950 when he was succeeded by Kaka Kalelkar. The scheme was wholly opposed by the Muslim League which saw the scheme as an attempt to gradually destroy Muslim culture in India and the focus on Hindustani language as a ploy to replace Urdu with Sanskritized Hindi. The Congress party&#x27;s argument that the scheme had been formulated by Husain was rejected by the Muslim League in its Patna session of 1939 where it declared that &quot;the mere fact that the Principal of Jamia Millia at Delhi has taken a prominent part in the preparation of the scheme does not prove that it is not unsuited to the Muslims&quot;. India&#x27;s National Policy on Education of 1968, 1988 and 2020 all draw on the ideas contained in the Wardha Scheme of Basic National Education.

Following the Partition of India, Husain was almost killed in communal violence at the Jalandhar railway station while he was on his way to Kashmir – an experience he described twelve years later to his friend Abdul Majid Daryabadi. On his return to Delhi, Husain worked to help the victims of rioting in Delhi. The Jamia Millia Islamia&#x27;s buildings at Karol Bagh were looted and destroyed in the violence in Delhi.

===Vice-Chancellor, Aligarh Muslim University (1948–1956)===
Husain was appointed Vice Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University in 1948, succeeding Nawab Ismail Khan. The university had been closely associated with the Pakistan Movement and had been a stronghold of the Muslim League. It was therefore perceived as a center of pro-Pakistan feeling and a threat to secular India. Maulana Azad, the Union Minister of Education, tasked Husain with leading the university so that it could be retained as a national institution of higher education.
Husain, who had served as a member of the Universities Commission between December 1948 and August 1949 however took regular charge only in early 1950 as he was incapacitated following a heart attack in October 1949. He set to work, attempting to dissociate the university from its past association with the Muslim League and restoring school discipline. Students released from prison for involvement in Communist activism were readmitted and socialists and communists from across North India took up the vacancies created by the departure of Muslim nationalists for Pakistan. Husain also filled up vacant faculty positions with eminent academicians. 
In 1951, Parliament enacted the Aligarh Muslim University (Amendment) Act which converted the university from a private, aided university to an autonomous institution of the Government of India, fully maintained by it. This ensured stability in the university&#x27;s finances while also allowing it autonomy in governance. By the end of his tenure, Husain had turned around the fortunes of the university, helping it overcome the uncertainty it faced in independent India and become a national institution under the patronage of the Government of India.

Husain served as a nominated Member of the Rajya Sabha from 3 April 1952 to 2 April 1956 and was renominated in 1956, serving until his resignation on 6 July 1957 following his appointment as the Governor of Bihar. For his services in the areas of culture and education Husain was conferred the Padma Vibhushan in 1954. Throughout the 1950s he was associated with various organizations working in the field of education. He was chairman, India Committee, International Students Service (1955), the World University Service, Geneva during 1955–57 and was a member of the Central Board of Secondary Education (1957). He served on the executive board of the UNESCO during 1957–58.

=== Governor of Bihar (1957–1962) ===
Husain was the Governor of Bihar from 6 July 1957 to 11 May 1962. Contrary to the advice of the then Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Krishna Sinha, Governor Husain, who was also Chancellor of Patna University reappointed for a second term its serving Vice-Chancellor. In response, the state government considered amending the law to require the governor to appoint a vice-chancellor as advised by the chief minister. Husain however threatened to resign rather than assent to such an amendment forcing the government to drop its plans. In later appointments made as Vice-Chancellors of other state universities in Bihar, Husain accepted the advice of the Chief Minister in the exercise of his powers as Chancellor and acted accordingly although he was opposed to the appointment of non-academicians as vice chancellors to universities.

=== Vice President of India (1962–1967) ===
On 14 April 1962, the Congress party chose Husain to be its candidate for the upcoming election to the office of the Vice President of India. The election was held on 7 May 1962, and votes counted the same day. Husain won 568 of 596 votes cast while his only rival N. C. Samantsinhar won 14 votes. He was sworn in as vice president on 13 May 1962.

In 1962, Husain was nominated the Vice President of the Sahitya Akademi – a post held by his predecessor S. Radhakrishnan before his election as President of India. The following year, he was awarded the Bharat Ratna. In 1965 he served briefly as the acting president when President Radhakrishnan left for the United Kingdom to undergo treatment for cataract. It was during his acting presidency that President&#x27;s rule was reimposed in Kerala after elections held there the previous month failed to give any party a majority and efforts by the Governor to facilitate the formation of a government collapsed.

As ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Husain gave rulings clarifying that Union ministers were entitled to speak in either house of parliament and that a sitting member of parliament who had been appointed as a Minister in a State would not be debarred from attending Parliament or voting in its debates until the member had been elected to the state legislature. In 1966, he ruled that parliamentary immunity from arrest would be limited to only civil cases and would not apply to criminal proceedings initiated against members.

=== President of India (1967–1969) ===

Husain was chosen as the Congress party&#x27;s candidate to succeed Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan as the President of India in the presidential election of 1967. There was a lack of enthusiasm for the candidature of Husain within the party, but Prime Minister Indira Gandhi chose to nominate him as the party candidate over objections raised by K. Kamaraj, the party president, and other senior members of her cabinet. A coalition of seven opposition parties got the sitting Chief Justice of India, Koka Subbarao to resign his post and contest the election as their joint candidate. Unlike the three previous presidential elections, the election of 1967 proved to be a real contest between the various candidates. The campaign was marred by communal rhetoric and accusations of sectarianism being made against Husain by the Jana Sangh party. There was also speculation that Husain would lose on account of cross voting against him by Congress legislators, an outcome which would have forced the Prime Minister to resign.

There were 17 candidates in the fray for the election held on 6 May 1967. Of these, nine failed to win any vote. Husain won 4,71,244 votes against the 3,63,971 received by Subbarao. The margin of 1,07,273 votes was much larger than what was expected by the Congress party with Husain winning the most votes in Parliament and in twelve state legislatures including three where the Congress Party sat in the opposition. The results of the presidential election, coming after the general elections of 1967 where the Congress party had suffered severe setbacks, were seen as strengthening Prime Minister Gandhi. Husain was declared elected on 9 May 1967. His election as president was seen domestically as the Congress Party&#x27;s attempt to reach out to the Muslims of India who had voted against it in the general elections and globally as burnishing India&#x27;s claim of being a secular nation.

Husain was sworn in on 13 May 1967. In a memorable inaugural address, while dedicating himself to the service of the Indian nation and its civilization, Husain said The whole of Bharat is my home and its people are my family. The people have chosen to make me the head of this family for a certain time. It shall be my earnest endeavour to seek to make this home strong and beautiful, a worthy home for a great people engaged in the fascinating task of building up a just and prosperous and graceful life.

Husain was the first Muslim and the first governor of a state to be elected President of India. Husain&#x27;s election was challenged before the Supreme Court of India on the grounds that the result of the election had been affected by undue influence exerted by the Prime Minister. The election petition filed by Baburao Patel was however dismissed by the court. During his presidential tenure, Husain led state visits to Canada, Hungary, Yugoslavia, USSR and Nepal. Husain, who had an interest in roses, is credited with having introduced several new varieties in the Mughal Gardens of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and building a glass conservatory for its collection of succulents.

=== Author ===
Husain wrote extensively in Urdu and also translated several books into that language. His translations include Friedrich List&#x27;s &quot;National System of Economics&quot;, Edwin Cannan&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Economics&quot; and Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. He also wrote extensively on education in books such as &quot;Aala Taleem&quot;, &quot;Hindustan me Taleem ki az Sar-E-Nau Tanzeem&quot;, &quot;Qaumi Taleem&quot; and &quot;Taleemi Khutbat&quot; and on Urdu poets Altaf Hussain Hali in &quot;Hali: Muhibb-e-Wata&quot;n and Mirza Ghalib in &quot;Intikhab-e-Ghalib&quot;. Husain wrote several stories for children which he published under a nom de plume. These include &quot;Uqab aur Doosri Kahaniyan&quot; and stories translated into English and published under The Magic Key series by Zubaan Books. &quot;Capitalism: An Essay in Understanding&quot; is a series of lectures he delivered at the Delhi University in 1946. His convocation addresses were published in 1965 as &quot;The Dynamic University&quot;. As President of India, Husain headed a committee to celebrate the Ghalib Centenary in 1969 which recommended the establishment of the Ghalib Institute as a memorial to Ghalib whereas the Ghalib Academy in Delhi was inaugurated by Husain in 1969.

==Death and legacy==

Husain, who had suffered a mild heart attack earlier in the year, was unwell after returning to Delhi from a tour of Assam on 26 April 1969. He died in the Rashtrapati Bhavan on 3 May 1969 of a heart attack. Vice President V. V. Giri was sworn in as acting president the same day. The Government of India declared thirteen days of national mourning. His body lay in state in the Durbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan where an estimated 200,000 people paid their tributes. The funeral was held on 5 May 1969. He is buried in the university campus of the Jamia Millia Islamia where his body was taken in a gun carriage in a ceremonial funeral procession, after the janaza prayers and the national salute being offered at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The United Arab Republic, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Nepal, Bhutan and Trinidad and Tobago all declared several days&#x27; of mourning. Husain&#x27;s death was mourned in Pakistan as well where flags flew at half mast on the day of his funeral. Pakistan&#x27;s President Yahya Khan sent the Chief of Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator Air Marshal Malik Nur Khan as his personal representative to the funeral. George Romney, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, represented President Nixon and the United States whereas the Soviet Union was represented by its Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin. The Prime Ministers of Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Nepal too attended the funeral. Up to a million people are thought to have lined the streets as the funeral cortege made its way to the burial ground. Husain was the first President to die in office and has served the shortest tenure in office.

Husain&#x27;s tomb was built in 1971 and was designed by Habib Rahman. Its architecture reflects the influence of Bauhaus aesthetics on traditional Indian styles as seen in its eight curved, reinforced concrete walls topped by rough cut marble which have been inspired by Tughluq tombs. These tapering walls stand along a square plan to form an open structure topped by a shallow dome. The tomb has no ornamentation but features jalis and arches. The graves of Husain and his wife lie under the dome of the tomb.

=== Commemoration===
Commemorative postage stamps on Husain were issued by India Post in 1969 and 1998. 
&quot;A Rose Called Zakir Husain – A Life of Dedication&quot; is a 1969 documentary film on the life of Husain produced by the Films Division of India. In 1975 the Delhi College, a constituent college of the Delhi University, was renamed the Zakir Husain Delhi College. The Zakir Husain Centre for Educational Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and the Dr. Zakir Husain Central Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia are also named after him. Delhi&#x27;s Wellesley Road was renamed the Dr. Zakir Husain Marg. The Zakir Hussain Rose Garden in Chandigarh, which is Asia&#x27;s largest rose garden, is also named after Husain. &quot;Dr. Zakir Hussain – Teacher who became President&quot;, a book on Husain by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, was released in 2000.

<doc id="449400" wikidata="Q468752" url="?curid=449400" title="Taishi Ci">
<text>Taishi Ci () (166–206), courtesy name Ziyi, was a Chinese military general who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He had served as a minor Han official, before eventually coming to serve warlords Liu Yao, Sun Ce, and Sun Ce&#x27;s successor Sun Quan.

A native of Donglai Commandery, he started his career as a minor official in the local commandery office. In 186, at the age of 20, he became famous after successfully completing a mission to prevent a letter from the provincial administration from reaching the imperial court in Luoyang first. However, out of fear that the provincial administration would take revenge against him, he went into hiding in Liaodong. After returning from Liaodong, he travelled to Beihai (around present-day Weifang, Shandong) to rescue the warlord Kong Rong, who was besieged by Yellow Turban rebels. By resorting to trickery, he managed to break out of the siege and seek aid from another warlord, Liu Bei. The siege was lifted when Taishi Ci returned to Beihai with reinforcements from Liu Bei. Taishi Ci travelled to Yang Province later to join the warlord Liu Yao, an old acquaintance of his. He fought for Liu Yao in the war between Liu Yao and Sun Ce, once engaging Sun Ce in a one-on-one fight. Following Liu Yao&#x27;s defeat and death, Taishi Ci headed to Jing County (north of present-day Jing County, Anhui) and tried to establish his own power base there. However, he was eventually defeated and captured by Sun Ce&#x27;s forces. Touched by Sun Ce&#x27;s sincerity and generosity towards him, Taishi Ci agreed to serve Sun Ce and even helped to persuade many former followers of Liu Yao to join Sun Ce as well. Sun Ce appointed him as a Commandant and put him in charge of security around Jianchang County (present-day Fengxin County, Jiangxi). During this time, he drove back Liu Pan (劉磐) and his men, who often raided Sun Ce&#x27;s territories in that area. After Sun Ce&#x27;s death, Taishi Ci continued serving under Sun Ce&#x27;s successor, Sun Quan. Sun Quan deeply mourned Taishi Ci when the latter died in 206.

Taishi Ci&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;) described him as seven &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately 178–182 cm) and having a shiny and beautiful beard. He was famous for his archery skills.

==Early career in Donglai Commandery==
Taishi Ci was from Huang County (黃縣), Donglai Commandery (東萊郡), which is in present-day Longkou, Shandong. As a youth, he was known for being studious. He served as a &quot;zoucaoshi&quot; (奏曹史; a minor official) in the local commandery office. Around 186, the commandery administration had a dispute with their superiors, the provincial administration of Qing Province. Both sides wrote to the imperial court in the capital Luoyang to complain about each other. At the time, since the imperial court often made decisions on a first-come, first-served basis, it meant that the court would tend to rule in favour of the party whose document it received first. Since the provincial administration had already sent a courier to deliver their complaint letter, the Administrator (太守) of Donglai Commandery began to feel anxious and started looking for someone to help him deliver his letter. Taishi Ci, then 20 years old, was chosen for the task.

When Taishi Ci finally reached Luoyang after travelling day and night, he saw the provincial administration&#x27;s courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, &quot;Sir, are you delivering a document?&quot; The courier replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; Taishi Ci asked again, &quot;Where is the document?&quot; The courier replied, &quot;In the carriage.&quot; Taishi Ci said, &quot;Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee&#x27;s details on the document? Let me see it.&quot; The courier did not know that Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, &quot;This man destroyed my document!&quot; Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t show me the document, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. I suggest we remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed.&quot; The courier asked, &quot;Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so I suggest we escape together.&quot; The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.

After leaving Luoyang, Taishi Ci secretly returned later and delivered the commandery administration&#x27;s letter to the imperial court. When the provincial administration of Qing Province found out, they sent another letter to the central government again. However, as the second letter contained some discrepancies, the imperial court ruled against the provincial administration in the dispute. Taishi Ci became famous after this incident. However, out of fear that the provincial administration would take revenge against him, he fled from Donglai Commandery and took shelter in Liaodong.

==Saving Kong Rong from the siege of Duchang==
Kong Rong, the Chancellor (相) of Beihai State (北海國; around present-day Weifang, Shandong), heard about Taishi Ci and regarded him as an extraordinary talent. He sent his subordinates to visit Taishi Ci&#x27;s mother on multiple occasions and passed her many gifts. In the late 180s or early 190s, when Beihai came under attack by Yellow Turban rebels, Kong Rong led his troops to a fortress at Duchang (都昌; in present-day Weifang, Shandong). The rebels, led by Guan Hai (管亥), besieged the Duchang fortress. After Taishi Ci returned from Liaodong, his mother told him, &quot;You haven&#x27;t met Kong Rong. He treated me very generously – almost like an old friend – while you were away. Now that he is in trouble, you should quickly go to help him.&quot; Three days later, Taishi Ci travelled alone on foot to Duchang.

At the time, the rebels had yet to completely surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong to let him lead soldiers to fight their way out, but Kong refused and insisted on waiting for reinforcements. The rebels came closer day by day. Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國), but no one had any idea on how to break out of the siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, &quot;The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are.&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won&#x27;t hesitate any longer.&quot; Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.

Taishi Ci packed his equipment and had a full meal. At dawn, he brought his bow and a quiver of arrows with him, and rode out of the fortress. He was accompanied by two riders, each carrying a target stand for archery practice. When the rebels saw Taishi Ci coming out of the fortress, they immediately readied themselves for battle. To their surprise, Taishi Ci took the two stands, placed them in the ditch around the fortress, fired some arrows at them, and then returned to the fortress. The following day, he repeated the entire process. Some of the rebels stood up and prepared for battle upon seeing him, while others ignored him and remained relaxed. On the third day, when Taishi Ci came out again, the rebels thought that he was going to practise archery again, so they paid no attention to him. Taishi Ci then seized the opportunity to break out of the siege. By the time the rebels realised what was going on, Taishi Ci had already escaped and killed several rebels along the way. None of them dared to pursue him.

When Taishi Ci arrived at Pingyuan, he told Liu Bei, &quot;I, (Taishi) Ci, am a commoner from Donglai. I am neither a relative nor an acquaintance of Kong Rong. But I have heard of him and we not only share similar beliefs, but also experienced difficult times together. Now, Guan Hai and the rebels have besieged Kong Rong; he is desperately in need of help. You are known for your kindness, righteousness, and willingness to help those in need. Kong Rong admires you and has placed his hopes in you, hence he sent me to fight my way out of the siege to seek help from you. Only you can save him.&quot; Liu Bei&#x27;s facial expression turned serious and he said, &quot;So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!&quot; He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, &quot;You are a young friend of mine.&quot; When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, &quot;I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong&#x27;s kindness in this way.&quot;

==Coming to serve Sun Ce==
Liu Yao, the Inspector (刺史) of Yang Province, was not only also from Donglai Commandery like Taishi Ci, but also an old acquaintance of Taishi Ci. Taishi Ci had not met Liu Yao since his return from Liaodong, so he crossed the Yangtze River and travelled to Qu&#x27;e County (曲阿縣; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) to find Liu Yao. Before he left, the warlord Sun Ce led his forces to attack Liu Yao&#x27;s territories. Someone advised Liu Yao to appoint Taishi Ci as a general to lead his troops to counter Sun Ce, but Liu Yao said, &quot;If I appoint Taishi Ci, Xu Zijiang will laugh at me.&quot; He then sent Taishi Ci on a reconnaissance mission to assess the strength of Sun Ce&#x27;s forces.

Taishi Ci, accompanied by only a single horseman, encountered Sun Ce at Shen Village (神亭; somewhere in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) during his mission. Sun Ce had 13 other men with him, including Han Dang, Song Qian and Huang Gai. Taishi Ci rode forth and engaged Sun Ce in battle. Sun Ce thrust his spear at Taishi Ci&#x27;s horse and managed to grab the handheld &quot;ji&quot; that Taishi carried on his back. Taishi Ci, on the other hand, managed to get hold of Sun Ce&#x27;s helmet. Their fight was broken up when their respective subordinates showed up.

After Liu Yao was defeated by Sun Ce subsequently in battle, Taishi Ci originally planned to accompany Liu Yao as he fled to Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) for shelter. However, Taishi Ci went into hiding in the hills at Wuhu County (蕪湖縣; east of present-day Wuhu, Anhui) and declared himself the Administrator (太守) of Danyang Commandery (丹楊郡). By then, Sun Ce had conquered the territories east of Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui); only the six counties west of Jing County (涇縣; north of present-day Jing County, Anhui) remained outside of Sun Ce&#x27;s control. Taishi Ci headed to Jing County, where he established a base and managed to recruit the Shanyue people to join him. Sun Ce personally led his forces to attack Taishi Ci, defeated him in battle, and captured him. Later, he released Taishi Ci from his bonds, held his hand and asked, &quot;Do you still remember our fight at Shen Village? What would you do if you captured me?&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t be certain about this.&quot; Sun Ce laughed and said, &quot;I shall manage the present-day affairs of the state together with you from this moment onwards.&quot;

Sun Ce asked Taishi Ci, &quot;In the past, you helped your commandery&#x27;s administrator destroy a letter from the provincial administration, saved Wenju (Kong Rong) from danger, and successfully obtained reinforcements from Xuande (Liu Bei). These are all acts of heroism. You are one of the most intelligent people in this world, yet you haven&#x27;t found someone who appreciates your talent. The ancients could forget about &quot;she gou zhan qu&quot;. I am someone who appreciates you. You don&#x27;t need to worry that you will feel unhappy if you join me.&quot; Sun Ce also said, &quot;If a dragon wishes to soar into the sky, it has to take off from a piece of wood.&quot;

===Alternative account in the &quot;Wu Li&quot;===
The &quot;Wu Li&quot; (吳歷) provided a different account of how Taishi Ci came to serve Sun Ce. It mentioned that Taishi Ci was defeated and captured by Sun Ce after their fight at Shen Village. Sun Ce had heard of Taishi Ci before so he released Taishi Ci from his bonds and asked him for advice on his future conquests. Taishi Ci replied, &quot;I am an officer of a defeated army. I am not qualified to speak on such matters.&quot; Sun Ce said, &quot;In the past, Han Xin heeded advice from Guangwu. In the present, I seek advice from a man of righteousness. What are you talking about?&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;My army has recently been defeated. The troops are scattered and low on morale. It may be difficult, but I still intend to gather and bring them together. I am afraid this is not what you wish to see.&quot; Sun Ce knelt down and said, &quot;What I want is your sincerity. I hope you will return by midday tomorrow.&quot; When Sun Ce&#x27;s subordinates raised doubts about Taishi Ci&#x27;s loyalty, Sun Ce said, &quot;Taishi Ziyi is a famous man from Qing Province. He is known for keeping his promises. I believe he will not deceive me.&quot; The following day, Sun Ce hosted a banquet and had a pole erected in the middle, so as to keep track of time by observing its shadow. By midday, when the shadow was shortest, Taishi Ci returned as promised. Sun Ce was overjoyed. He often consulted Taishi Ci on military affairs later on.

Pei Songzhi, who added the &quot;Wu Li&quot; account as an annotation to Taishi Ci&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, noted that the &quot;Wu Li&quot; account deviated significantly from what was recorded in Taishi Ci&#x27;s &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; biography. He suspected that there was a mistake.

==Persuading Liu Yao&#x27;s followers to surrender to Sun Ce==
After returning to his base in Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), Sun Ce commissioned Taishi Ci as a &quot;General of the Household Who Breaks Waves&quot; (折衝中郎將). Although Liu Yao had already died in Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi) in 195, there were still thousands of his former followers scattered around the area. Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci to persuade them to surrender.

Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, &quot;In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me for helping Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn&#x27;t have good intentions and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had control over the thousands of troops which used to be under my father&#x27;s command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I had no choice but to submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father&#x27;s troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn&#x27;t listen. That was when I decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don&#x27;t know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao&#x27;s former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don&#x27;t, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu&#x27;s defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish.&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don&#x27;t need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient.&quot;

Sun Ce&#x27;s aides cautioned him, &quot;(Taishi) Ci will not come back if he leaves.&quot; However, Sun Ce said, &quot;If Ziyi abandons me, who else can he turn to?&quot; He personally saw Taishi Ci off, held his hand and asked, &quot;When will you return?&quot; Taishi Ci replied, &quot;Not more than 60 days.&quot; He kept his word and returned within 60 days.

When Sun Ce sent Taishi Ci to persuade Liu Yao&#x27;s followers to surrender, many of Sun Ce&#x27;s aides felt that Taishi Ci could not be trusted. They believed that Taishi Ci would defect to either Hua Xin or Huang Zu. However, Sun Ce said, &quot;All of you are wrong. I trust my judgment. Taishi Ci may be brave and headstrong, but he is not an impulsive person. He is a man of exemplary character and a man who keeps his word. I treat him like a close friend and will not betray him. All of you don&#x27;t need to worry.&quot; Sun Ce&#x27;s aides only trusted Taishi Ci after he kept his promise and returned from Yuzhang Commandery. When Taishi Ci met Sun Ce again, he said, &quot;Hua Ziyu is a man of virtue, but not a talented leader. He has no grand plan; he only wants to preserve the status quo. Tong Zhi (僮芝) from Danyang lied that he has been appointed as the Administrator of Luling and has taken control of the commandery. The local clans in Poyang have formed their own ruling body and driven away the officials sent by Hua Ziyu to govern the area. Hua Ziyu is unable to control Luling and Poyang. Moreover, about 5,000 to 6,000 local clans in Haihun (海昏) have formed their own ruling body too and rejected control by the commandery administration. Hua Ziyu can do nothing about this.&quot; Sun Ce clapped his hands and laughed. Later on, he pacified Yuzhang Commandery and successfully induced Hua Xin to surrender to him.

==Service under the Sun family==
Liu Pan (劉磐), a nephew of Jing Province&#x27;s governor Liu Biao, often led his troops to raid Sun Ce&#x27;s territories in Ai County (艾縣; west of present-day Xiushui County, Jiangxi), Xi&#x27;an County (西安縣; present-day Putian District, Wuning County, Jiangxi) and the nearby counties. Sun Ce created a commandery composed of Haihun County (海昏縣; present-day Xiangshan Town, Xinjian District, Nanchang, Jiangxi), Jianchang County (建昌縣; present-day Fengxin County, Jiangxi) and six other counties, and appointed Taishi Ci as its Commandant (都尉), with the administrative centre at Haihun County. Taishi Ci led troops from these counties to drive back Liu Pan. Liu Pan stopped his raids after that.

Taishi Ci was famous for his archery skills. There was one notable incident when he accompanied Sun Ce to attack rebels in Mabao (麻保). The rebel leader stood at the viewing platform above the gate, with his hand resting against a wooden pillar, and hurled verbal abuse at Sun Ce. Taishi Ci took aim and fired an arrow at him. The arrow pierced through both the pillar and the rebel&#x27;s hand. Everyone was awed by Taishi Ci&#x27;s skill. When the warlord Cao Cao heard about Taishi Ci, he wrote a letter to him and put it inside a box containing a few pieces of &quot;danggui&quot;.

Sun Ce died in 200 CE and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan. When Sun Quan came to power, he continued to put Taishi Ci in charge of security in the areas around Haihun County because he knew that Taishi Ci was capable of deterring Liu Pan.

==Death==
Taishi Ci died in 206 at the age of 41 (by East Asian age reckoning). Before his death, he sighed and said, &quot;A man living in this world should aspire to carry a seven &quot;chi&quot;-long sword and rise to the position of a Son of Heaven. Now, I have yet to realise my ambition. How unfortunate that I am going to die soon!&quot; Sun Quan deeply mourned Taishi Ci&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Taishi Ci had a son, Taishi Xiang (太史享), whose courtesy name was &quot;Yuanfu&quot; (元復). Taishi Xiang served in Eastern Wu and held the appointments of Colonel of Yue Cavalry (越騎校尉), Imperial Secretary (尚書), and Administrator (太守) of Wu Commandery.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Taishi Ci&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on Taishi Ci as follows: &quot;Taishi Ci was loyal, righteous, trustworthy and upright. He possessed traits of ancient sages.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Taishi Ci appears as a character in the 14th century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; by Luo Guanzhong. His death was exaggerated for dramatic effect in Chapter 53 of the novel&#x27;s version of the Battle of Hefei (208).

==In popular culture==
Taishi Ci is featured as a playable character in the video game series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; by Koei.

Taishi Ci appears in the 2007 anime &quot;Kōtetsu Sangokushi&quot;, which is loosely based on &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, as a general of the &quot;barbaric&quot; Go (Wu) faction. The character Taishiji Shigi of the anime series &quot;Ikki Tousen&quot; is also based roughly on Taishi Ci.

Taishi Ci is a playable character in Total War: Three Kingdoms, being a part of various factions depending on the campaign.

<text>Angola is divided into twenty-one provinces, known in Portuguese as &quot;províncias&quot;. On 14 August 2024, Angola&#x27;s National Assembly approved a law to create three new provinces: 
* Cuando Cubango Province was divided into Cuando Province and Cubango Province; 
* Icolo e Bengo Province was separated from Luanda Province; and
* Moxico Leste Province was separated from Moxico Province. 

This law went into effect with its publication in the official gazette of Angola on 5 September 2024, and are expected to become operational in 2025. The former eighteen provinces are tabulated below:

<text>Carnmoney () is the name of a townland (of 456 acres), electoral ward and a civil parish in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Carnmoney is within the urban area of Newtownabbey, in the Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council area. It lies from Belfast city centre in the historic barony of Belfast Lower.

Carnmoney is known throughout Belfast for its large graveyard. Carnmoney Cemetery sits on the slopes of Carnmoney Hill, a major landmark in the area, which also contains a woodland nature reserve. The poet Derek Mahon mentions Carnmoney Cemetery in his poem &quot;My Wicked Uncle&quot;.

== History ==

Carnmoney, as a settlement, grew up around a holy well (still visible in the current Church of Ireland grounds), Glas-na-bradan river and Carnmoney Hill. The area became a Norman borough known as Coole or Le Coule, the borough was wrecked several times during subsequent English/Irish/Scots battles and nothing is left. Le Coule was on the site of the present Rathfern/Rathcoole housing estates. Bits of the Old Irish Highway, an old route from Carrick to Antrim passing through the Norman borough, are still visible running alongside the current O&#x27;Neill Road. Carnmoney as a name has come to represent Carnmoney Village (the village previously known as Ballyduff).

===Carnmoney Presbyterian Church===
Carnmoney Presbyterian Church is one of the oldest Presbyterian churches in Ireland as it dates from 1657. The plot where it stands was previously home to a meeting house, from 1622.

===Mary Butters===
Mary Butters (c.1770–c.1850), also referred to as the &quot;Carnmoney Witch&quot;, was put on trial for murder in March 1818. She was called a &quot;Wise-woman&quot; in the area and had been hired by a local farmer to lift a &quot;curse&quot; he believed had possessed one of his cows.

The day after she had supposedly lifted the spell, the farmer, his wife and his son were found dead in their home. Butters was accused of murdering them with a &quot;herbal potion&quot; she had created to use on the cow. Her story was that a man appeared before them with a huge bludgeon and killed the three only stunning her. The affair was the topic of much talk in Belfast and its surrounding villages, however Butters was discharged from the Spring Assizes in Carrickfergus by proclamation.

===The Troubles===
==Education==
There are seven schools in Carnmoney, all at primary level, run by the Education Authority.

* Ashgrove Primary School
* Carnmoney Primary School
*St Bernard&#x27;s Primary School (Also run by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS))
* St Mary&#x27;s on the Hill (Also run by the CCMS)
* St. McNissis Primary School (Also run by the CCMS)
* Mossley Primary School
* HillCroft Special Needs School
* EarlView Primary School

==Demographics==
The last UK census in 2001 showed Carnmoney had a population of 2,765. However the 2008 estimate is much higher due to major sub-urbanisation in Belfast.
*18.1% were under 16 and 22.3% was over the age of 60.
*47.5% of the population of Carnmoney were male and 52.5% were female.
*36.7% of people were from a Catholic background and 63.3% were from a Protestant or other Christian related community.
*The average age in Carnmoney was 40 years, higher than the Newtownabbey average of 35 years and higher still than the Northern Ireland average of 35.8 years.
* The population density of Carnmoney was 33.37 persons per hectare. This is proportionality much higher than in Newtownabbey were there are 5.31 persons per hectare, and higher still than 1.19, the Northern Ireland Average.
*In 2004 there were 26 births registered in Carnmoney, 42.3% of which were to unmarried mothers.

==Land use==
===Carnmoney Hill===

Carnmoney Hill is a northern outlier of the Belfast Hills chain and rises above Newtownabbey, and thus it can be seen from northern County Down, Belfast Lough, the M2 and M5 motorways and Belfast City. The eastern side is mainly covered by ancient woodland with semi-natural grasslands and other habitats interspersed, e.g. scrubland and bracken. The hill top has a volcanic cap yet the slopes are mainly of limestone and flint, joining mudstones at the coastal belt below.
The Woodland Trust and Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council own most of the eastern side, a third of the hill, although the crest and western two thirds of the hill are in private ownership, including most of the cultivated, grazing and heath land. There are numerous paths through the private land (often used by the public), leading to the top however there are no permanent paths on the hill open to the public.

Dunanney Ráth (or Fort) stands majestically overlooking Carnmoney Cemetery on the southern face of Carnmoney Hill. The ráth site, where in ancient times fairs and festivals were held, may date to Celtic times (around 500 BC). In 1556 the Earl of Sussex, Lord Deputy to Elizabeth I, camped with his troops at Dunanney where he met with Irish chieftains and tried unsuccessfully to pacify the Irish people. The name Dunanney has been translated both as &#x27;The Fort of the Assemblies&#x27; and &#x27;The Fort of the Watery Place&#x27; (built on rock, it tends to be wet and marshy). A second ráth exists to the east of Dunanney. Two souterrains (man-made underground passages) have been found on the hill, although more than 20 are known to have existed in the past.
Dunanney Ráth is on private land and not open to the public, however the part of Carnmoney Hill owned by the Woodland Trust is just south of Dunanney and is open to the public all year round. Newtownabbey Borough Council had in recent times tried to open Dunanney Ráth with little success. Plans to open a park on the hill are also underway.

Lilian Bland built and flew her own aircraft, the first biplane built in Ireland, from here in 1910.
There are a variety of habitats including floral meadows, wetland patches, shrub land, old hedgerows, copses, mixed ash woods, and semi natural woodland. The grazed lands tend not to have many wildlife species however they add to the hills landscape patchwork when seen from afar.

The hill offers good views of Belfast city, Cave Hill, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Bangor. On a clear day the Mourne Mountains, Slemish Mountain and even the western coast of Scotland are easily visible.

===Carnmoney Cemetery===
Carnmoney cemetery is well known throughout Belfast. It is a large cemetery split into two main sections on the east and west sides of Prince Charles Way. A Cross of Sacrifice was erected in the cemetery after the First World War. There are 46 Commonwealth burials of the First World War and 44 of the Second World War here. The cemetery has been the source of much controversy in recent years. In 2006 14 graves were damaged by vandals with floral tributes and ornaments being smashed on the graves. Outrage after the event led to a rise in foot patrols in the cemetery.
Newtownabbey Borough Council had previously proposed to expand the cemetery to the nearby Valley Park. There was controversy surrounding this proposal as it is in close proximity to Northern Ireland children&#x27;s hospice.

<doc id="449408" wikidata="Q4044360" url="?curid=449408" title="Mission Control (macOS)">
<text>Mission Control is a feature of the macOS operating system. Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces were combined and renamed Mission Control in 2011 with the release of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Exposé was first previewed on June 23, 2003, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a feature of the then forthcoming Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.

Mission Control allows a user to do the following:

* View all open application windows
* View all open application windows of a specific application
* Hide all application windows and show the desktop
* Manage application windows across multiple monitors
* Manage application windows across multiple virtual desktops

== Usage ==
Exposé and Mission Control include three separate features for organizing windows and open applications:

;All windows :Shows all open and unhidden windows, and all virtual desktops, shrinking their appearance so they all fit on a single screen. On newer Mac keyboards, this is activated from the F3 key, or F9 on older keyboards. On Apple&#x27;s Magic Mouse or multi-touch trackpads, this can be activated by pulling up on the trackpad with three or four fingers. Mission Control redesigned this feature extensively to show all running desktops.
;Application windows : Also called &#x27;App Exposé&#x27;. Shows all open and minimized windows for the currently active application. During this mode, the user can choose a window to switch to by using mouse or keyboard, or cycle through windows of different applications by pressing the tab key. This can be activated by pulling down with three or four fingers on a trackpad, the F10 key on older keyboards, by pressing Control + F3 on newer Apple aluminium and MacBook keyboards, or by right-clicking the app&#x27;s icon on the dock and selecting &#x27;Show all windows&#x27;. On OS X Snow Leopard, App Exposé can be activated by clicking and holding the application&#x27;s icon in the dock.
;Desktop : Moves all windows off the screen, with just the edges of the windows visible at the side of the screen, giving the user clear access to the desktop and any icons on it. This can be activated by pressing Command F3 on newer Apple aluminum and Macbook keyboards, the F11 key on older keyboards. On a trackpad, it can be selected by placing four fingers on the trackpad and pulling them away from each other.

In the first two cases, after Mission Control is activated, the user can select any window by clicking on it or selecting it with arrow keys and pressing &quot;Enter&quot;. Exposé then deactivates, leaving the selected window in the foreground. Using Apple Mighty Mouse, it is possible to select a window using the Scroll Ball, by scrolling in the direction of that window.

The keyboard shortcuts used for activating Exposé can be customized to be any of the function keys, the shift, control, option or command key, the fn key on Mac laptops, or even a mouse button on multiple-button mice (including Apple Mighty Mouse).

Different features of Mission Control can also be activated by moving the mouse to a &#x27;hot corner&#x27; of the desktop. This system is off by default; it can be enabled from System Settings.

== Changes in Mission Control ==

When Exposé first premiered in 2003, it could be controlled using the F9, F10 and F11 keys.

The Exposé shortcut keys were moved to the F3 key to make room for the &quot;rewind&quot;, &quot;play/pause&quot; and &quot;fast forward&quot; keys. On Mac keyboards made after 2004, Exposé can be activated by using the F3 key or in combination with the command key, or on the trackpad of Macbooks supporting multi-touch interface. (However, F9, F10 and F11 can still be used for controlling Exposé with the function modifier key, or by enabling the &quot;Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys&quot; setting.)

On Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, Exposé featured a new organized grid view and allowed users to activate Exposé from the Dock.

In Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, some features of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces were incorporated into Mission Control. This gave an overview of all running applications just like &quot;All windows&quot; but grouped windows from the same application, and added a display of Spaces. Desktop view and application window view were retained, the latter under the name of App Exposé, and could be accessed through gestures on multi-touch trackpads.

Some users criticised Mission Control in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion for not offering an unobscured &quot;Exposé&quot; view of all the windows in single workspace: windows of the same application are always hidden in bundles. This issue was fixed in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, however, with a checkbox in the System Settings pane allowing a user to choose whether to group windows of the same application. Some features of Exposé and Spaces from OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard did not return, however: it does not show the names of the windows displayed, nor does it return the added functionality provided by Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard multiple desktops feature, known as &quot;Spaces,&quot; which allowed users to drag and drop windows between desktops with a single click, and also allowed for larger thumbnail previews of each desktop in a 2D grid when in use.

In OS X Mavericks, the linen-texture background in Mission Control has been changed into a dark-grey background, as a part of moving away from skeuomorphism.

In OS X Yosemite, the dark-grey background has been replaced with a translucent background, lightly showing the desktop&#x27;s background and the desktop no longer zooms out.

In OS X El Capitan, the grouped window by app view has been changed into ungrouped windows view by default and the translucent background has been changed to it being transparent that fully shows the desktop&#x27;s background.

In macOS Catalina, Dashboard has been discontinued, therefore removing Dashboard from view permanently (if it was previously activated) in Mission Control.

== Undocumented features ==

The &quot;blob&quot; was a hidden and undocumented interface to Exposé that was discovered by a member of the MacNN forums. When clicked, it enabled the &quot;Application Windows&quot; mode. When Option+click, it enabled the &quot;All Windows&quot; mode.

Another undocumented feature of Exposé was for the show desktop function. It placed all the open windows in a small box on the screen that can be moved to anywhere on the screen. This function had some bugs, such as after exiting the show desktop mode, the foremost window will not have a shadow and the user will not be able to move the window. However, this was easily fixed by using the show all function. It also had another bug that causes an area of screen the width of the minimised preview to become unresponsive to mouse clicks requiring the windowserver to be restarted.
==Mission control evolution==
Using the Shift key, Mission Control can be activated in slow motion, as can Dashboard and the minimise effect and several other animations. This is the same effect that was demonstrated by Steve Jobs during the unveiling of Exposé during the 2003 Worldwide Developers Conference.

== Similar alternatives on other Operating Systems ==
Similar effects are used on other operating systems.

Microsoft Windows 2.0 first introduced a window switcher in 1990. Using , users could see a flattened view of all open windows. Every version of Windows since then has also provided this window switching functionality. Vista and Windows 7 provide an additional feature called Windows Flip 3D, which has a broadly similar purpose. Flip 3D allows a user to flip through all open windows with a three-dimensional perspective. A downside to this method is that the front-most window covers a significant portion of the other windows, unlike Exposé. On the other hand, this allows the user to see the contents of the front-most window, while this can be difficult in Exposé, especially if the user has a large number of windows open. Vista&#x27;s Desktop Window Manager exposes a public API that allows any application to access the same thumbnail representations that Flip3D uses, and so there are a number of third party add-ons that are able to provide Exposé-like functionality in Vista. A very few third-party applications, such as the Emcee Desktop Organizer, provide Mission Control-like organization of similar windows into visual &quot;stacks,&quot; or support Windows 8&#x27;s &quot;Immersive&quot; Apps. Windows 10 adds a very similar feature called Task View which also includes multiple-desktop support.

Microsoft&#x27;s Intellipoint Software for Microsoft Mice has a feature similar to Exposé as it also works with live images of windows, rather than static representations.

Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 7 introduced a feature called &quot;peeking&quot; that allowed a user to hover their mouse over an icon in the taskbar to reveal a small thumbnail depicting the contents of the application&#x27;s window or windows.[10]

Compiz and KWin are compositing window managers for systems using the X Window System. Both include plugins similar to Exposé - the scale plugin in Compiz and the present windows effect in KWin. Skippy also performs similar functions to Exposé.

Starting with version 3.0, the GNOME desktop environment has gained a new mode called &quot;Overview&quot;, which is used to launch applications and manage workspaces. In this mode, windows are scaled and arranged in an Exposé-like fashion for quick switching.

For Classic or Legacy Macintosh systems, the free Finder Workspaces offers functionality similar to Spaces.
ChromeOS has a window overview mode that shows a thumbnail of all open windows, available by pressing the &#x27;window switcher&#x27; key or swiping up with 3 fingers on the trackpad. Windows in overview mode can be closed by clicking an associated close button, or selected by clicking on the window thumbnail, which also closes overview mode and brings the selected window to the foreground.

<text>Pierre Etchebaster (8 December 1893 – 24 March 1980) was a French real tennis player, (in French &quot;jeu de paume&quot;), the original racquet sport from which the modern game of lawn tennis is descended.

==Life==
Born in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, a Basque fishing village, he served in the French Army during World War I before returning home to become the French champion in &quot;main nués&quot;, &quot;pala&quot; and &quot;chistera&quot;, all varieties of Basque pelota.

In 1922, Etchebaster was encouraged by tennis player Jacques Worth (a president of a Paris court club) to take up the game of real tennis. His first time on the court was during his audition to be the head professional of the club. After a few minutes of play, he was selected to fill the role. George Plimpton wrote that this was equivalent to &quot;picking up a baseball bat in the morning and playing for the New York Yankees in the afternoon.&quot;

Despite losing his first challenge to Fred Covey in 1927, Etchebaster returned in his customary blue beret to win the world championship in London in 1928. He emigrated to New York City in 1930 to be a professional at the Racquet and Tennis Club. Etchebaster proceeded to dominate the sport. He was the world champion for a record-breaking 26 years (1928–1954) until his retirement at the age of 60. He defended the title seven times — a feat unmatched until 2006 when Robert Fahey made his seventh title defense (Fahey successfully defended his title eleven times).

He would spend hours a day on court practising his shots, and studying the spin effects the various surfaces of the court had on the ball. In 1955 he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;honneur for his achievements, and in 1978 he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

After his retirement in 1971, a book of his coaching advice, &quot;Pierre&#x27;s Book&quot;, was published. It including accolades from many of the world&#x27;s best players. He died in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.

For many years Etchebaster divided his time between his summer position as a lawn tennis professional at Piping Rock Club, Locust Valley, NY and his role as head professional at the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue in New York. Each spring he would spend a month in Aiken, South Carolina, the site of one of the nine real tennis courts in the United States, where he would give lessons and play exhibitions.

The Racquet and Tennis Club made a video in 1954 featuring Etchebaster, Ogden Phipps, Francis X. Shields, and Alastair B. Martin, playing singles and doubles. 

&quot;Pierre&#x27;s Book&quot; (Barre Publishers, Barre MA 1971) was edited and introduced by George Plimpton.

<text>Provinces are constituent political entities of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe currently has ten provinces, two of which are cities with provincial status. Zimbabwe is a unitary state, and its provinces exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Provinces are divided into districts, which are divided into wards.

The Constitution of Zimbabwe delineates provincial governance and powers. After constitutional amendments in 1988, provinces were administered by a governor directly appointed by the President of Zimbabwe. Since the 2013 constitutional changes, there are technically no longer provincial governors, though in practice they remain in place as Ministers of State for Provincial Affairs. The 2013 Constitution also calls for the devolution of governmental powers and responsibilities where appropriate, though Zimbabwean opposition parties argue that the central government has yet to comply.

With the establishment of Company rule in Rhodesia in the 1890s, the country was divided into two provinces: Matabeleland in the west and Mashonaland in the east. Under British colonial rule as Southern Rhodesia, the colony was divided into five provinces. Later, the Rhodesian government expanded the number of provinces to seven: Manicaland, Matabeleland North and South, Mashonaland North and South, Midlands, and Victoria (today Masvingo). In the 1980s, Mashonaland North and South were reorganized to become three provinces (Mashonaland Central, East and West). The youngest provinces, Bulawayo and Harare, were created in 1997.

<doc id="449415" wikidata="Q197764" url="?curid=449415" title="Empire Builder">
<text>The Empire Builder is a daily long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak between Chicago and either Seattle or Portland via two sections west of Spokane. Introduced in 1929, it was the flagship passenger train of the Great Northern Railway and was retained by Amtrak when it took over intercity rail service in 1971.

The end-to-end travel time of the route is 45–46 hours for an average speed of about , though the train travels as fast as over the majority of the route. It is Amtrak&#x27;s busiest long-distance route.

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; carried 338,993 passengers, an increase of 15.0% from FY2022 but 21.8% below pre-COVID-19 levels (433,372 passengers during FY2019). During FY2022, the train had a total revenue of $49,600,000.

==History==
The Great Northern Railway inaugurated the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; on June 10, 1929. It was named in honor of the company&#x27;s founder, James J. Hill, who had reorganized several failing railroads into the only successful attempt at a privately funded transcontinental railroad. It reached the Pacific Northwest in the late 19th century, and for this feat, he was nicknamed &quot;The Empire Builder&quot;. Following World War II, Great Northern placed new streamlined and diesel-powered trains in service that cut the scheduled 2,211-mile trip between Chicago and Seattle from 58.5 hours to 45 hours.

The schedule allowed riders views of the Cascade Mountains and Glacier National Park, a park established through the lobbying efforts of the Great Northern. Re-equipped with domes in 1955, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; offered passengers sweeping views of the route through three dome coaches and one full-length Great Dome car for first class passengers.
In 1970, the Great Northern merged with three other closely affiliated railroads to form the Burlington Northern Railroad, which assumed operation of the &quot;Builder.&quot; Amtrak took over the train when it began operating most intercity routes a year later. To improve its farebox recovery ratio, Amtrak shifted the Chicago–St. Paul leg to run through Milwaukee via the Milwaukee Road. Before 1971, the Chicago–St. Paul leg used the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s mainline along the Mississippi River through Wisconsin. The service also used to operate west from the Twin Cities before turning northwest in Willmar, Minnesota, to reach Fargo.

Amtrak added a Portland section in 1981, with the train splitting in Spokane. This restored service to the line previously operated by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. It was not the first time that the train had operated Seattle and Portland sections; Great Northern had split the &quot;Builder&quot; in Spokane for much of the 1940s and 1950s.

In 2005, Amtrak upgraded service to include a wine and cheese tasting in the dining car for sleeping car passengers and free newspapers in the morning. Amtrak&#x27;s inspector general eliminated some of these services in 2013 as part of a cost-saving measure.

During summer months, on portions of the route, &quot;Trails and Rails&quot; volunteer tour guides in the lounge car give commentary on points of visual and historic interest that can be viewed from the train.

After running daily for the better part of a century, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was cut back to tri-weekly operation along with most of Amtrak&#x27;s other long-distance routes on October12, 2020, as part of a round of service reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For most of the fall and winter of 2020–21, trains departed Chicago on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays and departed Seattle or Portland on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. However, in March 2021, Amtrak announced the train would return to its pre-pandemic daily schedule on May24, 2021.

===Notable incidents===
On May27, 1931, the eastbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was struck by a tornado in Clay County, Minnesota. The train, carrying 117 passengers, had all of its cars, minus the locomotive and coal tender, thrown off the tracks by the tornado, with one car being thrown off the track. One passenger died, with 57 others injured.
Due to heavy patronage during World War II the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; ran in two sections, known as First 1 and Second 1. On August 9, 1945, at Michigan, North Dakota, First 1 was stopped to address an overheated journal. It was struck from behind by Second 1 at a speed of 45 mph. The rear car of First 1, a “bobtail” – part observation car and part sleeping berths, was telescoped practically its entire length by the engine of Second 1, and was demolished. It remains the worst rail disaster in both North Dakota and Great Northern Railway history. Thirty-four passengers died and 303 were injured.
On March 7, 1966, the eastbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; suffered a head-on collision with a &quot;Western Star&quot; mail and passenger train going in the opposite direction. This occurred between Chester, Montana and Joplin, Montana while Great Northern&#x27;s then-president John M. Budd was aboard. The two engineers both died in the collision and 79 were injured; 29 of those were hospitalized in what came to be known at the Great Northern Buelow wreck.
The westbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; derailed between Joplin, Montana and Chester, Montana , on September25, 2021, with three fatalities. The train was at the east end of Buelow siding.

==Ridership==
The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; is Amtrak&#x27;s most popular long-distance train. Over fiscal years 2007–2016, &quot;Empire Builder&quot; annual ridership averaged 500,000, with a high of 554,266 in FY 2008. Revenue peaked in FY 2013 at $67,394,779. About 65% of the cost of operating the train is covered by fare revenue, a rate among Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains second only to the specialized East Coast &quot;Auto Train&quot;.

==Route==

The current Amtrak &quot;Empire Builder&quot; passes through Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois. It makes service stops in Spokane, Washington; Havre, Montana; Minot, North Dakota; and Saint Paul, Minnesota. Its other major stops include Vancouver, Washington; Whitefish, Montana; Williston, North Dakota; Fargo, North Dakota; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It uses BNSF Railway&#x27;s Northern Transcon from Seattle to Minneapolis, Minnesota Commercial Railway from Minneapolis to St. Paul, Canadian Pacific Kansas City (former Milwaukee Road) from St. Paul to Rondout, Illinois, and Metra&#x27;s Milwaukee District / North Line (former Milwaukee Road) from Rondout to Chicago. The St. Paul to Chicago portion currently follows the route of the former &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot;, and beginning in May 2024 has been supplemented by the &quot;Borealis&quot;. In pre-Amtrak days it used the &quot;Twin Zephyrs&quot; routing.

The Seattle section follows Puget Sound and uses the Cascade Tunnel and Stevens Pass as it traverses the Cascade Range to reach Spokane. The Portland section runs along the Washington side of the Columbia River Gorge. The cars from the two sections are combined at Spokane; the Seattle train has the dining car, while the Portland train has the observation car. The combined train then traverses the mountains of northeastern Washington, northern Idaho and northwestern Montana, arriving in Whitefish in the morning. The schedule is timed so that the train passes through the Rocky Mountains (and Glacier National Park) during daylightan occurrence that is more likely on the eastbound train during summer. Passengers can see sweeping views as the &quot;Builder&quot; travels along the middle fork of the Flathead River, crossing the Continental Divide at Marias Pass. After crossing Marias Pass, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; leaves Glacier National Park and enters the Northern Plains of eastern Montana and North Dakota.

The land changes from prairie to forest as it travels through Minnesota. From Minneapolis-St. Paul, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; crosses the Mississippi River at Hastings, Minnesota and passes through southeastern Minnesota cities on or near Lake Pepin before crossing the Mississippi again at La Crosse, Wisconsin. The service travels southeast through rural south-central Wisconsin, turns due south at Milwaukee, and ends at Chicago Union Station.

The westbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; leaves Chicago in early afternoon, arriving in Milwaukee just before the afternoon rush and in St. Paul in the evening. After traveling overnight through Minnesota, it spends most of the following day traveling through North Dakota and Montana, arriving at Glacier National Park in the early evening and splitting late at night in Spokane. The Seattle section travels through the Cascades overnight, arriving in Seattle in mid-morning. The Portland section arrives in the Tri-Cities just before breakfast and in Portland in mid-morning. The eastbound Seattle and Portland sections leave within five minutes of each other just before the afternoon rush, combining in Spokane and traveling through Montana overnight before arriving at Glacier National Park in mid-morning and Williston at dinner time. After traveling overnight through North Dakota and Minnesota, it arrives in St. Paul at breakfast time, Columbus/Madison at lunch time, Milwaukee in early afternoon and Chicago just before the afternoon rush.

Stops at Milwaukee Airport and Sturtevant were added beginning March21, 2020, to replace &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains suspended due to the COVID-19-related drastic drop in demand. Additionally, local travel was allowed between Chicago and Milwaukee. These adjustments lasted until the train resumed its normal schedule in May 2021.

===Flooding===

The line has come under threat from flooding from the Missouri, Souris, Red, and Mississippi Rivers, and has occasionally had to suspend or alter service. Most service gets restored in days or weeks, but Devils Lake in North Dakota, which has no natural outlet, is a long-standing threat. The lowest top-of-rail elevation in the lake crossing is . In spring 2011, the lake reached , causing service interruptions on windy days when high waves threatened the tracks.

BNSF, which owns the track, suspended freight operations through Devils Lake in 2009 and threatened to allow the rising waters to cover the line unless Amtrak could provide $100 million to raise the track. In that case, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; would have been rerouted to the south, ending service to Rugby, Devils Lake, and Grand Forks. In June 2011 agreement was reached that Amtrak and BNSF would each cover 1/3 of the cost with the rest to come from the federal and state governments.

In December 2011, North Dakota was awarded a $10 million TIGER grant from the US Department of Transportation to assist with the state portion of the cost. Work began in June 2012, and the track is being raised in two stages: in 2012, and another 5 feet in 2013. Two bridges and their abutments are also being raised. When the track raise is complete, the top-of-rail elevation will be . This is 10 feet above the level at which the lake will naturally overflow and will thus be a permanent solution to the Devils Lake flooding.

In the spring and summer of 2011 flooding of the Souris River near Minot, North Dakota blocked the route in the latter part of June and for most of July. For some of that time the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; (with a typical consist of only four cars) ran from Chicago and terminated in Minneapolis/St Paul; to the west, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; did not run east of Havre, Montana. (Other locations along the route also flooded, near Devils Lake, North Dakota and areas further west along the Missouri River.)

===Freight train interference===
An oil boom from the Bakken formation, combined with a robust fall 2013 harvest, led to a spike in the number of crude oil and grain trains using the Northern Transcon in Montana and North Dakota. The resulting congestion led to rampant delays for the &quot;Empire Builder,&quot; with the train running on time 44.5% in November 2013, the worst on-time performance of any Amtrak route and well below congressional standards. In some cases, the delays resulted in an imbalance of crew and equipment, forcing Amtrak to cancel runs of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. By May 2014, only 26% of &quot;Empire Builder&quot; trains had arrived within 30 minutes of their scheduled time, with delays averaging between 3 and 5 hours. In some cases, freight congestion and severe weather resulted in delays as long as 11 to 12 hours. This was a marked change from past years in which the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was one of the best on-time performers in the entire Amtrak system, ahead of even the flagship &quot;Acela Express.&quot;

Due to the increasingly severe delays, Amtrak adjusted the route&#x27;s schedule west of St. Paul on April15, 2014. Westbound trains left St. Paul later, while eastbound trains left Seattle/Portland approximately three hours earlier. Operating hours for affected stations were also officially adjusted accordingly. The Amtrak announcement also said that BNSF was working on adding track capacity, and it was anticipated that sometime in 2015 the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; could be returned to its former schedule. In January 2015, it was announced that the train would resume its normal schedule.

Even during the worst of the delays, the train has seen frequent patronage from workers in the Bakken fields and their families who board and detrain in Williston. Passengers travel from as far as the Pacific Northwest.

=== Stations ===
===Former stops===

In 1970, the construction and filling of Lake Koocanusa necessitated the realignment of of track between Stryker, Montana, and Libby, Montana, and the construction of Flathead Tunnel, leading the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; to drop service to Eureka, Montana. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; also served Troy, Montana, until February15, 1973.

On October1, 1979, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was rerouted to operate over the &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot;″s old route between Minneapolis and Fargo, North Dakota. With this alignment change, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; dropped Willmar, Minnesota; Morris, Minnesota; and Breckenridge, Minnesota, while adding St. Cloud, Minnesota; Staples, Minnesota; and Detroit Lakes, Minnesota.

Another alignment change came on October25, 1981, when the Seattle section was rerouted from the old Northern Pacific (which had also become part of the BN in 1970) to the Burlington Northern Railroad&#x27;s line through the Cascade Tunnel over Stevens Pass. This change eliminated service to Yakima, Washington; Ellensburg, Washington; and Auburn, Washington. This change also introduced the Portland section, which returned service to the former Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railroad line (which became part of BN in 1970) along the Washington shore of the Columbia River. The route kept Pasco, but added Wishram, Bingen-White Salmon, and Vancouver (all in Washington) to the route. From Vancouver, the Portland section of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; uses the same route as the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; and &quot;Cascades&quot; trains to Portland Union Station.

It has been proposed that the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains servicing Glenview, Illinois have their station stop be shifted one station north to the Metra station at North Glenview, to eliminate stops which block traffic on Glenview Road. North Glenview would have to be modified to handle additional traffic, and the move depends on commitments from Glenview, the Illinois General Assembly, and Metra. In Minnesota, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; returned to Saint Paul Union Depot on May7, 2014, 43 years after it last served the station the day before the start of Amtrak. Renovation of the 1917 Beaux Arts terminal was undertaken in 2011, continuing through 2013, resulting in a multi-mode terminal used by Jefferson Lines, Greyhound Lines, commuter bus and the Metro Green Line, providing a light rail connection to downtown Minneapolis. The station replaced Midway Station which opened in 1978 after the initial abandonment of Saint Paul Union Depot in 1971 and the demolition of Minneapolis Great Northern Depot in 1978.

==Equipment==
===Current equipment===

Like all long-distance trains west of the Mississippi River, the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; uses bilevel Superliner passenger cars (except for the baggage car). The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was the first train to be fully equipped with Superliners, with the first run occurring on October28, 1979.

A typical &quot;Empire Builder&quot; consist includes:
* Two or three GE Genesis or Siemens Charger ALC-42 locomotives
* Viewliner baggage car
* Superliner transition sleeper car
* Two Superliner sleeper cars
* Superliner diner
* Superliner coach
* Superliner Sightseer Lounge/café
* Superliner coach
* Superliner coach/baggage car
* Superliner sleeper

In Spokane, the westbound train is split: the locomotives, baggage car, and first six passenger cars continue on to Seattle as train 7, while a single locomotive is used to take the remaining cars (including the lounge/cafe) to Portland as train 27. Eastbound the sections are combined in a reverse fashion, with the Seattle section numbered as train 8 and the Portland section as train 28. During peak travel periods, an additional coach is added to the rear of the train between Chicago and St. Paul. It is left overnight in St. Paul for the next day&#x27;s return trip to pick up. This car is designated train 807 westbound and train 808 eastbound.

Amtrak’s Siemens Charger ALC-42 locomotives were first used in revenue service on the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; on February8, 2022.

===Historical equipment===
When first launched in 1929, the Great Northern provided new heavyweight consists. When the railway received five new streamlined trainsets in 1947, the old heavyweight sets were used to reintroduce the &quot;Oriental Limited&quot;. In 1951 the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was re-equipped with six new streamlined trainsets; the 1947 cars were used to launch the &quot;Western Star&quot;, while the &quot;Oriental Limited&quot; was retired. When the GN acquired dome coaches in 1955, the 1951 coaches went to &quot;Western Star&quot;, while the 1947 coaches went to the pool of spare and extra-movement cars. Ownership of the cars on the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; was by-and-large split between the Great Northern and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q), though a couple of cars in the original consists were owned by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S). In this consist, one of the 48-seat &quot;chair&quot; cars and one of the 4-section sleepers were used for the connection to Portland, while the rest of the consist connected to Seattle.

The Great Northern coaches eventually found their way into state-subsidized commuter service for the Central Railroad of New Jersey after the Burlington Northern merger and remained until 1987 when NJ Transit retired its last E8A locomotive. Some of these cars remain in New Jersey. Some coaches were acquired from the Union Pacific; these also went to New Jersey. One of the 28 seat coach-dinette cars also remains in New Jersey and is stored near Interstate 78 wearing tattered Amtrak colors.

<doc id="449416" wikidata="Q4859256" url="?curid=449416" title="Barbara Roche">
<text>Barbara Maureen Roche (; born 13 April 1954) is a British Labour politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Hornsey and Wood Green from 1992 until 2005, when she lost her seat to the Liberal Democrats, despite having enjoyed a majority of over 10,000 in the 2001 general election.

==Early life and education==
Born to Polish-Ashkenazi father and a Sephardi Jewish mother, the daughter of Barnet and Hanna Margolis, Roche was educated at the Jews Free School, Camden Town and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). She trained to be a barrister and was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1977.

==Political career==
She first stood for Parliament in the 1984 Surrey South-West by-election, a Conservative-held seat, in which Roche came a distant third as the Labour candidate. This was followed by an unsuccessful candidacy for the marginal seat of Hornsey and Wood Green at the 1987 general election, when she failed to unset the incumbent MP Hugh Rossi.

Roche ran again in Hornsey and Wood Green at the 1992 general election. Rossi was not standing for Parliament, and had been replaced by Andrew Boff as the Conservative candidate. This time, Roche gained the seat for Labour, despite her party losing nationally. She saw her majority soar to 20,500 in 1997, when she polled 25,000 votes more than the Liberal Democrats&#x27; candidate, Lynne Featherstone.

However, by 2001, Roche&#x27;s majority had almost halved to 10,500, with a substantial swing to the Liberal Democrats, who had again selected Featherstone as their candidate. A local newspaper described Roche in January 2005 as &quot;a fiercely loyal Labour MP, who has only rebelled against the Government in four out of 1,570 votes.&quot;

During her time in Government, she held several ministerial offices; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry, 1997–1998; Financial Secretary to the Treasury, 1999; Minister of State for Asylum and Immigration, Home Office, 1999–2001; Cabinet Office, 2001–2002; Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 2002–2003.

At the 2005 general election, Roche unexpectedly lost her seat on another large 14.6% swing (14.6%) to the Liberal Democrats, with Featherstone succeeding her as the constituency&#x27;s MP.

=== Views on immigration ===
Roche was a strong supporter of a liberal immigration policy to the United Kingdom, and advocated for increased immigration during her time as Minister of State for Asylum and Immigration. Among her reasons for this, she included using migration to free up skills shortages, respond to the country&#x27;s ageing demography and for economic growth.

In September 2000, she gave a speech outlining her desires to liberalize the United Kingdom&#x27;s immigration policy, calling for what the government termed as &#x27;managed migration&#x27;. She believed that the benefits of migration should be shown by emphasizing the ethnic diversity of the United Kingdom and migrants&#x27; contribution to the country, in similar ways to countries like the United States, Australia and Canada, for example. She also advocated for a &quot;US style citizenship ceremony to ensure immigrants attached symbolic importance to their acceptance into British society.&quot;

Similarly, Roche was also a supporter of multiculturalism, and attached this to her Jewishness and immigrant parents, stating; &quot;My being Jewish informs me totally, informs my politics. I understand the otherness of ethnic groups. The Americans are ahead of us on things like multiple identity. I&#x27;m Jewish but I&#x27;m also a Londoner; I&#x27;m English but also British.&quot;

After she quit parliamentary politics, she became chair of the Migration Museum Project, co-founded the Migration Matters Trust and several other organizations in the migration field.

==After Parliament==
After her defeat in 2005, and prior to the 2010 general election, Roche attempted to re-enter the Commons, seeking the Labour Party nomination (and being shortlisted) in the &#x27;safe&#x27; Labour seats of Stockton North, Houghton &amp; Sunderland South, Wigan, and Stalybridge &amp; Hyde, but was not selected for any of them, despite the support of the Labour-affiliated Unite union.

== Personal life ==
Margolis married Patrick Roche in 1977, and the couple have a daughter. Outside politics, she lists her recreations as theatre and detective fiction.

<doc id="449424" wikidata="Q812923" url="?curid=449424" title="Beale ciphers">
<text>The Beale ciphers are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over 43 million US dollars  Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext accounts the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure&#x27;s owners and their next of kin.

The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet called The Beale Papers, detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in about 1820. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them, which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.

Since the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.

There are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including the 1980 article &quot;A Dissenting Opinion&quot; by cryptographer Jim Gillogly, and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the &quot;Beale Papers&quot; and their related story by Joe Nickell, using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presents linguistic evidence demonstrating that the documents could not have been written at the time alleged (words such as &quot;stampeding&quot;, for instance, are of later vintage). His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a &quot;secret vault&quot; allegory of the Freemasons; James B. Ward was a Mason himself.

==Background==

A pamphlet published in 1885, entitled &quot;The Beale Papers&quot;, is the source of this story. The treasure was said to have been obtained by an American named Thomas J. Beale in the early 1800s, from a mine to the north of Nuevo México (New Mexico), at that time in the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México (an area that today would most likely be part of Colorado). According to the pamphlet, Beale was the leader of a group of 30 gentlemen adventurers from Virginia who stumbled upon the rich mine of gold and silver while hunting buffalo. They spent 18 months mining thousands of pounds of precious metals, which they then charged Beale with transporting to Virginia and burying in a secure location. After Beale made multiple trips to stock the hiding place, he then encrypted three messages: the location, a description of the treasure, and the names of its owners and their relatives. The treasure location is traditionally linked to Montvale in Bedford County, Virginia.

Beale placed the ciphertexts and some other papers in an iron box. In 1822 he entrusted the box to a Lynchburg innkeeper named Robert Morriss. Beale told Morriss not to open the box unless he or one of his men failed to return from their journey within 10 years. Sending a letter from St. Louis a few months later, Beale promised Morriss that a friend in St. Louis would mail the key to the cryptograms; however, it never arrived. It was not until 1845 that Morriss opened the box. Inside he found two plaintext letters from Beale, and several pages of ciphertext separated into Papers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;3&quot;. Morriss had no luck in solving the ciphers, and decades later left the box and its contents to an unnamed friend.

The friend, then using an edition of the United States Declaration of Independence as the key for a modified book cipher, successfully deciphered the second ciphertext which gave a description of the buried treasure. Unable to solve the other two ciphertexts, the friend ultimately made the letters and ciphertexts public in a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Beale Papers&quot;, which was published by yet another friend, James B. Ward, in 1885.

Ward is thus not &quot;the friend&quot;. Ward himself is almost untraceable in local records, except that a man with that name owned the home in which a Sarah Morriss, identified as the spouse of Robert Morriss, died at age 77, in 1863. He also is recorded as becoming a Master Mason in 1863.

The images below, transcribed from the pamphlet, show the original line-breaks for easy comparison. In the second cryptogram, the original cipher errors are highlighted in red.

==Deciphered message==

The plaintext of paper number 2 reads:

I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford&#x27;s, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number three, herewith:

The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, and thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. eighteen nineteen. The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty-one, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange to save transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand dollars.

The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.

The second cipher can be decrypted fairly easily using a modified copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, but some editing is necessary. To decrypt it, one finds the word corresponding to the number (e.g., the first number is 115, and the 115th word in the Declaration of Independence is &quot;instituted&quot;), and takes the first letter of that word (in the case of the example, &quot;I&quot;).

Beale used a version of the United States Declaration of Independence slightly different from the original, and made mistakes in numbering it. To extract the hidden message, the following five modifications must be applied to the original text:
* after word 154 (&quot;institute&quot;) and before word 157 (&quot;laying&quot;), one word must be added. The pamphlet handles this by inserting &quot;a&quot; before &quot;new government&quot;.
* after word 240 (&quot;invariably&quot;) and before word 246 (&quot;design&quot;), one word must be removed (probably &quot;a&quot;). The pamphlet&#x27;s numbering has eleven words between the labels for 240 and 250.
* after word 466 (&quot;houses&quot;) and before word 495 (&quot;be&quot;), ten words must be removed (probably &quot;He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions&quot;). The pamphlet has two labels for 480.
* after word 630 (&quot;eat&quot;) and before word 654 (&quot;to&quot;), one word must be removed (probably &quot;the&quot;). The pamphlet&#x27;s numbering has eleven words between the labels for 630 and 640.
* after word 677 (&quot;foreign&quot;) and before word 819 (&quot;valuable&quot;), one word must be removed (probably &quot;their&quot;). The pamphlet&#x27;s numbering has eleven words between the labels for 670 and 680.

Furthermore:
* Words 78 and 79 (&quot;self-evident&quot;), shown hyphenated, are counted as two words.
* The first letter of word 95 (&quot;inalienable&quot;) is always used as a &quot;u&quot; (&quot;unalienable&quot;).
* Words 509 and 510 of the modified text (&quot;mean time&quot;) are counted as two words, despite being shown as one word.
* The first letter of the 811th word of the modified text (&quot;fundamentally&quot;) is always used by Beale as a &quot;y&quot;.
* The first letter of the 1005th word of the modified text (&quot;have&quot;) is always used by Beale as an &quot;x&quot;.

Finally, in the decoded text there are six errors, probably due to wrong transcription of the original paper:
* ... 84, 57, 540, 217, 115, 71, 29, 84 (should be 85), 63, ... &quot;consistcd&quot; (&quot;consisted&quot;).
* ... 53 (should be 54), 20, 125, 371, 38, 36, 10, 52, ... &quot;rhousand&quot; (&quot;thousand&quot;).
* ... 2, 108 (should be 10, 8), 220, 106, 353, ... &quot;itron&quot; (&quot;in iron&quot;).
* ... 440 (should be 40), 370, 643, 466, ... &quot;uith&quot; (&quot;with&quot;).
* ... 14, 73, 84 (should be 85), ... &quot;thc&quot; (&quot;the&quot;).
* ... 807, 81, 96 (should be 95), 405, 41, ... &quot;varlt&quot; (&quot;vault&quot;).

Additional Declaration differences affect paper number 1: word 210 of the modified text (&quot;more&quot;) is shown as &quot;now&quot;; words 919 and 920 of the modified text (&quot;fellow citizens&quot;) are shown hyphenated (also affects paper number 3); two extra words (&quot;made&quot; and &quot;the&quot;) are shown in modified text positions 1058 and 1188; a word is removed (&quot;of&quot;) after modified text position 1125. The other slight changes probably have no consequences.

Many versions of the Declaration of Independence have been printed, with various adjustments to paragraphing, word inclusion, word changing, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

The lack of clear images of the original ciphers, combined with the large quantity of numerals, has led to numerals being misprinted or omitted in many sources.

The Beale Papers text, on pages 20 to 21, gives an alleged translation of the second ciphertext, but it has nine differences from the actual one. The differences are shown here as {alleged decipherment | actual decipherment}:
I have deposited, in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford&#x27;s, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number {“3,” | three} herewith:
The first deposit consisted of {one thousand | ten hundred} and fourteen pounds of gold, and {three thousand | thirty-} eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited {November, 1819 | Nov. eighteen nineteen}. The second was made {December, 1821 | Dec. eighteen twenty-one}, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight {pounds | } of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange {for silver | } to save transportation, and valued at {$13,000 | thirteen thousand dollars}.
The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number {“1” | one} describes the exact locality of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.

===Value===
The treasure&#x27;s total weight is about 3 tons as described in inventory of the second cryptogram. This includes approximately 35,052 troy oz gold, 61,200 troy oz silver (worth about US $96,275,926 million and ,810,755.77 million, respectively, in October 2024) and jewels worth around in 2017.

==Authenticity==
There has been considerable debate over whether the remaining two ciphertexts are real or hoaxes. An early researcher, Carl Hammer of Sperry UNIVAC, used supercomputers of the late 1960s to analyze the ciphers and found that while the ciphers were poorly encoded, the two undeciphered ones did not show the patterns one would expect of randomly chosen numbers and probably encoded an intelligible text. Other questions remain about the authenticity of the pamphlet&#x27;s account.

The pamphlet&#x27;s background story has several implausibilities, and is based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence and hearsay.
* Later cryptographers have claimed that the two remaining ciphertexts have statistical characteristics which suggest that they are not actually encryptions of an English plaintext. Alphabetical sequences such as are both non-random, as indicated by Carl Hammer, and not words in English.
* Others have also questioned &quot;why&quot; Beale would have bothered writing three different ciphertexts (with at least two keys, if not ciphers) for what is essentially a single message in the first place, particularly if he wanted to ensure that the next of kin received their share (as it is, with the treasure described, there is no incentive to decode the third cipher).
* Analysis of the language used by the author of the pamphlet (the uses of punctuation, relative clauses, infinitives, conjunctives, and so on) has detected significant correlations between it and the writing style of Beale&#x27;s letters, including the plaintext of the second cipher, suggesting that they may have been written by the same person.
* The letters also contain several English words, such as &quot;improvise&quot;, not otherwise recorded before the 1820s in English but used from French from 1786 in the New Orleans area, and &quot;stampede&quot; (Spanish) &quot;an uproar&quot;. Beale&#x27;s &quot;stampeding&quot; apparently first appears in print in the English language in 1832 but was used from 1786 to 1823 in New Orleans in French and Spanish.
* The second message, describing the treasure, has been deciphered, but the others have not, suggesting a deliberate ploy to encourage interest in deciphering the other two texts, only to discover that they are hoaxes. In addition, the original sale price of the pamphlet, 50 cents, was a high price for the time (adjusted for inflation, it is equivalent to $ today), and the author writes that he expects &quot;a wide circulation&quot;.
* The third cipher appears to be too short to list thirty individuals&#x27; next of kin.
* If the modified Declaration of Independence is used as a key for the first cipher, it yields alphabetical sequences such as and others. According to the American Cryptogram Association, the chances of such sequences appearing multiple times in the one ciphertext by chance are less than one in a hundred million million. Although it is conceivable that the first cipher was intended as a proof of concept letting decoders know that they were &quot;on the right track&quot; for one or more of the subsequent ciphers, such a proof would be redundant, as the success of the key with respect to the second document would provide the same evidence on its own.
* Robert Morriss, as represented in the pamphlet, says he was running the Washington Hotel in 1820, yet contemporary records show he did not start in that position until at least 1823.
*In fact a common literary device of fiction is the story of finding a lost treasure map from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot; to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; to Milton Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

There have been many attempts to break the remaining cipher(s). Most attempts have tried other historical texts as keys (e.g., Magna Carta, various books of the Bible, the U.S. Constitution, and the Virginia Royal Charter), assuming the ciphertexts were produced with some book cipher, but none have been recognized as successful to date. Breaking the cipher(s) may depend on random chance (as, for instance, stumbling upon a book key if the two remaining ciphertexts are actually book ciphers); so far, even the most skilled cryptanalysts who have attempted them have been defeated. Of course, Beale could have used a document that he had written himself for either or both of the remaining keys or either a document of his own or randomly selected characters for the third source, in either case rendering &quot;any&quot; further attempts to crack the codes useless.

=== Existence of Thomas J. Beale ===
A survey of U.S. Census records in 1810 shows two persons named Thomas Beale, in Connecticut and New Hampshire. However, the population schedules from the 1810 U.S. Census are completely missing for seven states, one territory, the District of Columbia, and 18 of the counties of Virginia. The 1820 U.S. Census has two persons named Thomas Beale, Captain Thomas Beale of the battle of New Orleans 1815 in Louisiana originally from Virginia Botetourt County – Fincastle area 12 miles from Bedford County and one in Tennessee, and a Thomas K. Beale in Virginia, but the population schedules are completely missing for three states and one territory.

Before 1850 the U.S. Census recorded the names of only the heads of households; others in the household were only counted. Beale, if he existed, may have been living in someone else&#x27;s household.

In addition, a man named &quot;Thomas Beall&quot; appears in the customer lists of St. Louis Post Department in 1820. According to the pamphlet, Beale sent a letter from St. Louis in 1822.

Additionally, a Cheyenne legend exists about gold and silver being taken from the West and buried in mountains in the East, dating from roughly 1820.

===Poe&#x27;s alleged authorship===
Researcher Robert Ward and others have suggested that Edgar Allan Poe has been suggested as the pamphlet&#x27;s real author. Poe had an interest in cryptography and placed notices of his deciphering abilities in the Philadelphia paper &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Weekly (Express) Messenger&quot; that invited submissions of ciphers for him to solve. In 1843 he used a cryptogram as a plot device in his short story &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;. From 1820, he was also living in Richmond, Virginia at the time of Beale&#x27;s alleged encounters with Morriss. In February 1826, Poe enrolled as a student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, but with mounting debts, Poe left for Boston in April 1827. One theory is that he left the Beale papers with his sister Rosalie Mackenzie Poe, who gave out pieces of it along with other memorabilia related to her brother until her death in 1874.

However, research and facts debunk Poe&#x27;s authorship. He died in 1849, well before &quot;The Beale Papers&quot; were first published in 1885. The pamphlet also mentions the American Civil War that started in 1861. William Poundstone, an American author and skeptic, had stylometric analysis performed on the pamphlet for his 1983 book &quot;Biggest Secrets&quot;, and found that Poe&#x27;s prose is significantly different from the grammatical structure used by the author who wrote &quot;The Beale Papers&quot;.

=== Statistical analysis ===
Another method to check the validity of the ciphers is to investigate some statistical aspects in different number bases. For example, one can investigate the frequency of the last digit in each number in the ciphers. These frequencies are not uniformly distributed – some digits are more common than others. This is true for all three ciphers.

However, if one considers a base that is relatively prime to 10, then the last digits of the numbers in the unsolved ciphers turn uniform – each digit is equally common. The frequency of the solved cipher stays non-uniform. This indicates a complex behaviour in the solved cipher as one might expect from an encoded message, while the unsolved ciphers have a simpler behaviour.

Humans have limited abilities when it comes to generating random numbers out of thin air. One explanation for the difference between base 10 and the other ones is that the numbers were produced by a human in base 10, which would mean that the ciphers are fraudulent.
==Search attempts==
Despite the Beale Papers&#x27; unproven veracity, treasure hunters have not been deterred from trying to find the vault. The &quot;information&quot; that there is buried treasure in Bedford County has stimulated many expeditions with shovels, and other implements of discovery, looking for likely spots. For more than a hundred years, people have been arrested for trespassing and unauthorized digging; some of them in groups as in the case of people from Pennsylvania in the 1990s.

Several digs were completed at the top of Porter&#x27;s Mountain, one in the late 1980s with the land owner&#x27;s permission as long as any treasure found was split 50/50. However, the treasure hunters found only Civil War artifacts. As the value of these artifacts paid for time and equipment rental, the expedition broke even.

==Media attention==
The story has been the subject of multiple television documentaries, such as the UK&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries&quot; series, a segment in the seventh special of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;; and the 2011 &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; episode of the History Channel TV show &quot;Brad Meltzer&#x27;s Decoded&quot;. There are also several books, and considerable Internet activity. In 2014, the National Geographic TV show &quot;The Numbers Game&quot; referred to the Beale ciphers as one of the strongest passwords ever created. In 2015 the UKTV series &quot;Myth Hunters&quot; (also known as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Past&quot;) devoted one of its season 3 episodes to the topic. Also in 2015, the Josh Gates series &quot;Expedition Unknown&quot; visited Bedford to investigate the Beale Ciphers and search for the treasure.

Simon Singh&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;The Code Book&quot; explains the Beale cipher mystery in one of its chapters.

In 2010, an award-winning animated short film was made concerning the ciphers called &quot;The Thomas Beale Cipher&quot;.

In 2024, Dave Howard from Popular Mechanics wrote an article with interviews from a number of researchers who have been working to break the Beale Ciphers. A cryptographer named James Simpson had made a break in the Ciphers using a series of 111 alphabets ascending in their count to the number 2906, in the 112th alphabet. The Ciphers would then be arranged with a final enclosure of Old English Box Ciphers which created a series of statements about the operations behind illegally tapping Gold Mines in Arizona&#x27;s Superstition Mountains. The Ciphers exposed the details behind the Peralta Land Grab, and the author James Reavis in a relay of information sent to JP Morgan, with a message added from Albert Pike, in a communique of the Knights of the Golden Circle. The Ciphers reveal a second layer of maps in each that detail 1) the location of their Gold Mines in Arizona, 2) the location of their caches of .44cal &amp; 807 Series repeating rifles, and 3) the location of their caches of Gold and Silver in Virginia.

<text>Terence Henry Rooney (born 11 November 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bradford North from 1990 to 2010.

He chaired the Work and Pensions Select Committee from 2005 to 2010, and was the first member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the UK Parliament. Rooney&#x27;s constituency was replaced by Bradford East in boundary changes for the 2010 general election, and he was defeated in the new seat by the Liberal Democrat candidate David Ward.

== Early life and career ==
Rooney was born in Bradford in 1950, attending Buttershaw Comprehensive School and Bradford College, and receiving a Diploma in Higher Education at the latter.

Prior to his election as the MP for Bradford North in a by-election in November 1990, he was a welfare rights adviser at the Bierley Community Centre and a member of Bradford City Council for the University ward. He served as a councillor from 1983 to 1991, a high-profile figure known for his opposition to Militant, chairing the Labour Group from 1988 to 1991, and becoming Deputy Leader of the council from 1990 to 1991.

== Member of Parliament ==
In Parliament, Rooney was elected as Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee from 2005 to 2010. Other posts he held included:

*Secretary of the Yorkshire Group of Labour MPs (1991–2001).
*Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party Work and Pensions Committee (1990–2006).
*Member of the Broadcasting Committee (1991–1997).
*Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Michael Meacher (1997–2001).
*Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Planning, Keith Hill (2003–05).
*Member of the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform (2003–05).
*Member of the Liaison Committee (2005–10).

=== Political interests ===
Rooney&#x27;s main political interests are the welfare state, public sector housing, poverty and industrial relations. He is an active trade unionist and a member of UNISON and formerly Amicus, for which he was the chair of the Amicus Parliamentary Group. Rooney is a firm supporter of the retention of first-past-the-post for Westminster elections, and has also supported more directly redistributive tax and spend policies.

== Personal life ==
Rooney is married to Susanne, a former Bradford councillor, with whom he has three children and nine grandchildren.

He is an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and became the first, and only, member of the church elected to the UK Parliament during his tenure.

<doc id="449429" wikidata="Q1356878" url="?curid=449429" title="Hepadnaviridae">
<text>Hepadnaviridae is a family of viruses. Humans, apes, and birds serve as natural hosts. There are currently 18 species in this family, divided among 5 genera. Its best-known member is hepatitis B virus. Diseases associated with this family include: liver infections, such as hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinomas (chronic infections), and cirrhosis. It is the sole accepted family in the order Blubervirales.

==Taxonomy==
The following genera are recognized:
* &quot;Avihepadnavirus&quot;
* &quot;Orthohepadnavirus&quot;
* &quot;Herpetohepadnavirus&quot;
* &quot;Metahepadnavirus&quot;
* &quot;Parahepadnavirus&quot;

==History and discovery==
Although liver diseases transmissible among human populations were identified early in the history of medicine, the first known hepatitis with a viral etiological agent was Hepatitis A, in the picornaviridae family. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) was identified as an infection distinct from Hepatitis A through its contamination of yellow fever vaccine. The vaccine contained human serum as a stabilizing agent which was HBV-infected. HBV was identified as a new DNA virus in the 1960s, followed a couple of decades later by the discovery of the flavivirus hepatitis C. HBV was first identified in the lab as the &quot;Australia agent&quot; by Blumberg and colleagues in the blood of an Aboriginal transfusion patient. This work earned Blumberg the 1976 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

==Genome==
Hepadnaviruses have very small genomes of partially double-stranded, partially single stranded circular DNA (pdsDNA). The genome consists of two strands, a longer negative-sense strand and a shorter and positive-sense strand of variable length. In the virion these strands are arranged such that the two ends of the long strand meet but are not covalently bonded together. The shorter strand overlaps this divide and is connected to the longer strand on either side of the split through a direct repeat (DR) segment that pairs the two strands together. In replication, the viral pdsDNA is converted in the host cell nucleus to covalently-closed-circular DNA (cccDNA) by the viral polymerase.

Replication involves an RNA intermediate, as in viruses belonging to group VII of Baltimore classification. Four main open reading frames are encoded (ORFs) and the virus has four known genes which encode seven proteins: the core capsid protein, the viral polymerase, surface antigens—preS1, preS2, and S, the X protein and HBeAg. The X protein is thought to be non-structural. Its function and significance are poorly understood but it is suspected to be associated with host gene expression modulation.

===Viral polymerase===
Members of the family &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; encode their own polymerase, rather than co-opting host machinery as some other viruses do. This enzyme is unique among viral polymerases in that it has reverse transcriptase activity to convert RNA into DNA to replicate the genome (the only other human-pathogenic virus family encoding a polymerase with this capability is &quot;Retroviridae&quot;), RNAse activity (used when the DNA genome is synthesized from pgRNA that was packaged in virions for replication to destroy the RNA template and produce the pdsDNA genome), and DNA-dependent-DNA-polymerase activity (used to create cccDNA from pdsDNA in the first step of the replication cycle).

===Envelope proteins===
The hepatitis envelope proteins are composed of subunits made from the viral preS1, preS2, and S genes. The L (for &quot;large&quot;) envelope protein contains all three subunits. The M (for &quot;medium&quot;) protein contains only preS2 and S. The S (for &quot;small&quot;) protein contains only S. The genome portions encoding these envelope protein subunits share both the same frame and the same stop codon, generating nested transcripts on a single open reading frame. The pre-S1 is encoded first (closest to the 5&#x27; end), followed directly by the pre-S2 and the S. When a transcript is made from the beginning of the pre-S1 region, all three genes are included in the transcript and the L protein is produced. When the transcript starts after the pro-S1 at the beginning of the pre-S2 the final protein contains the pre-S2 and S subunits only and therefore is an M protein. The smallest envelope protein containing just the S subunit is made most because it is encoded closest to the 3&#x27; end and comes from the shortest transcript. These envelope proteins can assemble independently of the viral capsid and genome into non-infectious virus-like particles that give the virus a pleomorphic appearance and promote a strong immune response in hosts.

==Replication==
Hepadnaviruses replicate through an RNA intermediate (which they transcribe back into cDNA using reverse transcriptase). The reverse transcriptase becomes covalently linked to a short 3- or 4-nucleotide primer. Most hepadnaviruses will only replicate in specific hosts, and this makes experiments using in vitro methods very difficult.

The virus binds to specific receptors on cells and the core particle enters the cell cytoplasm. This is then translocated to the nucleus, where the partially double stranded DNA is &#x27;repaired&#x27; by the viral polymerase to form a complete circular dsDNA genome (called covalently-closed-circular DNA or cccDNA). The genome then undergoes transcription by the host cell RNA polymerase and the pregenomicRNA (pgRNA) is sent out of the nucleus. The pgRNA is inserted into an assembled viral capsid containing the viral polymerase. Inside this capsid the genome is converted from RNA to pdsDNA through activity of the polymerase as an RNA-dependent-DNA-polymerase and subsequently as an RNAse to eliminate the pgRNA transcript. These new virions either leave the cell to infect others or are immediately dismantled so the new viral genomes can enter the nucleus and magnify the infection. The virions that leave the cell egress through budding.

==Structure==
Viruses in Hepadnaviridae are enveloped, with spherical geometries, and T=4 symmetry. The diameter is around 42 nm. Genomes are circular, around 3.2kb in length. The genome codes for 7 proteins.

==Evolution==
Based on the presence of viral genomes in bird DNA it appears that the hepadnaviruses evolved &gt;. Birds may be the original hosts of the &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; with mammals becoming infected after a bird (see host switch).

Endogenous hepatitis B virus genomes have been described in crocodilian, snake and turtle genomes. This suggests that these viruses have infected vertebrates for over .

Hepadnaviruses have been described in fish and amphibians also. This suggests that this family has co-evolved with the vertebrates.

Phylogenetic trees suggest that the bird viruses originated from those infecting reptiles. Those affecting mammals appear to be more closely related to those found in fish.

=== Nackednaviridae ===
A proposed family of viruses – the &quot;Nackednaviridae&quot; – has been isolated from fish. This family has a similar genomic organisation to that of members of the family &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot;. These two families separated over , suggesting an ancient origin for the family &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot;.

Viruses in the family have non-enveloped, isosahedral structure with T=3 symmetry, smaller than typical &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; virions (about 5% of the latter show a T=3 symmetry). The circular, monopartite genome is about 3 kb much like &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot;. The envelop protein S is accordingly not present, likely the ancestral state by sequence analysis. Unlike &quot;Hepadnaviridae&quot; viruses that usually diverge alongside their hosts, viruses in the family jump hosts more frequently. The &quot;type&quot; for this family is &quot;African cichlid nackednavirus&quot; (ACNDV), formerly &quot;African cichlid hepadnavirus&quot; (ACHBV), a proposed and not-yet-accepted species.

==Cell tropism==
Hepadnaviruses, as their &quot;hepa&quot; name implies, infect liver cells and cause hepatitis. This is true not only of the human pathogen Hepatitis B Virus but also the hepadnaviruses that infect other organisms. The &quot;adhesion&quot; step of the dynamic phase—in which an exterior viral protein stably interacts with a host cell protein—determines cell tropism. In the case of HBV the host receptor is human sodium taurocholate receptor (NTCP), a mediator of bile acid uptake, and the virus anti-receptor is the abundant HB-AgS envelope protein.

<text>Ernest Ross (27 July 1942 – 17 October 2021) was a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundee West from 1979 to 2005. He was a member of the Labour Party.

== Early life ==
Ross was born in Dundee, Scotland, on 27 July 1942. Both his parents were employed by National Cash Register. He completed his primary education at St Joseph&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s primary schools before attending St John&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School. After graduating, he first worked as an engineer in a shipyard, then as a senior quality control engineer at Timex. He joined the Labour Party in 1973.

== Political career ==
Ross was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Dundee West in the 1979 general election, succeeding Peter Doig. He supported Tony Benn in the 1981 Labour Party deputy leadership election. Ross was re-elected five times until his retirement at the 2005 general election, when he was succeeded by Jim McGovern.

Ross sat on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee from July 1997 to March 1999, the Standards and Privileges Committee from October 1996 to March 1997, and the Education &amp; Employment Committee from November 1995 to March 1997. He also served on the Court of Referees from June 1987 to May 2005. While serving on the foreign affairs committee in 1999, he leaked a draft report to foreign secretary Robin Cook concerning the Sandline affair and Sierra Leone. Cook then erroneously mentioned the findings in interviews ahead of the publication of the report. This led to Ross&#x27;s resignation from the committee and suspension from the House of Commons for ten days. He was consequently dubbed &quot;the plumber&quot;, in reference to his ability to &quot;fix leaks&quot;.

Ross was an ardent supporter of Palestinian nationalism, leading to him being nicknamed &quot;the MP for Nablus West&quot;. He backed the decision by Dundee City Council in 1980 to twin the city with Nablus. In April of the following year, he took part in a good-will delegation from Dundee to visit Nablus and Kuwait City.

== Personal life ==
Ross married Jane Moad in 1964. They remained married until his death. Together, they had three children: Stephen, Ali and Karen. He had cancer while serving his first term in Parliament but survived after undergoing keyhole surgery by Alfred Cuschieri.

Ross died on 17 October 2021 in Dundee. He was 79 years old.

<text>Francis Roy (born 29 August 1958) is a former British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Motherwell and Wishaw from 1997 to 2015. He was a Government Whip and Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury from 2006 to 2010, after having served as an Assistant Whip from 2005.

==Early life==

Roy was educated at Our Lady&#x27;s High School, Motherwell, and later at Motherwell College (1992) and Glasgow Caledonian University in Consumer and Management Studies (1994).

Roy was, like many others in the area, a steelworker until he was made redundant in 1991 when Ravenscraig Steelworks closed. He describes the strikes of the 1980s as ensuring his &quot;politicisation was cemented for life&quot;

==Political career==
Roy worked as a parliamentary assistant to Helen Liddell MP before becoming MP for Motherwell and Wishaw. He is the first MP born locally to represent Motherwell and Wishaw.

In 2001 Roy resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Helen Liddell in the wake of the cancellation of a visit to Carfin Grotto by Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Ahern was due to visit the grotto to open a memorial to victims of the Great Famine but the visit was cancelled due to Roy&#x27;s advice of risk of possible sectarian violence, despite statements from Strathclyde Police that they did not consider the visit to be a security risk.

In 2015, Roy worked on Liz Kendall&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the Labour leadership.

He is the father of Brian Francis Roy, former general secretary of Scottish Labour.

Roy was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for political and public service.

<text>Christopher Shaun Ruane (born 18 July 1958) is a Welsh Labour politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Vale of Clwyd from 1997 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019.

==Early life==
Ruane attended Ysgol Mair Roman Catholic primary school in Rhyl. He then attended the Blessed Edward Jones Catholic High School on &quot;Cefndy Road&quot;, also in Rhyl.

At the University of Wales College, Aberystwyth, he gained a BSc in Economics in 1979. From the University of Liverpool he gained a PGCE in 1980. He was a town councillor from 1988 and the Chairman of West Clwyd NUT region.

He was a primary school teacher from 1982 to 1997, and a deputy head from 1991 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==

Ruane contested Clwyd North West in 1992.

He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Peter Hain from 2003 until his resignation in March 2007 in protest against the decision to replace Trident. In 2003, Ruane voted in favour of the Iraq War.

He lost his seat to Conservative James Davies in the 2015 General Election. However, he successfully stood for re-election in the Vale of Clwyd constituency in the 2017 election. before losing it again.

Ruane was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum and supported a second referendum. From 2017 until the 2019 General Election, Ruane served as Labour&#x27;s Shadow Wales Minister. In his role, he regularly campaigned for the need for greater transparency around the Government&#x27;s proposed replacement of European Union funding post-Brexit, on the basis that Wales had historically been a net recipient of funding.

As a Parliamentarian, Ruane tabled written parliamentary questions extensively and has regularly been one of the most prolific users of the procedure amongst Members of Parliament. He used written parliamentary questions to highlight the fall in the number of registered voters from 2001 onwards.

In 2013, he worked with Lord Layard and the Oxford Mindfulness Centre to establish mindfulness practice in the UK Parliament. Since then 260 UK parliamentarians and 460 members of their staff have received mindfulness training. In his period out of office, 2015–17, working with the Mindfulness Initiative (MI), he developed links with politicians and mindfulness advocates in 39 legislatures around the world and has helped to establish mindfulness practice in 13 of those legislatures. In 2018, he re-established the All Party Parliamentary Group on Wellbeing Economics in conjunction with former Chief Secretary to the Treasury Lord Gus O&#x27;Donnell and Lord Layard and has been a consistent campaigner for embedding wellbeing considerations in public policy formulation and decision making.

In 2019, he again lost his seat to Conservative James Davies in the General Election in December of that year.

==Expenses==

In October 2012, the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, blocked the release of data showing which MPs were renting their homes in London to other MPs for financial gain. However, a study of parliamentary records was published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. The study showed that 27 MPS, including Ruane receive rental income from their homes in London while simultaneously claiming rental income from the taxpayer to live at another residence. Ruane owns a flat in London which he bought through the use of parliamentary expenses. Ruane claimed £1,906 a month for his London flat. He also owns a flat about three minutes&#x27; walk away. He said: &quot;I have acted completely within the rules.&quot;

Between January and June 2018, Ruane claimed £9,760. making him the lowest claiming of MPs in North Wales.

==Personal life==
Ruane is married to Gill Roberts and has two children.

<text>David Laurie Ruffley (born 18 April 1962, Bolton) is a former Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, which encompasses Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, having first taken his seat at the 1997 general election.

A solicitor by profession, Ruffley served as special adviser to Ken Clarke (1991–96). He sat on the Treasury Select Committee from 1999 to 2004, on which he was an arch-critic of Gordon Brown, before becoming a whip in 2004. Ruffley served as Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform from 2005 to 2007 and Shadow Minister for Police Reform from 2007 to 2010. In 2010, he was unanimously re-elected to the Treasury Select Committee.

==Early life==
Ruffley was born in Bolton, Lancashire. He went to the Bolton School (Boys&#x27; Division), an independent school in the town. He studied at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, receiving a BA in law in 1985. From 1985 to 1991, he worked for solicitors Clifford Chance in London. He was then a special adviser to Ken Clarke, first as Secretary of State for Education and Science (1991–92), then as Home Secretary (1992–93), and finally as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1993–96). From 1996 to 1997, he was an economic consultant to the Conservative Party and Vice President of the Small Business Bureau.

During this time, he was an adviser to the Grant Maintained Schools Foundation (1993–96), as well as governor of St Marylebone School (1992–94) and Pimlico School (1994–96). He would later be a governor of Bolton School (1997–99), which he had attended himself.

Ruffley sought selection for parliamentary seats, being beaten to selection in Harrogate and Knaresborough by Norman Lamont. After Richard Spring was selected to fight West Suffolk, selection for Spring&#x27;s former seat of Bury St Edmunds with changed boundaries, was won by Ruffley. He won by a majority of 368 in 1997, increasing this at subsequent elections to 2,503, 9,930 and 12,380. In December 2013 he was reselected as the Bury St Edmunds Conservative parliamentary candidate for the 2015 election.

==Parliamentary career==

===Backbencher===
Ruffley served on William Hague&#x27;s campaign team in the 1997 party leadership election.

Ruffley was voted onto the powerful Treasury Select Committee in 1999. He remained on the committee until 2004, and criticised then-Chancellor Gordon Brown&#x27;s handling of the economy, dubbing him &#x27;Gambling Gordon&#x27; in 2002. He criticised Brown for hiding higher taxes by counting tax credits as a negative income tax, citing the OECD&#x27;s classification of it as an increase in spending.

In the 2001 leadership election, Ruffley initially supported Michael Portillo, and publicly declared support for his former boss Ken Clarke after Portillo was knocked out in the final MPs&#x27; ballot. He voted against Iain Duncan Smith in 2003. In the leadership election that followed the vote of no confidence in Duncan Smith, Ruffley was variously described as being a &#x27;likely supporter&#x27; of Michael Howard or a member of David Davis&#x27;s &#x27;wider [campaign] team&#x27;.

On his return to the backbenches, Ruffley resumed an active role in representing his constituents. He voted against equal marriage for same sex couples

===Shadow Minister===
With Howard as leader, Ruffley became a whip on 15 March 2004, after the resignation of David Curry.

In December 2005, he was appointed by David Cameron as the Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform.

In 2006, a group that included BBC Radio Suffolk and the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot; saw the failure of their programme to get St Edmund named as the patron saint of England. Ruffley had taken up the cause and helped deliver a large petition to the government in London. Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected the request, but St Edmund was named patron saint of Suffolk.

From July 2007 to 2010, Ruffley was Shadow Minister for Police Reform replacing Nick Herbert MP. In 2008, he took charge of reducing the safety and health burden on police officers, and obtained figures showing police spent less than two-thirds of their time on patrol. He said that there was an &#x27;emerging crisis of public confidence&#x27; in the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), after 700 people were falsely accused of having criminal records in the year to February 2008, and highlighted the risk posed by CRB checks to work experience. He pledged to end police moonlighting, after it was discovered in January 2009 that 4,300 officers held second jobs. He campaigned against speed cameras being used to &#x27;milk&#x27; motorists of £250,000 a day.

===Since 2010===
He was voted back onto the Treasury Select Committee in November 2010, replacing David Rutley.

On the select committee, Ruffley has opposed the Payments Council&#x27;s plans to withdraw personal cheques by 2018, saying that it &#x27;scared the pants off Middle England&#x27;, accusing the Council of &#x27;rank incompetence&#x27;, and calling for the council&#x27;s chairman to resign. He has also criticised the withdrawal of cheque guarantee cards in July 2011, saying that the public were not given sufficient warning.

In January 2011 Ruffley interrogated bankers appearing before the select committee, including Barclays&#x27; chief executive Bob Diamond, whom Ruffley asked whether he was &quot;grateful to the British taxpayer&quot; for the estimated £100bn of benefit of the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package to the wider banking system. Ruffley has opposed the Liberal Democrats&#x27; plan to give the government&#x27;s shares in the partly nationalised Lloyds and RBS to each of the 46 million people on the electoral roll, and called instead for them to be sold to raise money for a cut in the basic rate of income tax.

In July 2011, Ruffley supported Sajid Javid&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill to limit government debt to 40% of gross domestic product.

He voted against the Cameron–Clegg coalition government in 2013 on the issue of British military intervention in the Syrian civil war.

On 24 July 2014, it was reported that Ruffley was under investigation by the Conservatives&#x27; Chief Whip, Michael Gove, with the possibility that disciplinary measures may be taken against him. This follows his police caution from the Metropolitan Police for Ruffley&#x27;s common assault of his former partner.

On 28 July 2014 he announced that he would stand down at the 2015 general election as a result of the &quot;protracted media debate&quot; regarding his future as an MP, because he believed it would not &quot;serve the interests&quot; of the Conservative Party. In November 2014 Jo Churchill was selected as the Conservative PPC for the constituency

==Personal life==
On 17 June 2010, Ruffley suffered minor injuries after jumping into the path of an oncoming train at Victoria Station, London. He missed the live rail and the train safely passed over him, inflicting only cuts and bruises. The police treated the incident as &quot;non-suspicious&quot;. Ruffley was reported to have been suffering from depression at the time and was granted sick leave to recover. He returned to work in October 2010.
In March 2016 Ruffley was reported to have been convicted for drink-driving following his arrest on 27 January when he was found slumped over the wheel of his car following a crash in Page Street, Westminster. He was reported to be nearly three times over the legal limit and received a two-year ban and ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid community service.

<text>Namibia uses regions as its first-level subnational administrative divisions. Since 2013, it has 14 regions which in turn are subdivided into 121 constituencies.

Upon Namibian independence, the pre-existing subdivisions from the South African administration were taken over. Since then, demarcations and numbers of regions and constituencies of Namibia are tabled by delimitation commissions and accepted or declined by the National Assembly.

In 1992, the &quot;1st Delimitation Commission&quot;, chaired by Judge President Johan Strydom, proposed that Namibia should be divided into 13 regions. The suggestion was approved in the lower house, The National Assembly. In 2014, the &quot;4th Delimitation Commission&quot; amended the number of regions to fourteen.

The most urbanised and economically active regions are the Khomas and Erongo region, with Khomas home to the capital, Windhoek, and Erongo home to Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.

<doc id="449443" wikidata="Q247990" url="?curid=449443" title="Atlantic spotted dolphin">
<text>The Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) is a dolphin found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Older members of the species have a very distinctive spotted coloration all over their bodies.

==Taxonomy==
The Atlantic spotted dolphin was first described by Cuvier in 1828. Considerable variation in the physical form of individuals occurs in the species, and specialists have long been uncertain as to the correct taxonomic classification. Currently, just one species is recognised, but a large, particularly spotty variant commonly found near Florida quite possibly may be classified as a formal subspecies or indeed a species in its own right.

Atlantic spotted dolphins in the Bahamas have been observed mating with bottlenose dolphins. Rich LeDuc has published data that suggest the Atlantic spotted dolphin may be more closely related to the bottlenose dolphins (genus &quot;Tursiops&quot;) than to other members of the genus &quot;Stenella&quot;. More recent studies in the 2020s indicate that this is a consequence of reticulate evolution (such as past hybridization between &quot;Stenella&quot; (spotted dolphins) and ancestral &quot;Tursiops&quot; (bottlenose dolphins)) and incomplete lineage sorting, and thus support &quot;T&quot;. &quot;truncatus&quot; and &quot;T. aduncus&quot; belonging to the same genus. This likely explains why Atlantic spotted dolphins can mate with both species of bottlenose dolphins.

==Description==

The coloring of the Atlantic spotted dolphin varies enormously as it grows, and is usually classified into age-dependent phases known as two-tone, speckled, mottled, and fused. Calves are a fairly uniform gray-white, with one or no spots. When they are weaned, speckling occurs, typically between 3 and 4 years and lasting for an average of 5 years. A juvenile is considered mottled when it develops merging gray and white spots on the dorsal surface and black spots on the ventral surface. This usually happens between age 8 or 9. A fused pattern is reached when dark and white spots are on both the ventral and dorsal sides. As the animal matures, the spots become denser and spread until the body appears black with white spots at full maturation.

In comparison to other dolphin species, the Atlantic spotted dolphin is medium-sized. Newborn calves are about long, while adults can reach a length of and a weight of in males, and and in females.
Compared to the much smaller pantropical spotted dolphin, the Atlantic spotted dolphin is more robust. It shares its habitat with the pantropical spotted dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin.

The species exhibits a range of about ten different vocalizations, including whistles, buzzes, squawks and barks, each corresponding with different behaviors.

==Behavior==
Atlantic spotted dolphins are extremely gregarious animals, which gather in complex social groups of 5–15, often in mixed groups with common bottlenose dolphins. They are fast swimmers and known for their bow-riding and long, shallow leaping behaviors. Their mating system consists of one male mating with several females, and the pod is highly protective over pregnant females. The dolphin&#x27;s gestational period is ~11 months, and the mother cares for its calf for up to 5 years, with the help of the rest of her group.
These animals are cooperative hunters that hunt in groups at night. They strategically encircle their prey, which consists mostly of small fish, benthic invertebrates, and cephalopods such as squid. They can dive to depths of up to and can stay beneath the surface for up to 10 minutes at a time. When showing aggression towards other species, these dolphins make use of more contact behaviors such as biting and chasing than when being aggressive towards members of their species, in which they usually rely on display behaviors.

==Population and distribution==
The species is endemic to the temperate and tropical areas of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been widely observed in the western end of the Gulf Stream, between Florida and Bermuda. Off the Bahamas, tourism industries to swim with dolphins are available. It is also present in the Gulf of Mexico. More infrequent sightings have been made further east, off the Azores and Canary Islands. Northerly sightings have been made as far north as Cape Cod across to the southwestern tip of Spain. They are certainly present further south, too, as far as Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil and across to west Africa, but their distribution is poorly understood in these areas.

About 20 years ago, only about 80 dolphins were in the Bahamas. Now, almost 200 dolphins are found there. On account of their similar appearance to other dolphins in their range, it is difficult to be sure of the Atlantic spotted dolphin&#x27;s population. A conservative estimate is around 100,000 individuals.

==Human interaction==
Some Atlantic spotted dolphins, particularly some of those are around the Bahamas, have become habituated to human contact. In these areas, cruises to watch and even swim with the dolphins are common. They are usually not held in captivity.

Atlantic spotted dolphins are an occasional target of harpoon fishermen, and every year some creatures are trapped and killed in gill nets, but these activities are not currently believed to be threatening the survival of the species. This species lives in the mesopelagic layer of the ocean. These dolphins are not threatened by extinction, however, commercial trade may affect their evolution and sustainability. Sometimes they are killed by harpoons off St. Vincent.

==Conservation==
The Atlantic spotted dolphin is included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. They are also marked as Least Concern of the Conservation Action Plan for the World&#x27;s Cetaceans.

<doc id="449444" wikidata="Q174199" url="?curid=449444" title="Common bottlenose dolphin">
<text>The common bottlenose dolphin or Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is one of three species of bottlenose dolphin in the genus &quot;Tursiops&quot;. The common bottlenose dolphin is a very familiar dolphin due to the wide exposure it receives in human care in marine parks and dolphinariums, and in movies and television programs. Common bottlenose dolphins inhabit temperate and tropical oceans throughout the world, absent only from polar waters. While formerly known simply as the bottlenose dolphin, this term is now applied to the genus &quot;Tursiops&quot; as a whole. As considerable genetic variation has been described within this species, even between neighboring populations, many experts think additional species may be recognized.

==Description==
Common bottlenose dolphins have a grey coloring, a short beak, a single blowhole, and a hooked dorsal fin. The bottlenose is between long, and weigh between . Males are generally larger and heavier than females. In most parts of the world, adult length is between ; weight ranges between . Dolphins have a short and well-defined snout that looks like an old-fashioned gin bottle, which is the source for their common name.
Like all whales and dolphins, though, the snout is not a true nose; the nose instead evolved into the blowhole on the top of their heads. Their necks are more flexible than other dolphins&#x27; due to five of their seven vertebrae not being fused together like in other dolphins.

== Taxonomy ==
Until 1998, all bottlenose dolphins were considered one species &quot;T. truncatus.&quot; That year, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. aduncus&quot;) was recognized as a separate species. The two species are thought to have split during the mid-Pleistocene, about 1 million years ago.

Currently, four common bottlenose dolphin subspecies are recognized:
:&quot;T. t. truncatus&quot;, the nominotypical subspecies
:&quot;T. t. ponticus&quot;, or the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin
:&quot;T. t. gephyreus&quot;, or Lahille&#x27;s bottlenose dolphin
:&quot;T. t. nuuanu&quot;, or the Eastern Tropical Pacific bottlenose dolphin

Bottlenose dolphins along the southern California and Baja California coasts were previously recognized as the Pacific bottlenose dolphin, &quot;T. t. gillii&quot;, originally described as distinct species &quot;T. gillii&quot;. The name has since been reclassified as a junior synonym of &quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;. Additionally, bottlenose dolphins along the Pacific coast of Central America were described as &quot;T. nuuanu&quot; in 1911. A review of &quot;T. gillii&quot; and &quot;T. nuuanu&quot; specimens supported &quot;T. gillii&quot; as a synonym of &quot;T. truncatus&quot; and &quot;T. nuaanu&quot; as a unique subspecies.

A 2020 study identified four distinct lineages within &quot;T. truncatus&quot;, each of which could be a distinct subspecies: a lineage native to the coastal regions of the western North Atlantic (off the coast of North America), an offshore lineage found worldwide in pelagic ecosystems, a lineage native to the Mediterranean, and a lineage restricted to the Black Sea (previously described as &quot;T. truncatus ponticus&quot;). The study noted only weak differentiation between the Black Sea and Mediterranean lineages, and found them to form a sister group to the offshore lineage, indicating that they likely descended from offshore bottlenoses that colonized the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The clade containing the offshore, Mediterranean, and Black Sea populations was sister to the western North Atlantic lineage, indicating deep divergence between the two. An analysis of the morphology, genetics, and evolutionary divergence of the western North Atlantic coastal and offshore ecotypes supported the coastal form as being a distinct species. While the offshore type was retained within &quot;T. truncatus&quot;, the coastal dolphins are now recognized as Tamanend&#x27;s bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. erebennus&quot;).

==Ecology and behavior==

As a very social species, the common bottlenose dolphin lives in groups called pods that typically number about 15 individuals, but group size varies from pairs of dolphins to over 100 or even occasionally over 1,000 animals for short periods of time. Their geographic range dictates a lot of their behaviors including the densities of dolphins while travelling. The types of groups include: nursery groups, juvenile groups, and groups of adult males. Male dolphins tend to form pair bonds, which are the strongest of dolphin bonds, while females stay with their calves for 3–8 years and then tend to stay in social groups.

=== Echolocation ===

Dolphin use of their blowholes and nasal sacs to communicate and their ability to echolocate with their melon are keys to their success. Echolocation uses sound waves that are emitted and received to understand their surroundings. As sound waves are emitted they are bounced back and received as nerve impulses in the brain which can be interpreted at a frequency of 120 kHz. This allows dolphin to know the location, shape and size of objects aiding in navigation, communication, hunting, and awareness of predators nearby. Dolphins can emit both high and low frequency sounds, but lower frequencies travel best in the water allowing for the best results while using echolocation.

===Diet===
Its diet consists mainly of eels, squid, shrimp and a wide variety of fishes. It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. Dolphin pods often work as a team to harvest schools of fish, though they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is a form of sonar.

The diet of common bottlenose dolphin pods varies depending on area. Along the U.S. Atlantic coast, the main prey includes Atlantic croakers (&quot;Micropogonias undulatus&quot;), spot (&quot;Leiostomus xanthurus&quot;) and American silver perch (&quot;Bairdiella chrysoura&quot;), while in South Africa, African maasbankers (&quot;Trachurus delagoa&quot;), olive grunters (&quot;Pomadasys olivaceus&quot;), and pandora (&quot;Pagellus bellottii&quot;) are common bottlenose dolphin&#x27;s typical prey. Their hunting strategies depend on what they are eating; for example, with fish they will circle the school and use their echolocation to feed on them one by one. They can also stun fish using sonar or smash them into corals depending on their speed.

According to combined stomach content and stable isotope analyses in the Gulf of Cádiz, although European conger (&quot;Conger conger&quot;) and European hake (&quot;Merluccius merluccius&quot;) are most important prey of common bottlenose dolphins, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ13C and δ15N shows that Sparidae species; seabreams (&quot;Diplodus annularis&quot; and &quot;D. bellottii&quot;), rubberlip grunt (&quot;Plectorhinchus mediterraneus&quot;), and common pandora, (&quot;Pagellus erythrinus&quot;) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (&quot;Scomber colias&quot;, &quot;S. japonicus&quot; and &quot;S. scombrus&quot;), European conger, red bandfish (&quot;Cepola macrophthalma&quot;) and European pilchard (&quot;Sardina pilchardus&quot;) are the assimilated diet.

Research indicates that the type and range of fish in a dolphin&#x27;s diet can have a significant impact on its health and metabolism. Dolphins eat 10–20% of their body weight each day, with pregnant and nursing females eating the most.

===Communication===
Dolphins use sound for communication, including squeaks emitted from the blowhole, whistles emitted from nasal sacs below the blowhole, and sounds emitted through body language, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water. The dolphins address each other individually by matching each other&#x27;s signature whistle.
While communicating with each other, bottlenose dolphins grab ahold of each other with their teeth, which forms unique knicks and notches on the dorsal fins making them individually identifiable. These unique identifiers are universally used in studies around the globe.

====Child–directed communication====
Common bottlenose dolphin signature whistles, which are in a higher frequency range than humans can hear, have an important role in facilitating mother–calf contact. In the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program&#x27;s library of recordings were 19 female common bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) producing signature whistles both with and without the presence of their dependent calf. In all 19 cases, the mother dolphin changed the same signature whistle when the calf was present, by reaching a higher frequency, or using a wider frequency range. Similarly, humans use higher fundamental frequencies and a wider pitch range to inflect child–directed speech (CDS). This has rarely been discovered in other species. The researchers stated that CDS benefits for humans are cueing the child to pay attention, long-term bonding, and promoting the development of lifelong vocal learning, with parallels in these bottlenose dolphins in an example of convergent evolution.

===Reproduction===
 Mating behavior of the bottlenose dolphin is polygamous. Although they can breed throughout the year, it mostly occurs in spring, and with a 12 month gestation period mating season and birthing season overlap. Males form alliances, or pair bonds, to seek an estrous female and they attempt to breed the most while keeping other males away from viable females. For a chance to mate with the female, males separate the female from her home range. Females bear a calf every three to six years. After a year-long gestation period, females bear a single calf. Newborn calves are between long and weigh between . The calf&#x27;s suckling lasts between 18 and 20 months and they are weaned between three and eight years of age. Females typically reproduce every 3 to 6 years when sexual maturity is reached, and there is no recorded menopause in the bottlenose dolphin species. Sexual maturity varies by population, and ranges from 5–14 years of age; sexual maturity occurs between 8 and 13 years for males and 5 to 10 years for females.

===Life expectancy===
The average life span of common bottlenose dolphins is at least 40 years old and up to 60 years old, with females typically living longer than males. but in captivity they have been known to live to up to 51 years old.

The main threats to bottlenose dolphins depends on their geographic range. Dolphins living in shallow coastal waters tend to be the top predator with the exception of young dolphins having to be protected from sharks by their moms. Dolphin communities out in the deep ocean have more threats with shark attacks but living in pods allows them to survive. Other predators, mainly impacting newborns, include sting rays and orcas.

===Intelligence===
Common bottlenose dolphins have an encephalization quotient of 5.26, which is even higher than chimpanzees. This more than likely contributes to their high intelligence.

Many investigations of bottlenose intelligence include tests of mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. This intelligence has driven considerable interaction with humans. The common bottlenose dolphin is popular in aquarium shows and television programs such as &quot;Flipper&quot;. It has also been trained for military uses such as locating sea mines or detecting and marking enemy divers, as for example in the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish toward the fishermen and eating the fish that escape the fishermen&#x27;s nets.

==Distribution==
Although dolphins inhabit every ocean of the planet including some rivers and other ecosystems, the common bottlenose dolphin can be found in the warmer oceanic regions specifically in temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans around the world. The global population has been estimated at 600,000. Some bottlenose populations live closer to the shore (inshore populations) and others live further out to sea (offshore populations). Generally, offshore populations are larger, darker, and have proportionally shorter fins and beaks. Offshore populations can migrate up to in a season, but inshore populations tend to move less. However, some inshore populations make long migrations in response to El Niño events. The species has occurred as far as 50° north in eastern Pacific waters, possibly as a result of warm water events. The coastal dolphins appear to adapt to warm, shallow waters. It has a smaller body and larger flippers, for maneuverability and heat dispersal. They can be found in harbors, bays, lagoons and estuaries. Offshore dolphins, however, are adapted to cooler, deeper waters. Certain qualities in their blood suggest they are more suited to deep diving. Their considerably larger body protects them against predators and helps them retain heat.

==Other human interactions==

Some interactions with humans are harmful to the dolphins. Dolphin hunting industry exists in multiple countries including Japan, where common bottlenose dolphins are hunted for food annually in the town of Taiji, and the Faroe Islands. Also, dolphins are sometimes killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing.

Tião was a well-known solitary male bottlenose dolphin that was first spotted in the town of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with him. The dolphin later became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which earned it the nickname of killer dolphin.

Fungie was another solitary male bottlenose, living in close contact with humans in Dingle Harbour, Ireland, from 1983 until his disappearance in 2020. He became a symbol of the town, although some doubt exists over whether he was a single dolphin.

A lonely and potentially sexually frustrated dolphin was blamed in August 2024 for a spike in attacks on swimmers in Mihama, a Japanese seaside town.

==Conservation==
The North Sea, Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations of the common bottlenose dolphin are listed in Appendix II to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) of the Bonn Convention, since they have an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international cooperation organized by tailored agreements.

The species is included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning international trade (including in parts/derivatives) is regulated.

Estimated population of a few specific areas are including: 
The species is covered by the Agreement on Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS), the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region, and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia.

=== Marine pollution ===

Common bottlenose dolphins are the most common apex predators found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems along the southern coast of the US, thus serve as an important indicator species of bioaccumulation and health of the ecosystem.

It is believed that some diseases commonly found in dolphins are related to human behaviors, such as water pollution. Water pollution is linked to point and non-point source pollution. Point source pollution comes from a single source such as an oil spill and/or chemical discharge from a specific facility. The environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill caused a direct impact and still serves as a long-term impact of future populations. Common bottlenose dolphins use these important habitats for calving, foraging, and feeding. Environmental impacts or changes from chemicals or marine pollution can alter and disrupt endocrine systems, affecting future populations. For example, oil spills have been related to lung and reproductive diseases in female dolphins. A recent study suggested signs of lung disease and impaired stress in 32 dolphins that were captured and assessed in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, US. Out of these 32 dolphins, 10 were found pregnant and, upon a 47-month check up, only 20% produced feasible calves, compared to a previous success rate of 83%, in the same area. It is believed that a recent oil spill in this area is partially to blame for these severely low numbers.

Dense human development along the eastern coast of Florida and intense agricultural activity have resulted in increased freshwater inputs, changes in drainage patterns, and altered water quality (i.e. chemical contamination, high nutrient input, decreased salinity, decreased sea grass habitat, and eutrophication. High nutrient input from agriculture chemicals and fertilizers causes eutrophication and hypoxia, causing a severe reduction in water quality. Excess of phosphorus and nitrogen from these non-point sources deplete the natural cycle of oxygen by overconsumption of algae. Harmful algal blooms are responsible for dead zones and unusual mortality events of common bottlenose dolphins consuming these toxic fish from the brevetoxin produced by the dinoflagellate &quot;Karenia brevis&quot;. Brevetoxins are neurotoxins that can cause acute respiratory and neurological symptoms, including death, in marine mammals, sea turtles, birds, and fishes.

<doc id="449446" wikidata="Q875066" url="?curid=449446" title="Weekly Shōnen Sunday">
<text>is a weekly manga magazine published in Japan by Shogakukan since March 1959. Contrary to its title, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; issues are released on Wednesdays. &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; has sold over 1.8billion copies since 1986, making it the fourth best selling manga magazine, only behind &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; and &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; was first published on March 17, 1959, as a response to its rival &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;. The debut issue featured Shigeo Nagashima, the star player of the Yomiuri Giants on the cover, and a congratulatory article by Isoko Hatano, a noted child psychologist.

Despite its name, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; is published on Wednesday. The &quot;Sunday&quot; in the name was the creation of its first editor, Kiichi Toyoda, who wanted the title to be evocative of a relaxing weekend.

 &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;″s distinctive &quot;pointing finger&quot; that appears in the lower corner of every page on the left side of the magazine made its subtle debut in the 4/5 issue from 1969. This understated feature, ever present but easily overlooked, was referenced as a plot element in &quot;20th Century Boys&quot;. &quot;Sunday&quot;″s more noticeable mascot, a helmeted fish, debuted in the 1980s.

Prior to the 1990s and 2000s no serial in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; had run over 40 volumes, but that began to change with series such as &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Major&quot;, &quot;Inuyasha&quot;, &quot;Karakuri Circus&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hayate the Combat Butler&quot;, &quot;Zettai Karen Children&quot;, and &quot;Be Blues!&quot;, which maintained a high level of popularity.

In a rare event due to the closeness of the two magazines&#x27; founding dates, &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; released a special combined issue on March 19, 2008. In addition, other commemorative events, merchandise, and manga crossovers were planned for the following year as part of the celebrations. The book &quot;Shonen Sunday 1983&quot; was published on July 15, 2009 to celebrate the anniversary and the magazine&#x27;s heyday. It reprints manga from 1983, such as &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot;, and has interviews with their creators as well as artists who were inspired by the series from that period, such as Gosho Aoyama.

To celebrate &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;″s 55th anniversary, 55 new manga series were launched in the print and online magazines &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, &quot;Shōnen Sunday S&quot;, &quot;Ura Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Club Sunday&quot; throughout the year beginning in March 2014.

<doc id="449447" wikidata="Q1476763" url="?curid=449447" title="Permit-class submarine">
<text>The Permit&quot;-class submarine(known as the Thresher&quot; class until the lead boat was lost) was a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (hull classification symbol SSN) in service with the United States Navy from the early 1960s until 1996. They were a significant improvement on the , with greatly improved sonar, diving depth, and silencing. They were the forerunners of all subsequent US Navy SSN designs. They served from the 1960s through to the early 1990s, when they were decommissioned due to age. They were followed by the and classes.

The &quot;Thresher&quot; class was one of several results from a study commissioned in 1956 by Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Arleigh Burke. In &quot;Project Nobska&quot;, the Committee on Undersea Warfare of the United States National Academy of Sciences, collaborating with numerous other agencies, considered the lessons of submarine warfare and anti-submarine warfare learned from various prototypes and experimental platforms. The design was managed under project SCB 188.

==Design==
The new class kept the proven S5W reactor plant from the immediately preceding s, but were a radical change in many other ways. The &quot;Thresher&quot;s had the large bow-mounted sonar sphere and angled, amidships torpedo tubes used in the concurrently-built . This placed the sonar sphere in the optimum position for detection of targets at long range. &quot;Tullibee&quot; was an alternate design optimized for anti-submarine warfare, much smaller and slower than the &quot;Thresher&quot;s and with a quiet turbo-electric propulsion system. Although they used the same HY-80 steel (yield strength ) as the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s, the &quot;Thresher&quot;s″ pressure hulls were made using an improved design that extended test depth to . The engineering spaces were also redesigned, with the turbines supported on &quot;rafts&quot; that were suspended from the hull on isolation mounts for acoustic quieting. Drag was reduced, with external fittings kept to a minimum and the sail greatly reduced in size.

The small sail of &quot;Thresher&quot; (the smallest fitted to an American SSN) compensated for the increased drag of the longer hull, giving &quot;Thresher&quot; a top speed of , the same as the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s, according to one recollection. However, the small sail had disadvantages as well, including room for only one periscope and a reduced number of electronics masts, less convenient surfaced operation in rough seas, and an increased possibility of &quot;broaching&quot; (inadvertent surfacing) at periscope depth in rough seas.

Only &quot;Thresher&quot; was fitted with a five-bladed symmetric screw, very similar to the ones originally fitted to the &quot;Skipjack&quot;s, which allowed her to reach this speed. During trials of the &quot;Skipjack&quot; class, it was found that the propeller produced noise below cavitation depth. It was determined that the source of this noise, called blade-rate, was the blades of the screw vibrating when they hit the wake of the sail and control surfaces. This produced a noise that could carry for many miles and could be used by an enemy submarine to set up a firing solution because the frequency of blade-rate was directly related to the speed of the submarine (the RPM of the screw). The solution was to either make the screw smaller so it did not hit the wakes of the sail and control surfaces, which would cavitate more easily because of its increased speed, or have a large screw that gently interacted with these areas of disturbed water. The latter solution was chosen for all subsequent American SSNs. &quot;Permit&quot; and later submarines of this class had seven-bladed skewback screws, which reduced the problem of blade-rate, but reduced the submarines&#x27; top speed to . &quot;Jack&quot; was designed with counter-rotating screws, each of which were smaller than the standard seven-bladed screw, as an alternative solution to the blade-rate problem.

The class received mid-life upgrades in the late 1970s and 1980s, including the sonar suite with a retractable towed array, Mk 117 torpedo fire control equipment, and other electronics upgrades.

==Armament==
The boats had their torpedo tubes moved to the middle of the hull and angled outboard. This made available the required large space in the bow for the BQQ-2 (BQQ-5 as modernized from the late 1970s) sonar sphere, a new and powerful low-frequency detection sensor. Initially armed with Mark 37 torpedoes, by the late 1960s they carried the improved Mark 48 and the nuclear UUM-44 SUBROC short-range anti-submarine missile, replacing up to six Mk 48s. The &quot;Thresher&quot;s were the first class fitted with the Mark 113 fire control system that enabled the use of SUBROC; they were later upgraded with the Mark 117 system. In the late 1970s the UGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile was introduced; typically four were carried in place of Mk 48s.

The maximum weapons load was 23 torpedoes/missiles or, theoretically, up to 42 Mk 57, Mk 60, or Mk 67 mines. Any mix of mines, torpedoes, and missiles could be included.

==Construction==
The first submarine commissioned in the class was the ill-fated , and so the class was known by her name. When &quot;Thresher&quot; was lost on 10 April 1963, the class took the name of the second ship in the class, . &quot;Thresher&quot; had numerous advanced design features and embodied the future of US Navy submarine design, and her loss was a serious blow. As a result, the SUBSAFE program was instituted to correct design flaws and introduce strict manufacturing and construction quality control in critical systems. The seawater and main ballast systems of future classes (&quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class SSNs and SSBNs) were redesigned, and some &quot;Thresher&quot;s and other submarines were rebuilt to SUBSAFE standards. SUBSAFE includes specific training of SUBSAFE quality assurance inspectors in the engineering crew, and tracks extremely detailed information about every component of a submarine that is subject to sea pressure. Joints in any equipment carrying seawater must be welded (not brazed), and every hull penetration larger than a specified size can be quickly shut by a remote hydraulic mechanism. The program has been very successful, as no SUBSAFE submarines have been lost as of 2023 ( was not SUBSAFE).

, , and were designed under project SCB 188M and were fitted with a larger sail, to house additional masts, and built 13 feet 9 inches longer than the other units of the class to include more SUBSAFE features, additional reserve buoyancy, more intelligence gathering equipment and improved accommodations. was completed with the larger sail but the standard hull.

The engine room of was lengthened by to accommodate an experimental direct-drive propulsion system using concentric counter-rotating propellers. Although counter-rotating propellers produced impressive gains in speed on the experimental , in &quot;Jack&quot; the results were disappointing because of the difficulty in sealing the shaft. &quot;Jack&quot; was also used to test polymer ejection that could reduce flow noises that degraded sonar performance.

==Boats in class==
The gaps in the hull number sequence were taken by the unique , and the , , and fleet ballistic missile submarine classes.

<text>Flavivirus, renamed Orthoflavivirus in 2023, is a genus of positive-strand RNA viruses in the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;. The genus includes the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis, as well as insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) such as cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), Palm Creek virus (PCV), and Parramatta River virus (PaRV). While dual-host flaviviruses can infect vertebrates as well as arthropods, insect-specific flaviviruses are restricted to their competent arthropods. The means by which flaviviruses establish persistent infection in their competent vectors and cause disease in humans depends upon several virus-host interactions, including the intricate interplay between flavivirus-encoded immune antagonists and the host antiviral innate immune effector molecules.

Flaviviruses are named for the yellow fever virus; the word &quot;flavus&quot; means &#x27;yellow&#x27; in Latin, and yellow fever in turn is named from its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims.

Flaviviruses share several common aspects: common size (40–65 nm), symmetry (enveloped, icosahedral nucleocapsid), nucleic acid (positive-sense, single-stranded RNA around 10,000–11,000 bases), and appearance under the electron microscope.

Most of these viruses are primarily transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod (mosquito or tick), and hence are classified as arboviruses. Human infections with most of these arboviruses are incidental, as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect the arthropods needed to continue the virus life-cycle – humans are then a dead end host. The exceptions to this are the &quot;yellow fever virus&quot;, &quot;dengue virus&quot; and &quot;zika virus&quot;. These three viruses still require mosquito vectors but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts (although they continue to have important animal transmission routes, as well).

Other virus transmission routes for arboviruses include handling infected animal carcasses, blood transfusion, sex, childbirth and consumption of unpasteurised milk products. Transmission from nonhuman vertebrates to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod however mostly occurs with low probability. For example, early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious.

The known non-arboviruses of the &quot;flavivirus&quot; family reproduce in either arthropods or vertebrates, but not both, with one odd member of the genus affecting a nematode.

==Structure==

Flaviviruses are enveloped and spherical and have icosahedral geometries with a pseudo T=3 symmetry. The virus particle diameter is around 50 nm.

== Genome ==
Flaviviruses have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes which are non-segmented and around 10–11 kbp in length. In general, the genome encodes three structural proteins (Capsid, prM, and Envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). The genomic RNA is modified at the 5′ end of positive-strand genomic RNA with a cap-1 structure (me7-GpppA-me2).

==Life cycle==

Flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cells. The genome mimics the cellular mRNA molecule in all aspects except for the absence of the poly-adenylated (poly-A) tail. This feature allows the virus to exploit cellular apparatuses to synthesize both structural and non-structural proteins, during replication. The cellular ribosome is crucial to the replication of the flavivirus, as it translates the RNA, in a similar fashion to cellular mRNA, resulting in the synthesis of a single polyprotein.

Cellular RNA cap structures are formed via the action of an RNA triphosphatase, with guanylyltransferase, N7-methyltransferase and 2′-O methyltransferase. The virus encodes these activities in its non-structural proteins. The NS3 protein encodes a RNA triphosphatase within its helicase domain. It uses the helicase ATP hydrolysis site to remove the γ-phosphate from the 5′ end of the RNA. The N-terminal domain of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) has both the N7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities necessary for forming mature RNA cap structures. RNA binding affinity is reduced by the presence of ATP or GTP and enhanced by S-adenosyl methionine. This protein also encodes a 2′-O methyltransferase.

Once translated, the polyprotein is cleaved by a combination of viral and host proteases to release mature polypeptide products. Nevertheless, cellular post-translational modification is dependent on the presence of a poly-A tail; therefore this process is not host-dependent. Instead, the poly-protein contains an autocatalytic feature which automatically releases the first peptide, a virus specific enzyme. This enzyme is then able to cleave the remaining poly-protein into the individual products. One of the products cleaved is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, responsible for the synthesis of a negative-sense RNA molecule. Consequently, this molecule acts as the template for the synthesis of the genomic progeny RNA.

&quot;Flavivirus&quot; genomic RNA replication occurs on rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes in membranous compartments. New viral particles are subsequently assembled. This occurs during the budding process which is also responsible for the accumulation of the envelope and cell lysis.

A G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (also known as ADRBK1) appears to be important in entry and replication for several viruses in &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;.

Humans, mammals, mosquitoes, and ticks serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are zoonosis and bite.

==RNA secondary structure elements==
The positive sense RNA genome of &quot;Flavivirus&quot; contains 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; untranslated regions (UTRs).

===5&#x27;UTR===
The 5&#x27;UTRs are 95–101 nucleotides long in &quot;Dengue virus&quot;. There are two conserved structural elements in the &quot;Flavivirus&quot; 5&#x27;UTR, a large stem loop (SLA) and a short stem loop (SLB). SLA folds into a Y-shaped structure with a side stem loop and a small top loop. SLA is likely to act as a promoter, and is essential for viral RNA synthesis. SLB is involved in interactions between the 5&#x27;UTR and 3&#x27;UTR which result in the cyclisation of the viral RNA, which is essential for viral replication.

===3&#x27;UTR===
The 3&#x27;UTRs are typically 0.3–0.5 kb in length and contain a number of highly conserved secondary structures which are conserved and restricted to the &quot;flavivirus&quot; family. The majority of analysis has been carried out using &quot;West Nile virus&quot; (WNV) to study the function the 3&#x27;UTR.

Currently 8 secondary structures have been identified within the 3&#x27;UTR of WNV and are (in the order in which they are found with the 3&#x27;UTR) SL-I, SL-II, SL-III, SL-IV, DB1, DB2 and CRE. Some of these secondary structures have been characterised and are important in facilitating viral replication and protecting the 3&#x27;UTR from 5&#x27; endonuclease digestion. Nuclease resistance protects the downstream 3&#x27; UTR RNA fragment from degradation and is essential for virus-induced cytopathicity and pathogenicity.
* SL-II

SL-II has been suggested to contribute to nuclease resistance. It may be related to another hairpin loop identified in the 5&#x27;UTR of the &quot;Japanese encephalitis virus&quot; (JEV) genome. The JEV hairpin is significantly over-represented upon host cell infection and it has been suggested that the hairpin structure may play a role in regulating RNA synthesis.
* SL-IV

This secondary structure is located within the 3&#x27;UTR of the genome of &quot;Flavivirus&quot; upstream of the DB elements. The function of this conserved structure is unknown but is thought to contribute to ribonuclease resistance.
* DB1/DB2
These two conserved secondary structures are also known as pseudo-repeat elements. They were originally identified within the genome of &quot;Dengue virus&quot; and are found adjacent to each other within the 3&#x27;UTR. They appear to be widely conserved across the Flaviviradae. These DB elements have a secondary structure consisting of three helices and they play a role in ensuring efficient translation. Deletion of DB1 has a small but significant reduction in translation but deletion of DB2 has little effect. Deleting both DB1 and DB2 reduced translation efficiency of the viral genome to 25%.
* CRE

CRE is the Cis-acting replication element, also known as the 3&#x27;SL RNA elements, and is thought to be essential in viral replication by facilitating the formation of a &quot;replication complex&quot;. Although evidence has been presented for an existence of a pseudoknot structure in this RNA, it does not appear to be well conserved across flaviviruses. Deletions of the 3&#x27; UTR of flaviviruses have been shown to be lethal for infectious clones.

===Conserved hairpin cHP===
A conserved hairpin (cHP) structure was later found in several &quot;Flavivirus&quot; genomes and is thought to direct translation of capsid proteins. It is located just downstream of the AUG start codon.

== The role of RNA secondary structures in sfRNA production ==
Subgenomic &quot;flavivirus&quot; RNA (sfRNA) is an extension of the 3&#x27; UTR and has been demonstrated to play a role in &quot;flavivirus&quot; replication and pathogenesis. sfRNA is produced by incomplete degradation of genomic viral RNA by the host cells 5&#x27;-3&#x27; exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1). As the XRN1 degrades viral RNA, it stalls at stemloops formed by the secondary structure of the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; UTR. This pause results in an undigested fragment of genome RNA known as sfRNA. sfRNA influences the life cycle of the &quot;flavivirus&quot; in a concentration dependent manner. Accumulation of sfRNA causes (1) antagonization of the cell&#x27;s innate immune response, thus decreasing host defense against the virus (2) inhibition of XRN1 and Dicer activity to modify RNAi pathways that destroy viral RNA (3) modification of the viral replication complex to increase viral reproduction. Overall, sfRNA is implied in multiple pathways that compromise host defenses and promote infection by flaviviruses.

== Evolution ==

The flaviviruses can be divided into two clades: one with vector-borne viruses and the other with no known vector. The vector clade, in turn, can be subdivided into a mosquito-borne clade and a tick-borne clade. These groups can be divided again.

The mosquito group can be divided into two branches: one branch contains neurotropic viruses, often associated with encephalitic disease in humans or livestock. This branch tends to be spread by &quot;Culex&quot; species and to have bird reservoirs. The second branch is the non-neurotropic viruses associated with human haemorrhagic disease. These tend to have &quot;Aedes&quot; species as vectors and primate hosts.

The tick-borne viruses also form two distinct groups: one is associated with seabirds and the other – the tick-borne encephalitis complex viruses – is associated primarily with rodents.

The viruses that lack a known vector can be divided into three groups: one closely related to the mosquito-borne viruses, which is associated with bats; a second, genetically more distant, is also associated with bats; and a third group is associated with rodents.

Evolutionary relationships between endogenised viral elements of Flaviviruses and contemporary flaviviruses using maximum likelihood approaches have identified that arthropod-vectored flaviviruses likely emerged from an arachnid source. This contradicts earlier work with a smaller number of extant viruses showing that the tick-borne viruses emerged from a mosquito-borne group.

Several partial and complete genomes of flaviviruses have been found in aquatic invertebrates such as the sea spider &quot;Endeis spinosa&quot; and several crustaceans and cephalopods. These sequences appear to be related to those in the insect-specific flaviviruses and also the Tamana bat virus groupings. While it is not presently clear how aquatic flaviviruses fit into the evolution of this group of viruses, there is some evidence that one of these viruses, Wenzhou shark flavivirus, infects both a crustacean (&quot;Portunus trituberculatus&quot;) Pacific spadenose shark (&quot;Scoliodon macrorhynchos&quot;) shark host, indicating an aquatic arbovirus life cycle.

Estimates of divergence times have been made for several of these viruses. The origin of these viruses appears to be at least 9400 to 14,000 years ago. The Old World and New World dengue strains diverged between 150 and 450 years ago. The European and Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis strains diverged about 1087 (1610–649) years ago. European tick-borne encephalitis and louping ill viruses diverged about 572 (844–328) years ago. This latter estimate is consistent with historical records. &quot;Kunjin virus&quot; diverged from &quot;West Nile virus&quot; approximately 277 (475–137) years ago. This time corresponds to the settlement of Australia from Europe. The Japanese encephalitis group appears to have evolved in Africa 2000–3000 years ago and then spread initially to South East Asia before migrating to the rest of Asia.

Phylogenetic studies of the &quot;West Nile virus&quot; has shown that it emerged as a distinct virus around 1000 years ago. This initial virus developed into two distinct lineages, lineage 1 and its multiple profiles is the source of the epidemic transmission in Africa and throughout the world. Lineage 2 was considered an Africa zoonosis. However, in 2008, lineage 2, previously only seen in horses in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, began to appear in horses in Europe, where the first known outbreak affected 18 animals in Hungary in 2008. Lineage 1 &quot;West Nile virus&quot; was detected in South Africa in 2010 in a mare and her aborted fetus; previously, only lineage 2 &quot;West Nile virus&quot; had been detected in horses and humans in South Africa. A 2007 fatal case in a killer whale in Texas broadened the known host range of &quot;West Nile virus&quot; to include cetaceans.

&quot;Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus&quot; appears to have evolved within the last 1000 years. The viral genomes can be divided into 2 clades — A and B. Clade A has five genotypes, and clade B has one. These clades separated about 700 years ago. This separation appears to have occurred in the Kurgan province. Clade A subsequently underwent division into clade C, D and E 230 years ago. Clade C and E appear to have originated in the Novosibirsk and Omsk Provinces, respectively. The muskrat &quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;, which is highly susceptible to this virus, was introduced into this area in the 1930s.

==Taxonomy==

=== Species ===
In the genus &quot;Flavivirus&quot; there are 53 defined species:

===Sorted by vector===

==Vaccines==

The very successful yellow fever 17D vaccine, introduced in 1937, produced dramatic reductions in epidemic activity.

Effective inactivated Japanese encephalitis and Tick-borne encephalitis vaccines were introduced in the middle of the 20th century. Unacceptable adverse events have prompted change from a mouse-brain inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine to safer and more effective second generation Japanese encephalitis vaccines. These may come into wide use to effectively prevent this severe disease in the huge populations of Asia—North, South and Southeast.

The dengue viruses produce many millions of infections annually due to transmission by a successful global mosquito vector. As mosquito control has failed, several dengue vaccines are in varying stages of development. CYD-TDV, sold under the trade name Dengvaxia, is a tetravalent chimeric vaccine that splices structural genes of the four dengue viruses onto a 17D yellow fever backbone. Dengvaxia is approved in five countries.

<text>Qatar Airways Company Q.C.S.C. (, &quot;al-Qaṭariyya&quot;), operating as Qatar Airways, is the flag carrier of Qatar. Headquartered in the Qatar Airways Tower in Doha, the airline operates a hub-and-spoke network, flying to over 170 international destinations across five continents from its base at Hamad International Airport. The airline currently operates a fleet of more than 200 aircraft. Qatar Airways Group employs more than 43,000 people. The carrier has been a member of the Oneworld alliance since October 2013, and the official company slogan has been &quot;Going Places Together&quot; since 2015.

==History==

===Origin===
From 1974 until May 2002, the State of Qatar was a joint-owner member of Gulf Air along with Oman, the UAE state of Abu Dhabi, and the Kingdom of Bahrain. It became the first among the three countries to withdraw from the airline, although it remained a member of Gulf Air for six months after the government announced its complete termination.

===Foundation===
Qatar Airways was established by the government of Qatar on November 22, 1993; operations began on January 20, 1994. Amman was the airline&#x27;s first destination in May 1994. In April 1995, CEO Sheikh Hamad Bin Ali Bin Jabor Al Thani had employed a staff of 75. By this time the fleet consisted of two Airbus A310s that served a route network including Abu Dhabi, Bangkok, Cairo, Dubai, Khartoum, Kuwait, Madras, Manila, Muscat, Sharjah, Taipei, Tokyo and Trivandrum. During 1995, two ex-All Nippon Airways Boeing 747s were purchased from Boeing. The airline acquired a second-hand Boeing 747SP from Air Mauritius in 1996.


Services to Athens, Istanbul, Madras and Tunis were discontinued in late 1996, whereas Calcutta and Muscat were removed from the route network in January and September 1997, respectively. Flights to London were launched during 1997. The airline also took delivery of two second-hand 231-seater Airbus A300-600R aircraft on lease from Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS) during the year. A new logo was also revealed with the introduction of the new aircraft. A third A300-600R joined the fleet shortly afterwards, also on lease from AWAS. In July 1998 the carrier placed a firm order with Airbus for six Airbus A320s, slated for delivery between 2001 and 2005; it also took options for five more aircraft of the type. Also in 1998, the carrier struck a deal with Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise (SALE) for the lease of four Airbus A320s, with deliveries scheduled between February and April 1999; these latter four aircraft were aimed at replacing the Boeing 727-200 Advanced fleet. The airline took delivery of the first A320 powered by Aero Engines V2500 on lease from SALE in February 1999.

A fourth A300-600R on lease from AWAS joined the fleet in April 2000. In October 2000, Qatar Airways ordered an International Aero Engines V2500-powered Airbus A319CJ and took an option for another aircraft of the type. The airline became the Airbus A380&#x27;s ninth customer in 2001 when two aircraft of the type were ordered, plus two options. Also that year, the airline resumed services to Jakarta. A year later, in May, Qatar withdrew from Gulf Air to ensure the development of its national airline.

In June 2003, Qatar Airways was the first airline that resumed international services to Iraq when it flew the Doha–Basra route. Also that month, the airline incorporated its first dedicated cargo aircraft into the fleet. It was an Airbus A300-600R that was converted to freighter in Germany for  million. Also in June 2003 at the Paris Air Show, the carrier placed an order with Airbus valued at  billion for two Airbus A321s, 14 Airbus A330s and two Airbus A340-600s. The deal included eight A330-200s and six -300s; it also included options for further six A330-300s and eight A340-600s. The first aircraft were scheduled to enter the fleet in 2004, with the A340-600 slated for delivery in 2006. During the year the airline started serving the Chinese market with the introduction of flights to Shanghai. Also in 2003, the carrier expanded its portfolio of destinations with the commencement of services to Manchester in April, Tripoli in November, and Cebu and Singapore in December. During the 2003 Dubai Air Show the airline firmed up an earlier commitment for two Airbus A380s and took options for another two of these aircraft. The value of the transaction was  billion. It was also in 2003 that Qatar Airways became the first airline to be audited under the new IATA operational audit programme, IOSA.

The Qatar Airways Group —which included Qatar Airways, Doha International Airport and corporate business air services, ground handling and in-flight catering companies— reported its first profit ever for the fiscal year (FY) that ended in March 2004. The FY2004 saw the airline transporting 3.35 million passengers. Zürich became the carrier&#x27;s 53rd destination worldwide in July 2004; Yangon was added to the list of destinations in December the same year. A new service to Osaka was launched in March 2005. Its first A340 was delivered on September 8, 2006.

In May 2007, Qatar Airways and Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the acquisition of 80 Airbus A350 XWBs, including 20 Airbus A350-800s plus40}}and 20 aircraft of the –900 and –1000 variant, respectively, with the first aircraft initially slated for delivery in 2013. The agreement was firmed up in June during the 2007 Paris Air Show; three more Airbus A380s were also made part of the order. In July of the same year, during the unveiling ceremony of the Boeing 787 in Everett, Qatar Airways was recognised as a future customer for the type when its logo appeared on one side of the brand new aircraft. By that time, the airline had not acknowledged that it had placed an order for a number of these new aircraft. In November the same year, a firm order for 30 Boeing 787-8s, plus options for 35 more aircraft of the –9 or –10 variant, was confirmed. The order also included 14 Boeing 777-300ERs, six Boeing 777-200LRs and seven Boeing 777Fs, whereas five more aircraft of the type were on option. The combined order was valued at  billion. The airline took delivery of its first 335-seater Boeing 777-300ER in late November 2007. The route network grew further during 2007 with the incorporation of Newark in June, Nagpur —the carrier&#x27;s seventh destination in India— in September, and Stockholm in November. A new scheduled service to New York-JFK that commenced in November 2008 replaced the Newark route. The first two Boeing 777-200LRs were handed over by the aircraft manufacturer in February 2009. On June 15 of the same year, at the Paris Air Show, Qatar Airways ordered 20 Airbus A320 and four Airbus A321 aircraft worth $1.9bn. On October 12, 2009, the company completed the world&#x27;s first commercial passenger flight powered by a fuel made from natural gas. Also in 2009, Qatar Airways launched its first scheduled flights to Australia with Melbourne being the first city served; routes to Chengdu, Hangzhou, Phnom Penh and Clark International Airport in the Philippines were launched during 2009 as well.

Tokyo-Narita was first served by the carrier in April 2010. On May 18, 2010, the airline put its first Boeing 777F (A7-BFA) into service, with a flight from Doha to Amsterdam. The aircraft had been delivered on May 14, 2010. The airline has launched 22 new destinations since 2010, with nine more destinations announced: Ankara, Aleppo, Bangalore, Barcelona, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Hanoi, Montreal, Nice, Phuket, São Paulo, Shiraz, Kolkata, Medina, Oslo, Sofia, Stuttgart, Venice and Tokyo. Qatar Airways also launched Benghazi and Entebbe during 2011. Service to Baku and Tbilisi, originally planned for 2011, was delayed until February 1, 2012, due to &quot;operational issues&quot;.

Boeing&#x27;s handover of a Boeing 777-200LR in September 2011 marked Qatar Airways receiving its 100th aircraft from this aircraft manufacturer. In November the same year, at the Dubai Airshow, the airline ordered 55 Airbus planes: 50 A320neo and five A380, in addition to two Boeing 777 freighters.

In July 2012, Perth became the second city served in Australia. On October 8, 2012, Qatar Airways announced it would join Oneworld within the forthcoming 18 months. The entrance of the carrier into the alliance was mentored by British Airways. The joining ceremony took place on October 29, 2013.

On November 12, 2012, Qatar Airways became the seventh carrier worldwide to acquire the Dreamliner, when Boeing handed over the airline&#x27;s first aircraft of the type; it was the first delivered to a Middle Eastern airline. The aircraft was deployed on the Doha–Dubai corridor on November 20. Dreamliner services on the long-haul Doha–London-Heathrow route commenced on December 13, with the airline becoming the first one to offer regular services to the United Kingdom using this aircraft. During 2013, Qatar Airways launched flights to Gassim in Saudi Arabia, Basra and Najaf in Iraq, Phnom Penh, Salalah and Chicago. Services to Ethiopia began in September 2013.

In February 2013, Qatar Airways opened its European Customer Service centre in Wrocław, Poland.

In June 2013, the airline firmed up an order for two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft plus seven options. On November 17, 2013, the first day of the Dubai Airshow, Qatar Airways purchased 50 Boeing 777-9Xs. The commitment was firmed up during the 2014 Farnborough Air Show in a deal worth  billion; purchase rights for another 50 aircraft of the type were also taken. In addition, the transaction included firm orders for four Boeing 777Fs plus options for another four with a combined value of billion. Deliveries of the passenger aircraft are expected to start in 2020.

An all-business class flight to London-Heathrow was launched in May 2014 with Airbus A319LR aircraft. Flights to Edinburgh were launched in May 2014. The carrier expected to take delivery of its first three Airbus A380 aircraft in June 2014, with plans for the aircraft to be displayed at the Farnborough Air Show. There were intentions to first deploy the type on the Doha–London-Heathrow route starting June 17; another two undisclosed European points would likely become served with the A380. In late May 2014, it was reported that the delivery of the aircraft would be delayed by several weeks. Further delays shifted the start of A380 services to London to August 1, 2014. Delivery of the first aircraft of the type finally took place on September 16, 2014. A380 services to London commenced in October 2014. The airline became the launch customer for the A350 XWB; the first Airbus A350-900 was handed over to the company on December 22, 2014, and had its first revenue flight to Frankfurt almost a month later, on January 15, 2015.

In January 2015, the airline concluded an order for four Boeing 777Fs in a deal worth  billion; Qatar Airways also took purchase rights on four more aircraft of the type. In June 2015, it was disclosed that Qatar Airways had ordered ten Boeing 777-8Xs and four additional Boeing 777Fs for US$4.18 billion.

In August 2015, Qatar Airways was forced to relax its policy of sacking cabin crew for getting pregnant or marrying in their first five years of employment. A spokeswoman stated, &quot;our policies have evolved with the airline&#x27;s growth&quot;. Under the new regulations, &quot;we will provide an opportunity for someone to continue working in a ground position&quot;, the spokeswoman said.

In January 2016, the carrier received its first Boeing 747 nose loader. In 2016, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines claimed that their forensic investigators had uncovered documents that allegedly indicated that Qatar Airways had received more than $7 billion in aid from the Qatari government. According to reports, the investigation was conducted by Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. In July 2016, the U.S. Department of State held talks with Qatar government officials regarding the allegations of unfair competition. No formal action was taken by the Department of State. Qatar Airways has denied allegations that subsidies were received and Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker condemned the accusations.

As of February 5, 2017, the airline had the longest regularly scheduled flight of a commercial airline, between Doha and Auckland. On September 1, 2017, it was announced that Qatar Airways bought 49% of AQA Holding, the new shareholder of Meridiana.

In November 2018, the airline announced it would expand its flights to Iran, landing at Tehran and Shiraz, as of January 2019, and to Isfahan in February. In December 2018, the CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, threatened to pull the company out of the Oneworld alliance in February, following accusations that alliance members Qantas and American Airlines engaged in &quot;hostile business practices&quot; against his carrier. In 2018, during an annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association, the CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, claimed that a woman could not do his job as &quot;it is a very challenging position.&quot; Upon receiving backlash regarding his comments, Al Baker explained that he did not intend to refer to all women at Qatar Airways. He also mentioned that he would love to have a female CEO running the company after him. Since then, Al Baker has apologized for his comments in a statement that was provided to &quot;The Independent&quot;.

On April 30, 2019, Qatar Airways retired its last Airbus A340-600 from service after around 16 years of service. The last flight was QR835 from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport to Hamad International Airport. The removal from service was to lower the age of its fleet as well as its ineffectiveness compared to the Boeing 777 as stated by CEO Akbar Al Baker in 2009.

In July 2023, the Government of Australia blocked an expansion plan from Qatar Airways that would have seen the carrier double its flights to Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The government intervention was supported by Australian flag-carrier and rival airline Qantas, who argued that Qatar&#x27;s flights would &quot;distort the market&quot;, while the government dismissed criticism from Qatar Airways and tourism operators, stating that Qatar Airways&#x27; route expansion is against Australia&#x27;s national interest.

In October 2023, Qatar Airways announced a collaboration with Starlink to provide high-speed in-flight internet.

=====Cargo=====

Qatar Airways Cargo, the airline&#x27;s freight branch, is the world&#x27;s third largest international cargo carrier. Dedicated cargo flights to Cairo International Airport were launched in June 2009 complementing the passenger services already operated.

On August 18, 2010, the airline launched its first US-dedicated cargo service from its hub in Doha to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare with a stop-over in Amsterdam, Netherlands using Boeing 777 freighter aircraft.

On March 13, 2013, Qatar Airways Cargo first of three A330F was delivered provided on lease from BOC aviation replacing A300-600F.

Global Supply Systems operated three Boeing 747-8F aircraft under a wet lease arrangement for British Airways World Cargo until BA terminated the contract early on January 17, 2014. An agreement with Qatar Airways to operate flights for IAG Cargo using Boeing 777F was announced on the same day.

On March 18, 2015, Qatar Airways Cargo announced that starting April 4, 2015, will launch a twice-weekly Boeing 777 Freighter service to Los Angeles which will become Qatar Airways Cargo&#x27;s fourth US freighter destination alongside Houston, Chicago and Atlanta.

=====Qatar Executive=====
Qatar Executive is a corporate jet subsidiary of Qatar Airways, with its livery sporting a white fuselage with a slightly smaller Oryx painted in the airline&#x27;s traditional colours of burgundy and grey.

The Royal fleet of Qatar Amiri Flight is also painted in full Qatar Airways livery, although they are not part of the airline or Qatar Executive.

=====Al Maha Airways=====
Al Maha Airways was a proposed airline to serve the Saudi Arabian market. It used a similar livery, except in green instead of burgundy. It was planned to launch in September 2014 and by May 2015 the airline had already taken delivery of 4 Airbus A320 aircraft.

In February 2017, Qatar Airways announced that the Al Maha Airways project had been cancelled and the airline would not start operations due to ongoing issues gaining its operational license and the Qatar diplomatic crisis.

===Livery===
Qatar Airways has an oryx, the national animal of the State of Qatar, as its logo. The aircraft livery includes the word &quot;Qatar&quot; in burgundy-coloured letters on a light grey background at both sides of the forward part of the fuselage, with the word in Arabic titles appearing close to it in a darker grey and a smaller typeface. A burgundy oryx in a grey background adorns the tailfin. The airline unveiled this branding in 2006.

===Natural gas to liquid fuel demonstration===
On October 12, 2009, a Qatar Airways Airbus A340-600 conducted the world&#x27;s first commercial passenger flight using a mixture of kerosene and synthetic gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuel, produced from natural gas, on a flight from London Gatwick Airport to Doha. The experiment&#x27;s purpose was to demonstrate the viability of jet fuel made from a source not subject to rapidly fluctuating oil prices. Also, positioning natural gas in particular as an alternative source of jet fuel is in the interests of the Qatari government; Qatar is the world&#x27;s leading exporter of natural gas. However, some experts believe that GTL fuel is likely to remain a marginal choice due to an expensive production process.

On other long and medium-haul aircraft, business class seats are in a 2-2-2 configuration offering flatbed seats with 180 degrees recline, with massage functions.

In March 2017, Qatar Airways revealed a new business class cabin, named &quot;Qsuite.&quot; The new cabin offers suites with doors arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration. Qsuite features single seats on the window sides, and the middle section suites can be converted into a quad room, allowing four passengers to face each other in a dining-room like set up. Additionally, select &quot;couple&quot; seat pairs in the middle section can be converted into a double bed, offering a product similar to what other airlines offer in First Class. Launched on new Boeing 777-300ER and A350 XWB aircraft in summer 2017 and initially introduced on the Doha to London Heathrow route, the new seats will be retrofitted in the remaining fleet progressively, excluding the Airbus A330s and Airbus A380s due to their upcoming retirement of the types beginning in 2019 and 2024 as Qatar Airways introduced the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and Boeing 777X to replace them.

==Controversies==
===Treatment of employees===

==== Pay ====
Qatar Airways’ average pay for its long-haul international crew is significantly less than that of its competitors, with airlines such as Australian-flag carrier Qantas paying its long-haul crew on average three times more of what Qatar Airways pay for similar distance routes. Qatar Airways employees are prohibited from campaigning for pay rises through industrial action and advocacy campaigns as trade union activity is effectively illegal for the vast majority of workers in the State of Qatar.

==== Working conditions ====
In 2014, the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; published a report ostensibly based around three Qatar Airways employees, whose lives were allegedly heavily &quot;monitored&quot; and &quot;controlled&quot; by the company. Qatar Airways&#x27; Swedish PR agency responded to the report by stating, &quot;Because we do not know which individuals and which particular cases the article is based on, Qatar Airways is unable to comment&quot;. The CEO of Qatar Airways has denied the claims made in a Swedish newspaper regarding the alleged unfair treatment of its employees. He stated, &quot;This is not directed at Qatar Airways, but rather at my home country.&quot; My country is being unfairly criticized and attacked without any justification.

In 2022, a Thompson Reuters Foundation report revealed that Qatar Airways crew are frequently exposed to dangerous, life-threatening working conditions, highlighting that most pilots and cabin crew collectively suffer burnout and fatigue from being overworked and underpaid, and are fearful of publicly and privately speaking out due to the risk of disciplinary action by Qatar Airways or criminal prosecution by the State of Qatar.

===2020 Doha Airport forced strip searches===
On October 2, 2020, thirteen Australian female passengers aboard a Qatar Airways flight to Sydney from Hamad International Airport in Doha were forced to deplane before takeoff at gunpoint, and were subsequently strip searched and &quot;subjected to an invasive internal examination&quot; against their will. This was allegedly prompted by the discovery of a newborn baby in an airport bathroom. This evolved into a diplomatic incident between Australia and Qatar with the then-Australian foreign minister Marise Payne stating &quot;the treatment of the women concerned was offensive, grossly inappropriate, and beyond circumstances in which the women could give free and informed consent&quot;.

In October 2022, the affected Australian women began legal proceedings in Australia against Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority under the Montreal convention.

In July 2023, the Australian Government rejected a request for Qatar Airways to double capacity into Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, with Australian Minister for Transport Catherine King stating that the 2020 incident was a &#x27;factor&#x27; influencing the Australian Government&#x27;s rejection of the bid.

In September 2023, Qatar Airways&#x27; senior vice president of global sales Matt Raos asserted that the 2020 incident was &quot;a one-off and an isolated incident&quot; during an Australian Senate inquiry.

In April 2024, The Federal Court of Australia dismissed the case, after finding that the searches did not happen onboard a Qatar Airways aircraft nor were carried out by the airline&#x27;s employees. Also, Qatar strongly expressed its disapproval of the incident soon after it happened, with Qatari officials apologizing multiple times.

=== Hostilities with other Oneworld members ===

Qatar Airways, since joining the Oneworld alliance in 2013, has been involved in numerous high profile public disputes with fellow members of the alliance. Qatar Airways was engaged in a dispute with American Airlines from 2017 to 2020, and a dispute with Qantas started in 2018 and continues to this date. In 2015 and 2019, Qatar Airways threatened to leave Oneworld citing its relationship with American and Qantas, however never followed through on this threat.

===Possible involvement in the death of Marc Bennett===

On September 29, 2022, &quot;The Times&quot; published an article about the death of British travel industry executive Marc Bennett in Qatar. On December 24, 2019, Bennett was found hanged in his hotel room in Doha. According to the investigation by The Times, Bennett was arrested after resigning from a senior post with Qatar Airways for a rival firm in Saudi Arabia. Qatar Airways told &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;On 15 October Marc left the business and evidence subsequently came to light showing that over a significant period Marc had emailed highly confidential documents relating to Qatar Airways to a private email address without authorization. Marc was still in Qatar at the point this discovery was made. He was arrested and this then became a police matter.&quot; However, Qatari authorities claimed that he had committed suicide and Qatar Airways stated, &quot;Marc Bennett was a valued and popular former colleague of Qatar Airways group. He left with our best wishes.&quot;

=== EU transport chief bribes ===
In November 2024, it was reported the European Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office (EPPO) has initiated a criminal investigation into Henrik Hololei, a former EU transport chief, over allegations of accepting free flights from Qatar Airways while negotiating an Open Skies deal that favored the airline. Reports indicate Hololei traveled business class at no cost nine times from 2015 to 2021. Following a prior investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Office, the European Commission&#x27;s disciplinary office has also been involved, though its procedures are in the early stages. Hololei resigned from his position as director general but remains a political advisor within the EU.

== EU–Qatar agreement on air transport ==
In December 2022, the European Parliament suspended Qatar&#x27;s access following allegations that Qatari representatives offered substantial bribes to influence decisions, leading to the arrest of several individuals, including MEP Eva Kaili. Subsequently, Lufthansa called for the suspension of the EU-Qatar air transport agreement, citing competitive disparities and the corruption allegations associated with its negotiation.

== Accidents ==
* April 19, 2007: An Airbus A300, registration A7-ABV, was written off as a result of a hangar fire during maintenance at Abu Dhabi Aircraft Technologies.
* December 8, 2017: An Airbus A321, with registration A7-AIB was damaged beyond economic repair by a fire at Hamad International Airport, Doha.

<doc id="449464" wikidata="Q479081" url="?curid=449464" title="Bob Russell (British politician)">
<text>Sir Robert Edward Russell (born 31 March 1946) is a former Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom who was the Member of Parliament for Colchester from 1997 to 2015. He was first elected at the 1997 United Kingdom general election and won subsequent re-election in 2001, 2005 and 2010; he was defeated in the 2015 United Kingdom general election by the Conservative candidate Will Quince.

Russell was knighted for public service in the 2012 New Year Honours. He holds the ceremonial position of High Steward of Colchester.

==Career==
Prior to his first election to the House of Commons, Russell was a councillor representing New Town ward continuously from 1978 to 2002. He was originally elected as a Labour Party candidate before defecting to the Social Democratic Party in 1981, and then standing as a Liberal Democrat candidate from 1988 onwards. He held a dual mandate of Member of Parliament and councillor from 1997 to 2002.

He was leader of Colchester Borough Council until 1991, having previously served as Mayor of Colchester for the year 1986–87.

Prior to standing as parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Russell stood unsuccessfully for Parliament for Colchester in 1979 as a Labour candidate.

Russell was the Liberal Democrats&#x27; spokesman on Culture, Media and Sport from 2002 to 2005, when he was replaced by Don Foster. He was a member of the Liberal Democrat Shadow Defence team until the formation of the Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Government on 11 May 2010, at which point he became a backbencher.

At the 2010 general election Russell&#x27;s majority was 6,982 votes (15.1%). In 2011, Russell was a member of the special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Armed Forces Bill which was passed.

During his period in parliament, Russell was a member of the Beveridge Group, vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Flag Group and sat on the Defence Select Committee.

Following his defeat at the 2015 general election, he was appointed the High Steward of Colchester (also known as &quot;High Sheriff of Colchester&quot;), a position he currently holds. He stood at the 2017 general election as the Liberal Democrat candidate for his former seat, finishing in third place.

===Causes===
Russell is known for supporting unusual causes, such as petitioning the House of Commons for the return of Young&#x27;s bitter to the Strangers&#x27; Bar. He spoke out against celebrity tax exiles, including Lewis Hamilton. He campaigned against the 1996 sale of Ministry of Defence housing to Annington Homes and for soldiers&#x27; housing to be improved.

===Controversy===
In December 2010, a reply that Russell wrote to a constituent who was concerned about the cost of the upcoming Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton was published. In it, Russell told the constituent to &quot;get a life and stop whinging&quot;. In 2011, he followed this up with a contentious letter to a member of the public who had asked whether he would lend support to Colchester&#x27;s new Visual Arts Facility (later to become Firstsite). Referring to alleged implications that he did not support the arts as &quot;Rubbish[,] man!&quot;, Russell accused those in support of Firstsite as &quot;expecting the council to fund their social life&quot;.

Russell caused further controversy in February 2012, when another letter he had written to a constituent appeared in the press. Russell responded to the constituent&#x27;s query as to what would happen if sufficient funds for a new Royal yacht could not be raised by stating, “Are you serious? Don’t you have more important things in your life to be worried about without bothering me with this?&quot;

===Expenses===
In 2012, Russell was found to have broken parliamentary expenses rules after claiming more than £70,000 over seven years for an office owned by a company in which he was a major shareholder. He was found to have acted in good faith, but was found to be in &quot;clear breach&quot; of the rules. Russell apologised, stating: &quot;I have not personally made a financial gain from the arrangements. Rather I have made a significant personal contribution to provide an office which is fit for purpose at no additional cost to the public purse.&quot;

==Other interests==
Russell is a former season ticket holder for Colchester United football club, and wrote the foreword for a history of the club.

<doc id="449466" wikidata="Q149877" url="?curid=449466" title="Initiative for Catalonia Greens">
<text>Initiative for Catalonia Greens (, ICV; ) was an eco-socialist political party in Catalonia. It was formed as a merger of Iniciativa per Catalunya and Els Verds. IC had been an alliance led by Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya and was the equivalent of Izquierda Unida in Catalonia. IC later developed into a political party, and PSUC was dissolved. The youth of ICV was called &quot;Joves d&#x27;Esquerra Verda&quot; (Green Left Youth). It used to be called JambI, &quot;Joves amb Iniciativa&quot; (Youth with Initiative).

In the elections to the European Parliament in 2004 ICV ran on the Izquierda Unida list. One MEP, Raül Romeva, was elected from ICV which joined the Green Group. The ICV formed part of the past ruling tripartite coalition (along with the Socialist Party of Catalonia and the Republican Left of Catalonia, a left-wing Catalan Nationalist Party) in the Generalitat of Catalonia. The coalition governed Catalonia from 2004-2010. ICV was given responsibility for the Ministry of the Environment in the share-out of power in the new government. Initiative for Catalonia Greens had an agreement of mutual association with Equo.
It was dissolved in 2019. In July 2020 it was announced that the party would be re-founded as Green Left.

== Ideology ==
Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds called itself an &quot;ecosocialist&quot; party and its members were therefore &quot;ecosocialists&quot;. This ideology is summarized in the book &quot;The Ecosocialist Manifesto&quot;, co-written by a number of left-wing green politicians. This ideology looks to renew the left and is firmly against communism as practised in the former Soviet Union and against capitalism, as practised by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but also against social democracy, which it considers as only a lesser evil that does not respond to the environmental and social challenges ahead. From an ecosocialist point of view, both communism and capitalism are two faces of the productivist &quot;mode of production&quot; (a Marxist term), which should be phased out if the ecological health of the planet is to survive. The manifesto also considers this ideology to be deeply feminist and in favour of the &quot;freedom of the European peoples&quot; (i.e. for self-determination for the Basque Country, Galicia or Catalonia). The party voted in favour of the Catalan parliament&#x27;s declaration defining Catalonia as a &quot;sovereign political and juridical entity&quot; (&quot;subjecte polític i jurídic sobirà&quot;) in 2013.

<doc id="449469" wikidata="Q6205412" url="?curid=449469" title="Joan Ryan (politician)">
<text>Joan Marie Ryan (born 8 September 1955) is a British former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Enfield North from 1997 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2019. She was first elected as a Labour Party MP but later defected to join Change UK.

Ryan studied sociology and worked as a teacher, before becoming a Labour councillor on Barnet London Borough Council in 1990, serving as deputy leader of the council from 1994 to 1998. She was a government whip under Tony Blair from 2002 to 2006, a junior Home Office minister responsible for ID cards from 2006 to 2007, and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Representative to Cyprus from 2007 to 2008, when she was sacked. She lost her seat in the 2010 general election after an expenses scandal and was deputy campaign director of NOtoAV in the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum.

Ryan was re-elected in Enfield North in the 2015 general election and became chair of the Labour Friends of Israel (LFI). She was highly critical of party leader Jeremy Corbyn and lost a motion of no confidence put forward by her constituency party in 2018. She left Labour to join The Independent Group, later Change UK, in February 2019. In September, she announced she would stand down at the next general election and was subsequently succeeded by Labour&#x27;s Feryal Clark.

== Early life and education ==
Ryan was born in Warrington, Lancashire. She attended local schools before studying history and sociology at the City of Liverpool College of Higher Education. She graduated in 1979 and went on to study for a master&#x27;s degree in sociology at Polytechnic of the South Bank, graduating in 1981. She taught sociology and politics in Hammersmith at William Morris Academy and also worked as an interviewer for the Imperial War Museum in the 1980s.

==Political career==
=== Barnet council, 1990–1998 ===
Ryan was elected as a councillor for the East Finchley ward on Barnet London Borough Council, representing the Labour Party, in 1990. She became chair of the policy and resources committee in 1994, before becoming deputy leader of the council later that year. She served on the council and as deputy leader until 1998.

=== Blair and Brown governments, 1997–2010 ===
Ryan was elected as the Labour Member of Parliament for Enfield North in the 1997 general election. In her first years as an MP, she was known as an advocate for Greek Cypriots in her constituency and in the Commons, and also as an opponent of Ken Livingstone during the creation of the Greater London Authority (GLA). She sat on the board of the London Labour Party and defended a vetting panel for mayoral candidates that was accused of bias. In response to Livingtone&#x27;s campaign to get on the ballot, Ryan said &quot;It is not acceptable. I think the public are fed up with it. He should wait his turn.&quot;

Ryan was appointed as parliamentary private secretary to Andrew Smith in 1998, and as an assistant whip in 2002. A parliamentary question from Ryan in January 2000, on the topic of businesses breaking the UN sanctions on Angola, led Foreign Office minister Peter Hain to name three businessmen who he claimed had been breaking the sanctions. In January 2001, Ryan voted in favour of a ban on hunting. She was appointed as a junior minister at the Home Office in Tony Blair&#x27;s May 2006 reshuffle. In July, a report authored by Ryan was leaked to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;; it said that a surge in immigration from eastern Europe in 2007 could put pressure on Britain&#x27;s education, health, and welfare services, and could also lead to &quot;potentially serious&quot; consequences for community cohesion.

From 2006 until 2007, Ryan was the minister responsible for the then government&#x27;s controversial ID card scheme.

In April 2007, she launched a campaign to promote the achievements and financial struggles of &#x27;supplementary schools&#x27;, based on the concerns of Enfield Turkish School in her constituency, and she sent a dossier to Andrew Adonis to that effect. In June 2007, she became vice-chair of the Labour Party. She was also removed as a Home Office minister and appointed as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Representative to Cyprus.

In July 2007, she was sworn as a Member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council, entitling her to the prefix &#x27;The Right Honourable&#x27; for life.

In September 2008, she was revealed by Siobhain McDonagh to have requested leadership nomination papers ahead of the party&#x27;s annual conference. Ryan said that it was time for the party&#x27;s &quot;direction and leadership&quot; to be debated openly. Gordon Brown subsequently sacked her from her Cyprus and Labour Party roles.

In 2009, Ryan led delegations of MPs on two international trips, one to Canberra and Melbourne in Australia, and the other to Cameroon. A man was acquitted of harassing Ryan in March 2010 on the grounds of insanity. Ryan, who lived on the same street as the man, had stayed away from her house with her family since January, following two incidents that had left her &quot;terrified&quot;.

===Expenses controversies===
In October 2007, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; reported that Ryan had claimed £173,691 in expenses in the 2006/2007 tax year, the highest of any MP in London. She had been the second-highest claimant in the previous tax year. In May 2007, Ryan had voted in favour of David Maclean&#x27;s Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, which would have kept details of parliamentary expenses secret.

During the parliamentary expenses scandal, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed in May 2009 that Ryan had spent £4,500 of expenses on a second home in Enfield before &quot;flipping&quot; it with her main home, a flat in south London. Between 2004 and 2008, she had designated her house in Enfield, which was in her constituency, as a second home. She designated her main home during that period as a south London flat she bought in 2004. She had spent £1,045 on repairs and refurbishment to the second home in 2007/2008, and £3,624 on it during 2008/2009. The work was covered by the Additional Costs Allowance (ACA).

In response to the report, Ryan said that she had not made any claims for refurbishment on her south London flat and therefore had not &quot;flipped&quot; the properties to maximise the benefit of the allowances. She told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; that when she was in government, the rules required her to designate her flat as her main home because it was closest to Parliament. After leaving government, she decided to change it to the Enfield house as she had &quot;returned to spending more time&quot; there. In Thomas Legg&#x27;s February 2010 audit report of expenses claims, Ryan was asked to repay £5,121.74 for mortgage interest claims. By the time of publication of the report, she had only paid £322.45.

====Wikipedia edits====
&quot;The Independent&quot; reported in March 2012 that &quot;at least 10 attempts&quot; were made from computers on the Parliamentary estate to remove information about Ryan&#x27;s expenses from her Wikipedia article. A further 20 attempts were made from inside her former constituency of Enfield North. In his &quot;2010 Editing Wikipedia From Inside Parliament Awards&quot;, entertainer Tom Scott gave the anonymous editor of Ryan&#x27;s page the &quot;Sweeping Things Under The Carpet Award&quot;. In November 2014, the &quot;Enfield Independent&quot; reported that a section titled &quot;Involvement in the expenses scandal&quot; had been removed from her page. In response, Ryan said that allegations she had altered the entry were &quot;categorically untrue&quot; and that this was a &quot;politically-motivated smear campaign against me [Ryan].&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the entire section about expenses on Ryan&#x27;s page was deleted by computers inside Parliament in run-up to the 2015 general election. Ryan, though a parliamentary candidate, was not an MP at the time.

=== Out of Parliament, NOtoAV 2010–2015 ===
Ryan was defeated by Conservative candidate Nick de Bois by 1,692 votes in the 2010 general election. After losing her seat, she was appointed Chief Executive of the Global Tamil Forum, and later became deputy director of the successful NOtoAV campaign.

In March 2013, Ryan announced she was to seek re-selection by Labour to contest the Enfield North constituency at the 2015 general election. After her reselection, several constituents wrote to her local paper, the &quot;Enfield Advertiser&quot;, suggesting that voters had not yet forgotten the revelations about her expenses in 2009. She regained her seat in the House of Commons with a majority of 1,086 votes.

=== Reelected Labour MP 2015–2019 ===

==== Labour Friends of Israel ====
In August 2015, Ryan became Chair of the Labour Friends of Israel (LFI).

While chair of LFI, Ryan was filmed as part of the Al Jazeera documentary &quot;The Lobby&quot;, which investigated the alleged influence of the Israeli lobby in British politics. The documentary was cited by her constituency Labour Party (CLP) in their vote of no confidence against Ryan. Based on video footage from &quot;The Lobby&quot;, the CLP said Ryan had made false allegations of antisemitism against the party. 

&quot;The Lobby&quot; also revealed a heated exchange between Ryan and a Labour Party member regarding the wealth and prestige of the LFI, where Ryan alleged that the member used an antisemitic trope. &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; reported that Ryan was later filmed claiming that the member &quot;suggested joining LFI could result in a job at a bank&quot;, but the recording did not substantiate the claims. Ryan made a complaint to the Labour Party about the member, they were subsequently cleared.

Ryan retained the position of chair of LFI when she resigned from the Labour Party in February 2019. In August 2019, she relinquished the role to Louise Ellman and became honorary president.

She is also a Vice-President of the All-Party Britain-Israel Parliamentary Group.

==== &#x27;Independent-minded&#x27; election campaign ====
During the 2017 general election campaign, Ryan urged constituents in her election literature to vote for her because she was &quot;independent-minded&quot; in the context of the perceived unpopularity of Corbyn. She wrote in her election letter that constituents she had spoken to had more faith in Theresa May as PM, than in Corbyn as May&#x27;s potential successor. Ryan, arguing in line with most opinion polls, said she expected May&#x27;s government to return with a much larger number of MPs, but that she was well placed to combat such a Conservative majority. It was the fifth time Ryan and Nick de Bois had stood against each other.

====No-confidence vote====
On 6 September 2018, her Constituency Labour Party passed a motion of no confidence in her. It accused her of acting like an &quot;independent MP in all but name&quot;, of making false accusations of antisemitism, and of fuelling a &quot;trial by media&quot; by smearing Jeremy Corbyn. Ryan said the motion had passed because of &quot;Trots, Stalinists and communists&quot;, who she said had entered the Enfield North Labour Party, and said &quot;Just to be clear I will not be resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.&quot;

=== The Independent Group ===
Ryan left the Labour Party on 19 February 2019 to join the Independent Group of former Labour MPs, accusing Corbyn and the &quot;Stalinist clique which surrounds him&quot; of failing to provide effective opposition and of &quot;presiding over a culture of antisemitism and hatred of Israel&quot;. Ryan said she had faced a &quot;torrent of abuse&quot; when leaving Labour but maintained that &quot;those threats only strengthen my resolve.&quot;

In February 2019, the Labour Party reported Ryan to the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, accusing Ryan of accessing party systems to contact members after resigning from the party. Ryan told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Neither I nor my office have accessed or used any Labour Party data since I resigned the Labour whip and my membership of the Labour Party.&quot;

In September 2019, Ryan announced that she would not stand at the next general election. On 5 December, Ryan publicly announced that she would not be voting for Labour at the following week&#x27;s general election, citing entryism as causing changes which meant she could no longer support the Labour Party. She also indicated that while she was not telling people how to vote there was &quot;a huge risk if we vote for Jeremy Corbyn&quot;. She also called on Labour MPs to remove Corbyn as leader after the election.

==Later career==
In 2021, Ryan was appointed chief executive of ELNET-UK, the British section of ELNET, a NGO working to strengthen relations between Europe and Israel. 

==Personal life==
, Ryan lived in Enfield with her husband, Martin Hegarty, and had two children and two grandchildren.

<text>Dame Joan Mary Ruddock, (née Anthony; born 28 December 1943) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lewisham Deptford from 1987 to 2015. Ruddock was Minister of State for Energy at the Department of Energy and Climate Change until 11 May 2010. She stood down at the 2015 general election.

==Early life==
Ruddock was educated at Pontypool Girls&#x27; Grammar School and at Imperial College London where she studied Botany and Chemistry. Prior to her election to Parliament, she was chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a UK pressure group; she resigned in 1985.

==Parliamentary career==
Ruddock fought the safe Conservative seat of Newbury in 1979, coming third. She was elected for Lewisham Deptford in 1987, succeeding John Silkin. She was initially a member of the Campaign Group but resigned in 1988 in protest at Tony Benn&#x27;s decision to challenge Neil Kinnock for the leadership.

During the government of Tony Blair, she briefly served as Minister for Women. She returned to government when Gordon Brown appointed her Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in June 2007 with responsibility for biodiversity, climate change adaptation, waste and domestic forestry. In October 2008 she was transferred to the newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change, continuing in her previous role. In the June 2009 reshuffle she was promoted to Minister of State level, with responsibility for energy policy, which she held until the fall of the Labour Government in 2010.

During her time in Parliament Ruddock was responsible for successfully introducing two private members bills on fly tipping and ensuring local authorities provided doorstep recycling.

She is an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths, University of London, an Honorary Fellow of Laban London and a member of the Board of Trinity Laban.

She was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 9 June 2010. She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for public and political services.

==Private life==
Ruddock&#x27;s first husband was Keith Harrhy Ruddock, Professor of Biophysics at Imperial College London, whom she married in 1963, He died in a traffic accident in 1996; the couple had separated in 1990. Her second marriage was to the former Labour MP for Aberdeen North, Frank Doran from 2010 until his death in 2017.

<doc id="449477" wikidata="Q837924" url="?curid=449477" title="Bilinear form">
<text>In mathematics, a bilinear form is a bilinear map on a vector space (the elements of which are called &quot;vectors&quot;) over a field &quot;K&quot; (the elements of which are called &quot;scalars&quot;). In other words, a bilinear form is a function that is linear in each argument separately:
* and 
* and 

The dot product on formula_1 is an example of a bilinear form which is also an inner product. An example of a bilinear form that is not an inner product would be the four-vector product.

The definition of a bilinear form can be extended to include modules over a ring, with linear maps replaced by module homomorphisms.

When is the field of complex numbers , one is often more interested in sesquilinear forms, which are similar to bilinear forms but are conjugate linear in one argument.

==Coordinate representation==
Let be an -dimensional vector space with basis .

The matrix &quot;A&quot;, defined by is called the &quot;matrix of the bilinear form&quot; on the basis .

If the matrix represents a vector with respect to this basis, and similarly, the matrix represents another vector , then:
formula_2

A bilinear form has different matrices on different bases. However, the matrices of a bilinear form on different bases are all congruent. More precisely, if is another basis of , then
formula_3
where the formula_4 form an invertible matrix . Then, the matrix of the bilinear form on the new basis is .

==Properties==
===Non-degenerate bilinear forms===

Every bilinear form on defines a pair of linear maps from to its dual space . Define by
This is often denoted as
where the dot ( ⋅ ) indicates the slot into which the argument for the resulting linear functional is to be placed (see Currying).

For a finite-dimensional vector space , if either of or is an isomorphism, then both are, and the bilinear form is said to be nondegenerate. More concretely, for a finite-dimensional vector space, non-degenerate means that every non-zero element pairs non-trivially with some other element:
:formula_5 for all formula_6 implies that and
:formula_5 for all formula_8 implies that .

The corresponding notion for a module over a commutative ring is that a bilinear form is if is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated module over a commutative ring, the pairing may be injective (hence &quot;nondegenerate&quot; in the above sense) but not unimodular. For example, over the integers, the pairing is nondegenerate but not unimodular, as the induced map from to is multiplication by 2.

If is finite-dimensional then one can identify with its double dual . One can then show that is the transpose of the linear map (if is infinite-dimensional then is the transpose of restricted to the image of in ). Given one can define the &quot;transpose&quot; of to be the bilinear form given by
The left radical and right radical of the form are the kernels of and respectively; they are the vectors orthogonal to the whole space on the left and on the right.

If is finite-dimensional then the rank of is equal to the rank of . If this number is equal to then and are linear isomorphisms from to . In this case is nondegenerate. By the rank–nullity theorem, this is equivalent to the condition that the left and equivalently right radicals be trivial. For finite-dimensional spaces, this is often taken as the &quot;definition&quot; of nondegeneracy:
Given any linear map one can obtain a bilinear form &quot;B&quot; on &quot;V&quot; via
This form will be nondegenerate if and only if is an isomorphism.

If is finite-dimensional then, relative to some basis for , a bilinear form is degenerate if and only if the determinant of the associated matrix is zero. Likewise, a nondegenerate form is one for which the determinant of the associated matrix is non-zero (the matrix is non-singular). These statements are independent of the chosen basis. For a module over a commutative ring, a unimodular form is one for which the determinant of the associate matrix is a unit (for example 1), hence the term; note that a form whose matrix determinant is non-zero but not a unit will be nondegenerate but not unimodular, for example over the integers.

===Symmetric, skew-symmetric, and alternating forms===
We define a bilinear form to be
* symmetric if for all , in ;
* alternating if for all in ;
* &#x27; or &#x27; if for all , in ;
*; Proposition: Every alternating form is skew-symmetric.
*; Proof: This can be seen by expanding .

If the characteristic of is not 2 then the converse is also true: every skew-symmetric form is alternating. However, if then a skew-symmetric form is the same as a symmetric form and there exist symmetric/skew-symmetric forms that are not alternating.

A bilinear form is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric) if and only if its coordinate matrix (relative to any basis) is symmetric (respectively skew-symmetric). A bilinear form is alternating if and only if its coordinate matrix is skew-symmetric and the diagonal entries are all zero (which follows from skew-symmetry when ).

A bilinear form is symmetric if and only if the maps are equal, and skew-symmetric if and only if they are negatives of one another. If then one can decompose a bilinear form into a symmetric and a skew-symmetric part as follows
formula_9
where is the transpose of (defined above).

===Reflexive bilinear forms and orthogonal vectors===

A bilinear form is reflexive if and only if it is either symmetric or alternating. In the absence of reflexivity we have to distinguish left and right orthogonality. In a reflexive space the left and right radicals agree and are termed the &quot;kernel&quot; or the &quot;radical&quot; of the bilinear form: the subspace of all vectors orthogonal with every other vector. A vector , with matrix representation , is in the radical of a bilinear form with matrix representation , if and only if . The radical is always a subspace of . It is trivial if and only if the matrix is nonsingular, and thus if and only if the bilinear form is nondegenerate.

Suppose is a subspace. Define the &quot;orthogonal complement&quot;
formula_10

For a non-degenerate form on a finite-dimensional space, the map is bijective, and the dimension of is .

===Bounded and elliptic bilinear forms===
Definition: A bilinear form on a normed vector space is bounded, if there is a constant such that for all ,
formula_11

Definition: A bilinear form on a normed vector space is elliptic, or coercive, if there is a constant such that for all ,
formula_12

==Associated quadratic form==

For any bilinear form , there exists an associated quadratic form defined by .

When , the quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; is determined by the symmetric part of the bilinear form &quot;B&quot; and is independent of the antisymmetric part. In this case there is a one-to-one correspondence between the symmetric part of the bilinear form and the quadratic form, and it makes sense to speak of the symmetric bilinear form associated with a quadratic form.

When and , this correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms breaks down.

==Relation to tensor products==
By the universal property of the tensor product, there is a canonical correspondence between bilinear forms on and linear maps . If is a bilinear form on the corresponding linear map is given by

In the other direction, if is a linear map the corresponding bilinear form is given by composing &quot;F&quot; with the bilinear map that sends to .

The set of all linear maps is the dual space of , so bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of which (when is finite-dimensional) is canonically isomorphic to .

Likewise, symmetric bilinear forms may be thought of as elements of (dual of the second symmetric power of ) and alternating bilinear forms as elements of (the second exterior power of ). If , .

==Generalizations==
===Pairs of distinct vector spaces===
Much of the theory is available for a bilinear mapping from two vector spaces over the same base field to that field
Here we still have induced linear mappings from to , and from to . It may happen that these mappings are isomorphisms; assuming finite dimensions, if one is an isomorphism, the other must be. When this occurs, &quot;B&quot; is said to be a perfect pairing.

In finite dimensions, this is equivalent to the pairing being nondegenerate (the spaces necessarily having the same dimensions). For modules (instead of vector spaces), just as how a nondegenerate form is weaker than a unimodular form, a nondegenerate pairing is a weaker notion than a perfect pairing. A pairing can be nondegenerate without being a perfect pairing, for instance via is nondegenerate, but induces multiplication by 2 on the map .

Terminology varies in coverage of bilinear forms. For example, F. Reese Harvey discusses &quot;eight types of inner product&quot;. To define them he uses diagonal matrices &quot;Aij&quot; having only +1 or −1 for non-zero elements. Some of the &quot;inner products&quot; are symplectic forms and some are sesquilinear forms or Hermitian forms. Rather than a general field , the instances with real numbers , complex numbers , and quaternions are spelled out. The bilinear form
formula_13
is called the real symmetric case and labeled , where . Then he articulates the connection to traditional terminology:
===General modules===
Given a ring and a right -module and its dual module , a mapping is called a bilinear form if

for all , all and all .

The mapping is known as the &quot;natural pairing&quot;, also called the &quot;canonical bilinear form&quot; on .

A linear map induces the bilinear form , and a linear map induces the bilinear form .

Conversely, a bilinear form induces the &quot;R&quot;-linear maps and . Here, denotes the double dual of .

<doc id="449478" wikidata="Q13751836" url="?curid=449478" title="List of United States congressional districts">
<text>Congressional districts in the United States are electoral divisions for the purpose of electing members of the United States House of Representatives. The number of voting seats within the House of Representatives is currently set at 435, with each one representing an average of 761,169 people following the 2020 United States census. The number of voting seats has applied since 1913, excluding a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929. In addition, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D. C., sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.

The Bureau of the Census conducts a constitutionally mandated decennial census whose figures are used to determine the number of congressional districts to which each state is entitled, in a process called &quot;apportionment&quot;. The 2022 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2020 United States census.

Each state is responsible for the redistricting of districts within their state, while several states have one &quot;at-large&quot; division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes following a re-apportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district have changed substantially. Setting the boundaries of states&#x27; congressional districts is the responsibility of state governments, who often gerrymander districts for various reasons. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries, while changing their district numbers.

The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.

<doc id="449485" wikidata="Q1243683" url="?curid=449485" title="Dorabella Cipher">
<text>The Dorabella Cipher is an enciphered letter written by composer Edward Elgar to Dora Penny, which was accompanied by another dated July 14, 1897. Penny never deciphered it and its meaning remains unknown.

The cipher, consisting of 87 characters spread over 3 lines, appears to be made up from 24 symbols, each symbol consisting of 1, 2, or 3 approximate semicircles oriented in one of 8 directions (the orientation of several characters is ambiguous). A small dot appears after the fifth character on the third line.

== Background ==

Dora Penny (1874–1964) was the daughter of the Reverend Alfred Penny (1845–1935) of Wolverhampton. Dora&#x27;s mother died in February 1874, six days after giving birth to Dora, after which her father worked for many years as a missionary in Melanesia. In 1895 Dora&#x27;s father remarried, and Dora&#x27;s stepmother was a friend of Caroline Alice Elgar. In July 1897 the Penny family invited Edward and Alice Elgar to stay at the Wolverhampton Rectory for a few days.

Edward Elgar was a forty-year-old music teacher who had yet to become a successful composer. Dora Penny was almost seventeen years his junior. Edward and Dora liked one another and remained friends for the rest of the composer&#x27;s life: Elgar named Variation 10 of his 1899 &quot;Variations on an Original Theme&quot; (Enigma) &quot;Dorabella&quot; as a dedication to Dora Penny.

On returning to Great Malvern on 14 July 1897 Alice wrote a letter of thanks to the Penny family. Edward Elgar inserted a note with cryptic writing: he pencilled the name &#x27;Miss Penny&#x27; on the reverse. This note lay in a drawer for forty years and became generally known when Dora had it reproduced in her memoir &quot;Edward Elgar: Memories of a Variation&quot;, published by Methuen Publishing in 1937. Subsequently, the original note was lost. Dora claimed that she had never been able to read the note, which she assumed to be a cipher message.

Composer and historian Kevin Jones advanced one view;
Dora&#x27;s father had just returned from Melanesia where he had been a missionary for many years. Fascinated by local language and culture, he possessed a few traditional talismans decorated with arcane glyphs. Perhaps such an item surfaced as a conversation piece during the Elgars&#x27; week in Wolverhampton? And if Dora recalled this when writing her memoirs, it might account for the fact the coded message was referred to as an &#x27;inscription&#x27; when communicating with the director of SOAS many years later.

The Dorabella Cipher is not the only document penned by Elgar that contains the approximately semi-circular characters. At a concert in April 1886 (over ten years prior to his letter to Penny), he annotated a concert program with 18 similar characters followed by an underscore. This fragment became known as the &quot;Liszt fragment&quot;. The symbols also appear in a 1920s notebook of Elgar, along with diagrams resembling clock faces, and on the so-called &quot;Cryptogram card&quot;, which forms part of a series of cards detailing Elgar&#x27;s solution to a cryptographic challenge set in &quot;Pall Mall&quot; magazine in 1896.

== Proposed solutions ==

Eric Sams, the musicologist, produced an interpretation in 1970. His interpretation of the message is:

The length of this text is 109 letters (ignoring the parenthetic note on Greek), whereas the original text contains only 87 or 88 characters: Sams claimed the surplus letters are implied by phonetic shorthand.

Javier Atance has suggested that the solution is not a text but a melody, the 8 different positions of the semicircles, turning clockwise, corresponding to the notes of the scale, and that each semicircle has 3 different levels corresponding to natural, flat or sharp notes.

Tim S. Roberts claims a solution via a simple substitution cipher and offers a statistical justification:

In December 2011, Canadian cryptographer enthusiast Richard Henderson claimed to have found the correct clear text, encoded once again as a simple substitution cipher (with two letters as nulls), although some details remain to be worked out. His solution would read:

In July 2020, Wayne Packwood claimed in the journal &quot;Musical Opinion&quot; to have produced a complete decryption:

The secondary message below was identified as the word RATS, which Packwood believed was a playful acknowledgement from Sir Edward to the individual that broke his cipher. Packwood&#x27;s method involved rearranging the cipher based on the position of several dots, which Packwood identified as representing a conductor&#x27;s baton, and then arbitrarily shifting the presumed values of each glyph independently until a message emerged. The logic behind the pattern of shifts is not explained.

In a 2023 study, Viktor Wase applied cipher-solving computer algorithms to the Dorabella cipher and discovered that it is unlikely to be a monoalphabetic substitution cipher in English or Latin. This was done by showing that these algorithms can solve ciphers that are as short as Dorabella, yet they fail to solve the Dorabella cipher. 

== 2007 Elgar Society Competition ==

The Elgar Society advertised a Dorabella Cipher Competition in 2007 to mark the 150th anniversary of Elgar&#x27;s birth. A number of entries were received but none were found to be satisfactory: &quot;One or two entries did contain some impressively ambitious and thoughtful analysis. These entries, though, having matched Elgar&#x27;s symbols to the alphabet, invariably ended up with a fairly arbitrary sequence of letters. ... [T]he results read as a disconnected chain of bizarre utterances, such as an imaginative mind could conjure up from any group of random letters&quot;.

<text>There currently are 12 United States congressional districts in New Jersey based on results from the 2020 census. There were once as many as 15. The was lost after the 1980 census, the was lost after the 1990 census, and the was lost after the 2010 census.

Between the 1998 and 2018 elections, Democrats held between 6 and 8 seats. The 2018 elections brought Democrats to 11 of the 12 seats, which was their highest since the 1912 elections. This left Chris Smith in the 4th district as the only Republican member of New Jersey&#x27;s congressional delegation for the 116th Congress. It was also the first time since that election that Republicans failed to hold any seat in North Jersey. In the 118th Congress, Democrats hold 9 of the 12 seats.

<text>Porthcawl () is a town and community in the Bridgend County Borough of Wales. It is located on the south coast, west of Cardiff and south-east of Swansea.

Historically part of Glamorgan and situated on a low limestone headland on the South Wales coast, overlooking the Bristol Channel, Porthcawl developed as a coal port during the 19th century, but its trade was soon taken over by more rapidly developing ports such as Barry. North-west of the town, in the dunes known as &quot;Kenfig Burrows&quot;, lies the remains of Kenfig Castle.

==Toponymy==
 is a common Welsh element meaning &quot;harbour&quot; and the &quot;&quot; here refers to &quot;sea kale&quot;, which may have grown in profusion or even been collected here.

==Holiday resort==

Porthcawl is a holiday resort in South Wales and is home to a large static caravan park known as &quot;Trecco Bay&quot;, which is owned and operated by Parkdean Resorts. It has an extensive promenade and several beaches: a tourist-oriented beach at Trecco Bay, at the east end of the town; a sandy beach at Rest Bay, which lies to the north-west of the town; and the quiet and sandy Pink Bay leading out towards Sker Point where a tarmac-covered car park serves a sandy beach. Trecco Bay and Rest Bay are Blue Flag Beaches.

Porthcawl, like many British resorts, has suffered a decline in its holiday trade, especially since most of the South Wales Valleys coal pits closed. A major feature of the summer was the miners&#x27; fortnight, when large numbers of miners took their annual break.

==Local attractions==
Tourist attractions in the area include sandy beaches, a grand pavilion, a funfair named Coney Beach (modelled on Coney Island in New York), a museum, three golf courses and the site of the former black obelisk.

Built in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, Porthcawl&#x27;s promenade runs along the seafront from Lock&#x27;s Common in the west to the harbour, before joining the Eastern Promenade and leading to Coney Beach and Griffin Park. It was restored in 1996. There are many cafes, bars, restaurants and hotels along the promenade, which offer views across the Bristol Channel.

The Grand Pavilion, built at a cost of £25,000 in 1932, is the venue for shows, including the annual pantomime. The singer, actor and civil rights activist Paul Robeson once performed &#x27;live&#x27; at the Pavilion via a transatlantic telephone link.

Controversial luxury flats now dominate the seafront on the site previously occupied by the Esplanade Hotel, which dated back to the late 1880s. The Royal Society of Architects in Wales awarded &#x27;Esplanade House&#x27; a Welsh Housing Design Award in 2006, but the architecture has proved unpopular with many local residents who have nicknamed it &quot;the bottle bank&quot;.

===Harbour Quarter===
Porthcawl Lifeboat Station, built in 1995, is situated near the harbour. The station operates an Atlantic 85-class lifeboat and a D-class IB1 inflatable lifeboat. &quot;Cosy Corner&quot; is a park area, which over the years has housed a theatre, cinema, roller skating rink and ballroom. The Jennings Building, built in 1832, is a grade II listed building and Wales&#x27; oldest maritime warehouse. The building was identified as a potentially important facility as part of the &quot;Porthcawl Regeneration Strategy&quot;; it houses three hospitality businesses.

At the end of Porthcawl jetty stands a white lighthouse built in 1860, as a navigational aid. It was the last coal and gas-powered lighthouse in the United Kingdom. It switched to being powered by North Sea gas in 1974, before becoming powered by electricity in 1997. The jetty and surrounding area are popular spots for sea fishing.

The historic ships the PS Waverley, the last seagoing paddle steamer in the world, and the MV Balmoral sail from this area during the summer months.

<doc id="449493" wikidata="Q4717117" url="?curid=449493" title="Alex Haley's Queen">
<text>Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen (also known as Queen) is a 1993 American television miniseries that aired in three installments on February 14, 16, and 18 on CBS. The miniseries is an adaptation of the 1993 novel &quot;&quot;, by Alex Haley and David Stevens. The novel is based on the life of Queen Jackson Haley, Haley&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Alex Haley died in February 1992 before completing the novel. It was later finished by David Stevens and published in 1993. Stevens also wrote the screenplay for the miniseries.

&quot;Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen&quot; was directed by John Erman, and stars Halle Berry in the title role. It tells the life story of a young woman and it shows the problems which biracial slaves and former slaves faced in the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout her life, Queen struggles to fit into the two cultures of her heritage; and at times, each side shuns her.

The series begins on Forks of Cypress, a plantation near Florence in northern Alabama. James Jackson Jr., the son of the plantation owner, and Easter, a slave who works in the weaving house, have both grown up on the estate, and gradually their feelings for each other have developed into romance. Easter is the daughter of an African-American house slave, Captain Jack, and Annie, a part-Cherokee slave who is no longer on the Jackson property.

James Jackson Sr., an Irish immigrant who has accumulated considerable wealth, becomes ill and soon dies, leaving his wife Sally a widow. Grieving, James Jr. retreats to the comfort of the weaving house and he and Easter make love. Several months later, while they are alone, Easter reveals to him that she is pregnant with his child. Meanwhile, Sally encourages James Jr. to marry the respectable and wealthy heiress Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Perkins, the daughter of a neighboring planter.

On April 8, 1841, Easter gives birth to a healthy girl. As the Jackson family dine with acquaintances, Captain Jack announces that a slave child has been born, and assures James, &quot;Easter&#x27;s doing just fine&quot;. Lizzie, who is present for the dinner, concludes that the new baby is James&#x27; child, excuses herself from the table and throws a fit. She vows to her mother that she&#x27;ll never marry him, but her mother persuades her otherwise. Captain Jack begins to refer to the baby as Princess, but, when James enters the birth in the record book, he writes the name &quot;Queen&quot;, and leaves blank the section for the name of the father.

James proposes marriage to Lizzie the next evening; she accepts, and the pair are later married. Still in love with Easter, James continues to visit her frequently at night during both his engagement and his marriage. Later Lizzie learns that she has become pregnant. She and James welcome a daughter, Jane, whom Queen attends and serves. Although Jane and Queen are half-sisters, the family does not acknowledge that relationship.

James later proposes that Queen be trained as Jane&#x27;s lady&#x27;s maid. Both Easter and Lizzie oppose that plan, but James&#x27; word is final, so at age five Queen moves into the mansion. Jane and Queen grow up as playmates; however, the other slave children tease and torment Queen because of her light skin and her ability to read and write. By 1860, several years later, the two young ladies, Queen and Jane, have grown up, and they begin to attract the attention of the young men in Florence.

In the next year, 1861, Alabama secedes from the United States, the North declares war against the South, and James enters the Confederate Army and heads northward. As James rides away in a cavalry unit, Easter confirms to Queen that he is her &quot;pappy&quot;.

On July 21, 1861, during the First Battle of Bull Run, in Prince William County, Virginia, near Manassas, James sustains an injury, and he is discharged and sent back home. There he learns that both Jane and Easter have died during an epidemic of diphtheria.

Queen continues to serve the aging Sally and Lizzie in the big house. Many of the field hands have left and gone north, and Queen takes over the duties of overseer, supervising the remaining slaves.

Soon James forms a regiment, receives a promotion to the rank of colonel, and heads back into the war. Eventually the Union Army reaches Florence and the Jackson plantation. Union soldiers loot and plunder, wantonly destroy property, insult the ladies and brutalize the slaves, for whose freedom they have claimed to be fighting. Captain Jack is injured, and dies as a free man, with Sally Jackson and Queen beside him. Meanwhile, Col. Jackson sustains another injury, which causes the amputation of his right arm without anesthesia.

Sally Jackson advises Queen to find a place to live among the newly freed blacks, saying that there is no food and no place for her at the estate; Queen strongly objects, insisting that the plantation is her home, and the Jacksons are her family. Parson Dick, another slave there, warns Queen about the difficulties awaiting mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons in the new free society.

===Part 2===
Mr. Henderson, the former overseer, and his wife have left the Jackson plantation, and they now run a nearby grocery store, where young redneck white men hang out, and James trades. Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, however, freely insult James and Queen.

After an unpleasant confrontation at the store with Mrs. Henderson and several of the rednecks, Queen runs away and hides until the next morning; tired and hungry, she returns home, only to be berated for her absence. Queen decides to leave the estate; as she visits the grave of her mother, Sally bids her goodbye and hands her a sum of money. After a brief encounter on the laneway with James, who has been out searching for her, Queen sets off on her own.

In Florence, Queen realizes how easily she can &quot;pass&quot; as a white lady; she buys a one-way stagecoach ticket and travels to Charleston, South Carolina.

At a charitable soup kitchen, Queen meets Alice, a fair-skinned young &quot;colored&quot; lady who is passing as white. Alice befriends Queen, takes her into her apartment, cleans her up, teaches her about passing, and takes her to a white dance hall; there she meets Alice&#x27;s white gentleman friend, George, who gets Queen a job in a flower shop.

At the shop, Queen meets Digby, an injured former Confederate soldier, who quickly falls for her and proposes marriage. Queen accepts, then tells Alice, who insists that such a marriage would be dangerous and strongly urges Queen to break the engagement.

Queen goes to Digby&#x27;s apartment, intending to break off the engagement. Digby begins to seduce Queen with some help from a dose of laudanum. Queen objects and resists, and blurts out that she is a Negro. Digby then flies into a rage, beats her, rapes her, and throws her out.

Queen returns to Alice, who also throws her out, to protect her own position and reputation. The next day, after a miserable night in a camp of black homeless people, Queen staggers into a meeting of a black church, where she receives help from a kindly woman, who later takes her to the home of two self-righteous and sanctimonious spinsters, Misses Mandy, and Giffery, who hire Queen as a live-in maid.

A few days later Davis, a gardener and a former slave, arrives in the spinsters&#x27; backyard in search of work. Queen and Davis start a friendship, which turns into romance and Queen becomes pregnant. Queen first seeks an abortion, then decides to keep the child; She confronts Davis, who invites her to meet him at the railway station, presumably to head north.

Queen waits at the station well into the evening, but Davis fails to appear, so she dejectedly returns to the old maids. Miss Mandy labels her as a wicked, naughty girl and a fallen sinner, but she and Miss Giffery allow her to remain. In due time the two spinsters, acting as midwives, attend the birth of a healthy boy. Queen wants to give him the name &quot;David&quot;, but at the insistence of the two women, the baby is christened &quot;Abner&quot;. Misses Mandy and Giffery increasingly take over Abner, apparently intending to raise him as though he were their own. One night, Queen flees and heads north with six-month-old Abner in her arms.

===Part 3===
At a crossroads store and lunchroom, Queen meets Mrs. Benson, an upper-middle-class white mother of a 15-month-old son, for whom she needs a wet nurse. They ride away toward the Benson home, in Beaufort, South Carolina, which is south of Charleston and not on a direct way to Savannah, Tennessee (Queen&#x27;s destination).

When Queen and Mrs. Benson arrive in Beaufort, they meet Mr. Benson amid a crowd of angry black former slaves, striking for more pay and more respect, under the vocal persuasion and agitation of Davis, Abner&#x27;s father. Later Queen finds Davis, confronts him, berates him for having abandoned her and Abner. They eventually reconcile.

Unknown to Queen, Mr. Benson is a leader among the local Ku Klux Klan. Mrs. Benson, feigning concern for the security of Davis, urges Queen to leave Abner with her in safety while she warns Davis that he is in imminent danger of a &quot;terrible work&quot; of the Klan. Queen goes, and a Klansman follows; when she returns to the Benson home, Abner is not there. Mrs. Benson says that Abner &quot;is doing God&#x27;s work tonight&quot;; the child is used as bait to lure Davis from his cabin. The next morning, Queen finds Davis&#x27; hanged and charred body; Abner is inside a wooden chicken cage at his father&#x27;s feet.

In the next scene, Queen and Abner, now a toddler of about two years, board a small wooden ferryboat near Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee, where they meet its operator, Alec Haley, and his son, Henry. Although Queen tells him she is travelling north, Alec persuades her to ride back to the south side, saying that in the North she would find only &quot;cold weather and cold-hearted Yankees&quot;.

Soon Alec introduces Queen to Dora, the cook in the home of Mr. Cherry, a widower, who gives her a job as a maid. Brooding over her regrettable experiences, Queen adopts a defensive and disagreeable attitude; Dora tells her, &quot;It&#x27;s high time you figure out who your friends are, Missy&quot;, and Mr. Cherry tells her, &quot;You are the most ornery maid I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. Alec berates her for &quot;never talking peaceable to a living soul&quot; and &quot;hating the world for whatever the world done to you&quot;. Gradually, Queen allows a friendship to develop between Alec and herself and changes her attitude; Mr. Cherry comments, &quot;She really lights up this old place when she smiles&quot;. Queen and Alec&#x27;s relationship grows into romance and eventually they are married; Mr. Cherry gives the bride away.

Queen and Alec have a child, whom Queen names as Simon; she expresses high hopes for his future. When he completes the sixth grade, the point at which black boys in the South typically (in the subject setting) drop out of school to start full-time work in the fields, as did Henry and Abner, Simon&#x27;s teacher comments to Queen that he is &quot;the best student in the district&quot;. Alec vigorously argues against Queen&#x27;s wish that Simon stay in school, but Queen presents persuasive logic, and he eventually agrees to &quot;waste&quot; one of the three boys.

One day, Queen takes Abner and Simon back to the Forks of Cypress, the Jackson plantation, to show them where she was raised and to share her memories of her childhood. When they arrive there, the funeral for James Jackson, her father, takes place, and she pays her respect from a distance. Queen then shows her sons the weaving house, where she lived as a girl, along with her mother Easter&#x27;s grave and the Jackson mansion. Inside the house, Lizzie Jackson accosts her bitterly and tells her that she does not belong there, as the mansion was never truly her home. Queen quickly leaves, feeling again sad and rejected by the white side of her family.

In due time, Simon becomes the first black boy in Savannah to complete grade school, and, after another major disagreement at home, Simon begins making plans to go to the normal school in Memphis, Tennessee.

Abner announces that he too wishes to go out into the world to make his own way. Alec reluctantly consents, but Queen objects emotionally, and during the conflict she reveals to Abner that Alec is not his real father. Anxious and upset, Queen begins stoking the wood-fired cast-iron cookstove; an accidental fire ignites her long dress; she runs out of the house and into the surrounding woodland. The fire in the dress dies out, and Queen sustains only minimal physical injuries. However, this last event in the series of accumulated tragic experiences of her past life causes her to have a mental breakdown; Alec commits her to a mental-health institution, in Bolivar, Tennessee, about 50 miles from home.

After several weeks in the depressing &quot;lunatic asylum&quot;, Queen asks that Mr. Cherry visit her at the hospital. She tells her former employer about Abner&#x27;s wish to &quot;find his own place in the world&quot;. Since Queen and Alec have already given all their cash to Simon for his schooling, Queen asks Mr. Cherry for a loan of $50, which he graciously agrees to make. Queen tearfully thanks him and compliantly returns to her room.

Queen convinces the doctor at the asylum to allow her to go home to see her sons when they leave; Alec takes her home in a wagon. They take Abner and Simon on the ferryboat across the Tennessee River stream, and place them aboard a carriage bound for Memphis.

Back at home the aging couple sit on the front porch, and Queen for the first time tells Alec about her life, starting with her time as a slave girl with Jane at the Jackson plantation.

<text>The barony of Camoys was created twice. From 26 November 1313 to 1 April 1335 Ralph de Camoys (d. 1336) was summoned to Parliament by writ, and is thereby held to have become Baron Camoys of the first creation. Ralph de Camoys (d. 1336) married firstly, Margaret de Brewes, daughter of William de Brewes, 1st Lord Brewes (d. 1291), and secondly, Elizabeth le Despenser, daughter of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester (executed 27 October 1326).

By his first wife, Margaret de Brewes, daughter of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose, Ralph de Camoys (d. 1336) had a son, Thomas de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys (d. 1372). Thomas married Margaret, and by her had a son, Ralph Camoys. This first creation of the barony expired with the death on 11 April 1372 without male heirs of Thomas de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys, his son Ralph having predeceased him.

The heir of Thomas de Camoys (d. 1372) was his nephew, another Thomas de Camoys (d. 1421), who was the grandson of Ralph de Camoys (d. 1336) by his second wife, Elizabeth le Despenser, and the son of Sir John Camoys by his second wife, Elizabeth le Latimer, daughter of William le Latimer, 3rd Lord Latimer. From 20 August 1383 to 26 February 1421 Thomas de Camoys (d. 1421) was summoned to Parliament by writ, by which he is held to have become Baron Camoys of the second creation.

Thomas de Camoys (d. 1421) was twice married, firstly to Elizabeth Louches, the daughter of William Louches of Great Milton and Chiselhampton, and secondly to Elizabeth Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, and widow of Henry &#x27;Hotspur&#x27; Percy. By his first wife, Elizabeth Louches, he had a son, Sir Richard Camoys, who married Joan Poynings, and by her had three sons, John, Ralph and Hugh, and two daughters, Margaret and Eleanor. Sir Richard Camoys predeceased his father, dying sometime before 24 June 1416.

The barony was inherited by Sir Richard&#x27;s third son, Hugh de Camoys, 2nd Baron Camoys, who died a minor and a ward of the King on 18 June 1426. On his death the barony fell into abeyance between his sisters, Margaret and Eleanor. It remained in abeyance for 413 years until 1839, when Thomas Stonor, 3rd Baron Camoys successfully claimed the barony as a descendant of Margaret de Camoys. He had previously represented Oxford in the House of Commons and later held office as a lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the Liberal administrations of Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston and William Ewart Gladstone, as well as in the coalition government of Lord Aberdeen. He was succeeded by his grandson, Francis Stonor, 4th Baron Camoys, who served as a lord-in-waiting in the Liberal governments of William Gladstone and Lord Rosebery. the title is currently held by his great-great-grandson, the 8th baron, who succeeded his father in that year.

The ancestral seat of the Stonor family is Stonor Park, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

<text>Walter Robert Szczerbiak Jr. ( ; born March 5, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player and current color analyst for the New York Knicks on MSG Network. He played 10 seasons for four teams in the National Basketball Association. Szczerbiak played college basketball for Miami University, a university in Ohio, and is one of five of the university&#x27;s basketball players whose jerseys have been retired.

==Early life==
Wally Szczerbiak was born in Madrid, Spain, to Marilyn and Walt Szczerbiak, a former ABA player who helped lead Real Madrid to three FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) championships. During his time with Real Madrid, the elder Szczerbiak set a Spanish League single-game scoring record with 65 points. Wally Szczerbiak spent much of his childhood in Europe during his father&#x27;s playing career, and he was taught to speak fluent Spanish and Italian.

When Walt Szczerbiak retired, he moved his family back to his native Long Island, New York. Wally Szczerbiak played basketball at Cold Spring Harbor High School in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. As a senior in the 1994–95 season, he averaged 36.6 points per game and 15.9 rebounds per game. He was named the winner of the Richard Sangler Award as Nassau County&#x27;s outstanding boys&#x27; basketball player. Szczerbiak competed for the Long Island team in the 1994 Empire State Games. Despite his outstanding high school statistics, the small size of Szczerbiak&#x27;s school did not win him the attention of East Coast college coaches, and he went unrecruited.

==College career==
During the fall of his high school senior year, Szczerbiak and his parents visited the Miami University campus in Oxford, Ohio. The following Monday, despite Walt&#x27;s wishes for his son to wait before making a decision, Szczerbiak called coach Herb Sendek and committed to play for Miami.

In his first two seasons at Miami, Szczerbiak averaged 8.0 and 12.8 points per game, respectively. As a junior in 1997–98, he burst onto the scene as one of college basketball&#x27;s leading scorers, averaging 24.4 points per game and earning first-team All-MAC honors despite missing several games with a broken right wrist.

In his senior season, Szczerbiak averaged 24.2 points per game and led the Redhawks to the Sweet 16 in the 1999 NCAA tournament as a #10 seed. Szczerbiak scored a career-high 43 points in a first-round win over #7 seed Washington. He followed that performance with 24 points in a second-round toppling of #2 seed Utah, leading the Redhawks to the Sweet 16. Despite Szczerbiak&#x27;s 23-point performance, the team lost to Kentucky, 58–43. Miami finished the season with a record of 24–8.

Szczerbiak was named MAC Player of the Year, was honored as a first-team All-American by &quot;Basketball News&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and was selected as a second-team All-American by the Associated Press (AP).

Szczerbiak finished his college career as Miami&#x27;s second all-time leading scorer with 1,847 points. He earned a degree in marketing. In 2001, Szczerbiak became the fifth Miami player to have his jersey retired (#32). In 2009, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame. In 2013, Szczerbiak was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame.

==NBA career==

===Minnesota Timberwolves (1999–2006)===
The Minnesota Timberwolves selected Szczerbiak with the sixth overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft. His best year as a professional was in 2002, when he was a coaches&#x27; selection to the Western Conference All-Star team. He tied a Timberwolves franchise record of 44 points on April 13, 2003; the record has since been broken. Szczerbiak came off the bench during the 2004–05 NBA season, but returned to a starting role in the 2005–06 season.

===Boston Celtics (2006–2007)===

On January 26, 2006, Szczerbiak, along with Michael Olowokandi, Dwayne Jones and a conditional first-round draft pick, was traded to the Boston Celtics for Ricky Davis, Mark Blount, Marcus Banks, Justin Reed, and two second-round draft picks.

Szczerbiak underwent surgery during the 2006 offseason to repair a knee injury. In the 2006–07 season, Szczerbiak played well early on, including a 35-point performance against the Charlotte Bobcats early in the season. However, he was soon plagued by several injuries to both ankles. The injuries greatly affected his shooting and jumping ability, and he elected to have season-ending surgery.

===Seattle SuperSonics (2007–2008)===
On June 28, 2007 (the night of the 2007 NBA draft), the Celtics traded Szczerbiak to the Seattle SuperSonics along with Delonte West and Jeff Green (the 5th overall pick) for Ray Allen and Glen Davis (35th overall).

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2008–2009)===

On February 21, 2008, Szczerbiak and Delonte West were traded by the SuperSonics to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a three-way deal that sent Ira Newble and Donyell Marshall from Cleveland to Seattle, Adrian Griffin from the Chicago Bulls to Seattle, Cedric Simmons, Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes, and Shannon Brown, from Cleveland to Chicago, and Ben Wallace and Joe Smith from Chicago to Cleveland.

Szczerbiak played in 25 regular season games (one start) with the Cavaliers, averaging 8.2 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. He scored 18 points against Detroit on April 16, 2008. Between the SuperSonics and the Cavaliers, Szczerbiak played in 75 games in the 2007-2008 season and averaged 11.5 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.

During the 2008 NBA playoffs, Szczerbiak started at shooting guard for the Cavaliers, helping the Cavs defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round by scoring 26 points and shooting 6–13 from the three-point line in Game Six. For the playoffs, Szczerbiak averaged 10.8 points per game.

During the 2008–2009 NBA season, Szczerbiak played in 74 games, starting in five of them. Given 20 minutes a game, Szczerbiak averaged seven points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game while shooting .450 from the field and .411 from the three-point line.

===Retirement===
Szczerbiak was in discussions with the Denver Nuggets in August 2009 about joining the team on a one-year contract. He reportedly rejected a veteran&#x27;s minimum contract offer from Denver, opting instead to continue to rehabilitate his knee and possibly test the free agent market later.

Szczerbiak harbored hopes of signing a one-year contract with the New York Knicks. However, on November 5, 2009, Szczerbiak revealed that he had a third surgery performed on his left knee. According to Szczerbiak&#x27;s doctors, so little cartilage was left in his knee that a fourth surgery would make it difficult for him to have a normal life. Szczerbiak retired from the NBA that year.

During his 10-year NBA career, Szczerbiak averaged 14.1 points per game over 651 games on .485 shooting from the field and .406 shooting from three-point range.

==Broadcasting career==
Szczerbiak became a basketball analyst for CBS College Sports in 2009.

In 2012, Szczerbiak was hired as an analyst at MSG Network to cover the New York Knicks. As of 2023, he remains in that role.

==Personal life==
Szczerbiak is of Ukrainian origin: his grandparents were Ukrainians and met in a refugee camp in West Germany after World War II. After the war, they emigrated to Pittsburgh.

Szczerbiak has a younger brother named Will and a younger sister named Wendy. Wendy Szczerbiak played college basketball for Lehigh University.

Szczerbiak married Shannon Ward in 2000. The couple have five children. The couple filed for divorce in 2020.

<text>In heraldry, a flaunch (; also called flanches or flanks) are among the ordinaries or subordinaries, consisting of two arcs of circles protruding into the field from the sides of the shield. The flaunch is never borne singly.

Plain flaunches are seen in the coats of Hulbert Paul Lindahl Silver and Gillian Patricia Birtwhistle. They may be of different tinctures, as in the coat of the Free State Women&#x27;s Agricultural Union (South Africa) where they are orange/tenny and azure.

Flaunches may touch each other, as in the coat of Bradley Hook.

Like any ordinary, they may
* be charged with other things, as in the English coats of Harlow District Council and Forest of Dean District Council.
* have colourings other than plain ones, as in the English coat of Hoylake Urban District Council and the Canadian one of the Central Saanich (British Columbia) Police Service.
* have ornamented edges, as in the Welsh coat of Maesteg Town Council.

A very rare variation is &quot;square&quot; flaunches, as in the coat of Sheila-Marie Suzanne Cook and the coat of the US Coastguard Cutter &quot;Sequoia&quot;. Parker&#x27;s glossary, s.v. Flaunches, cites two similar coats for Mosylton or Moselton with square flaunches.

==Diminutive==
While supposedly the diminutives of flaunches are &quot;flasques&quot; and &quot;voiders&quot; (which likewise cannot be borne singly), these exist only very rarely in modern heraldry, and in practice cannot be distinguished from flaunches. An example occurs in the coat of Liddell-Grainger of Ayton (second quarter for Liddell), &quot;Argent fretty gules; two voiders or;...&quot; (Scots Public Register, volume 38, page 3).

==As a debruisement==
Some early heraldic writers say that the illegitimate son of a noblewoman must bear her arms with &quot;a surcoat&quot;; that is, on (large) flaunches around a blank center.

<text>Walter Hadye Lin̄i ( ; 1942 – 21 February 1999) was a Raga Anglican priest and politician who was the first Prime Minister of Vanuatu, from independence in 1980 to 1991. He was born at Agatoa village, Pentecost Island.

Lin̄i was a key figure in Vanuatu&#x27;s struggle for independence. He was a key proponent of Melanesian socialism.

==Early life==
Lin̄i started school at the age of five when he attended the Australian Missionary Sunday School at Lamalanga on North Pentecost. In 1950, he began attending Nazareth School at Agatoa. From there, he attended Vureas School on Aoba. After finishing school, Lin̄i worked in the Anglican Diocesan office at Lolowai, before undertaking theological training at St Peter&#x27;s College in Siota, Solomon Islands and St John&#x27;s College, Auckland.

After returning from his studies in New Zealand, Lin̄i, along with Donald Kalpokas and John Bani, formed the New Hebrides Cultural Association and launched its mouthpiece newspaper, &quot;New Hebrides Viewpoint&quot;. At that time, New Hebrides was a condominium ruled by the United Kingdom and France. Soon after the formation of the New Hebrides Cultural Association, Lin̄i and others formed the New Hebrides National Party (NHNP), with Lin̄i responsible for publishing the newspaper as well as recruiting party members on Aoba, North Pentecost and Maewo. In 1974, the Party Congress elected Lin̄i as full-time national president of the party, with Fred Timakata vice-president. In May, 1974, Lin̄i addressed the United Nations Committee of 24 on decolonisation, and called for independence for the New Hebrides by 1977.

==Political career==
Lin̄i was instrumental in the NHNP changing its name to the Vanua&#x27;aku Pati (VP). He was elected Chief Minister following the VP&#x27;s victory in the 1979 New Hebridean general election, and ascended to the position of Prime Minister upon Vanuatu&#x27;s independence on July 30, 1980.

Lin̄i went on to lead the VP to victory in the 1983 and the 1987 general elections.

Lini suffered a stroke in 1987 but subsequently remained active in politics.

Lin̄i&#x27;s administration was very controversial in because of its ties with the Eastern Bloc, Libya, and other communist and socialist countries viewed with disdain by the United States and its staunch opposition to nuclear testing in the region. He was the primary advocate of Melanesian socialism. Lini was a critic of Western market economies, arguing that they caused poverty in the Third World. Vanuatu was a part of the non-aligned movement. Vanuatu provided support to the Kanak indigenous independence movement in New Caledonia and was the only country in the region to support the independence of East Timor, then under Indonesian occupation, to self-determination.

In 1988, President Ati George Sokomanu sought unsuccessfully to remove Lini from office.

His term ended in 1991, due to factionalism within his party. He joined the National United Party, of which he was leader at the time of his death.

He was later appointed deputy prime minister, minister of justice and minister of interior.

He died of an illness in Vanuatu&#x27;s capital Port Vila.

== Personal life ==
His sister, Hilda Lin̄i, and brother, Ham Lin̄i, are also politicians in Vanuatu. His sister Heather Lin̄i-Leo Matas was the first indigenous female lawyer in the country.

According to Lini, on his mother&#x27;s side, he was a descendant of the high chief Virasangvulu, while on his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from the famous weaver, Nuenue, as well as from the high chief Viralalau.

<text>Beja () is a city and a municipality in the Alentejo region, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 35,854, in an area of . The city proper had a population of 21,658 in 2001.

The municipality is the capital of the Beja District. The municipal holiday is Ascension Day. The Portuguese Air Force has an airbase in the area – the Air Base No. 11.

==History==
Situated on a hill, commanding a strategic position over the vast plains of the Baixo Alentejo, Beja was already an important place in antiquity. Already inhabited in Celtic times, the town was later named &quot;Pax Julia&quot; by Julius Caesar in 48 BCE, when he made peace with the Lusitanians. He raised the town to be the capital of the southernmost province of Lusitania (Santarém and Braga were the other capitals of the &quot;conventi&quot;). During the reign of emperor Augustus the thriving town became Pax Augusta. It was already then a strategic road junction.

When the Visigoths took over the region, they called the town &quot;Paca&quot; (a direct derivation or shortening of the Latin &quot;Pax or Pace-Augusta&quot;) which then became the seat of a bishopric. Saint Aprígio (died in 530) became the first Visigothic bishop of Paca. The town fell to the invading Umayyad army in 713. &quot;Paca&quot;, was then adapted to Arabic &quot;Baja&quot; ( there&#x27;s no sound for &quot;p&quot; in Arabic), and eventually became &quot;Beja&quot;.

Starting in 910 there were successive attempts of conquest and reconquest by the Christian kings. With the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba in 1031, Beja became a taifa, an independent Muslim-ruled principality. In 1144 the governor of Beja, Sidray ibn Wazir, helped the rebellion of the &quot;Murīdūn&quot; (disciples) led by Abul-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn al-Quasi in the Algarve against power of Seville. In 1150 the town was captured by an army of the Almohads, who annexed it to their North African empire. It was retaken in 1162 by Fernão Gonçalves, leading the army of the Portuguese king Afonso I. It must have been abandoned by the Portuguese because in 1172 Gerald the Mercenary captured the town from the Muslims and before departing from it the medieval Arab city was reduced to rubble and left desolate. A scarce 200 men and their families returned to the city rebuilding once more but a mere 6 years later [when the Almohad caliph crossed the straits to Morocco] in 1178, the Portuguese under Afonso I launched an expedition against the city. The entire population fled to Mertola thus bringing a definitive end to Muslim inhabitation of Beja. It stayed under Muslim rule [most likely only inhabited by a garrison] till 1234 when king Sancho II finally recaptured the town from the Moors.

All these wars depopulated the town and gradually reduced it to rubble. Only with Manuel I in 1521 did Beja again reach the status of city. It was attacked and occupied by the Portuguese and the Spanish armies during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1667).

Beja became again the head of a bishopric in 1770, more than a thousand years after the fall of the Visigothic city. In 1808 Napoleonic troops under General Junot sacked the city and massacred the inhabitants.
===Jewish History===
Jews had already been living in Beja by the time the Kingdom of Portugal was established in the 12th century. Clauses regarding Jews are mentioned in the town&#x27;s first charter. When the Jews were expelled from Portugal, Beja became a center for crypto-Judaism. The surname Beja was common among Sephardim living in other parts of Europe and the Middle East, presumably the descendants of those who were expelled, as it was common for Sephardic Jews to take on the surnames of the towns they were expelled from.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Due to its southernmost inland location with the descending winds of the subtropics and low precipitation, especially in summer, the city has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). It is the hottest main city in Portugal and one of the hottest places in Europe during summer. Between 2001 and 2018 it had the hottest summer of any main city in the country. Winters are mild and moderately rainy, while summers are hot and dry.

The average high in January is around , while the July and August highs are around . However, in the last few years there has been an increase, to around 34-36°C+. The July and August lows are around , while the January lows are around , occasionally dropping below during the cold months, with an average of 9 days with frost per year. The annual mean temperature is around . The average total rainfall in a year is .

Snow is rare but may fall about once per decade, the last major snowfall having happened on January 10, 2009. The year 2005 was particularly dry in Portugal and Beja suffered devastating forest fires in the surrounding rural areas contributing to the desertification that affects Alentejo.


===Human geography===
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 11 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Albernoa e Trindade
* Baleizão
* Beja (Salvador e Santa Maria da Feira)

====International relations====

Beja is twinned with:
==Architecture==

=== Castle ===


The Castle of Beja on top of the hill can be seen from afar and dominates the town. It was built, together with the town walls, under the reign of King Diniz in the 13th century over the remains of a Roman &quot;castellum&quot; that had been fortified by the Moors. It consists of battlement walls with four square corner towers and a central granite and marble keep (&quot;Torre de Menagem&quot;), with its height of 40 m the highest in Portugal. The top of the keep can be accessed via a spiral staircase with 197 steps, passing three stellar-vaulted rooms with Gothic windows. The merlons of the machicolation around the keep are topped with small pyramids. Standing on the battlements, one has a sensational panorama of the surrounding landscape. One can also glimpse the remains of the city walls that once had forty turrets and five gates. The castle now houses a small military museum.

The square in front of the castle is named after Gonçalo Mendes da Maia or &quot;O Lidador&quot;, a brave knight killed in the battle against the Moors in 1170.

===Visigothic Museum===
The whitewashed Latin-Visigothic church of Santo Amaro, dedicated to Saint Amaro, standing next to the castle, is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the 6th century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the 7th century. Especially the column with birds attacking a snake is of particular note. It houses today a small archaeological museum with Visigothic art.

===Museum of Queen Eleanor===
This regional museum was set up in 1927 and 1928 in the former Convent of Our Lady of the Conception (&quot;Convento de Nossa Senhora da Conceição&quot;) of the Order of Poor Ladies (dissolved in 1834), gradually expanding its collection. This Franciscan convent had been established in 1459 by Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and duke of Beja, next to his ducal palace. The construction continued until 1509.

It is an impressive building with a late-Gothic lattice-worked architrave running along the building. This elegant architrave resembles somewhat the architrave of the Monastery of Batalha, even if there are some early-Manueline influences. Above the entrance porch on the western façade is an &quot;ajimez&quot; window (a mullioned window) in Manueline and Moorish style in the room of the abbess, originating from the demolished palace of the dukes of Beja. The entrance door is embedded under an ogee arch. A square bell-tower and a spire with crockets tower above the complex. The convent has been classified as a national monument.

The entrance hall leads to the sumptuously gilded Baroque chapel, consisting of a single nave under a semi-circular vault. Three altars (one of the 17th century, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, and two of the 18th century, dedicated to St. Christopher and St. Bento) are decorated with gilded woodwork (&quot;talha dourada&quot;). The fourth altar, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, was decorated with Florentine mosaics by José Ramalho in 1695.

On the wall are three religious azulejos dating from 1741, depicting scenes from the life of St. John the Baptist

The refectory and the &quot;claustro&quot; are decorated with exquisite &quot;azulejos&quot;, some dating from Moorish times, others from the 16th to the 18th centuries.

One enters the chapter house through a Manueline portal from the &quot;quadra&quot; of St. John the Evangelist. The ribbed vault of this square room was distempered during the renovations of 1727. The walls are covered with Arab-Hispanic azulejos with geometric and vegetal designs that are among the most important ceramic decorations in Portugal. Above the azulejos are some semicircular distempered paintings with religious themes: St. John the Baptist, St. John the Evangelist, St. Christopher, St. Clare and St. Francis of Assisi.

The museum houses also an important collection of Flemish, Spanish and Portuguese paintings from the 15th to the 18th centuries, among them:

* Flemish paintings: &quot;Virgin with Milk&quot;; Flemish School (c. 1530) and &quot;Christ and His Apostles&quot; (16th century)
* Portuguese paintings: &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; (15th century), &quot;St. Vincent by Vicente Gil and Manuel Vicente (16th century), &quot;Virgin with the Rose&quot; by Francisco Campos (16th century), &quot;Mass of St. Gregory&quot; probably by Gregório Lopes (16th century), &quot;Annunciation&quot; (16th century) and four paintings by António Nogueira (16th century), &quot;Last Supper&quot; by Pedro Alexandrino (17th century).
* Spanish paintings: &quot;St. Augustine&quot;, &quot;St. Jerome&quot; and &quot;Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew&quot; by José de Ribera (Spanish, 17th century), &quot;Head of Saint John the Baptist&quot; (Spanish School, 17th century)

The museum houses also the funeral monuments in late-Gothic style of the first abbess D. Uganda and of the Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and his wife Beatriz of Portugal.

The archaeological collection of Fernando Nunes Ribeiro, donated to museum in 1987 after forty years of archaeological research, is on display on the upper floors: Visigothic and Roman artefacts, gravestones from the Bronze Age with antique writings of the Iberians and steles from the Iron Age.

Among the several other artefacts in its collection, the museum possesses the &quot;Escudela de Pero de Faria&quot;, a unique piece of Chinese porcelain from 1541.

<text>Bragança (; ), also known in English as Braganza ( , ), is a city and municipality in north-eastern Portugal, capital of the district of Bragança, in the Terras de Trás-os-Montes subregion of Portugal. The population in 2011 was 35,341, in an area of 1173.57 km².

==History==
Archeological evidence permits a determination of human settlement in this region to the Paleolithic. During the Neolithic there was a growth of productive human settlements which concentrated on planting and domestication of animals, with a nascent religion. There are many vestiges of these ancient communities, including ceramics, agricultural implements, weights, arrowheads and modest jewelry found in funerary mounds, such as the tumulus of Donai (mostly destroyed). There are many signs of megalithic constructions dotted throughout the region. It is believed that the larger prehistoric communities developed in Terra Fria, probably in the final part of the Bronze Age (1000-700 BC). During this period, the Celtic or Castro culture of fortified urban structures resulted in walled settlements, situated in elevated areas, with a panoramic view for defense. These communities essentially survived on subsistence agriculture.

Roman colonization, which occurred late in the Roman era, resulted in the establishment of private property and movement away from the forests, in addition to organizational changes resulting administrative, material and cultural evolution. Remnants of the Gallaico-Roman castro societies are evident in Castro of Sacóias and the Castro of Avelãs. In these excavations, modern archaeologists have discovered funerary remains, coins and implements. The Castro of Avelãs (about three kilometres from Bragança) was an important centre on the military road to Astorga, although there are many examples (in Alfaião, Aveleda, Carrazedo, Castro de Avelãs, Donai, França, Gostei, Meixedo, Pinela, Quintela Lampaças, etc.) of the Roman presence. 

The area was dominated by two ethnic communities: the &quot;Zoelae&quot;, with their seat in Castro de Avelãs, and a Lusitanian civitas under the stewardship of the &quot;Baniense&quot; in the southern part of the district. A Latin map, &quot;Atlas de Gotha&quot; by Justus Perthes, mentioned three settlements within this region: Aquae Flaviae (Chaves), Veniatia (Vinhais) and Zoelae (its seat in Zoelas, today Castro de Avelãs) without mentioning any reference to a name similar to Bragança. During Roman colonization, it was part of Gallaecia and dependent administratively on Astorga, on the Atlantic axis of a Roman highway from Meseta, that controlled the gold, iron and silver trade. The references to a settlement with the name similar to &quot;Bragança&quot; occurred in the acts of Council Lugo (569 AD) regarding the &quot;Vergancia&quot;. A similar reference by Wamba (666 AD) referred to &quot;Bregancia&quot;, and where, supposedly two Christian martyrs (John and Paul) were born.

Records of the proto-Germanic Suebic and Visigothic kingdoms are few, probably an indication of advancement in rural agrarian and pastoral communities during their occupation and settlement. Toponymic references such as Gimonde, Guadramil and Samil are some of the remains from this period.

===Medieval period===
Although some placenames remained (such as Alfaião, Babe, Baçal, Bagueixe, Mogadouro), the influence of the Islamic civilization to the northern regions and Douro (as well as mountainous areas) was very small. There is but one passing reference to a &quot;Pelagius Count of Bragança&quot; during the Council of Oviedo (in 970). Owing to the Reconquista, this region was quickly integrated into the Kingdom of Asturias (later León after the 10th century), and the economy, ecclesiastical organization, architecture, culture and language was heavily influenced by the Asturo-Leonese.

During the 11th and 12th century, in the books of genealogy, the Bragançãos family of Castro d&#x27;Avelãs (at the time the seat of the Benedictine monastery) dominated Bragança, its abbot Mendo Alãm, who later married Princess Ardzrouri of Armenia (who passed through the region on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela), originated the hereditary line. Legend holds that Fernão Mendes (a Braganção) presumably kidnapped, then married, Sancha, daughter of Afonso Henriques and Teresa, obtaining with his dead the important defense of the region. Fernão Mendes and Sancha would find the ruins of the ancient village and rebuilt from the ground in the &quot;Realenga das Terras da Bragança&quot;. Historically, Fernão Mendes was later referred to as the &quot;Brave&quot; for his gallantry during the Battle of Ourique. Yet, later, the region of Bragança would become a property of the Crown as no heir would develop from their union. The Bragançãos contributed to the foundation of the settlement, and its importance would remain integral to the defense of the country, owing to the geopolitical position in the northwest frontier with the Spanish Kingdoms of León and Castile. By the seventh generation, around 1258, the Bragançãos lost their hereditary title, and Afonso III transferred the title to Nuno Martins, a descendant of the line.

The origin of the city of Bragança dates from the 10th or 11th century, and likely developed from a Romanized castro, although archaeological evidence is still under-discovered. The strategic importance of Bragança, to military control of access, resulted from its localization and was reinforced by administrative institutions established by the King. Sancho signed a foral in June 1187, which was renovated by King Afonso III, in May 1253, and later by Manuel I on 11 November 1514. The foral demonstrated specifically the importance of the city, which was the first in the Trás-os-Montes to receive the title of &quot;town&quot;. In his proclamation, Afonso III specified that the municipality of Bragança pertained to the &quot;Church&quot; of Braganza, and not the crown, and that its represents should motivate the settlement of all unpopulated lands. This conflicted with the Military Orders and administration of the Monastery of Castro de Avelãs, who believed that they had the right to settle all villages and use the land as they willed. The privileges that were conceded to the nascent Portuguese population by various monarchs outlines the geographic importance of attracting settlement to the northern frontier: Afonso III created an annual fair in 1272 and Fernando establishes a free-trade fair in 1383, which was renovated or reformulated by successive monarchs (John I in 1392 and 1413, the Regent Peter in 1439 and Afonso V in 1455). This initiatives, although tempered by cyclical migration and epidemics, permitted the concentration of settlers in the northern community.

During the 14th century, wars with Castile result in the destruction of the frontier settlements and Castellian troops take the city of Bragança. In 1381, the region is once again devastated militarily, resulting in famine, epidemics, infant mortality rates, the abandonment of lands, resulting in an 83% drop in the population. In 1387, the Duke of Lancaster and Constance sign the Treaty of Babe, that recognized John I&#x27;s title and rights to Portugal and the Algarve (then already acclaimed in the Portuguese &quot;Cortes&quot; and married to Philippa of Lancaster). But in 1396, John returned to Bragança to curb Castilian aggression, taking the titles from Afonso Pimental (who was an ally of Castile) and delivering into his illegitimate son&#x27;s hands Afonso (donated in 1401 by Regent Peter), who he charged with reinforcing the border and elaborating the defenses of the castle. John then bound the frontier region to the Crown with a marriage of his son to Beatriz, daughter of Nuno Álvares Pereira in order to strengthen the ties of the fledgling crown to the land.

Historically, a Jewish community was present in Bragança during medieval times. When the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, 3000 Jewish refugees settled in Bragança. When the Jews were forced to convert to Christianity, Bragança became an important center for crypto-Judaism. There was crypto-Jewish activity in Bragança until the second half of the 20th century.

===Monarchy===
By the middle of the 13th century, Bragança was divided into four parishes: Santa Maria (then the main town), São Tiago, São João (outside the castle walls) and São Vicente.

In 1442, King Afonso V established the hereditary dukedom of the Duchy of Braganza, for his uncle Afonso, Count of Barcelos, becoming one of the oldest fiefdoms in Portugal. The second Duke of Braganza, Fernando, reinforced his grandfather&#x27;s frontier strategy and expanded his territory by integrating the lands of his deceased brother Afonso, Marquis of Valença. Ferdinand supported King Afonso V of Portugal, and during his North African campaigns, became the Governor of Ceuta. Ferdinand was responsible for ensuring the elevation of Braganza to the status of city (on 20 February 1464), and was Regent when Afonso V returned to North Africa. But his conspiracies and court intrigues during the reign of King John II would have him condemned to death, the banning of the House of Braganza and the incorporation of their hereditary lands and titles into the Crown. The lands remained in the hands of the Crown until the reign of Ferdinand of Portugal, when they were offered as a dowry to João Afonso Pimentel on his marriage to Joana Teles de Menezes, half-sister of Queen Leonor Teles.

King Manuel I reinstated the Braganzas on 18 June 1496, but forced their heirs to expel the Jews from Bragança, resulting in the departure of hundreds of the inhabitants that had supported and promoted town. Those that did not convert to Christianity left Portugal (with their money, contacts, knowledge, merchant experience), including Orobio de Castro (who became a leader in the Amsterdam synagogue) and Jacob de Castro Sarmento who was an important figure in England and Scotland, professor at the University of Aberdeen.

In the 14th and 15th century, growth outside the city of Bragança developed, and in the proceeding centuries there were major renovations and remodelling to the churches, convents and noble estates within the municipality. Many of street names from Bragança also show a rapid industrialization and commercialization in the community, with the appearances of street names such as &quot;Rua dos Prateiros&quot; (silver-smiths), &quot;Rua dos Sineiros&quot; (bell-makers), &quot;Rua dos Oleiros&quot; (potters), &quot;Rua da Alfândega&quot; (customs house), &quot;Ponte das Tenarias&quot; (tanners), &quot;Ponte das Ferrarias&quot; (blacksmiths), that directed their exports to the regional market. This dynamic environment was facilitated by Jews who escaped the Inquisition in Castile during the 15th century, and who stimulated the commercial, artisanal and cereal markets in the region.

After 60 years the Portuguese were able to end the Iberian Union with Spain. On 1 December 1640 the independence of Portugal was restored, allowing the ascension of the 8th Duke of Braganza (then military governor of Portugal) as King John IV. From 1640 to 1910 the House of Braganza was responsible for providing Portugal its kings and the two emperors of Brazil. The latter ruled from 1822 to 1889. The feudal castle of the dukes (built 1187) still remains.

By the 18th century there were several crises and failures in Bragança associated with tentative industrialization. Problems with agriculture in the beginning of the 19th century would also occur just when industrialists began to abandon the city of Bragança. Since then, the economy of the region has wavered through boom-and-bust cycles, stimulated by some national initiatives.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
Bragança lies on a branch of the Sabor River south of the Culebra Mountains, 255 km northeast of Porto, 515 km from Lisbon and 22 km from the Spanish border.

====Ecoregions/Protected areas====
The municipality of Bragança is part of the frontier of the Montesinho Natural Park, established in 1979 to safeguard the distinct elements of the region. The creation of this ecoregion was made to preserve the existing qualities and allow human/cultural interaction. Montesinho is classified into forests and woods (oak and chestnut plantations at the base of the Coroa Mountains, the Tuela and lower Baceiro Rivers); wood and pine forests (forests and shrub vegetation in the western and eastern Rio Maças, Aveleda, Portelo/Montesinho, Mofreito/Montouto, Pinheiros, Serrea da Coroa, Vilar Seco da Lomba); a sub-Atlantic mixed farming area (around the Tuela and Baceiro Rivers); open space that allows farming along the plateaus of Baçal, Aveleda, Onor, Deilão); and the granite mountains of oak and birch species, mainly within the park and Pinheiros area.

===Climate===

The climate in Bragança (the northeasternmost district capital city in Portugal) is Mediterranean (&quot;Csb&quot; bordering &quot;Csa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), influenced by the distance from the coast and the elevation. It is very similar to the continental climate of the Spanish Meseta, which means cooler winters and shorter hot summers. It is one of the snowiest Portuguese cities, however this may vary a lot between winters, with less than 5 snow days (2007/2008) to more than 20 (2008/2009).

The average high in the coldest month – January – is around while the July high is around . The January average low hovers around the freezing point. It has been known to snow in April, and winter temperatures can fall to as low as , as recorded in February 1983, at around which time the station of a local institute on the outskirts of the city also recorded -17.5 °C. Frosts happen on average 67 days per year. The annual mean is around . The mean total rainfall in a year is . The year of 2005 was particularly dry in Portugal, and Bragança suffered water shortages and devastating forest fires in the rural areas.

===Human geography===


Of the 18 Portuguese historical district capitals, Bragança is the farthest from Lisbon, the national capital.

The seat of the municipality is the city of Bragança, which consists of the parish Sé, Santa Maria e Meixedo, and had a population of 20,309 in 2001. In the hierarchy of Portuguese urban communities, Bragança is only second to Chaves in the sub-region of the Alto Trás-os-Montes. Historically, the municipality has seen a demographic evolution. Between 1911 and 1991, there has been a 6.80% (1655 inhabitant) increase, mitigated by annual changes that both saw growth and decreases. For example, between 1981 and 1991 there was an exodus from the interior of the region of young people, resulting in a drop of population and birth rates (which only helped the coastal communities of Portugal). The city of Bragança has generally seen positive growth, being the capital of the region, and attracting a more youthful component. Sé and Santa Maria, the two primarily urban parishes, benefited directly from this, becoming the dynamic engine of growth in the territory, and developing into a pole in the interior northeast.

Bragança pertains to an area referred to as the &quot;Terra Fria Transmontana&quot; (&quot;Cold Transmontana Lands&quot;). Within the NUTS nomenclature, Bragança is part of the Terras de Trás-os-Montes subregion, along with eight other municipalities. Its connection to this region are formalized within various associations, including the &quot;Associação de Municípios de Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro&quot; (&quot;Municipal Association of Tr&#x27;s-os Montes and Alto Douro&quot;), as part of the &quot;Associação de Municípios da Terra Fria&quot; (constituted by the municipalities of Bragança, Vinhais, Vimioso and Miranda do Douro), the &quot;Associação Comercial e Industrial de Bragança&quot; (&quot;Commercial Association of Bragança&quot;), the district &quot;Núcleo Empresarial do Distrito de Bragança&quot; (&quot;Business Nucleus of the District of Bragança&quot;), the &quot;Região de Turismo do Nordeste Transmontano&quot; (&quot;Tourist Region of Nordeste Transmontano&quot;) and the &quot;Parque Natural de Montesinho&quot; (Montesinho Natural Park). Bragança is also affiliated with the &quot;Associação do Pacto do Eixo Atlântico&quot;, along with 17 municipalities in the northwest peninsula, whose objective is to implement policy that strategically support socio-economic and socio-cultural objectives of the communities along the Portuguese-Spanish border region with Galicia. This is an important political relationship since 1999, as Bragança is of significant size to motivate economic activity in the northern portion of the Iberian Peninsula. Its peripheral place in the urban hierarchy of Portugal has contributed to the political, administrative and populational concentration of many regional and national associations, administrative delegations and regional directorates
The neighbouring municipalities are Vimioso in the southeast, Macedo de Cavaleiros in the southwest and Vinhais in the west.

==Economy==
Bragança is a city of services with a dependence on state-run institutions like the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança and the regional hospital for jobs. In the turn of the 21st century, its countryside suffered a population decline with the abandonment of the villages and the aging of the rural population. The city of Bragança is an anchor of the regional economy, resisting the desertification of the hinterland, and concentrating public sector administration in the region. In Bragança, approximately 16% of the population is involved in the secondary industrial sector, while 60% are associated with the tertiary service sector, alluding to a problem in attracting investments in the secondary sector. Employment is primarily driven by the tertiary sector, including commerce, restaurants and hotels, but also civil construction (which is the second largest employer of local residents). Although there has been a positive evolution, industrial activities still remain weak, hindered by the evolution of the market in this periferic borderland region of Portugal. Due to its location near the Spanish border, the city receives tourists from Zamora, León, Salamanca, Asturias and elsewhere. Agribusiness is focused on olive oil, grains, chestnut and livestock, especially sheep.

===Transportation===
Located eight kilometres from the city centre, the municipal/regional airport (Bragança Airport), with scheduled flights by Sevenair Air Services to Lisbon (LIS) and Vila Real (VRL). Bragança Airport is located north of the city, in the parish of Aveleda, accessible by taxi or bus route. The aerodrome was expanded and the runway enlarged, including new navigational systems, new lighting and support facilities, in order to increase mid-size aircraft to be on par with other European regional airports.

Bragança is one of the two (along with Viseu) district capitals without a rail service in Portugal. There was formerly a metre-gauge railway (the Tua line) from Bragança to Tua, for connecting trains to Oporto. Bragança station (and the Bragança-Mirandela section of the railway) closed in 1991. Bragança is located about 35 km away from the Sanabria AV high-speed railway station, part of the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia high-speed rail line. With 35,341 people, Bragança is the largest potential market in the station&#x27;s surroundings. There are discussions about the possibility of a connecting motorway between Bragança and the area served by the station.

There are three main accessways within the municipality: the A4, IP2 and the N103 motorways. The principal roadway connecting Bragança and local communities is the A4: Amarante-Vila Real-Bragança-Quintanilha, which crosses the municipalities southwest border towards Bragança, before circling the city in the direction of the eastern border with Spain. The ancillary IP2 meets the A4 around Macedo de Cavaleiros and the N103 crosses from west to east, meeting in Bragança, before continuing as the N218 into Spain. Other roads connect nearby municipalities such as Mirandela, Penafiel, in addition to Chaves, Valpaços and Miranda do Douro, including the towns of Vinhais and Vimioso.

==Architecture==
Notable landmarks in the city include the 12th-century Domus Municipalis (Portugal&#x27;s oldest and largest town hall) in Romanesque style, the Renaissance cathedral, and the old town walls, which are still well preserved, and look down on the river and the modern city.

==Education==
The student population of Bragança is heavily concentrated within the town, its population for 1999–2000 being 14,406 registered students. Of this number the largest frequency of students were enrolled in the state-run higher-education technical college (polytechnic institute): the &quot;Instituto Politécnico de Bragança (IPB)&quot;. Since its formation in 1986, there has been a significant growth in enrollment (200, 4000 and 4731,in the 1986–87, 1998–99, and 1999–2000 school years, respectively). The remaining higher-education enrollees are dispersed at the &quot;Instituto Superior de Línguas e Administração&quot; (&quot;Superior Institute of Languages and Administration&quot;) and &quot;Escola Superior de Enfermagem (Superior School of Nursing). Other institutions of education include 4,650 students enrolled in secondary and junior high schools, 874 in technical/professional schools, 2,868 in primary schools, and 614 in pre-school programs.

In many villages there are not enough children to maintain the rural schools, which are gradually being closed by the Portuguese government.

== Sports ==
The Grupo Desportivo de Bragança (abbreviated as GD Bragança) is a Portuguese sports club based in Bragança which hosts both a football department and an athletics department. The club was founded in 1943 and its men&#x27;s football team plays its home matches at the Municipal de Bragança stadium with 5,000 seats.

==Religion==
Bragança pertains to the Diocese of Bragança-Miranda, a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Braga.

In June 1928, a synagogue was inaugurated in the city.
