<text>James Hovis Hodges (born November 19, 1956) is an American businessman, attorney, and politician who served as the 114th governor of South Carolina from 1999 to 2003. A former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, Hodges is the most recent Democrat to serve as the state&#x27;s governor.

==Early life and career==
James Hovis Hodges was born on November 19, 1956, to parents George N. and Betty H. Hodges. He grew up in Lancaster, South Carolina, near the North Carolina border. He attended Davidson College but later transferred to the University of South Carolina, where he completed a BSBA in 1979 and earned election to Phi Beta Kappa. During his undergraduate studies, Hodges worked summers at a cotton mill to pay for his schooling.

In 1982, Hodges received a J.D. from the University of South Carolina School of Law. From 1983 to 1986, Hodges served as Lancaster County Attorney.

==South Carolina House of Representatives==
At age 30, Hodges first won an election in a December 1986 special election for the 45th district seat in the South Carolina House of Representatives vacated by the late Tom Mangum. While in the House, Hodges served as chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 1992 until 1994 and as House Democratic Leader from 1995 until 1997.

The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce named Hodges &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; in 1993, and the National Federation of Independent Business bestowed Hodges with its &quot;Guardian of Small Business&quot; award.

While serving in the state legislature, Hodges also worked as general counsel for The Springs Company.

==Governor of South Carolina 1999–2003==
===1998 Gubernatorial election===
Hodges entered the 1998 gubernatorial election in South Carolina an underdog but took advantage of controversy and missteps by incumbent Republican governor David Beasley, namely Beasley&#x27;s indecisiveness on allowing a Confederate flag to fly at the state capitol and call to eliminate video poker. Donations from video gambling interests helped Hodges narrow a near million-dollar fundraising gap with Beasley.

In what was reported as an upset victory, Hodges won the gubernatorial race by a 8% margin and won 35 of 46 counties. Hodges became the first challenger to defeat a sitting governor since the South Carolina constitution first allowed consecutive terms in 1980.

===Tenure as governor===

As South Carolina&#x27;s 114th governor, Hodges signed a law that made Martin Luther King, Jr. Day an official state holiday; South Carolina was the last state in the U.S. to do so. That law also added a Confederate Memorial Day, a move that drew opposition from the NAACP. Several hours later, Hodges signed the South Carolina Heritage Act which the General Assembly had passed as a compromise so that the Confederate flag could be moved from the state capitol&#x27;s dome to its grounds.

Public education was a major focus in the Hodges administration, as Hodges oversaw the founding of the South Carolina Education Lottery and the First Steps preschool initiative. The governor also helped pass a $1.1 billion school construction initiative, and the lottery funded millions in college scholarships to South Carolina students.

Hodges made efforts to reform land use policy in South Carolina. He signed several executive orders which created task forces and interagency councils. Besides the Historic Preservation Task Force created by Hodges, Governor Mark Sanford did not continue Hodges policies. Hodges also instituted the construction of the Ravenel Bridge in Charleston, which is North America&#x27;s longest cabled spanned bridge. 
Hodges received criticism in his first year in office for his management of the Hurricane Floyd evacuation, particularly his decision not to make Interstate 26 one-way westbound. Hodges also received blame for financial problems with the state Department of Commerce and long lines at Division of Motor Vehicles offices.

In 2003, the University of South Carolina self-reported to the NCAA several secondary recruiting violations on Hodges&#x27; part. Hodges had met with recruits, something he was prohibited from doing as an ex-oficio trustee of the university.

===2002 Gubernatorial election===

In 2002 Hodges ran for reelection Against former U.S. Representative Mark Sanford. Like Hodges&#x27; 1998 bid, the race concentrated on issues such as education and the state budget.

During the campaign, Sanford &quot;likened Hodges to a weasel and to former President Bill Clinton and Al Gore,&quot; reported &quot;The State&quot; in October 2002. On November 5, 2002, Sanford defeated Hodges, 53%–47%. To date, Hodges remains the last Democrat to have served as governor of South Carolina.

==Post-political career==

Since leaving office as governor, Hodges has served as a senior advisor at McGuire Woods Consulting, LLC, and as partner in the affiliated law firm of McGuireWoods, LLP, and is based in Columbia, South Carolina.

He endorsed General Wesley Clark&#x27;s (D-Arkansas) campaign in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries.

In 2007, Hodges publicly supported Stephen Colbert&#x27;s attempt to run for president in the South Carolina primaries, and even offered himself up as a vice presidential choice should the comedian actually win the nomination. In February 2008 the former governor officially endorsed U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-Illinois) in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. The Obama campaign, in turn, named Hodges as one of its national co-chairs.

Hodges and his wife Rachel live in Columbia with their two sons. He is an Episcopalian.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 238 was a large six-engined flying boat designed and built by the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss. Developed during the Second World War, it was the heaviest aircraft ever built when it first flew in 1944, and was the largest aircraft produced by any of the Axis powers during the conflict.

Development of the BV 238 started in January 1941 in response to a Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) request for a long range multipurpose flying boat. The resulting design drew upon the firm&#x27;s existing large six-engined flying boat, the BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot;, but was considerable larger and featured numerous refinements, such as to its elevator and float configuration. To gather flight data on its proposed configuration, a quarter-scale model, the FGP 227, was commissioned, but was so delayed that it provided little benefit. The company received an order for four prototypes, the construction of which commenced during January 1944.

During March 1945, flight testing of the first prototype commenced. Two months later, this prototype was sunk while moored at Lake Schaal after being strafed by Allied aircraft. While recovery was thought to be possible, the end of the conflict and the refusal of the Allies to permit continued aircraft development in Germany at that time meant that work on the programme was abandoned. This included work on a land-based derivative of the flying boat, designated &quot;BV 250&quot;, which ultimately never flew.

==History==
At the start of the Second World War, the design team at the German aircraft manufacturer Blohm &amp; Voss were largely preoccupied by the development of the BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot;, a large six-engined flying boat. However, during 1940, the firm&#x27;s designer opted to start work on an even larger flying boat under the designation P 200 that would be suitable for the future long distance routes (particularly transatlantic ones) of the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa. Furnished with eight engines, this vast flying boat was anticipated to have had a loaded weight of , a range of and a passenger capacity of 120.

During January 1941, work on the P.200 proposal was suspended in order to focus on the fulfilment of a new request issued by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) for a long range multipurpose flying boat. In the following months, the design team worked on an initial four-engined design for what would become the &quot;BV 238&quot;, however, it was abandoned by mid 1941 due to the lengthy timescale involved in developing suitable domestic engines to power it. Instead, in July 1941, work commenced on a fresh design that, while being considerably larger than the BV 222, shared numerous features as well as its general layout. This design was warmly received and a development order calling for the completion of four prototypes was promptly issued to the firm.

While its similarities to the BV 222 meant that some useful data could be obtained from this existing flying boat, it was felt that some aspects were too dissimilar for this arrangement to be fully sufficient. Accordingly, an approximately quarter-scale model of the BV 238 was commissioned to test the long and slim hull design, which was largely original. Built by the &quot;Flugtechnische Fertigungsgemeinschaft GmbH&quot; (FGP) in Prague and designated FGP 227, this scale model did not arrive (as a result of several factors, including sabotage and damage sustained during its maiden flight) until September 1944, too late to contribute any data to the program.

During 1942, the construction of the various jigs and components for the BV 238 commenced; fabrication of the first hull started in January 1944. Production work continued even as many other aircraft programmes were cancelled due to Germany&#x27;s declining position in the conflict; one factor in this decision was that, aside from the materials involved, little of the BV 238&#x27;s supply chain competed with that of fighter aircraft production. Although extensive defensive armament was planned, the first prototype, &quot;BV 238 V1&quot;, lacked any upon its completion in March 1945 (these armaments were planned to be installed at a later date). While the flying boat had been designed to fulfil a military specification, the design team had undertaken some work towards its prospective civilian applications as well.

By the end of March 1945, after completed only four test flights, BV 238 V1 was declared to be fit for service. After only two months of flights, this aircraft was strafed and partially sunk while moored on Lake Schaal, several miles to the east of Hamburg. One wing remained above water, which was later salvaged. Following the end of the conflict, the Allies refused to let the flying boat be restored so it was taken out to deeper water and sunk. Two additional flying boats were mid-construction, but these were also never completed.

==Design==
The BV 238 was an extremely large flying boat of conventional aerodynamic design, but bearing the usual B&amp;V structural hallmarks of all-metal construction with a tubular steel wing main spar which also functioned as the armoured main fuel tank. Of the era, only the earlier Tupolev ANT-20, the Martin XPB2M-1 and the later Hughes H-4 had a bigger wing span. However, the BV 238 would be the heaviest yet flown, at fully loaded.. Principal differences between the BV 238 and the preceding BV 222, aside from the formerly greater size and some hydrodynamic improvements, included a revised elevator and an alternative float arrangement.

The hull had an unusually long and slim planing bottom, of essentially two-step design but with a row of smaller auxiliary steps behind the main one. A large nose door opened onto its cavernous interior, with the main crew cabin immediately above and behind it. For ease of production, design features were kept relatively simple while no use of magnesium was made for any part of the airframe.

The wing was of straight, constant-chord form with tapered outer sections. Auxiliary floats were integrated into underside panels of the outer sections and could be retracted to lie flush with the wing. A catwalk ran internally along the wing in front of the tubular steel main spar, providing access to the engines in flight. It was powered by six Daimler-Benz DB 603 liquid-cooled inverted V12 piston engines, capable of producing up to 1,287 kW (1,750 hp). These engines were installed in nacelles that were arranged along the leading edge of the wing&#x27;s centre section.

==BV 250== 
A landplane version, initially referred to as the &quot;BV 238-Land&quot;, was proposed; it was to be capable of carrying out transport, long-range bombing and transatlantic reconnaissance duties.

The lower hull was replaced by a plain fairing with retractable undercarriage comprising twelve main and two nose wheels. A single bomb bay occupied the space between the wheel bays while another was located directly behind the main undercarriage. The wing floats were similarly replaced with retractable outrigger stabilising wheels. The nose wheel could be folded up, making the aircraft &quot;kneel&quot; and allowing vehicles to drive directly on- and off-board via a loading ramp to the nose doorway. Alternatively, passenger seating could be fitted. A further, upper deck behind the crew cockpit accommodated further passengers, bringing the total capacity to 300 troops.

Redesignated &quot;BV 250&quot; during 1942, four prototypes were ordered but none were finished by the end of the conflict.

<doc id="460135" wikidata="Q11671" url="?curid=460135" title="David Beasley">
<text>David Muldrow Beasley (born February 26, 1957) is an American politician and the former executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme. A member of the Republican Party, he served one term as the 113th Governor of South Carolina from 1995 until 1999 before losing reelection to Democrat Jim Hodges. He also served as a state representative from 1981 until 1995.

==Early life==
Beasley was born in Lamar, South Carolina. He is the son of Richard Lee Beasley and Jacqueline (Blackwell) Beasley. He graduated from Lamar High School in 1975, then attended the Capitol Page School in Washington, DC while serving as a page in the U.S. Congress.

==Early political career==
Elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives at age 20, Beasley transferred from Clemson University to the University of South Carolina where he received a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies in 1979 and a J.D. from the School of Law in 1983. Beasley was a member of the South Carolina House representing the Society Hill area from 1979 until 1995, serving as majority whip from 1985 to 1986 and the majority leader from 1987 to 1989. He served as the youngest Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; and majority leader in the nation.

During the 1991–92 legislative session Beasley switched to the Republican Party. 

==Governor Of South Carolina (1995-1999)==
in the 1994 election for governor, both Beasley and his Democratic opponent Lieutenant Governor Nick Theodore faced tough primary opposition within their respective parties. Beasley defeated his toughest competitor, former congressman and state senator Arthur Ravenel Jr., in both the primary and run-off, and went on to win the general election by 23,754 votes.

South Carolina had a strong economy while Beasley was governor, with unemployment at a record-low 3.5% in 1998.
 Beasley often made known his Christ-centered beliefs and conservatism in a state known for its strong ties to Christianity and conservative politics.

Beasley strongly opposed gambling, which was legal in South Carolina until 2002. At the time, many gas stations, convenience stores, and poker &quot;casinos&quot; were established across the state, and as Beasley supported legislation that would outlaw gambling, the video poker industry generated &quot;Ban Beasley&quot; billboards and radio ads.

Until 2000, the Confederate flag flew atop the South Carolina State House. It had been raised over the Capitol dome in celebration of the Civil War centennial. This celebration started in 1961 with the raising of the Army of Tennessee Battle Flag over the State House Dome. The Army of Tennessee Battle Flags were also displayed in the inner chambers of the SC Senate and SC House of Representatives.

Beasley initially supported the flag&#x27;s presence but announced on statewide television in 1996 that he had reversed his decision and believed the flag should be relocated to a monument elsewhere on the grounds. Beasley&#x27;s position on the Confederate flag cost him many Republican votes in the next election. The flag was removed from the capitol dome in 2000 after Beasley left office. It was displayed on a pole in front of the statehouse until it was removed from the grounds in 2015 after the Emanuel Nine shooting.

Beasley also faced allegations of having an affair with his former press secretary, Ginny Wolfe. Beasley refuted the claims, saying, &quot;I can tell you right up front [my wife] Mary Wood and I love each other dearly. We both have been faithful to one another 100 percent.&quot;

In the 1998 South Carolina gubernatorial election, Beasley Ran for reelection against Democrat Former state representative Jim Hodges, Hodges took advantage of controversy and missteps made by Beasley, namely Beasley&#x27;s indecisiveness on allowing The Confederate flag to fly at the state capitol and call to eliminate video poker. While also Blaming Beasley for the poor SAT scores and the low achievement levels by the students of the state. Donations from video gambling interests helped Hodges narrow a near million-dollar fundraising gap with Beasley. On November 3rd 1998 Beasley Decisively lost to Hodges by 85,982 votes.

==Later career==
===Post-governor===

In 2000, after leaving office as governor, Beasley supported George W. Bush in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary. He introduced Bush during a campaign speech at Bob Jones University, which drew controversy because of the fundamentalist school&#x27;s anti-Catholic teaching and strict policy against interracial dating. Referring to Bush&#x27;s anti-abortion stance, Beasley said Bush &quot;shares our values.&quot;

After his term as governor, Beasley was a fellow at Harvard Kennedy School. In 2003, he received the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award from U.S. senator Ted Kennedy for his controversial request to the South Carolina legislature to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse dome.

In 2004, Beasley unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate to replace retiring Democrat Fritz Hollings. He lost the Republican nomination to Congressman Jim DeMint of Greenville, South Carolina. In April 2005, Beasley, along with his administration&#x27;s former chief legal counsel, Henry Deneen, incorporated the Center for Global Strategies, Ltd (CGS). CGS focuses on developmental initiatives in the non-integrated world. Beasley is chairman of the board.

In 2007, Beasley endorsed Mike Huckabee in the 2008 Republican presidential primaries. In 2010, he endorsed Henry McMaster in the South Carolina Republican gubernatorial primaries.

===World Food Programme===

In February 2017, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (also a former South Carolina governor) nominated Beasley to be the next executive director of the World Food Programme (WFP). United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization José Graziano da Silva officially appointed Beasley to the post in March 2017, saying he brought &quot;extensive experience with key governmental and business leaders and stakeholders around the world, with very strong resource mobilisation skills.&quot; Guterres also said Beasley had been among 23 applications/nominations for the position.

In his capacity as executive director of WFP, Beasley served at the level of Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and was a member of the organization&#x27;s Senior Management Group (SMG) under Guterres. Since 2019, he has been a member of the World Economic Forum High-Level Group on Humanitarian Investing, co-chaired by Børge Brende, Kristalina Georgieva and Peter Maurer.

In December 2020, Beasley accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the WFP for its efforts to combat world hunger.

As the term of the director of the World Food Programme is five years, Beasley&#x27;s term was originally set to expire in April 2022. However, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres extended Beasley&#x27;s term, citing the current food crisis of the Russo-Ukrainian War and the COVID-19 pandemic. President Biden initially opposed extending Beasley&#x27;s term, but bipartisan support in Congress encouraged Biden to support the extension. Beasley&#x27;s term as executive director expired in April 2023.

In 2023, he was made a Grand officer of the Order of the Two Niles by the Sudanese head of state General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.

<text>Crambe maritima, common name sea kale, seakale or crambe, is a species of halophytic (salt-tolerant) flowering plant in the genus &quot;Crambe&quot; of the family Brassicaceae. It grows wild along the coasts of mainland Europe and the British Isles.

The plant is related to the cabbage and was first cultivated as a vegetable in Britain around the turn of the 18th century. The blanched stems are eaten as a vegetable, and became popular in the mid-19th century.

==Description==
Growing to tall by wide, it is a mound-forming, spreading perennial. It has large fleshy glaucous collard-like leaves and abundant white flowers. The globular pods contain a single seed.

==Distribution==
This species appears to be a European endemic, with a distribution generally confined to two discontinuous coastal regions of Europe; the species is absent from North Africa and the Middle East. It occurs in the Black Sea coasts of Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine including the Crimea, but is absent from most of the Mediterranean, recurring again from northern France and the British Isles to the Baltic Sea. In the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and Italy it is replaced by the species &quot;Crambe hispanica&quot;, with which its distribution has been confused with until quite recently; the species is absent from Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain, but is said to occur in Croatia.

Although it was once believed to be found growing in Israel and Jordan, or alternatively Lebanon and Syria, these populations are now classified as &quot;C. hispanica&quot;.

It is very rare in Northern Ireland, but has been recorded in Counties Down and Antrim, and in a number of other coastal counties in the island of Ireland. In England it is primarily found on the southeast coast (extensively along Chesil Beach in Dorset), but it also occurs on stretches of the East Anglian and Cumbrian coasts. In Wales it is found on the northern beaches and in Scotland in the extreme southwest.

It is uncommonly found along the coast of Norway, particularly so in the Færder National Park.

==Ecology==

&quot;Crambe maritima&quot; is a halophyte, meaning that it tolerates salt and is therefore found on coastal beaches where little else thrives. It is usually found above high tide mark on beaches in which the sand includes pebbles or rock. A typical habitat for the species in Britain is vegetated shingle beaches, where it grows in association with yellow horned poppy and curled dock. It is the dominant plant species in plant communities found in fragmentary, endangered habitats on shingle beaches and bars on the southern Baltic coasts of Sweden, Finland and Estonia, east to Mecklenburg, where it grows together with &quot;Leymus arenarius&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia palustris&quot;, &quot;Honkenya peploides&quot;, &quot;Angelica archangelica&quot; ssp. &quot;litoralis&quot;, &quot;Atriplex&quot; spp., &quot;Beta vulgaris ssp. &quot;maritima&quot;, &quot;Elymus repens&quot;, &quot;Geranium robertianum&quot; ssp. &quot;rubricaule&quot;, &quot;Glaucium flavum&quot;, &quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;, &quot;Ligusticum scoticum&quot;, &quot;Mertensia maritima&quot;, &quot;Silene uniflora&quot;, &quot;Tripleurospermum maritimum&quot; and &quot;Valeriana salina&quot;. Trapping wind-blown sand, clumps of sea kale may initiate the formation of dunes.

==Cultivation and culinary use==

There are records from the 18th century of local people along some coasts of England digging out and harvesting the emerging shoots as a vegetable from naturally occurring root crowns in the early springtime. This custom was first reported by Phillip Miller in his 1731 &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as practised among the indigenous peoples of Sussex, and it was seen once in the 18th century being sold as food at the Chichester market in 1753. John Martyn was the first to publish some practical notes on cultivating the plant in a late edition of Miller&#x27;s work, but William Curtis was the first to publish a tract about his experiments of growing the plant as a vegetable crop in London in 1799, just before his death, with John Maher giving a reading before the Horticultural Society of London in 1805 which elaborated slightly on the work of Curtis. Both Curtis and Maher recommended growing the plant as a forced, blanched vegetable, growing the root crown in a ceramic cylinder which could be capped with a closed blanching pot. Over and about this pot fresh manure would be heaped a few feet deep, the heat produced when this dung rotted would be sufficient to force the plant to bolt as early as December, although later in the winter was recommended. For those without the financial means to purchase expensive blanching pots, Maher suggests covering the plants in a mat covered by a thick layer of gravel, and Curtis mentions simply hoeing a foot of soil over the crown, or piling sea sand, pebbles or coal ash over it, although both agree this will produce a much inferior crop. An area of roughly five square feet could hold a single root crown consisting of three plants, which after growing out from seed for three years could be forced at least twice a season to yield four to six shoots of up to twelve inches, although usually much less.

Thomas Jefferson grew sea kale at Monticello between 1820 and 1825. It was served at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, when Prince Regent George IV of the United Kingdom (1762–1830) used it as a seaside retreat. By the Victorian Era sea kale had become &quot;in very general use&quot; as a vegetable in Britain, according to the popular cookbook &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot;, in which it is called a type of asparagus, although at nine pennies for a basket of sprouts, it was one of the most expensive vegetables to be had. Its cultivation is discussed in older books on vegetable growing. Wild stocks were severely reduced in Britain by forcing &quot;in situ&quot; and collecting for food until the practice was banned in the early 20th century. Sea kale fell out of favour, but in the early 21st century, British chefs made it fashionable again. It is commercially grown by a number of farmers in Britain.

A tiny experimental plot of sea kale is cultivated on Texel, a North Sea island in the Netherlands. It is irrigated with adulterated seawater.

Maher mentions that he personally considered blanched sea kale a delicacy. Curtis says that as a food, boiled twenty minutes and covered in melted butter, it resembled most asparagus, although with hints of cabbage. He reports most he served it to found it agreeable; although some found it no better than cabbage, others found it superior even to asparagus. Although Curtis had never tried to do so himself, he mentions someone once made a decent stew of it and also theorizes that perhaps it might be well suited to be pickled.

<text>The Edinburgh Multi-Access System (EMAS) was a mainframe computer operating system at the University of Edinburgh. The system went online in 1971.

EMAS was a powerful and efficient general purpose multi-user system which coped with many of the computing needs of the University of Edinburgh and the University of Kent (the only other site outside Edinburgh to adopt the operating system).

==History==
Originally running on the ICL System 4/75 mainframe (based on the design of the IBM 360) it was later reimplemented on the ICL 2900 series of mainframes (as EMAS 2900 or EMAS-2) where it ran in service until the mid-1980s. Near the end of its life, the refactored version was back-ported (as EMAS-3) to the Amdahl 470 mainframe clone, and thence to the IBM System/370-XA architecture (the latter with help from the University of Kent, although they never actually ran EMAS-3). The National Advanced System (NAS) VL80 IBM mainframe clone followed later. The final EMAS system (the Edinburgh VL80) was decommissioned in July 1992.

The University of Kent system went live in December 1979, and ran on the least powerful machine in the ICL 2900 range - an ICL 2960, with 2 MB of memory, executing about 290k instructions per second. Despite this, it reliably supported around 30 users. This number increased in 1983 with the addition of an additional 2 MB of memory and a second Order Code Processor (OCP) (what is normally known as a CPU) running with symmetric multiprocessing. This system was decommissioned in August 1986.

==Features==
EMAS was written entirely in the Edinburgh IMP programming language, with only a small number of critical functions using embedded assembler within IMP sources. It had several features that were advanced for the time, including dynamic linking, multi-level storage, an efficient scheduler, a separate user-space kernel (&#x27;director&#x27;), a user-level shell (&#x27;basic command interpreter&#x27;), a comprehensive archiving system and a memory-mapped file architecture.

Such features led EMAS supporters to claim that their system was superior to Unix for the first 20 years of the latter&#x27;s existence.

==Legacy==
The Edinburgh Computer History Project is attempting to salvage some of the lessons learned from the EMAS project and has the complete source code of EMAS online for public browsing.

<text>The green wood hoopoe (Phoeniculus purpureus) is a large, up to long tropical bird native to Africa. It is a member of the family Phoeniculidae, the wood hoopoes, and was formerly known as the red-billed wood hoopoe.

==Taxonomy==
In 1784 the English illustrator John Frederick Miller included a hand-coloured plate of the green wood hoopoe in his &quot;Icones animalium et plantarum&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Promerops purpureus&quot; and mistakenly specified the type locality as eastern India. The green wood hoopoe is now one of five species placed in the genus &quot;Phoeniculus&quot; that was introduced in 1821 by the Polish zoologist Feliks Paweł Jarocki.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. p. senegalensis&quot; (Vieillot, 1822) – south Senegal to south Ghana
* &quot;P. p. guineensis&quot; (Reichenow, 1902) – north Senegal and Gambia to Chad and Central African Republic
* &quot;P. p. niloticus&quot; (Neumann, 1903) – Sudan to west Ethiopia and northeast DR Congo
* &quot;P. p. marwitzi&quot; (Reichenow, 1906) – east Uganda and Kenya to east South Africa
* &quot;P. p. angolensis&quot; (Reichenow, 1902) – Angola and west Zambia to northeast Namibia and north Botswana
* &quot;P. p. purpureus&quot; (Miller, JF, 1784) – central, southwest South Africa

The green wood hoopoe is sometimes considered as conspecific with the black-billed wood hoopoe (&quot;Phoeniculus somaliensis&quot;) and the violet wood hoopoe (&quot;Phoeniculus damarensis&quot;).

==Description==
This abundant species is a metallic dark green, with a purple back and very long diamond-shaped purple tail. Distinctive white markings on the wings and white chevrons on the tail edges make it easily identifiable, as does its long, thin, curved red bill. Sexes are similar, but immatures have a black bill.

It advertises its presence with its loud &quot;kuk-uk-uk-uk-uk&quot; call and other vocalisations.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and foraging===
The green wood hoopoe is an insect-eating species. It feeds mainly on the ground, at termite mounds, or on tree trunks, and forms flocks outside the breeding season. Its specialised claws enable it to cling easily to the underside of branches while closely inspecting the bark for insects.

===Breeding===
The green wood hoopoe is a cooperative breeder and common resident in the forests, woodlands and suburban gardens of most of sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in groups of up to a dozen or so birds with only one breeding pair. The breeding female lays two to four blue eggs in a natural tree hole or old barbet nest and incubates them for about 18 days. On hatching, she and the nestlings are fed by the rest of the group, even after they have fledged and left the nest hole. The group is fearless in defence of the nestlings against intruders. This species is parasitised by the greater and lesser honeyguide.

==Status==
Widespread and common throughout its large range, the green wood hoopoe is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<text>Crambe is a genus of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae, native to a variety of habitats in Europe, Turkey, southwest and central Asia and eastern Africa. They carry dense racemes of tiny white or yellow flowers on (mostly leafless) stems above the basal leaves. &quot;Crambe hispanica&quot; subsp. &quot;abyssinica&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Crambe abyssinica&quot;, is grown for the oil from the seeds that has characteristics similar to whale oil.

The word &quot;crambe&quot; derives, via the Latin &quot;crambe&quot;, from the Greek &quot;κράμβη&quot;, a kind of cabbage.

&quot;Crambe&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of the weevil &quot;Lixus canescens&quot; (Coleoptera) and some Lepidoptera species including the lime-speck pug.

<text>The Yokosuka MXY8 &quot;Akigusa&quot; (秋草, &quot;Autumn grass&quot;) was a training glider built in parallel with the Mitsubishi J8M rocket-powered interceptor aircraft.

==Design and development==
The J8M was to have simply been a licence-built Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;, but, due to difficulties in obtaining technical materials from Germany, it eventually had to be designed almost from scratch. The MXY8 was designed in parallel with the J8M to validate the design and then to provide pilot training during the development of the actual interceptor. The Army designation for the type was Ku-13.

The MXY8 was built entirely of wood and fitted with ballast tanks that would be filled with water to simulate the weight and, therefore, flight characteristics of a fully equipped J8M. Some 50-60 of these gliders were eventually built.

A more advanced trainer, the MXY9, equipped with a primitive jet engine was planned but was never produced.

Many sources apply the designation MXY8 to the Yokosuka MXY7 Ohka kamikaze weapon.

<doc id="460175" wikidata="Q888792" url="?curid=460175" title="Johnny Paul Koroma">
<text>Major Johnny Paul Koroma (9 May 1960 – 1 June 2003/11 August 2017) was a Sierra Leonean military officer who was the head of state of Sierra Leone from May 1997 to February 1998.

A member of the Limba people, Koroma began his military career in 1985, and quickly rose through the ranks of the Sierra Leonean army. Following the start of the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1991, Koroma commanded government forces against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel group. As the war continued, he was arrested in 1996 after being suspected of plotting a coup against President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. The following year, he was freed from prison following a coup overthrowing Kabbah, and became the leader of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) military junta. Koroma allied himself with the RUF and presided over mass looting, murder and rape against civilians, aid workers, and peacekeepers over his roughly nine months in power. In 1998, an intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ousted him, and the war ended in 2002.

In 2003, Koroma was indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for war crimes, crimes against humanities and other offenses for his role in the war. Koroma reportedly fled into exile in Liberia where he was murdered later that year. Other sources claim that he died in Sierra Leone in 2017.

==Youth and education ==

Koroma was born to Limba parents in Tombodu, in the Kono District of eastern British Sierra Leone, and grew up in Freetown, the capital. He is from the same ethnic group as former presidents Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh.

He joined the Sierra Leonean army in 1985 and was sent to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England in 1988 to train as an officer. He returned to Sierra Leone the next year and was promoted to platoon commander, and soon thereafter to company commander. He continued to move up the ladder, and in 1994, he went to the Teshi Military College in Ghana for training in army command.

==Coups and civil war==

Koroma received military training in Nigeria and the United Kingdom. He commanded government forces who were fighting against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), a rebel army led by the warlord Foday Sankoh. In August 1996, he was arrested for alleged involvement in a coup plot against the southern civilian officials who were in control of the country. It was also alleged that there were plans to kill President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.

Koroma was freed from prison during a successful military coup on 25 May 1997, when 17 junior soldiers serving the Sierra Leone Army (SLA) broke into the central prison and made a do-or-die offer that brought him to power. He advocated making a peaceful settlement with Sankoh and allowing him to join the government, though this never happened.

After the coup in 1997, Koroma was named head of state and chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). He invited the leadership of the Revolutionary United Front to join the AFRC, which they promptly did. To maintain order, he suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations and abolished all political parties.

The AFRC coup was accompanied by an explosion of violence against civilians throughout the nation. The key strategic change was that the RUF had immediate access throughout the country, something they had failed to achieve through six years of military action. Koroma cited corruption, erosion of state sovereignty, over-dependence on foreign nations, and leaders&#x27; failure to address tensions between the SLA and government-backed tribal militia movements (in particular the Kamajors) as the pretext for the coup.

Koroma&#x27;s story was consistent with that of the AFRC, which cited the failure of the Abidjan Peace Accord struck between the government of Sierra Leone and the RUF on 30 November 1996.

=== Involvement of ECOMOG ===

By 2 June 1997, the RUF/AFRC found itself at odds with Nigerian forces, which were deployed unilaterally under the Economic Community of West African States&#x27; Ceasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and its mandate of August 1997. The Nigerians were stationed in and around Freetown&#x27;s Western Area, trading mortar fire along the main highway into Freetown and around Freetown International Airport.

Koroma immediately sought to ease the situation, seeking mediation, which resulted in the signing of a peace accord in late October 1997 in Conakry, Guinea. Almost immediately, violations of the peace accord were perpetrated by all sides in the complex conflict. By January 1998, ECOMOG forces were preparing to oust the RUF/AFRC from power.

On 6 February 1998, ECOMOG forces invaded key locations in the Western Area, removing the RUF/AFRC entirely by 12 February. On 1 March, ECOMOG forces commenced operations in provincial Sierra Leone, removing the RUF/AFRC from every key town except Kailahun (in the far east of the country). By December 1998, RUF/AFRC forces had reversed this position, and they entered Freetown in January 1999. Failing to hold territory, the RUF/AFRC retreated into the Northern Province of Sierra Leone.

===Lomé Peace Agreement===

The leadership of the RUF oversaw negotiations with the government of Sierra Leone that led to the signing of the Lomé Peace Accord on 7 July 1999. Koroma was cut out of the negotiations, and the AFRC did not benefit from the substantive provisions of the agreement. Nevertheless, Koroma participated in the disarmament process, encouraging those SLA soldiers who had joined the AFRC to demobilize.

By 2000, Koroma no longer held significant influence over the RUF leadership, as evidenced by the involvement of ex-AFRC members (from a splinter group called the West Side Boys) in defending towns in Port Loko District against a renewed RUF offensive in May 2000. In August 2000, Koroma officially disbanded the AFRC and sought to consolidate his position by forming a political party.

== Special Court for Sierra Leone ==

In early 2002, the government of Sierra Leone and the United Nations signed a bilateral treaty establishing the Special Court for Sierra Leone, mandated to try those who &quot;bear the greatest responsibility&quot; for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. According to the indictment, the RUF/AFRC, under the orders of Koroma, had led armed attacks in Sierra Leone in which the primary targets included civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and UN peacekeeping forces.

These attacks served the purpose of terrorizing the population as a form of punishment for not supporting rebel activities. They included such crimes as looting, murder, mutilations, sexual violence, and rape. Child soldiers were conscripted, and women and girls were kidnapped to be raped or turned into sex slaves. Men and boys were also abducted and forced to work or fight for the rebel groups.

On 7 March 2003, the prosecutor of the Special Court issued his first indictments. For his role in the RUF/AFRC, Koroma was among them. He fled Freetown in December, reportedly to Liberia. On 1 June 2003, he was officially declared dead under mysterious circumstances, said to have been murdered. However, the prosecutor has yet to withdraw the indictment against Koroma. An October 2006 newspaper headline in Freetown read, &quot;Johnny Paul has 1,000 armed soldiers&quot;.

According to an unconfirmed report in September 2008, Koroma&#x27;s remains were found buried in Foya, a village in Liberia&#x27;s Lofa County. However, Stephen Rapp, the Special Court&#x27;s prosecutor, noted that DNA tests on the remains found in Lofa County did not match Koroma&#x27;s DNA. As of 2010, many still believe Koroma was executed somewhere in Lofa at the hands of former President Charles Taylor of Liberia.

Three witnesses—former Vice President Moses Blah of Liberia; Joseph Zig Zag Marzah, a former member of Taylor&#x27;s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) rebel group; and a protected witness—testified that while they had not witnessed Koroma&#x27;s execution, Taylor had told them about it. In October 2010, Taylor&#x27;s defense team filed a motion to have these testimonies removed as evidence, alleging that the prosecution had bribed the three witnesses, but this motion was rejected the following month.

Koroma allegedly died on 10 or 11 August 2017 in his home village of Binkolo.

<text>Steven St. Croix (born Ben Banks; February 24, 1968) is an American pornographic actor and director. In 2013, he received a NightMoves Lifetime Achievement Award. St. Croix has made several mainstream appearances, including a music video for Gloria Estefan and the 2004 film &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;.

==Early life==
St. Croix was born in Connecticut. Raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, he grew up in a &quot;very religious, strict&quot; household. At 18, he had his first sexual experience. St. Croix attended vocational school to become a mason. He also worked in telemarketing and adult video sales prior to his porn career.

==Career==

St. Croix entered the adult film industry as a production assistant in December 1992. While working on the film &quot;Deep Throat 6&quot;, he performed in his first scene after an actor failed to show up. In 1995, St. Croix became the first male performer to sign an exclusive contract with Los Angeles–based studio Vivid Entertainment.

St. Croix first left the industry in the late 1990s to pursue mainstream acting. During this time, he took classes under an acting coach and learned improv from the comedy troupe Groundlings. He also body doubled for Brian Bosworth, was an extra on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, and danced in music videos for Gloria Estefan and Jon Secada. After struggling to pay his bills, he returned to acting in pornographic films.

In 2005, he was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame. St. Croix left the adult film industry again in late 2010, only to return in early 2012. In February 2013, he published an e-book titled &quot;Porn Star: Everything You Want to Know and Are Embarrassed to Ask&quot;.

===Advocacy===
St. Croix has spoken out against Measure B, a law that requires the use of condoms in all vaginal and anal scenes filmed in Los Angeles County. He urged his fans to spread his NoToMeasureB public service announcements on social media on October 16, 2012. Later that month, he received the Positive Image Award from the Free Speech Coalition for his work to &quot;dispel the myths and misconceptions of the adult entertainment industry.&quot; In April 2013, St. Croix appeared alongside former pornographic actor Danny Wylde on a HuffPost Live panel to debate Measure B.

==Personal life==
While away from the adult film industry, St. Croix lived in Cannes, France, and ran a small art gallery. He is an avid painter, primarily creating large-format acrylics. His work is heavily inspired by the expressionist movement. St. Croix describes his political views as &quot;Libertarian with Republican business leanings.&quot;

<doc id="460181" wikidata="Q2997212" url="?curid=460181" title="Republic of Texas (group)">
<text>The Republic of Texas (and also known as &quot;Provisional Government of the Republic of Texas&quot;) is a general term for several organizations, some of which have been called militia groups, that claim the annexation of Texas by the United States was illegal and that Texas remains an independent nation to this day but is under occupation. The issue of the legal status of Texas led the group to claim to have reinstated a provisional government on December 13, 1995. Activists within the movement claim over 40,000 active supporters, and public opinion polls have shown significant support for the secession of Texas or other states. A September 2014 Reuters/Ipsos poll found over 34% of people in southwestern states favored their own state seceding from the United States. So far, however, supporters have not managed to turn these public sentiments into concrete moves toward an independent Texas.

==History==
The movement for independence was started by Richard Lance &quot;Rick&quot; McLaren (born ). McLaren claimed that, in 1861, Texans voted four-to-one to leave the Union. That most Union loyalists were prevented from voting by violence, threats, and terrorism, he ignored. McLaren still concluded that Texas still met the qualifications, under international law, of a captive nation of war since the end of the American Civil War in 1865, a claim not supported by scholars.

The movement split into three factions in 1996, one led by McLaren, one by David Johnson and Jesse Enloe, and the third by Archie Lowe and Daniel Miller. In 1997, McLaren and his followers kidnapped Joe and Margaret Ann Rowe, held them hostage at the Davis Mountain Resort, and demanded the release of a movement member in exchange for the release of the Rowes. McLaren&#x27;s wife, Evelyn, convinced him to surrender peacefully after a week-long standoff with police and Texas Rangers. McLaren and four other Republic of Texas members were sent to prison. Two other members of the group, Richard F. Keyes III and Mike Matson managed to slip away. Matson was shot dead by Texas Rangers two days later, while Keyes surrendered to the authorities on September 19. In June 1998, Keyes was convicted of burglary with intent to commit aggravated assault and sentenced to 90 years in prison. This effectively destroyed the McLaren faction, and the Johnson-Enloe faction was discredited after two of its members, Jack Abbot Grebe Jr. and Johnnie Wise, were convicted in 1998 of threatening to assassinate several government officials, including President Bill Clinton. The two men were each sentenced to 24 years in prison.

In a case involving Richard McLaren and his wife Evelyn as plaintiffs, a United States District Court in the District of Columbia ruled on April 30, 1998: &quot;Despite plaintiffs&#x27; argument ... [i]n 1845, Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America. The Republic of Texas no longer exists.&quot;

In 2003, what remained of the organized movement consolidated into one dominant group recognizing an &quot;interim&quot; government (which replaced the &quot;provisional&quot; government), headed by Daniel Miller. This interim government claimed authority from the original proclamations of 1995 and set up a headquarters in the town of Overton, Texas. The movement split again over legal arguments, resulting in the current state of affairs. Most of the original personalities of the movement have disappeared from public view. The organization&#x27;s finances have come from donations and the sale of some items such as a Republic of Texas passport. The Republic of Texas headquarters in Overton burned down on August 31, 2005; one person was moderately injured.

In January 2004, a man in jail in Aspen, Colorado claimed that the state of Colorado had no jurisdiction to extradite him to California on a probation warrant, on the grounds that he was a citizen of the Republic of Texas. He said that the sliver of land which contains Aspen was a part of the original Republic of Texas and, as such, he was not a citizen of the United States. His claim was rejected by the courts.

In 2010 the group was referenced in U.S. Army War College paper entitled &quot;War: Will, Action and Resources&quot;, the paper expanded the definition of war to include non-state actors.

In February 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Texas Attorney General&#x27;s office, Brazos County deputies and police from the city of Bryan, Texas conducted a raid on a meeting of about sixty followers of a Republic of Texas group. No arrests were made, but the officers seized computers, phones and other items. The raid was conducted in connection with an allegation that a member of the group, claiming to be &quot;chief justice of the international Common Law Court for the Republic of Texas&quot;, had issued phony writs of &quot;&quot;quo warranto&quot; and &quot;mandamus&quot;&quot; and a phony &quot;subpoena&quot;, purporting to order both an attorney and a Texas state court judge to appear at &quot;hearings&quot; apparently to be conducted by the group at Bryan, Texas. In 2011, the vice president of the group sent a letter to the governor of Oklahoma, asserting that the governor faced indictment because Oklahoma&#x27;s counties were &quot;trespassing inside the geographical boundaries&quot; of the Republic of Texas. On April 27, 2015, McLaren, while an inmate at the Texas Clements Unit in Amarillo, Texas, served &quot;Legal Notice of Commencement of Special Inter-Actions&quot; against Chief Justice Richard Barajas, Senior Status, of El Paso, Texas asserting &quot;Declaration at Law Executing Rights Law on or over the Texian Territory&quot;.

<text>QVC (short for &quot;Quality Value Convenience&quot;) is an American free-to-air television network and a flagship shopping channel specializing in televised home shopping, owned by Qurate Retail Group. Founded in 1986 by Joseph Segel in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States, QVC broadcasts to more than 350 million households in seven countries, including channels in the UK, Germany, Japan, and Italy, along with a joint venture in China with China National Radio called CNR Mall.

As of December 2013, Halo2Cloud holds the network&#x27;s record for most units sold in a day of 380,000 chargers with total sales reaching $19 million.

==History==

===Early era (1986–1992)===

====QVC&#x27;s founding and television launch====

QVC was founded on June 13, 1986, by Joseph Segel and investors including Ralph Roberts, the founder and chairperson of Comcast. Roberts was able to arrange deals in which cable companies received investment stakes in QVC in exchange for carrying the channel. Sears was one of the first brands that QVC would represent, with a two-year exclusive agreement to sell Sears products through television shopping. The corporation later set a new record for first full-year fiscal sales for a new public company of $112 million. The channel was launched on November 24, 1986, with program hosts Kathy Levine, John Eastman, Ellen Langas, Bob Bowersox, and Cindy Briggs-Moore. Each November 24, QVC celebrated their birthday annually through 2008. Initially broadcasting live from 7:30 p.m. until midnight ET each weekday and 24 hours a day each weekend, the channel extended its live programming to 24/7/364 in January 1987. Former QUBE host and producer, Ron Giles, was named an executive vice president and executive producer at QVC in late 1987. In October 1988, the board of directors elected Michael C. Boyd to the position of senior executive vice president and chief operating officer. In early 1990, Boyd would take the title of president, reportedly to relieve some of Segel&#x27;s load.

====Competitor buy-out attempts====

In July 1989, QVC acquired the Cable Value Network, founded by Irwin L. Jacobs. The $380 million deal contributed to a loss of $17 million during the next fiscal quarter, and then led to difficulties in the couple of years that followed.

QVC first offered to buy out the Burbank-based Shop Television Network on March 16, 1991, a bid rejected by its producers and the Los Angeles Superior Court, and which carried blocks of time offering JCPenney merchandise. On May 21, 1991, it acquired the channel and its 4 million subscribers, with a liability of $2 million to its producers, along with a license to carry JCPenney brands on-air.

A QVC offer to buy rival Home Shopping Network in March 1992 was sidetracked by antitrust concerns. On July 12, 1993, QVC offered to acquire Home Shopping in a stock swap valued at about $1.1 billion, but talks faltered when QVC pursued a bid for Paramount in fall 1993. Liberty Media Corp. held a controlling interest in the St. Petersburg, Florida-based Home Shopping Network along with their share of QVC.

===Barry Diller, use of QVC for corporate raider attempts (1993–1995)===

====Diller&#x27;s takeover and failure of Q2====

Introduced to televised shopping by designer Diane von Fürstenberg a decade before their marriage, Fox founder Barry Diller pursued slick &quot;infotainment&quot;-style programming as his next television venture. After resigning as chairman of Fox Inc. in early 1992, Diller&#x27;s Arrow Investments purchased a $25 million stake in QVC, or just under 3 percent of the company, in December 1992 and Diller succeeded Segel as chairman and chief executive on January 18, 1993.

Diller, known for building Fox as a fourth national television network in just five years, replaced QVC&#x27;s second channel, The Fashion Channel, with Q2. Debuting in spring 1994, Q2 was aimed at younger, more economic shoppers, and broadcast from New York City. The spin-off network was shelved in 1996, costing QVC $55 million.

====Failed Paramount takeover bid====
QVC, under Diller, first placed a hostile $9.6 billion bid for Paramount in September 1993, when talks for a friendly merger between Paramount and Viacom, worth $7.2 billion at the time, were already under way. QVC&#x27;s more attractive bid was forced on Paramount in the February 4, 1994 decision of Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc. by the Delaware Supreme Court. Following Viacom&#x27;s merger with Blockbuster that gave Viacom the financial lead, Diller proposed that QVC financial backer BellSouth could buy QVC shares after the merger to boost the value of QVC&#x27;s stock to Paramount shareholders. Diller dropped the proposal when reminded of its legal challenges and on February 14, 1994, QVC lost its bid for Paramount to a $9.85 billion bid from Viacom. Diller&#x27;s reported five-word response to the end of what &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called &quot;the biggest takeover war of the 1990s&quot; was: &quot;They won. We lost. Next.&quot;

====Worldwide reach====

Diller changed the name of QVC Network to QVC, Inc. in 1994, while creating a holding company to allow the firm to diversify and build assets and divisions separately. Among the changes were the creation of two new divisions, Q Direct, to produce infomercials and 60- and 120-second direct response TV commercials, and QVC Interactive, an online-shopping service. QVC launched their internet shopping site, iQVC, on September 15, 1996.

QVC&#x27;s shopping channel based in Mexico, airing in non-primetime programming hours on Canal 4, launched November 1, 1993 in a partnership with Televisa, and known domestically as CVC (a Spanish translation of the network&#x27;s full name). The operation closed on August 4, 1995, after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during a monetary transition, and a general national loathing of long-form home shopping and paid programming content.

===QVC&#x27;s rise (1995–2005)===

On September 29, 1994, QVC Vice President Douglas Briggs unveiled the QVC Local, a customized, $1.7 million state-of-the-art television studio in a bus, in Washington, D.C. In January 1995, QVC kicked off the &quot;Quest for America&#x27;s Best: 50 in 50 Tour,&quot; a 50-week nationwide product search to promote local and regional products with live broadcasts from every State. The QVC Local traveled 88,796 miles of American road during the 50 in 50 Tour in 1995.

Comcast and TCI spin-off company Liberty Media completed their acquisition of the company on February 2, 1995, and Diller resigned. Douglas S. Briggs was announced as QVC Inc. CEO on March 6, 1995, after overseeing the daily business of the company as president of QVC electronic retailing and executive vice president of QVC Inc. since February 1994. Briggs was tasked with boosting Diller&#x27;s many start-up ventures, including QVC UK and Q2.

On September 24, 1997, at 7pm ET, QVC signed off their live broadcast from their previous studio and celebrated the opening of their new broadcast center and corporate offices, Studio Park, a nearly 17-acre property with more than 58,000 square feet of filming studios in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

QVC tested a retail concept in 2000 at The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota with a limited-term lease on a 500 square-foot store. The next year, QVC signed a ten-year lease on a 2,500 square-foot store with broadcasting capabilities and opened QVC @ The Mall on August 8, 2001. The Mall of America store remained the only location for this format and the store closed at the conclusion of the ten-year lease on March 22, 2011.

====Legal hurdles and Comcast&#x27;s exit====

In 1998, two former hosts filed a class-action lawsuit against QVC, claiming that they were discriminated against by the shopping channel based on their race. The lawsuit went on to state that QVC refused to allow non-white hosts any permanent daytime/primetime spots, which relegated them to the overnight hours, otherwise known as the &quot;graveyard shift.&quot; Because of this, the non-white hosts were paid considerably less than the white hosts.

On July 3, 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Liberty Media, which purchased the remaining 56.5% of QVC it didn&#x27;t already own for $7.9 billion. Comcast, for which QVC was a financial asset, not a strategic one, continued to carry QVC for its 21 million cable subscribers.

On Wednesday, March 24, 2004, the FTC sued QVC over violating a June 2000 order barring the company from making misleading claims about dietary supplements. A March 2009 settlement with the FTC charged QVC with paying $6 million for consumer redress and a $1.5 million civil penalty and for QVC to discontinue the dietary supplements products.

In 2006, the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia settled a dispute between QVC and HSN over the use of the phrase &quot;Christmas in July,&quot; QVC maintaining their use of it since 1987, and HSN claiming copyright on it in 2000.

===Move towards e-commerce (2006–2021)===

CEO Douglas Briggs announced his retirement in April 2005 and on November 1, 2005, Michael A. George, who previously served as chief marketing officer and general manager of the U.S. consumer business at Dell Inc, was named successor. George was named QVC CEO on April 15, 2006.

On September 23, 2007, QVC U.S. rebranded itself, changing its logo on-air and online. The rebranding was accompanied by an advertising campaign with the tagline &quot;iQdoU?&quot; (&quot;I shop QVC, do you?&quot;) that had preceded the rebrand with billboards in major U.S. cities. The iQdoU? campaign also included a &quot;teaser&quot; website.

On September 30, 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site, CNR Mall. In 2014 the joint venture reached 89 million households.

In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on August 5, 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition, and the arrangement has since spread to other broadcasters with improvements in multiplexing a number of subchannels. The arrangement also features different on-screen toll-free lines for each station group to allow them to participate in revenue sharing in exchange for the channel space. The broadcast service is branded as &quot;QVC Over the Air&quot;, with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network&#x27;s programming.

After integrating their shopping experience with Facebook in 2008 and with Instagram in 2012, QVC launched &quot;toGather&quot;, a social shopping platform resembling Pinterest in July 2013. The site allowed members to set up a personalized newsfeed to view shopping recommendations from people and brands they chose to follow. QVC shut down the site in January 2015.

On October 21, 2014, QVC returned to the NASDAQ, with trading names QVCA and QVCB.

====Mergers with Zulily and HSN into Qurate====

In August 2015, QVC acquired the online retailer Zulily for $2.4 billion.

On July 6, 2017, QVC&#x27;s parent company, Liberty Interactive, announced its intention to purchase the remaining 62% of stock it did not already own of HSN, the rival home shopping channel. The all-stock deal is valued at $2.1 billion ($40.36 a share). In 2018, Liberty Interactive rebranded itself as Qurate Retail Group, trading under the new NASDAQ tickers QRTEA and QRTEB, with Mike George remaining as president and CEO.

In 2018, Qurate named Leslie Ferraro as President of their QVC and HSN units. Ferraro concluded her 17-year run at The Walt Disney Company where she most recently served as co-chair of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media and president of Disney Consumer Products and reported to work at Qurate on September 16. On February 6, 2019, QVC again rebranded itself, the new logo with a square shape intended to resemble a computer or a phone screen emphasizing its digital and mobile platforms. The reimagined &#x27;Q&#x27; in a sleek, mobile-friendly format, has a lever that is supposed to symbolize an open door, said Susan Ripke, QVC&#x27;s vice president of brand strategy. On Monday, October 7, 2019, QVC ceased its 24/7 live broadcasting model in favor of airing nineteen hours of live and five hours of repeated programming daily.

====COVID-19 pandemic response on-air and online====

As early as March 16, 2020, QVC saw changes to their operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, with on-air product representatives appearing via Skype from around the world, calling in to live broadcasts with program hosts and models practicing social distancing. QVC remained live on-air 20 hours a day, with QVC2 temporarily cutting back to one live hour per day. Employees not essential to the West Chester, Pennsylvania live broadcast shifted to remote work, while all fulfillment centers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, California, and North and South Carolina remained operational with the introduction of health and safety measures and enhanced sanitation practices. Additionally, despite posted revenue gains, Qurate laid off 450 employees in July 2020 &quot;to simplify and streamline its operating structure.&quot;

Approximately 75% of QVC&#x27;s 1.2 million-square-foot Rocky Mount, North Carolina distribution center was damaged in a fire on December 18, 2021, fire, which resulted the death of an employee, along with the furloughing of the facility&#x27;s 2,000-person workforce, as QVC chose not to restore operations at the site and sold it off in the spring of 2023.

===QVC2===
On August 22, 2013, QVC launched a timeshift channel called QVC Plus (the first such channel operated by a home shopping network), made available initially on cable provider Bright House Networks and satellite provider DirecTV, which broadcasts the channel&#x27;s programming on a three-hour tape delay. On April 1, 2017, QVC Plus was rebranded as QVC2 as a destination for more live programming, broadcasting live 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday from noon to midnight ET, and Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-10pm ET. After four months of reduced programming on QVC2 due to the global coronavirus pandemic, QVC2 ceased live programming on July 14, 2020, focusing thereafter only on repeated QVC programming. QVC2 restored live programming with 2 hours live programming daily on December 9, 2020, which increased to 13 hours live daily on July 1, 2021.

===QVC3===
On April 1, 2019, Beauty iQ&#x27;s broadcast channel was rebranded as QVC3, airing rebroadcasts of previously recorded QVC and QVC2 programming 24 hours a day. On June 1, 2022, it took over the cable carriage formerly held by ShopHQ&#x27;s secondary channel, ShopHQ Health.

===QVC NOW===

On October 25, 2016, QVC announced the creation of Beauty iQ, a female-oriented television channel based entirely on beauty products. The network was launched on both DirecTV and Dish Network on October 31, 2016. Beauty iQ aired live programming Monday through Friday, 8pm- Midnight ET. Beauty iQ ceased live programming on March 13, 2019. Beginning April 23, 2019, QVC introduced Beauty iQ as their first digital-only channel, in order to better target its younger audience. On March 1, 2021, BeautyiQ converted to QVC NOW, a mix of various repeated QVC programming.

===QVC France===
On August 1, 2015, QVC reached its seventh international market with France. Before the launch, the company said it expected to create about 200 jobs in its first two years in the country. QVC France broadcast from their studio and administration facility in Seine-Saint-Denis live on weekdays from 15:00 to 23:00 and weekends from 11:00 to 23:00, online, on mobile devices and on major satellite TV, cable TV and internet TV. The channel&#x27;s corporate website said QVC stood for: &quot;Qualité, Valeur, Confiance,&quot; replacing &quot;convenience&quot; with (the French for) &quot;trust&quot;.

Qurate Retail Group ceased operations of QVC France on March 13, 2019, stating that &quot;QVC France had underperformed against financial and operational expectations, in large part due to unique in-market structural challenges and market dynamics that evolved in the years following the launch of the operation.&quot;

===QVC/CNR (China)===
QVC/CNR (China) is based in Beijing and operates both a television broadcast and associated e-commerce website cnrmall.com.

Chinese law prohibits private control of television stations, so this is the maximum position QVC can hold in its Chinese operations. QVC/CNR broadcasts live 17 hours a day. The company&#x27;s 2013 sales were worth $110 million.

==Today&#x27;s Special Value==

Since August 11, 1987, QVC has branded their daily featured product as &quot;Today&#x27;s Special Value&quot;. Originally, &quot;Today&#x27;s Special Value&quot; (&quot;TSV&quot;) was a product specially priced for one day only, but since 2017, contrary to its name, it is offered for a variable amount of time, for up to two weeks.

<text>A web developer is a programmer who develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (Front-end web development), server-side applications (back-end development), or both (full-stack development).

== Prerequisite == 

There are no formal educational or license requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles which teach web development, often freely available on the web - for example, on .

Even though there are no formal requirements, web development projects require web developers to have knowledge and skills such as:
* Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Programming/coding/scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks
* Understanding server-side/client-side architecture and communication of the kind mentioned above
* Ability to utilize a database

<doc id="460192" wikidata="Q4743682" url="?curid=460192" title="American Empire style">
<text>American Empire is a French-inspired Neoclassical style of American furniture and decoration that takes its name and originates from the Empire style introduced during the First French Empire period under Napoleon&#x27;s rule. It gained its greatest popularity in the U.S. after 1820 and is considered the second, more robust phase of the Neoclassical style, which earlier had been expressed in the Adam style in Britain and &quot;Louis Seize&quot;, or Louis XVI, in France. As an early-19th-century design movement in the United States, it encompassed architecture, furniture and other decorative arts, as well as the visual arts.

In American furniture, the Empire style was most notably exemplified by the work of New York cabinetmakers Duncan Phyfe and Paris-trained Charles-Honoré Lannuier. Other major furniture centers renowned for regional interpretations of the American Empire style were Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Many examples of American Empire cabinetmaking are characterized by antiquities-inspired carving, gilt-brass furniture mounts, and decorative inlays such as stamped-brass banding with egg-and-dart, diamond, or Greek-key patterns, or individual shapes such as stars or circles.

The most elaborate furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, anthemion, stars, and acanthus-leaf ornamentation, sometimes in combination with gilding and &quot;vert antique&quot; (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The Red Room at the White House is a fine example of American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, often referred to as the Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly figured mahogany veneers, and sometimes gilt-stencilled decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive chests of drawers with scroll pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and fiddleback chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, chests of drawers and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in oak and oak veneers.

This Americanized interpretation of the Empire style continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-nineteenth century.

<doc id="460195" wikidata="Q257233" url="?curid=460195" title="Fatal Fury">
<text>Fatal Fury, known as in Japan, is a fighting game series developed by SNK, first released on the Neo Geo system.

== Gameplay ==
The original &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; is known for the two-plane system. Characters fight from two different planes. By stepping between the planes, attacks can be dodged with ease. Later games have dropped the two-plane system, replacing it with a complex system of dodging, including simple half second dodges into the background and a three plane system. Characters have moves that can attack across the two planes, attack both planes at once, or otherwise attack dodge characters. The plane system was fully abandoned from later releases beginning with &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;.

Later &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games have experimented with various mechanical changes. &quot;Ring-outs&quot; allow a character to lose the round if the character is thrown into the edges of the fighting backdrop; single-plane backdrops, where dodging is eliminated altogether, causing moves that send opponents to the opposite plane to do collateral damage. The &quot;Deadly Rave&quot; is a super combo used by several characters, where after execution, a player had to press a preset series of buttons with exact timing for the entire combo to execute. The &quot;Just Defend&quot; is a type of protected block in which players regained lost life, did not wear down the player&#x27;s guard crush meter and removed all block stuns making combo interruptions smoother.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
&quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and its sister series, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, are set in the same fictional universe; while &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; takes place in the late 1970s, the story of &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; begins over a decade later in the early 1990s. The two series are set primarily in the same fictional city of &quot;South Town&quot;, loosely based on the real-life city of Miami. The &quot;Wolves&quot; sub-series takes place in the neighboring city of &quot;Second Southtown&quot;.

Many characters from both &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; appear in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, which is set in its own universe that ignores the continuity established in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; games so that the characters from both series could battle without having to age any of them.

=== Characters ===

As with most fighting games, the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series has an extensive cast of characters that increases with each installment. The series&#x27; primary protagonists include Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi, all introduced in the original game, and female ninja Mai Shiranui, introduced in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;; these four characters have appeared in every series entry since their debut, with the exception of &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;. The series&#x27; most prominent antagonist is Geese Howard, a crime lord in South Town responsible for the death of the Bogard brothers&#x27; father, who is often accompanied by his right hand man Billy Kane. Other major antagonists have included Geese&#x27;s half brother Wolfgang Krauser; possessed orphans the Jin brothers; and Geese&#x27;s brother in law Kain R. Heinlein.

&quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; acts as a soft reboot of the series, taking place ten years after the previous games and featuring an almost entirely new cast of fighters, with the story primarily focusing on Rock Howard, son of Geese Howard and protégé of Terry Bogard. Terry, now completely redesigned, is the only returning character in &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;; however, other legacy &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; characters are set to return in the upcoming sequel, &quot;City of the Wolves&quot;.

Certain characters are shared with the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series to more closely establish continuity between the two; for example, &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; features Geese Howard and depicts his initial rise to power in South Town, while Marco Rodrigues in &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot; is established to be the student of &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; protagonist Ryo Sakazaki. Some characters have also made appearances outside the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, particularly in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;.

=== Story ===
In 1981, ten years prior to the events of &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;, Terry and his brother Andy are adopted by Jeff Bogard, only for Jeff to be killed in front of them by his former rival Geese Howard. Determined, the brothers spend the next decade training to become stronger, meeting new allies Joe Higashi and Mai Shiranui, before returning to South Town to participate in the &quot;King of Fighters&quot; fighting tournament being held by Geese. After winning the tournament, Terry and Geese have a showdown at the top of Geese Tower, and Geese is sent falling from the building, believed to be dead. One year later in &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot;, Geese&#x27;s half brother Wolfgang Krauser hosts a new global King of Fighters tournament in a bid to draw out Geese&#x27;s killers and prove himself stronger. At the end of the tournament, Terry defeats Krauser, who chooses to take his own life in shame.

In &quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot;, set three years later, Terry and his friends learn that Geese survived his fall using a magic scroll, and now seeks to recover the three legendary Jin scrolls, said to imbue their user with great power. With the scrolls spotted in South Town, Terry and the others race to recover the scrolls before Geese while also contending with Jin Chonshu and Jin Chonrei, two Chinese orphans possessed by the spirits of their ancestors that seek to use the scrolls to resurrect themselves. Geese recovers the Jin scrolls, but chooses to destroy them so they cannot be used against him. In &quot;Real Bout: Fatal Fury&quot;, to assert his power, Geese holds another &quot;King of Fighters&quot; tournament, which culminates in a final battle between him and Terry. Geese is once again knocked from his tower, and though Terry tries to save him, Geese refuses and willingly falls to his death. Seeking to end the cycle of violence, Terry decides to raise Geese&#x27;s now orphaned young son, Rock Howard.

The story continues in &quot;Garou: Mark of the Wolves&quot;, taking place ten years later. Terry and the now grown up Rock are invited to participate in the new &quot;King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem&quot; tournament. The two later learn that it was organized by Rock&#x27;s maternal uncle, Kain R. Heinlein, who seeks to use Geese&#x27;s fortune to make Second Southtown an independent city-state ruled by violence. When Kain reveals that Rock&#x27;s mother Marie is still alive, but was kidnapped by one of Kain&#x27;s enemies, Rock leaves Terry to go with Kain in order to learn the truth and save his mother. The story is set to continue in the upcoming &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot;.

Several other &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games have been released, though these games&#x27; stories are not a part of the main series canon. These include &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;, which retells the story of the original game with characters from later entries, and &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury Special: Dominated Mind&quot;, in which new protagonist Alfred stops the evil White from filling the power vacuum in South Town after Geese&#x27;s death.

== Development ==

Series producers Takashi Nishiyama (&quot;Fatal Fury&quot;~&quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury 2&quot;) and Hiroshi Matsumoto (&quot;Fatal Fury 3&quot;~&quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;), were the planners of the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (where they were credited as Piston Takashi and Finish Hiroshi). Matsumoto is also the creator of the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series.

== In other media ==
The &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series inspired a trilogy of animated productions produced by NAS with SNK, featuring character designs by Masami Ōbari. The first is a television special that aired in 1992 on Fuji TV titled &quot;Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf&quot; (&quot;Battle Fighters Garou Densetsu&quot;), which adapts the plot of the first game. It was followed in 1993 by another television special &quot;Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle&quot; (&quot;Battle Fighters Garou Densetsu 2&quot;) based on the second game, which also aired on Fuji TV. A theatrically released film followed in 1994, titled &quot;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&quot; (&quot;Garou Densetsu: The Motion Picture&quot;), which features an original plot and new characters. The first two TV specials were released on a single laserdisc and later on DVD.

VIZ Communications picked up the license for the trilogy and produced English dubbed versions of each of them, releasing them straight to VHS, and later on DVD. They were later released subtitled, with the first two &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; specials released in one video titled &quot;Fatal Fury One-Two Punch&quot;. The subbed version of &quot;Fatal Fury 2&quot; features a scene involving a rematch between Joe Higashi and Big Bear (Raiden) that was cut from the dubbed version. The English DVD release of the TV specials, &quot;Fatal Fury: Double Impact&quot;, features this scene. If chosen to be viewed with the English dub, it would temporarily go onto Japanese with English subtitles during this scene.

Many soundtracks, manga comics, other books, video tapes, and drama CDs have been released in Japan for the series as a whole and for each of its individual entries. A brief OVA set after the events of &quot;Mark of the Wolves&quot;, titled &quot;Memories of Stray Wolves&quot;, was packaged with the 15th anniversary soundtrack collection. The events of the first game were also loosely adapted in the web series &quot;The King of Fighters: Destiny&quot;.

Characters from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; have gone on to make guest appearances in various fighting games such as &quot;Dead or Alive 5: Last Round&quot;, &quot;Tekken 7&quot;, &quot;Fighting EX Layer&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, and &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, as well as games from other genres such as &quot;Fall Guys&quot;.

<text>Public holidays in New Zealand (also known as statutory holidays) consist of a variety of cultural, national, and religious holidays that are legislated in New Zealand. Workers can get a maximum of 12 public holidays (eleven national holidays plus one provincial holiday) and a minimum of 20 annual leave days a year.

== History ==
Bank holidays in New Zealand originated with a celebration of St Andrew&#x27;s Day in 1857. Nationwide public holidays began with the Bank Holidays Act 1873, which was based on the UK Bank Holidays Act 1871. Initially there was some resistance to it.

Anniversary days celebrated, from as early as 1843, the first arrivals of settlers in each province. By 1846 the Wellington Anniversary Day was described as having the appearance of an English Fair.

Half-holidays, or early closing days, were widespread from the 1900s to 1970s. They allowed 6 day weeks in shops and offices to include a half day off from 1 pm, on a day set by the local council. From the late 1840s the practice spread from Wellington and Christchurch. In the 1870s many towns adopted shopping half holidays, usually a Wednesday Thursday, or Saturday. From 1873 female factory workers had a half-holiday from 2 pm on Saturdays, from 1881 under-18s got it and, after 1891, the holiday started from 1 pm. The Shops and Shop Assistants Act 1892 gave shop assistants half-holidays starting at 1 pm, the shops themselves also being closed from 1894. From 1907 electors could set the day in local elections.

===Matariki===

In 2006, Māori Language Commissioner Haami Piripi proposed to make Matariki an official holiday. After public discussion, in 2009 a bill was introduced to make Matariki a public holiday; however, the bill was voted down at its first reading. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on 7 September 2020 that her government would create a new public holiday to celebrate Matariki should the Labour Party win the 2020 general election. Labour won the election, and in February 2021 Ardern announced that Matariki would become an annual public holiday with a variable date (June or July). The Matariki Public Holiday Bill received royal assent on 11 April 2022. The first Matariki public holiday was observed on 24 June 2022.

==National public holidays==

Statutory holidays are legislated by the Holidays Act 2003.


===Mondayised===

The holidays that do not always fall on Monday or Friday are &quot;Mondayised&quot;.

If the holiday fall on a weekend, and an employee does not work on the weekends, then the holiday is transferred to the following Monday or Tuesday. If the employee works on the weekends, then the holiday is taken on that day.

Christmas Day and New Years&#x27; Day have always been Mondayised holidays, and from 2013 Waitangi Day and Anzac Day are also Mondayised.

Waitangi Day and Anzac Day are always &quot;commemorated&quot; on the exact date, as they remember specific historical events. The statutory holidays, however, are Mondayised.

===Pay===
All workers who work on a public holiday must be paid time-and-a-half, and if it would otherwise be a normal working day for them, be given an alternative holiday (known as a day in lieu). Payment for the alternative holiday is equivalent relevant daily pay for the particular alternative day taken, had they have worked it.
===Restricted trading days===

There are special trading restrictions on Christmas Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday (not a public holiday) and before 1 pm on Anzac Day. On those days, generally only dairies, petrol stations, pharmacies, restaurants, cafés, and shops within an airport or train station may open. All other shops including supermarkets must close.

Some shops open each year despite the law and are fined.

Certain areas have exemptions allowing them to trade one or more of the restricted days. These areas include Parnell Road in Parnell, Auckland, Paihia, Picton, and Queenstown. The Shop Trading Hours Commission decided where exemptions were to apply but it was shut down in 1990, leaving the existing exemptions in place but no longer having a mechanism for other places to apply. In 2016, regional councils were given the power to set Easter Sunday trading rules in their area. Around 44 councils, covering around one-third of the population, have set policy allowing trading on Easter Sunday.

Shops that can open on the restricted days are still subject to conditions and subject to any other law to the contrary. For example, alcohol can only be sold with a meal or to people staying on the premises overnight.

==Provincial anniversary days== 
In addition to the eleven national public holidays, section 44 of the Holidays Act 2003 specifies as public holidays the anniversary days of each province (or the day locally observed as that day) to celebrate the founding days or landing days of the first colonists of the various colonial provinces. These are only celebrated within each province, not nationwide. Exact dates of the various provinces&#x27; anniversary days are not specifically stated in the act, and are instead determined by historical convention and local custom. The regions covered are set by provincial district (as they stood when abolished in 1876), plus Southland, the Chatham Islands, South Canterbury, and Northland. The actual observance days can vary even within each province and is due to local custom, convenience or the proximity of seasonal events or other holidays and may differ from the official observance day.

==Annual leave and non-working days==
In addition to the above holidays, from 1 April 2007 all workers must be given four weeks annual leave, often taken in the summer Christmas – New Year period. In many industries there is a Christmas – New Year shutdown of business. With only three working days between Christmas and New Year, many workers take this time off, as they can have a ten-day summer break for only three days leave. Many retail outlets also hold sales at this time to stimulate business while others close down due to low demand for services. The days from 25 December to 15 January are not considered to be working days for official government purposes. The public counters of most government departments do open on weekdays during this period, though often only a limited service may be available.

==School holidays==
State schools have a 4-term year, of about ten weeks each and usually with a two-week holiday between terms. Although standard term dates are set by the Ministry of Education each year, schools can vary these to account for local holidays and school closures due to weather. The first term commences in late January or early February. Occasionally, Easter holidays and/or Anzac Day may fall within these holidays. The holiday between terms two and three is generally known as the midwinter break and occurs in July, while that between terms 3 and 4 occurs in late September, early October. Term four ends in mid December, generally a week or two before Christmas, though for many senior students this term ends after their final NCEA examination in late November or early December. From time to time, state schools are entitled to schedule a &quot;teacher only&quot; day for teacher training and administration. These days count as a public holiday for the students of that particular school -- who do not attend on that day -- but not for the teachers or the broader non-student population.

== One-off public holidays ==

A &quot;one off&quot; national public holiday, known as Queen Elizabeth II Memorial Day, was declared by the Prime Minister for 26 September 2022 to allow people to pay their respects for the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch of New Zealand. South Canterbury Anniversary Day, which was due to be observed on 26 September, was moved to be observed on Friday 11 November.

==Proposals for new holidays==
Following the death of Sir Edmund Hillary in 2008, the Green Party proposed a public holiday in his honour. There is also support in some quarters for the old Dominion Day holiday to be revived as &quot;New Zealand Day&quot;.

==Proposals for abolition of holidays==

From the 1950s to the 1970s it was frequently suggested that the Provincial Anniversary holidays be abolished, as the Provinces ceased to exist in 1876.

Before Waitangi Day was made a national public holiday it was sometimes suggested that a Waitangi Day holiday should replace the anniversary days, and the Waitangi Day Act 1960 made provision for this. Waitangi Day was eventually made an additional holiday and the provincial holidays lived on, primarily because most regions had long established events on those weekends.

<text>Johann Wilhelm Kinau (22 August 1880 – 31 May 1916), better known by his pseudonym Gorch Fock (), was a German author. Other pseudonyms he used were Jakob Holst and Giorgio Focco.

==Life==
Kinau was the eldest child of fisherman Heinrich Wilhelm Kinau and his wife, Metta Holst, on the Elbe island of Finkenwerder (now part of Hamburg). In 1895 he was apprenticed to his uncle, the merchant August Kinau in Geestemünde (today part of Bremerhaven), and from 1897 until 1898 he attended a commercial school in Bremerhaven. Later he was employed as an accountant in Meiningen, Bremen, Halle (Saale) and from 1907 at the shipping company Hamburg-Amerika-Linie in Hamburg. He married Rosa Elisabeth Reich in 1908, with whom he had three children. 
In 1904, Kinau started publishing poetry and stories in his native Low German dialect. In 1913, he published his most popular work, the novel &quot;Seefahrt ist Not!&quot;, in which he describes the life of the deep sea fishermen of his home island.

In the First World War, Kinau was drafted into the German infantry in 1915. He fought in Serbia and Russia and later at Verdun. From 1916 he served in the German Navy, having requested the transfer. He served as a lookout on the light cruiser SMS &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; and died when the ship was sunk in the Battle of Jutland. His body was found on the Swedish shore on the island Väderöbod midsummer&#x27;s eve 1916 near Fjällbacka. He was later buried on the island of Stensholmen together with other German and British servicemen. He was recognised by carrying a poem, &quot;Letzter Wunsch&quot;, which predicted his demise, in a hermetically sealed box in his pocket:

In 1938, his widow was invited to take part in the first voyage of M/V &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; to Madeira.

The German Navy named two training windjammers in his honor, the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; of the Kriegsmarine and the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot; of the Deutsche Marine. Gorch-Fock-Wall on the Hamburg Wallring is also named after him.

== Burial ==
Gorch Fock is buried on the Stensholmen in Bohuslän the northernmost part of the Swedish west coast. He was buried in the War cemetery on Stensholmen in 1920 by the pastor C. Norborg in Fjällbacka alongside two British and thirteen German sailors found dead in the archipelago and brought to land by local fishermen.

<text>The DFS 228 was a rocket-powered, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft designed by the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - &quot;German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;) during World War II. By the end of the war, the aircraft had only flown in the form of two unpowered prototypes.

==Design and development==
Initial design of the DFS 228 was undertaken before the outbreak of war as a research aircraft, the DFS 54, aimed at developing a high-altitude escape system for sailplanes. The project was suspended by the commencement of hostilities, but was revived in 1940 when the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM - &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) delivered the DFS with a requirement for a rocket-powered reconnaissance aircraft.

The advantages of a sailplane for aerial reconnaissance included its silence, its low speed relative to the ground (allowing for higher-quality photography), and its potential ability to loiter above an area of interest. The project gave the DFS the opportunity to investigate two additional areas that it was interested in: the effects of wing sweep on sailplane design, and supersonic flight.

The DFS 228 was designed by Felix Kracht and a first prototype was completed in March 1944; it was undergoing gliding tests by that August, carried aloft piggyback and strut-mounted atop a Dornier Do 217. The aircraft was of conventional sailplane arrangement with long, slender wings and designed to land on a retractable skid mounted on its belly. The nose of the aircraft could be separated in an emergency and formed a self-contained, pressurized escape capsule for the pilot. Because of problems with the cabin pressurization system, the second prototype accommodated the pilot in a prone position.

Forty flights were made with the prototypes, and installation of a rocket was to have taken place in February 1945, but the project fell by the wayside as the war situation became more desperate. The second prototype was destroyed in an air raid in May 1945, and the first prototype was captured by U.S. troops in June. In 1946 it was sent to the United Kingdom for study where it was apparently scrapped in 1947, although its exact fate is unknown.

==Variants==

;DFS 54
:Experimental glider with a pressure cabin, oxygen, cabin heating and insulation for high altitude flying.
;DFS 228
:Powered variant of the DFS 54 with a Walter HWK 509D rocket propulsion unit.

<text>Kastamonu Province () is a province of Turkey, in the Black Sea region in the north of the country. It is surrounded by Sinop to the east, Bartın, Karabük to the west, Çankırı to the south, Çorum to the southeast and the Black Sea to the north. Its area is 13,064 km2, and its population is 378,115 (2022). The population density is 29 inhabitants per km2. The provincial capital Kastamonu has a population of 128,707 (2022).

==Districts==

Kastamonu province is divided into 20 districts (capital district in bold):

==History==
It is not definitively known when Kastamonu was first founded. However, some sources dating back to the Early Middle Ages refer to the province. There are also some archeological findings that date to about 100,000 years that suggest the region was inhabited at that time.

There are many ideas about the derivation of the name Kastamonu:

According to the first view, it should be considered that the name Kastamonu is Turkishized from the name Paphlagonía[Greek &quot;land of Paphlagon (people)&quot;]. The region covering the West Black Sea and Central Black Sea regions was called Paphlagonia before the Turks. Today, Kastamonu, Sinop, Bartın, Çankırı and Karabük are located in this region, while parts of Çorum, Bolu, Zonguldak and Samsun provinces remain within the region. The Paphlagonians, who dominated this region in 1000 BC, gave their name to this geography.

According to a second opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the name Kastama, which was used for the same region in the Hittite period. The name Kastama turned into Kastamonu over time.

According to another view, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Gas and Tumanna. Gas, or better known as Kashkas, are among the first settlers of Kastamonu. Tumanna is the name of a city/region located on Kastamonu at that time. The combination of these two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.

According to a third opinion, the city of Kastamonu took its name from the combination of the words Kastra and Komnen. The word Kastra means &quot;castle&quot; in Latin. The Komnens are a Byzantine Dynasty and the settlers of this region during the Byzantine period. These two words took the form of Kastamonu over time.

With the weakening of the Macedon kings, the Paphlagonia and Bithynia regions were engulfed by the newly formed Pontus kingdom. After the fall of the Pontus kingdom in first century BC, the area was incorporated by the Roman Empire by joining Paphlagonia with Bithynia. The capital center of this new city-state was Pompeiopolis, of which the remains still stand near Tasköprü District in Kastamonu.

The region then fell under the hegemony of the Seljuq dynasty (11th century AD), followed by the Danishmends, the Byzantines during the crusades, Çobanoğlu and Jandarid beyliks. The Ottoman sultan Beyazid I conquered the province in 1392; however, following his capture and death in Battle of Ankara, the area was granted back to the Çandaroğlu by the Mongol warlord Timur Lenk. Ottoman sultan Mehmed II incorporated the region back into the empire in 1461.

During the Ottoman reign, the province boundaries were expanded up to reach Constantinople. The sultan&#x27;s heirs were often sent to rule the province as governors to gain experience.

After the First World War, during the battles of the Turkish War of Independence, Kastamonu played an important role in the supply of ammunition and troops to the İnebolu–Ankara front, transporting the war machines that would arrive to İnebolu by sea from Istanbul (Constantinople) and the Soviets. When the Greeks noticed this activity, the İnebolu port was bombarded from the sea on 9 June 1921.

== Geography ==
The province is mostly covered with forests, thanks to the mild Black Sea climate. Ilgaz National Park, where a micro-climate dominates due to the mountainous terrain and numerous streams, is 63 km south of the province center of Kastamonu.

Ilgaz Mountain (highest peak 2587 m) dominates the south of the province where hiking and whitewater rafting is possible at the Ilgaz Stream.

== Economy ==
According to the 2000 census, 77.5% of the labor force is occupied in agriculture. This ratio is higher than the country average. The second largest sector is public and private services (8.9%).

Almost all of the arable land has permanent crops. The agricultural products make up about of 0.01% of the total in Turkey. A large portion of the agricultural produce consists of cereals. Thanks to its widespread forest areas (a total of 57% of the surface area), forestry is also an important industry. Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture and mining products.

Underground resources include copper, mercury, iron ore, chromium, manganese, asbestos, bauxite, graphite, phosphate, kaolinite, clay, limestone, quartz, marble, magnesite, fire clay, coal and nickel. There are also some natural thermal and mineral water springs, of which a few are suitable for economic investments.

Kastamonu shares about 0.4% of the GDP, the composition of the GDP is as follows (1998 est.):
*Agriculture: 32.8%
*Communication and transport: 20%
*Services: 16.8%
*Industry: 9.5%

Transportation is possible only through paved and unpaved highways; a railroad that will connect Çankırı, Kastamonu and İnebolu is under construction. Although the province has a 135 km long coastline to Black Sea, only İnebolu has a small port and transportation by the sea is almost non-existent.

There are around 112,000 telephone main lines in use, about 200,000 cellphone subscribers and 15,000 Internet users in the province.

==Miscellaneous==
*Handcrafts are abundant in Kastamonu, especially in rural areas. Most available are hand-woven textiles.
*Several national and local annual festivities also take place in the province.
*In a research conducted in the province, 812 different food are identified that are specific to the region.
*The provincial soccer team Kastamonuspor competes in the Bank Asya 1st League (1st National Soccer League).
*The founder of the Turkish republic, Atatürk, declared the &quot;dress code reform&quot;, which abolished the fez, in Kastamonu in 1925.

<doc id="460227" wikidata="Q1227702" url="?curid=460227" title="Dirichlet's unit theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem is a basic result in algebraic number theory due to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. It determines the rank of the group of units in the ring of algebraic integers of a number field . The regulator is a positive real number that determines how &quot;dense&quot; the units are.

The statement is that the group of units is finitely generated and has rank (maximal number of multiplicatively independent elements) equal to

where is the &quot;number of real embeddings&quot; and the &quot;number of conjugate pairs of complex embeddings&quot; of . This characterisation of and is based on the idea that there will be as many ways to embed in the complex number field as the degree formula_1; these will either be into the real numbers, or pairs of embeddings related by complex conjugation, so that
Note that if is Galois over formula_2 then either or .

Other ways of determining and are

* use the primitive element theorem to write formula_3, and then is the number of conjugates of that are real, the number that are complex; in other words, if is the minimal polynomial of over formula_2, then is the number of real roots and is the number of non-real complex roots of (which come in complex conjugate pairs);
* write the tensor product of fields formula_5 as a product of fields, there being copies of formula_6 and copies of formula_7.

As an example, if is a quadratic field, the rank is 1 if it is a real quadratic field, and 0 if an imaginary quadratic field. The theory for real quadratic fields is essentially the theory of Pell&#x27;s equation.

The rank is positive for all number fields besides formula_2 and imaginary quadratic fields, which have rank 0. The &#x27;size&#x27; of the units is measured in general by a determinant called the regulator. In principle a basis for the units can be effectively computed; in practice the calculations are quite involved when is large.

The torsion in the group of units is the set of all roots of unity of , which form a finite cyclic group. For a number field with at least one real embedding the torsion must therefore be only . There are number fields, for example most imaginary quadratic fields, having no real embeddings which also have for the torsion of its unit group.

Totally real fields are special with respect to units. If is a finite extension of number fields with degree greater than 1 and
the units groups for the integers of and have the same rank then is totally real and is a totally complex quadratic extension. The converse holds too. (An example is equal to the rationals and equal to an imaginary quadratic field; both have unit rank 0.)

The theorem not only applies to the maximal order but to any order .

There is a generalisation of the unit theorem by Helmut Hasse (and later Claude Chevalley) to describe the structure of the group of &quot;-units&quot;, determining the rank of the unit group in localizations of rings of integers. Also, the Galois module structure of formula_9 has been determined.

==The regulator==

Suppose that &quot;K&quot; is a number field and formula_10 are a set of generators for the unit group of &quot;K&quot; modulo roots of unity. There will be Archimedean places of &quot;K&quot;, either real or complex. For formula_11, write formula_12 for the different embeddings into formula_6 or formula_7 and set to 1 or 2 if the corresponding embedding is real or complex respectively. Then the matrix formula_15 has the property that the sum of any row is zero (because all units have norm 1, and the log of the norm is the sum of the entries in a row). This implies that the absolute value of the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting one column is independent of the column. The number is called the regulator of the algebraic number field (it does not depend on the choice of generators ). It measures the &quot;density&quot; of the units: if the regulator is small, this means that there are &quot;lots&quot; of units.

The regulator has the following geometric interpretation. The map taking a unit to the vector with entries formula_16 has an image in the -dimensional subspace of formula_17 consisting of all vectors whose entries have sum 0, and by Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem the image is a lattice in this subspace. The volume of a fundamental domain of this lattice is formula_18.

The regulator of an algebraic number field of degree greater than 2 is usually quite cumbersome to calculate, though there are now computer algebra packages that can do it in many cases. It is usually much easier to calculate the product of the class number and the regulator using the class number formula, and the main difficulty in calculating the class number of an algebraic number field is usually the calculation of the regulator.

===Examples===

*The regulator of an imaginary quadratic field, or of the rational integers, is 1 (as the determinant of a matrix is 1).
*The regulator of a real quadratic field is the logarithm of its fundamental unit: for example, that of formula_19 is formula_20. This can be seen as follows. A fundamental unit is formula_21, and its images under the two embeddings into formula_6 are formula_21 and formula_24. So the matrix is formula_25
*The regulator of the cyclic cubic field formula_26, where is a root of , is approximately 0.5255. A basis of the group of units modulo roots of unity is where and .

==Higher regulators==

A &#x27;higher&#x27; regulator refers to a construction for a function on an algebraic -group with index that plays the same role as the classical regulator does for the group of units, which is a group . A theory of such regulators has been in development, with work of Armand Borel and others. Such higher regulators play a role, for example, in the Beilinson conjectures, and are expected to occur in evaluations of certain -functions at integer values of the argument. See also Beilinson regulator.

==Stark regulator==
The formulation of Stark&#x27;s conjectures led Harold Stark to define what is now called the Stark regulator, similar to the classical regulator as a determinant of logarithms of units, attached to any Artin representation.

==-adic regulator==
Let be a number field and for each prime of above some fixed rational prime , let denote the local units at and let denote the subgroup of principal units in . Set formula_27

Then let denote the set of global units that map to via the diagonal embedding of the global units in .

Since is a finite-index subgroup of the global units, it is an abelian group of rank . The -adic regulator is the determinant of the matrix formed by the -adic logarithms of the generators of this group. &quot;Leopoldt&#x27;s conjecture&quot; states that this determinant is non-zero.

<doc id="460231" wikidata="Q107466928" url="?curid=460231" title="Expansion pack">
<text>An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion, is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game, video game, collectible card game or miniature wargame. An expansion may introduce new rules or game mechanics that augment the original game and add more variety to playing it. In the case of video games, they typically add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters, adventures or an extended storyline to an already-released game. 

While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, it may choose to develop the expansion itself, or it may do both.

Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; games &quot;Xanadu Scenario II&quot; and &quot;Sorcerian&quot;. Other terms for the concept are module and, in certain games&#x27; marketing, adventure.

==Characteristics==
The price of an expansion pack is usually much less than that of the original game. As expansion packs consist solely of additional content, most require the original game in order to play. Games with many expansions often begin selling the original game with prior expansions, such as &quot;The Sims Deluxe Edition&quot; (&quot;The Sims&quot; with &quot;The Sims: Livin&#x27; Large&quot;). These bundles make the game more accessible to new players. When games reach the end of their lifespan, the publisher often releases a &#x27;complete&#x27; or &#x27;gold&#x27; collection, which includes the game and all its subsequent expansions.

==Stand-alone expansion packs==
Some expansion packs do not require the original game in order to use the new content, as is the case with &quot;Half-Life: Blue Shift&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; or &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot;. Some art, sound, and code are reused from the original game. In some cases, a stand-alone expansion such as &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death&quot;, or &quot;Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna&quot; includes the original game.

==Console game expansion packs==
Expansion packs are most commonly released for PC games, but are becoming increasingly prevalent for video game consoles, particularly due to the popularity of downloadable content. The increasing number of multi-platform games has also led to the release of more expansion packs on consoles, especially stand-alone expansion packs (as described above). &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, for example, requires the original &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot; to play on the PC, but Xbox 360 versions of both the original &quot;Tiberium Wars&quot; and &quot;Kane&#x27;s Wrath&quot; are available, neither of which require one another.

The Japanese version of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Beatmania&quot; was the first game on the PlayStation to support expansion packs, which were branded as append discs. These discs included additional tracks and required the original Beatmania disc (and later playable Beatmania game discs) to play. The discs required the player to access the Disc Change menu on the Beatmania disc, remove the Beatmania disc, insert an append disc, then press the start button to play. The first append disc for the game, Beatmania Append Yebisu Mix, was bundled with the PlayStation version as the game&#x27;s 2nd disc, with subsequent append discs being released as standalone retail releases.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto: London 1969&quot; was marketed as the first expansion pack released for the PlayStation. The game required the player to insert the &quot;London&quot; disc, remove it, insert the original &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; disc, remove it, then insert the &quot;London&quot; media again in order to play.

&quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; for the Mega Drive/Genesis was unusual in that it functioned as both a stand-alone cartridge and as an expansion pack for both &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;.

==Collectible card game expansions==
Collectible card games, or CCGs for short, are typically released as expansion sets, composed of booster packs. CCGs may be referred to as &quot;living&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;, and living CCGs are routinely published with supplementary expansions. CCGs generally do not have a core set that is reprinted indefinitely, instead, they are retired and replaced with new expansions on a quarterly or bi-annual basis. Expansions usually introduce new rules, or game mechanics, expanding the game&#x27;s library of cards and rules set.

<doc id="460233" wikidata="Q26261772" url="?curid=460233" title="Stumptown">
<text>Stumptown is a name or nickname that has been applied to several places in the United States (listed alphabetically by state):

*Guerneville, California, was the site of an ancient coast redwood forest, much of which was logged for the rebuilding of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Prior to being renamed for one of the local milling families, Guerneville was called Stumptown for the giant redwood stumps left by the loggers. Each year Guerneville holds its &quot;Stumptown Daze Parade&quot; and a number of local businesses adopted the original name including Stumptown Brewery, Stumptown Nursery and Stumptown Cycles.
*Whitefish, Montana, was called Stumptown as the area was cleared for the train station.
*Matthews, North Carolina, was originally named Stumptown in the early 19th century after cotton farmers cleared the land, leaving tree stumps everywhere.
*Portland, Oregon, bears the nickname Stumptown, as well as several other nicknames. In the mid-19th century, the city&#x27;s growth led residents to clear a lot of land quickly, but the tree stumps were not immediately removed; in some areas, there were so many that people used to jump from stump to stump to avoid the muddy, unpaved roads. The nickname is used in the names of several local businesses, including Stumptown Coffee Roasters, an independent coffee roaster and retailer located in Portland; Stumptown Sewing, a custom sewing and upholstery shop; StumpTown Kilts, a maker of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s modern kilts; Stumptown (comics), a creator-owned detective fiction comic book series by Greg Rucka, set in Portland; the Stumptown Comics Fest, an annual comic book convention held in Portland; Stumptown Syndicate, a Portland-based 501(c)(3) organization working to create resilient, radically inclusive tech and maker communities that empower positive change; Stumptown Dance, a Portland based weekly Swing Dance; and Stumptown Mattress, a Portland based e-commerce mattress brand. 
*Stumptown, Indiana, is an unincorporated community in Parke County.
*Stumptown, Loudoun County, Virginia, is an unincorporated community.
*Stumptown, Northampton County, Virginia, is an unincorporated community.
*Stumptown, West Virginia, is an unincorporated community in Gilmer County.

The name &quot;Stumpville&quot; likewise has appeared in various locales. Both of these names share the theme that U.S. town names before the mid-20th century were profuse because every village or roadside cluster of homes had its own name (in addition to whichever township was its legal municipality), in a way that the postal code system later deemphasized to the extent that many of the minor town names have now disappeared from current use (persisting solely in contexts such as historical documentation, reminiscences, and so on).

<doc id="460235" wikidata="Q2880612" url="?curid=460235" title="Resultant force">
<text>In physics and engineering, a resultant force is the single force and associated torque obtained by combining a system of forces and torques acting on a rigid body via vector addition. The defining feature of a resultant force, or resultant force-torque, is that it has the same effect on the rigid body as the original system of forces. Calculating and visualizing the resultant force on a body is done through computational analysis, or (in the case of sufficiently simple systems) a free body diagram.

The point of application of the resultant force determines its associated torque. The term &quot;resultant force&quot; should be understood to refer to both the forces and torques acting on a rigid body, which is why some use the term &quot;resultant force–torque&quot;. 

The force equal to the resultant force in magnitude, yet pointed in the opposite direction, is called an equilibrant force.

==Illustration==
The diagram illustrates simple graphical methods for finding the line of application of the resultant force of simple planar systems.
#Lines of application of the actual forces formula_1 and formula_2 in the leftmost illustration intersect. After vector addition is performed &quot;at the location of formula_3&quot;, the net force obtained is translated so that its line of application passes through the common intersection point. With respect to that point all torques are zero, so the torque of the resultant force formula_4 is equal to the sum of the torques of the actual forces.
#Illustration in the middle of the diagram shows two parallel actual forces. After vector addition &quot;at the location of formula_5&quot;, the net force is translated to the appropriate line of application, whereof it becomes the resultant force formula_4. The procedure is based on a decomposition of all forces into components for which the lines of application (pale dotted lines) intersect at one point (the so-called pole, arbitrarily set at the right side of the illustration). Then the arguments from the previous case are applied to the forces and their components to demonstrate the torque relationships.
#The rightmost illustration shows a couple, two equal but opposite forces for which the amount of the net force is zero, but they produce the net torque formula_7   where formula_8  is the distance between their lines of application. This is &quot;pure&quot; torque, since there is no resultant force.

==Bound vector==
A force applied to a body has a point of application. The effect of the force is different for different points of application. For this reason a force is called a &quot;bound vector&quot;, which means that it is bound to its point of application.

Forces applied at the same point can be added together to obtain the same effect on the body. However, forces with different points of application cannot be added together and maintain the same effect on the body.

It is a simple matter to change the point of application of a force by introducing equal and opposite forces at two different points of application that produce a pure torque on the body. In this way, all of the forces acting on a body can be moved to the same point of application with associated torques.

A system of forces on a rigid body is combined by moving the forces to the same point of application and computing the associated torques. The sum of these forces and torques yields the resultant force-torque.

==Associated torque==
If a point R is selected as the point of application of the resultant force F of a system of &quot;n&quot; forces Fi then the associated torque T is determined from the formulas
:formula_9
and
:formula_10

It is useful to note that the point of application R of the resultant force may be anywhere along the line of action of F without changing the value of the associated torque. To see this add the vector kF to the point of application R in the calculation of the associated torque,
:formula_11
The right side of this equation can be separated into the original formula for T plus the additional term including kF,
:formula_12
because the second term is zero. To see this notice that F is the sum of the vectors Fi which yields
:formula_13
thus the value of the associated torque is unchanged.

==Torque-free resultant==
It is useful to consider whether there is a point of application R such that the associated torque is zero. This point is defined by the property
:formula_14
where F is resultant force and Fi form the system of forces.

Notice that this equation for R has a solution only if the sum of the individual torques on the right side yield a vector that is perpendicular to F. Thus, the condition that a system of forces has a torque-free resultant can be written as
:formula_15
If this condition is satisfied then there is a point of application for the resultant which results in a pure force. If this condition is not satisfied, then the system of forces includes a pure torque for every point of application.

==Wrench==
The forces and torques acting on a rigid body can be assembled into the pair of vectors called a &quot;wrench&quot;. If a system of forces and torques has a net resultant force F and a net resultant torque T, then the entire system can be replaced by a force F and an arbitrarily located couple that yields a torque of T. In general, if F and T are orthogonal, it is possible to derive a radial vector R such that formula_16, meaning that the single force F, acting at displacement R, can replace the system. If the system is zero-force (torque only), it is termed a &quot;screw&quot; and is mathematically formulated as screw theory.
The resultant force and torque on a rigid body obtained from a system of forces Fi i=1...,n, is simply the sum of the individual wrenches Wi, that is

:formula_17
Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces F and -F acting at points A and B respectively, yields the resultant W=(F-F, A×F - B× F) = (0, (A-B)×F). This shows that wrenches of the form W=(0, T) can be interpreted as pure torques.

<text>Warren Evan Spector (born October 2, 1955) is an American role-playing and video game designer, director, writer, producer and production designer. He is known for creating immersive sim games, which give players a wide variety of choices in how to progress. Consequences of those choices are then shown in the simulated game world in subsequent levels or missions. He is best known for the critically acclaimed video game &quot;Deus Ex&quot; that embodies the choice and consequence philosophy while combining elements of the first-person shooter, role-playing, and adventure game genres. In addition to &quot;Deus Ex,&quot; Spector is known for his work while employed by Looking Glass Studios, where he was involved in the creation of several acclaimed titles including &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;Ultima Underworld II, System Shock&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. He is employed by OtherSide Entertainment, where he was part of the development team for the stalled &quot;System Shock 3&quot;. He is currently working on a new immersive sim based on an original intellectual property.

==Early life==
Spector grew up in Manhattan, which he described as a sometimes hostile environment where &quot;short, pudgy, Jewish kids didn&#x27;t fare well&quot;. He showed an intense devotion to whatever topic became his focus at any given time, from dinosaurs and airplanes as a small boy, to an interest in law by the sixth grade. At age 13, Spector had decided he wanted to be a film critic, and by high school, his interests expanded to include cars and basketball.

Spector and game designer Greg Costikyan were friends since high school.

Spector attended Northwestern University in Illinois, still intending to become a film critic, stating that he &quot;knew more about movies than a lot of my teachers&quot;. Spector earned his BS in Communications at Northwestern, and went on to earn his MA in Radio-TV-Film at the University of Texas at Austin in 1980. His thesis was a critical history of Warner Bros. cartoons.

All through college, Spector enjoyed gaming, and recalls that he &quot;played Avalon Hill games mainly, and a lot of &quot;OGRE&quot; and &quot;G.E.V.&quot; games, and &quot;Rivets&quot; from Metagaming. It was all boardgames until I became friends with science-fiction writers who were into &quot;D&amp;D&quot; games, so I gave the game a try. I was hooked.&quot; Spector taught several undergraduate classes at the University of Texas at Austin, on the history, theory, and criticism of film.

==Career==
===Tabletop role-playing games===
In 1983, after a job at the Harry Ransom Center as an archivist in charge of the David O. Selznick collection ended after a few months, Spector recalls that he &quot;was sitting around, wondering how I was going to pay the next month&#x27;s rent, when I got a call from Chris Frink. He was a writer for a weekly entertainment magazine I used to edit in college. Anyway, he said that he was now editor of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; magazine and asked if I wanted a job. So, in the fall of 1983, I started as an editor.&quot; Within a short time, Spector became the editor-in-chief for all Steve Jackson Games products, the company that owned and published &quot;Space Gamer&quot; magazine. Spector began producing role-playing games for the company, stating, &quot;I supervised game development, typesetting, and the art and graphic departments.&quot; Greg Costikyan developed &quot;Toon&quot; (1984), based on an idea by Jeff Dee; Costikyan only intended the game to be an article in &quot;Fantasy Gamer&quot; magazine, but Spector liked the idea and expanded it into a complete role-playing system, publishing it as the first full role-playing game from Steve Jackson Games. Spector wrote the early &quot;Paranoia&quot; game supplement &quot;Send in the Clones&quot; (1985) with Allen Varney. Spector also worked on the &quot;GURPS&quot; role-playing game. In March 1987 he was hired by TSR, initially working on games such as &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; and the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; role-playing game. He also worked on &quot;The Bullwinkle and Rocky Party Roleplaying Game&quot;, and the second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules set, as well as board games, choose-your-own-adventure books, and novels. Spector spent some time in TSR&#x27;s research and development department, helping launch, among other things, &quot;Spelljammer&quot;.

===Origin and Looking Glass Studios===
In 1989, Spector entered the video game industry and joined Origin, where he co-produced &quot;Ultima VI&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander&quot; and produced &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; and &quot;Ultima Underworld II&quot;, &quot;Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle&quot;, &quot;System Shock&quot;, &quot;Wings of Glory&quot;, &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and others. He later became general manager of Looking Glass Austin. He worked briefly on &quot;Dark Camelot&quot;, which later became &quot;&quot;. However, Spector left Looking Glass soon afterward, just before &quot;Thief&quot; shipped, to pursue other interests. According to Spector, his decision to dissolve the Austin branch was prompted by the company&#x27;s ongoing financial struggles and the realization that &quot;continued existence of the Austin Studio was going to jeopardise the existence of Looking Glass overall&quot;.

===Ion Storm===
In 1996, Spector was about to sign a contract with EA to do an unannounced project (which was revealed to be a &quot;&quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; Role-Playing Game&quot;) when he got a call from John Romero to join him at Ion Storm; Romero persuaded Spector by offering him the chance to make the game of his dreams with no creative interference and a big marketing budget. Spector later agreed. In 1997 he founded Ion Storm&#x27;s Austin development studio, and his &quot;dream project&quot; later became the award-winning action/RPG called &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. As Ion Storm studio director, he oversaw development of &quot;Deus Ex: Invisible War&quot; (2003) and &quot;&quot; (2004). In 2004, Spector left Ion Storm to &quot;pursue personal interests outside the company&quot;. Ion Storm was closed by owners Eidos Interactive in February 2005.

===Disney===
In 2005, it was announced that he had established a new studio Junction Point Studios. Somewhere between the end of 2005 and mid-2007, Junction Point Studios and Warren worked on an additional Episode for Half-Life 2 that was ultimately cancelled by Valve. A job advertisement for the studio called for artists for a game that has &quot;classic Hollywood cartoons&quot; featuring &quot;cartoon mice, cats and wabbits&quot;. On July 13, 2007, it was announced that Disney Interactive had acquired Junction Point Studios. His first project with Disney Interactive was a project involving Disney characters, titled &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;. The game is steampunk-themed and designed exclusively for the Wii; the game was released in 2010.

In January 2013, it was announced that Warren Spector had left Disney Interactive following the closure of Junction Point Studios.

===University of Texas===
After leaving Disney Interactive, Spector worked with the University of Texas at Austin to build a new post-baccalaureate game development program – the Denius-Sams Gaming Academy. He worked with UT staff to create a curriculum and plan out courses and labs.

===OtherSide Entertainment===
In February 2016, Spector announced he had joined OtherSide Entertainment, a studio formed by Paul Neurath in 2014 and includes several previous Looking Glass developers, as their Studio Director, after having been in an advisory role from its inception. He will be helping the studio with their current development of &quot;System Shock 3&quot; and &quot;Underworld Ascendant&quot;, the spiritual successor to &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; which both Spector and Neurath worked on in the early 1990s. Though Spector had completed only two-and-a-half years of a three-year commitment to the University of Texas, he jumped at the chance to work on &quot;System Shock&quot; when Neurath approached him with the offer. He also believed the opportunity would help garner good favor from players that had been disappointed by his choice to work on &quot;Epic Mickey&quot;, even though he states that game had still been based on his past design philosophy used in the development of &quot;System Shock&quot; and &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. OtherSide Entertainment announced in November 2022 that Spector is working on a multiplayer game with immersive sim elements entitled &quot;Argos: Riders on the Storm.&quot;

==Personal life==
Spector met Caroline Skelley in 1984 at a comic book store in Austin, Texas, where she was employed. After Skelley got a job at Steve Jackson Games, she and Spector began a relationship. They were married on April 11, 1987. The couple sometimes worked together, such as on game supplements for the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; role-playing game. The two reside in Austin, Texas. Caroline is a fantasy writer.

<doc id="460248" wikidata="Q335692" url="?curid=460248" title="James Graham, 8th Duke of Montrose">
<text>James Graham, 8th Duke of Montrose, (born 6 April 1935), styled as Earl of Kincardine until 1954 and Marquess of Graham between 1954 and 1992, is a Scottish peer and Conservative politician in the House of Lords.

==Biography==
===Early life===
James Graham was born on 6 April 1935 in Southern Rhodesia, where his father—the then Marquess of Graham—was establishing a farm. He attended boarding school in Scotland, first in Aberdeenshire and after that at the Loretto School, near Edinburgh.

He was appointed Officer, Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (OStJ) in 1978. He served as Brigadier of the Royal Company of Archers in 1986.

===Marriage===
On 31 January 1970, the Marquess of Graham married Catherine Elizabeth MacDonell Young (d. 29 October 2014), daughter of Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders officer Capt. Norman Andrew Thompson Young, of Ottawa, Canada.

They have three children: 
* Lady Hermione Elizabeth Graham (born 20 July 1971), married Christopher John Thornhill, and has issue.
* James Alexander Norman Graham, Marquess of Graham (born 16 August 1973), married Cecilia Manfredi, without issue.
* Lord Ronald John Christopher Graham (born 13 October 1975), married Florence Mary Arbuthnott, and has two sons.

===Politics and international relations===
Montrose considers himself a Conservative and took his seat in the House of Lords on his father&#x27;s death in 1992. He is one of four dukes to have re-entered the House (of the 24 non-royal dukes eligible) following the House of Lords Act 1999, having been one of the 90 peers chosen or elected by the others sitting. The other dukes in the upper house among these are the Duke of Somerset, who won a by-election in December 2014, the Duke of Wellington, who won a by-election in September 2015, and the Duke of Norfolk who, as hereditary Earl Marshal and one of the Great Officers of State, does not have to stand for election.

Montrose was a shadow minister for the Scotland Office before the 2010 general election. He has also spent some time in China promoting renewable energy and environmental measures, and he is a fluent speaker of Mandarin.

<doc id="460249" wikidata="Q243049" url="?curid=460249" title="Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece">
<text>Marie-Chantal Claire Miller (Greek: Μαρί Σαντάλ Μίλλερ; born 17 September 1968), is a member of the former Greek royal family and the extended Danish royal family. She is married to Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, son of King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, who was heir apparent to the Greek throne until the monarchy&#x27;s abolition in 1973.

==Early life==
Marie-Chantal Miller was born in London, England, to Robert Warren Miller, an American-born British businessman, and his wife María Clara &quot;Chantal&quot; Pesantes Becerra, an Ecuadorian. She has an older sister, Pia, formerly married to Christopher Getty, and a younger sister, Alexandra, formerly married to Prince Alexander von Fürstenberg. She was baptized in the Catholic faith at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City by the Archbishop of New York, John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor, with Princess Donatella Missikoff Flick serving as her godmother.

Marie-Chantal was raised in Hong Kong where she attended The Peak School until she was 9 years old when she went to board at Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. In 1982, she transferred to the Ecole Active Bilingue in Paris until her senior year which she took at The Masters School in New York. She interned with Andy Warhol while she was in high school. After graduating, she attended the Academy of Arts for one year. She began a degree in History of Art at New York University in 1993 but dropped out a year later after Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, proposed to her on a skiing holiday in Gstaad, Switzerland, at Christmas.

==Marriage==

In 1994, Marie-Chantal became engaged to Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, son of the deposed King Constantine II and Queen Anne Marie. She converted from Catholicism to Greek Orthodoxy, taking the Greek name María on 22 May 1995 in a private Chrismation ceremony at St Paul&#x27;s Chapel in New York. 

Her engagement ring was a cabochon-cut sapphire and heart-shaped diamond ring. The wedding was planned by Lady Elizabeth Anson and Robert Isabell. Marie-Chantal wore a Valentino dress. The ceremony was held on 1 July 1995 at St Sophia&#x27;s Cathedral in London. Attendees included many members of European royal families.

The couple live in London and have five children: 
*Princess Maria-Olympia (born 25 July 1996 in New York City), 
*Prince Constantine-Alexios (born 29 October 1998 in New York City), 
*Prince Achileas-Andreas (born 12 August 2000 in New York City), 
*Prince Odysseas-Kimon (born 17 September 2004 in London),
*Prince Aristidis-Stavros (born 29 June 2008 in Los Angeles).

==Activities==

In 2000, Marie-Chantal founded the luxury childrenswear brand Marie-Chantal. The brand expanded with a store in London in 2018, and with a new line of fabrics for nursery&#x27;s in 2022. She collaborated with Alice Naylor-Leyland on the 2024 housewares collection, and collaborated with Silver Cross on prams.

In 2019, she published the book &quot;Manners Begin at Breakfast: Modern etiquette for families&quot;. She is a trustee of the Royal Academy Trust and a board director of DFS Group Ltd. 

Her husband&#x27;s family is closely related to many European royal families, particularly the British and Danish royal families. Marie-Chantal has been a guest at high-profile events such as the wedding of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Mary Donaldson (now King Frederik X and Queen Mary), the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of King Charles III. She also attended the 2023 birthday of Christian, Crown Prince of Denmark.

==Titles, styles, and honours==
* 17 February 1968 – 1 July 1995: &quot;Miss&quot; Marie-Chantal Miller
* 1 July 1995 – present: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece, Princess Pavlos of Denmark

Following the deposition of the Greek monarchy in 1973, the Greek Royal Family titles and styles are no longer legally recognised by the government of the Hellenic Republic. Marie-Chantal is also a Danish princess with the style of &quot;Highness&quot;.

<doc id="460250" wikidata="Q147417" url="?curid=460250" title="Thuja plicata">
<text>Thuja plicata is a large evergreen coniferous tree in the family Cupressaceae, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. Its common name is western redcedar in the U.S. or western red cedar in the UK, and it is also called pacific red cedar, giant arborvitae, western arborvitae, just cedar, giant cedar, or shinglewood. It is not a true cedar of the genus &quot;Cedrus&quot;. &quot;T. plicata&quot; is the largest species in the genus &quot;Thuja&quot;, growing up to tall and in diameter. It mostly grows in areas that experience a mild climate with plentiful rainfall, although it is sometimes present in drier areas on sites where water is available year-round, such as wet valley bottoms and mountain streamsides. The species is shade-tolerant and able to establish in forest understories and is thus considered a climax species. It is a very long-lived tree, with some specimens reaching ages of well over 1,000 years.

Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest use the wood of this species for many purposes, such as building canoes, totem poles, and tools. The bark is harvested by indigenous peoples and processed into a fiber, which they use to make items such as rope, baskets, clothing, and rain hats. Because of its wide range of uses, the species is of great cultural importance to these people. Western redcedar wood is aromatic and rot-resistant and is used for applications such as the construction of shingles and siding. It has been introduced to cool temperate areas in other parts of the world, such as Northern Europe and New Zealand.

== Description ==
&quot;Thuja plicata&quot; is a large to very large tree, ranging up to tall and in trunk diameter, larger than any other species in its genus. The trunk swells at the base and has shallow roots. The bark is thin, gray-brown, and fissured into vertical bands. Trees growing in the open may have a crown that reaches the ground, whereas trees densely spaced together will exhibit a crown only at the top, where light can reach the leaves. As the tree ages, the top is damaged by wind and replaced by inferior branches. The species is long-lived; some trees can live well over a thousand years, with the oldest verified aged 1,460.

The foliage forms flat sprays with scale-like leaves in opposite pairs, with successive pairs at 90 degrees to each other. The foliage sprays are green above and green marked with whitish stomatal bands below; they emit a strong aroma reminiscent of pineapple when crushed. The individual leaves are long and broad on most foliage sprays but up to long on strong-growing lead shoots. The foliage of individual branchlets turns orange-brown before falling off in autumn. Branches growing in full sunlight produce denser foliage with more overlap, while shaded branches grow more horizontally, with less self-overlap.

The cones are slender, long, and broad, with 8 to 12 (rarely 14) thin, overlapping scales. They are green to yellow-green, ripening brown in fall about six months after pollination, and open at maturity to shed the seeds. The seeds are long and broad, with a narrow papery wing down each side. The pollen cones are long, red or purple at first, and shed yellow pollen in spring.

=== Chemistry ===
The heartwood of western redcedar contains numerous chemical substances, such as plicatic acid, thujaplicatin methyl ether, hinokitiol and other thujaplicins, , thujic acid, methyl thujate, 1,4-cineole, and . Plicatic acid is believed to be the main irritant and contact allergen responsible for provoking allergic reactions and asthma exacerbation. This leads to occupational asthma in woodworkers that are exposed to western redcedar wood dust. Thujaplicins serve as natural fungicides which prevent the wood from rotting. This effect lasts around a century even after the tree is felled. However, thujaplicins are only found in older trees. Saplings do not produce the chemical, causing them to often develop rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow trunk, as the tree moves to heal itself as it grows. Due to their fungicidal and anti-browning properties, thujaplicins are used in agriculture for fungal diseases and to prevent post-harvest decay. Thujaplicins, like other tropolones, are potent chelating agents and bind divalent metal ions. Basic and animal studies have shown that thujaplicins may have other biological properties, including antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant activities, however reliable evidence on their effectiveness is still lacking.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Thuja plicata&quot; is one of two &quot;Thuja&quot; species native to North America, the other being &quot;T. occidentalis&quot;. Nuclear genome analysis indicates that it is likely more closely related to &quot;T. koraiensis&quot;, which is native to the Korean Peninsula. The two species are hypothesized to have diverged in the Miocene.

A 2008 study found that western redcedar populations in coastal areas of Washington and Oregon are more genetically variable than populations in the Rocky Mountains and coastal British Columbia, indicating that the species most likely spread throughout its current range from a single refugium in the southern portion of its range after the Last Glacial Maximum. Some studies have suggested the existence of an inland refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum, likely in central Idaho. However, more recent genomic approaches corroborate the existence of only a single glacial refugium near the south of the current distribution, with subsequent expansion northward and inland since the last glacial maximum. Refugial populations may have undergone repeated population bottlenecks during the glacial maxima of the Pleistocene. Pollen cores indicate that &quot;T. plicata&quot; only became common in southern coastal British Columbia starting at approximately 6,000 YBP. This coincides with a transition from the warmer, drier climate of the early Holocene to a cooler, wetter climate. The species arrived later in the Canadian Rockies, as recently as 4,000–5,000 YBP. Pollen Assemblages at Seeley Lake, on the eastern slope of the Coast Mountains east of Haida Gwaii, indicate that western redcedar became common there at approximately 2,200 YBP.

=== Etymology ===
The species name &quot;plicata&quot; derives from the Latin word and means &#x27;folded in plaits&#x27; or &#x27;braided,&#x27; a reference to the pattern of its small leaves.

Most authorities, both in Canada and the United States transliterate the English name in two words as &#x27;western redcedar&#x27;, or occasionally hyphenated as &#x27;western red-cedar&#x27;, to indicate that it is not a true cedar (&quot;Cedrus&quot;), but it also appears as &#x27;western red cedar&#x27; in some popular works. In the American horticultural trade, it is also known as the giant arborvitae, by comparison with arborvitae for its close relative &quot;T. occidentalis&quot;. Other names include giant red cedar, Pacific red cedar, shinglewood, British Columbia cedar (being the province&#x27;s official tree), canoe cedar, and red cedar. &quot;Arborvitae&quot; comes from the Latin for &#x27;tree of life&#x27;; coincidentally, Native Americans of the West Coast also address the species as &quot;long life maker&quot;.

One endonymous name for the tree is the Halkomelem word xepá:y, from the roots , meaning &#x27;scratch&#x27; or &#x27;line&#x27;, and , &#x27;bark&#x27;; the former root may be in reference to both the lined or &quot;folded/braided&quot; appearance of the bark and the tree&#x27;s ubiquity in carving and other forms of woodwork. It is called x̱ápay̓ay in the Squamish language. Further south, in the Lushootseed language, the root for red cedar is x̌payʔ and x̌payʔac refers to a red cedar tree.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Thuja plicata&quot; is among the most widespread trees in the Pacific Northwest. It is associated with Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) and western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) in most places where it grows. It grows best on moist sites in areas with a wet, maritime climate, and only occurs where precipitation exceeds annually. It grows from the Cascade Range and Coast Mountains westward to the Pacific Ocean, from central South East Alaska (near the village of Kake) to northern California (growing closer to the coast at the northern and southern extremes). A disjunct population occurs inland from central-southeast British Columbia through the Idaho Panhandle. The easternmost extent of its distribution occurs in Glacier National Park in Montana, where it is a major component of forests surrounding Lake McDonald. It is present east of the continental divide in the park, growing in a handful of small, isolated stands. It is usually found from sea level to elevations of , but grows at altitudes of up to at Crater Lake in Oregon and in Idaho.

Western redcedar grows on many types of soils. It is present on all landforms and soil classes on Vancouver Island, but is restricted to wet, low-lying areas and streamsides in the drier eastern portions of its range. Unlike its associates western hemlock and Douglas-fir, western redcedar can grow well in environments with stagnant groundwater present less than below the soil surface in the winter. It does not grow as well in areas with flowing groundwater, unlike another common associate, Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;). Western redcedars growing in the Rocky Mountains and along the eastern slope of the Washington Cascades are subject to higher mortality rates when growing on glacial till and sedimentary rocks than on other substrates. Western white pine (&quot;Pinus monticola&quot;) and Douglas-fir growing in these areas exhibit the opposite pattern, exhibiting low mortality rates on these substrates but high mortality rates on nutrient-poor metasedimentary rocks, a substrate on which western redcedar does not exhibit elevated mortality rates.

Western redcedar is less cold-tolerant than many conifer species that it shares its range with and is vulnerable to frost damage in late spring and early fall. Its northern range limit in Southeast Alaska and its upper elevational limits on Vancouver Island are controlled by temperature. In Southeast Alaska, it is absent from areas with mean summer temperatures less than . It does not grow in areas of coastal British Columbia with minimum temperatures of less than , although some interior populations experience colder temperatures.

It has been introduced to other temperate zones, including further north in Alaska, western Europe, Australia (at least as far north as Sydney), New Zealand, and higher elevations of Hawaii. The species was described as invasive in Great Britain by a 2004 survey, although it is not listed as such by the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as of September 2022. Its presence has also been recorded in Poland, where it has been identified as a potentially problematic exotic species in the Białowieża Forest.

==Ecology==
=== Use by wildlife ===
Western redcedar provides cover for bears, raccoons, skunks, and other animals which nest inside trunk cavities. It is used as a nest tree by cavity-nesting bird species such as yellow-bellied sapsuckers, hairy woodpeckers, tree swallows, chestnut-backed chickadees, and Vaux&#x27;s swifts. Pileated woodpeckers on the Olympic Peninsula prefer very large western redcedars with heart rot when selecting roosting sites, but do not use them for nesting, instead relying on Pacific silver fir (&quot;Abies amabilis&quot;) for that purpose. Old-growth valley bottom forests of western redcedar and western hemlock are the preferred habitat for white-tailed deer in the Priest River drainage of northern Idaho. The dense canopies of these forests prevent deep snow accumulation, which makes movement difficult for the deer.

The foliage, especially that of saplings, is an important food source year-round for browsing ungulates such as Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer, especially during the winter months when little else is available. Western redcedar foliage is more palatable for browsing herbivores than the commonly associated Sitka spruce and western hemlock. Browsing by introduced Sitka black-tailed deer is a major source of mortality for seedlings and saplings in old-growth forests on Haida Gwaii, where the deer lack natural predators. The presence of deer there has been linked to a decline in western redcedar recruitment. The seeds may be eaten by birds and rodents such as deer mice, but are apparently not the preferred food source for most species, possibly due to their small size or unpleasant odor. A 1937 study conducted in western Cowlitz County, Washington demonstrated a strong preference among deer mice for Douglas-fir and western hemlock seeds over western redcedar seeds. However, pine siskins apparently favor western redcedar seeds over those of Douglas-fir and western hemlock.

=== Forest succession ===
Western redcedar appears in all stages of forest succession, but as one of the most shade-tolerant species in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest it is considered to be a climax species along with western hemlock. It will readily establish and grow in the shade of other, less shade-tolerant species such as red alder (&quot;Alnus rubra&quot;), black cottonwood (&quot;Populus trichocarpa&quot;), or Douglas-fir, and prevent seedlings of those species from establishing themselves in its shade. However, western hemlock and Pacific silver fir are more tolerant of shade.

A 2010 study found that &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; growing in old-growth forests above sea level in the North Shore Mountains of British Columbia have higher growth rates than associated western hemlock and Pacific silver fir when growing underneath a closed canopy. The study also found that western redcedars do not increase their growth rates in response to canopy gap formation that occurs after the death of a mature overstory tree as much as the two other species. This result indicates that western redcedar may be less reliant on canopy gaps for recruitment than western hemlock and Pacific silver fir. Western redcedar can also reproduce vegetatively via layering, as well as branch development from fallen branches or entire trees.

On northeastern Vancouver Island, western redcedar grows along with western hemlock in relatively open-canopied forests with an understory dominated by salal (&quot;Gaultheria shallon&quot;). Another type of forest characterized by dense stands of western hemlock and Pacific silver fir with sparse understory vegetation also occurs in the area. The two forest types occur in areas with very similar environmental conditions and are separated by sharp boundaries, often less than wide. Western redcedar recruitment is nearly absent in the western hemlock-Pacific silver fir forest type, and there is no evidence of a transitional stage between the two types. It has been hypothesized that, once established, these forest types are self-sustaining and are unlikely to change unless a major disturbance occurs.

=== Fire ecology ===
It is considered to have low to moderate fire resistance, as its thin bark, shallow roots, low dense branching habit and flammable foliage offer little protection. Smaller trees are commonly killed by fire, but larger specimens often survive due to their size if they are not completely girdled. The intervals between fires within western redcedar stands tend to be very long, from 50 up to 350 years or more.

=== Pathology ===
Western redcedar shows susceptibility of varying degrees to the following soil pathogens: &quot;Armillaria ostoyae, Fomitopsis pinicola, Heterobasidion annosum, Phaeolus schweinitzii, Phellinus weirii, Rhizinia undulata,&quot; and &quot;Postia sericeomollis.&quot;

&quot;P. sericeomollis&quot; is responsible for brown cubical butt and pocket rot of cedar. It is the second-most common cause of decay in Western redcedar following &quot;P. weirii&quot;. Rather than forming a single column of decay in the heartwood, &quot;P. sericeomollis&quot; tends to cause rings or pockets of decay in the lower bole.

While Western redcedar is a host to &quot;P. weirii,&quot; the fungus which causes the disease laminated root rot, it is rated as resistant while other conifers are rated as highly susceptible or susceptible. &quot;P. weirii&quot; in Western redcedar expresses as a butt rot.

In addition to &quot;P. weirii,&quot; western redcedar is also less susceptible to &quot;H. annosum&quot; and &quot;A. ostoyae&quot; than other conifer species. Studies have found that western redcedar produces a phytochemical called thujaplicin which has been credited with granting the species its natural resistance to fungal attacks. Additional research has shown that western redcedar responds to &quot;A. ostoye&quot; infection by producing periderms and resin ducts near infection sites. Because of these natural defenses, it has been suggested that western redcedar may serve as a suitable alternative to other conifers when regenerating a site affected by these pathogens.

==== Cedar leaf blight ====
Western redcedar foliage can become infected by the ascomycete fungus &quot;Didymascella thujina&quot;, which causes cedar leaf blight. The fungus causes leaves to turn brown and does not spread between adjacent leaves through hyphae. It is present throughout the native range of western redcedar, but reproduces best when western redcedar foliage is wet for long periods of time, with minimal wind exposure. Significant variation in resistance to cedar leaf blight exists between populations of &quot;Thuja plicata&quot;; trees sourced from coastal populations exhibit higher resistance than trees from interior populations. Additional variation also occurs within populations. A study published in 2013 projected a decrease in the incidence of cedar leaf blight among western redcedars in coastal British Columbia by late 21st century as a result of warmer, drier summers due to climate change. The authors of the study conceded that they were unable to incorporate the impacts of warmer winter temperatures into their model because research on the topic was lacking at the time of their study. They hypothesized that warmer winter temperatures could result in increased incidence of cedar leaf blight and cautioned that management decisions should take this uncertainty into account.

==== Insect pathogens ====
&quot;Thuja plicata&quot; is a host to several destructive insect species such as the western cedar borer, cedar bark beetle, redcedar cone midge, and conifer seedling weevils. Redcedar cone midge (&quot;Mayetiola thujae&quot;) larvae hatch from eggs laid between the scales of immature cones, then feed on the cone scales and seeds. The application of insecticides has been used as a control measure.

===Cedar dieback attributed to climate change===

&quot;Uncommonly hot, dry weather&quot; in coastal Washington State, beginning in 2015, has been attributed as the underlying cause of a large dieback of this species that could not otherwise be attributed to any &quot;killer pest or known pathogen.&quot;

== Cultivation ==
Like its relative &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; and many other conifer species, &quot;T. plicata&quot; is grown as an ornamental tree, and for screens and hedges, throughout the world in gardens and parks. A wide variety of forms, sizes, and colors is available.

==Uses==

=== In indigenous societies ===
Western redcedar is considered the Tree of Life by many of the First Nations of the Pacific Northwest, as the tree gave them everything that they needed for life: food, water (in the form of water tight woven cedar bark baskets), clothing, medicine, transportation (their canoes made from the wood), shelter (boards of wood used to build their long houses), and spirituality (the boughs being used in many ceremonies). Some northwest coast tribes refer to themselves as &quot;people of the Red Cedar&quot; because of their extensive dependence on the tree for basic materials. The wood has been used for constructing housing and totem poles, and crafted into many objects, including masks, utensils, boxes, boards, instruments, canoes, vessels, houses, and ceremonial objects. Western redcedar is also associated with a long tradition of curing and cooking fish over the open fire. Roots and bark are used for baskets, bowls, ropes, clothing, blankets, and rings.

A huge number of archaeological finds point to the continuous use of redcedar wood in native societies. Woodworking tools dating between 8,000 and 5,000 years ago, such as carved antlers, were discovered in shell middens at the Glenrose site, near Vancouver, British Columbia. In Yuquot, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, tools dating 4,000 to 3,000 years old have been found. The Musqueam site, also near Vancouver, yielded bark baskets woven in five different styles, along with ropes and ships dated to 3,000 years ago. At Pitt River, adzes and baskets were dated around 2,900 years ago. Wooden artefacts 1000 years old were unearthed on the east coast of Vancouver Island.

Western redcedar was used extensively wherever it was found along the northwest coast (British Columbia, Washington state, parts of Alaska). Evidence of this use is found in culturally modified trees (CMTs) that are found throughout the coast. When First Nations people removed the bark from cedars, it left a scarwhich is considered a CMT. Other types of harvest (for planks, tinder, and other uses) leave different types of evidence of cultural modification.

A legend amongst the Coast Salish peoples describes the origins of the western redcedar. In this legend, there was a generous man who gave the people whatever they needed. When the Great Spirit saw this, he declared that when the generous man died, a great Red Cedar tree will grow where he is buried, and that the cedar will be useful to all the people, providing its roots for baskets, bark for clothing, and wood for shelter.

==== Tools ====
The wood was worked primarily with the adze, which was preferred over all other tools, even ones introduced by Europeans. Alexander Walker, an ensign on the fur trade ship &quot;Captain Cook&quot;, reported that the indigenous peoples used an elbow adze, which they valued over tools brought by the Europeans, such as the saw or the axe, going so far as to modify traded tools back into an adze. Tools were generally made from stone, bone, obsidian, or a harder wood such as hemlock. A variety of hand mauls, wedges, chisels, and knives are also used.

Excavations done at Ozette, Washington, turned up iron tools nearly 800 years old, far before European contact. When James Cook passed the area, he observed that almost all tools were made of iron. There has been speculation on the origin of these iron tools. Some theories include shipwrecks from East Asia or possible contact with iron-using cultures from Siberia, as hinted in the more advanced woodworking found in northern tribes such as the Tlingit.

==== Wood ====
Harvesting western redcedar required some ceremony and included propitiation of the tree&#x27;s spirits as well as those of the surrounding trees. In particular, many people specifically requested the tree and its brethren not to fall or drop heavy branches on the harvester, a situation which is mentioned in a number of different stories of people who were not sufficiently careful. Some professional loggers of Native American descent have mentioned that they offer quiet or silent propitiations to trees which they fell, following in this tradition.

Felling of large trees such as western redcedar before the introduction of steel tools was a complex and time-consuming art. Typically the bark was removed around the base of the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the cut would be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the cut would be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. A constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location.

Once the tree was felled, the work had only just begun, as it then had to be stripped and dragged down to the shore. If the tree was to become canoes, then it would often be divided into sections and worked into rough canoe shapes before transport. If it were to be used for a totem pole or building materials, it would be towed in the round to the village. Many trees are still felled in this traditional manner for use as totem poles and canoes, particularly by artists who feel that using modern tools is detrimental to the traditional spirit of the art. Non-traditionalists simply buy redcedar logs or lumber at mills or lumber yards, a practice that is commonly followed by most working in smaller sizes such as for masks and staves.

Because felling required such an extraordinary amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split off the side of the tree. Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a line of stakes.

Redcedar wood is used to make huge monoxyla canoes in which the men went out to high sea to harpoon whales and conduct trade. One of those canoes, a craft dug out about a century ago, was bought in 1901 by Captain John Voss, an adventurer. He gave her the name of Tilikum (&#x27;Relative&#x27; in Chinook jargon), rigged her, and led her in a hectic three-year voyage from British Columbia to London.

Redcedar branches are very flexible and have good tensile strength. They were stripped and used as strong cords for fishing line, nets, rope cores, twine, and other purposes where bark cord was not strong enough or might fray. Both the branches and bark rope have been replaced by modern fiber and nylon cordage among the aboriginal northwest coast peoples, though the bark is still in use for the other purposes mentioned above.

==== Bark ====
At the right time of year, the bark is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is harvested for use in making mats, rope and cordage, basketry, rain hats, clothing, and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care, as stripping too much bark will kill the tree. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees that have not been stripped before. After harvesting, the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started with a series of cuts at the base of the tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since western redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks. It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing ten meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods.

Today bark rope making is a lost art in many communities, although it is still practiced for decoration or art in a few places. Other uses of bark are still common for artistic or practical purposes. In recent years there has been a revival of cedar weaving in some communities, and along with it, new forms of cedar bark products. For example, in some recent weddings cedar roses are used to decorate the tables.

===Timber===
The soft red-brown timber has a tight, straight grain and few knots. It is valued for its distinct appearance, aroma, and its high natural resistance to decay, being extensively used for outdoor construction in the form of posts, decking, shingles, and siding. It is commonly used for the framing and longwood in lightweight sail boats and kayaks. In larger boats it is often used in sandwich construction between two layers of epoxy resin and/or fiberglass or similar products. Due to its light weight driedit is about 30% lighter than common boat building woods, such as mahogany. For its weight it is quite strong but can be brittle. It glues well with epoxy resin or resorcinol adhesive.

Its light weight, strength, and dark, warm sound make it a popular choice for guitar soundboards, particularly among European guitar builders such as Lowden and Furch.

Western redcedar wood is export-restricted in the United States. The tree is highly allergenic and woodworkers or loggers who work with it may have adverse reactions, including the development of occupational asthma, exacerbation of existing asthma, reduction of lung function, and eye irritation. Approximately 5% of workers are allergic to western redcedar. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit for western redcedar dust of 2.5 mg/m3 as a time-weighted average over eight hours.

=== Essential oil ===
The essential oil of western redcedar leaves contains natural compounds, such as α-thujone, β-thujone, fenchone, sabinene, terpinen-4-ol and beyerene, which have also been isolated from different other essential oils. Some of these substances are aroma compounds and are used in perfumery. Thujones are GABAA receptor competitive antagonists, but do not have any pharmacological use due to their high toxicity and convulsive activity.
=== Other uses ===
It is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making beehive components.

Its bark has been studied for applications in polyurethane.

Used in the construction of windows and doors (joinery grade timber).

Western red cedar is still highly valued as &quot;tonewood&quot; for stringed instruments&#x27; sound boards.

==Notable specimens==
The largest living specimen is the Cheewhat Giant, in Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on Vancouver Island, at , with a diameter of 5.8 m (19 ft). The tallest well-documented individual is called Whisky Creek Cedar II in Qualicum Beach, on Vancouver Island. It stands in height, although even taller ones are known to exist. The &#x27;Quinault Lake Redcedar&#x27; was the largest known western redcedar in the world, with a wood volume of . Located near the northwest shore of Lake Quinault north of Aberdeen, Washington, about from the Pacific Ocean, it was one-third the volume of the largest known tree, a giant sequoia named &#x27;General Sherman&#x27;. The Quinault Lake Redcedar was tall with a diameter of at breast height. The Quinault Lake Redcedar was destroyed by a series of storms in 2014 and 2016 and is now only a stump. The fifth-largest known was the Kalaloch Cedar in Olympic National Park, at , until it was destroyed by a storm in March 2014.

A redcedar over tall, in diameter, and over 700 years old stood in Cathedral Grove on Vancouver Island before it was set on fire and destroyed by vandals in 1972. That tree now lies in &quot;Giant&#x27;s Grave&quot;, a self-dug &#x27;grave&#x27; created by the force of its own impact. A specimen measuring diameter and tall on the Giant Red Cedar National Recreation Trail in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests is designated the &quot;Champion Tree of Idaho&quot;.

The Giant Cedar Stump is an ancient redcedar turned roadside attraction in Snohomish County, Washington.

<text>Water conservation aims to sustainably manage the natural resource of fresh water, protect the hydrosphere, and meet current and future human demand. Water conservation makes it possible to avoid water scarcity. It covers all the policies, strategies and activities to reach these aims. Population, household size and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used. 

Climate change and other factors have increased pressure on natural water resources. This is especially the case in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation. Many countries have successfully implemented policies to conserve water conservation. There are several key activities to conserve water. One is beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources. Another is avoiding any damage to water quality. A third is improving water management practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water. 

Technology solutions exist for households, commercial and agricultural applications to reduce the . Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal water utilities or regional governments.

==Aims==
The aims of water conservation efforts include:
* With less than 1% of the worlds water being freshwater, one aim is ensuring the availability of water for future generations where the withdrawal of freshwater from an ecosystem does not exceed its natural replacement rate.
* Energy conservation as water pumping, delivery, and wastewater treatment facilities consume a significant amount of energy. In some regions of the world, over 15% of the total electricity consumption is devoted to water management.
* Habitat conservation where minimizing human water usage helps to preserve freshwater habitats for local wildlife and migrating waterfowl, but also water quality.

==Strategies==
The key activities to conserve water are as follows:
*Any beneficial reduction in water loss, use and waste of resources.
*Avoiding any damage to water quality.
*Improving water management practices that reduce the use or enhance the beneficial use of water.
One of the strategies in water conservation is rainwater harvesting. Digging ponds, lakes, canals, expanding the water reservoir, and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water. Many people in many countries keep clean containers so they can boil it and drink it, which is useful to supply water to the needy. Harvested and filtered rain water can be used for toilets, home gardening, lawn irrigation, and small scale agriculture.

Another strategy in water conservation is protecting groundwater resources. When precipitation occurs, some infiltrates the soil and goes underground. Water in this saturation zone is called groundwater. Contamination of groundwater causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as a resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can take years to replenish. Some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks, septic systems, uncontrolled hazardous waste, landfills, atmospheric contaminants, chemicals, and road salts. Contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources from contamination is an important aspect of water conservation.

An additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources. Groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams. Excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource. Ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and, in extreme examples, diminish the water supply of lakes, rivers, and streams. In coastal regions, over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of groundwater water supply. Sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation.

A fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs. Developing communication that educates science to land managers, policy makers, farmers, and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation. Communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action.

The conservation of water is extremely important in order to preserve wildlife habitats. There are many organisms in temperate regions who are affected by shortages in water. Additionally, many freshwater organisms are increasingly feeling the impacts of water pollution as it disrupts the ecosystem.

&quot;World Water Day&quot; is celebrated on 22 March.

==Social solutions==

Water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level, by either municipal water utilities or regional governments. Common strategies include public outreach campaigns, tiered water rates (charging progressively higher prices as water use increases), or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing. Cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of xeriscaping or natural landscaping in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage. Most urban outdoor water use in California is residential, illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses.

One fundamental conservation goal is universal water metering. The prevalence of residential water metering varies significantly worldwide. Recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30% of UK households. Although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings, the US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent. In addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use, metering is also an important way to identify and localize water leakage. Water metering might benefit society by providing a financial incentive to avoid waste in water use.

Some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers, in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world&#x27;s fresh water use. The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common. Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force farmers to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.

New technology poses a few new options for consumers, features such as full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste. It is also possible to use/&quot;pollute&quot; the water in stages (keeping use in flush toilets for last), hereby allowing more use of the water for various tasks within a same cycle (before it needs to be purified again, which can also be done in-situ). Earthships often use such a setup.

Also available are modern shower heads that help reduce wasting water: Old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute, while new fixtures available use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage.
Another method is to recycle the water of the shower directly, by means a semi-closed system which features a pump and filter. Such a setup (called a &quot;water recycling shower&quot;) has also been employed at the VIRTUe LINQ house. Besides recycling water, it also reuses the heat of the water (which would otherwise be lost).

Contrary to the popular view that the most effective way to save water is to curtail water-using behavior (e.g., by taking shorter showers), experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers; as demonstrated by two household end use logging studies in the US.

Water-saving technology for the home includes:
*Low-flow shower heads sometimes called energy-efficient shower heads as they also use less energy
*Low-flush toilets, composting toilets, and incinerating toilets. Composting toilets have a dramatic impact in the developed world, as conventional Western flush toilets use large volumes of water
*Dual flush toilets include two buttons or handles to flush different levels of water. Dual flush toilets use up to 67% less water than conventional toilets
*Faucet aerators, which break water flow into fine droplets to maintain &quot;wetting effectiveness&quot; while using less water. An additional benefit is that they reduce splashing while washing hands and dishes
*Raw water flushing where toilets use sea water or non-purified water (i.e. greywater)
*Wastewater reuse or recycling systems, allowing:
**Reuse of greywater for flushing toilets or watering gardens
**Recycling of wastewater through purification at a water treatment plant. &quot;See also Wastewater - Reuse&quot;
*Rainwater harvesting
*High-efficiency clothes washers
*Weather-based irrigation controllers
*Garden hose nozzles that shut off the water when it is not being used, instead of letting a hose run.
*Low flow taps in wash basins
*Swimming pool covers that reduce evaporation and can warm pool water to reduce water, energy and chemical costs.
*Automatic faucet is a water conservation faucet that eliminates water waste at the faucet. It automates the use of faucets without the use of hands.
Smart water meters are also a promising technology for reducing household water usage. A study conducted in Valencia, Spain, shows the potential that smart meter-based water consumption feedback has for conserving water in households. The findings showed that households that were equipped with smart water meters increased their water savings. This technology works to show people how much water they were using in their household, suggest ways they can reduce water usage, and incentivize water savings with physical rewards.

=== Applications===
Many water-saving devices (such as low-flush toilets) that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving. Other water-saving technology for businesses includes:
*Waterless urinals (also can be installed in schools)
*Waterless car washes
*Infrared or foot-operated taps, which can save water by using short bursts of water for rinsing in a kitchen or bathroom
*Pressurized waterbrooms, which can be used instead of a hose to clean sidewalks
*X-ray film processor re-circulation systems
*Cooling tower conductivity controllers
*Water-saving steam sterilizers, for use in hospitals and health care facilities
*Rainwater harvesting
*Water-to-water heat exchangers.
It is important to consider implementing water-conserving changes to industrial and commercial application use. It was found that high-income countries use roughly 59% of their water for industrial usage while low-income countries use 8% for industrial usage. One big change that industrial and commercial companies can implement are to improve the assessment and maintenance of water systems. It is easy to add water-efficient applications but it is the proper maintenance and inspection of it which will lead to long-term changes. A water conservation plan can be created, including adding various goals and benchmarks for both the employees and the company. Another change that industrial and commercial companies can make are to check water-consuming systems at regular intervals for any leaks or problems. By doing this, it will ensure that water is not unnecessarily being lost and there is no excess money being spent on utility bills. A third change that industrial and commercial companies can implement is installing a rain sensor. This sensor should be able to detect when precipitation is occurring and stop the program which would normally irrigate the land. After the rain ends, the sensor should turn the program back on and resume to its normal watering cycle.

===Agricultural applications===

Water is an essential part of irrigation. Plants always take a lot of ground water thus ground water should be replenished. For crop irrigation, optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation, runoff, or subsurface drainage while maximizing production. An evaporation pan in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements. Flood irrigation, the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts. Overhead irrigation, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern. Drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses. However, drip irrigation is increasingly affordable, especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates. Using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions. There are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation.

As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system. This may include chiselling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules. Usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report notes that &quot;[i]mproved soil organic matter from the use of green manures, mulching, and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains&quot;, which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season.

As seen in China, plastic mulch also has the potential to conserve water in agricultural practices. The &quot;mulch&quot; is really a thin sheet of plastic that is placed over the soil. There are holes in the plastic for the plants to grow through. Some studies have shown that plastic mulch conserves water by reducing the evaporation of soil moisture, however, there haven&#x27;t been enough applied studies to determine the total water savings that this practice may bring about.

===Water reuse===
Water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage. More than 40% of the world&#x27;s population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply. The imbalance between supply and demand, along with persisting issues such as climate change and population growth, has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water. There are a variety of methods used in the treatment of waste water to ensure that it is safe to use for irrigation of food crops and/or drinking water.

Seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water. Despite this, many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world. This makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology. Current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination.

Sand filtration is another method used to treat water. Recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements, but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water. Sand filtration is very effective at removing protozoa and bacteria, but struggles with removing viruses. Large-scale sand filtration facilities also require large surface areas to accommodate them.

The removal of pathogens from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans. The levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations. Further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater.

===Wasting of water===

Wasting water is the flip side of water conservation, and in household applications, it means causing or permitting water discharge without any practical purpose. Inefficient water use is also considered wasteful. According to EPA estimate, household leaks in the US can waste approximately 900 billion gallons (3.4 billion cubic meters) of water annually nationwide. Generally, water management agencies are reluctant or unwilling to give a concrete definition to a relatively vague concept of water waste.

However, definition of water waste is often given in local drought emergency ordinances. One example refers to any acts or omissions, whether willful or negligent, that are &quot;causing or permitting water to leak, discharge, flow or run to waste into any gutter, sanitary sewer, watercourse or public or private storm drain, or to any adjacent property, from any tap, hose, faucet, pipe, sprinkler, pond, pool, waterway, fountain or nozzle.&quot; In this example, the city code also clarifies that &quot;in the case of washing, &quot;discharge,&quot; &quot;flow&quot; or &quot;run to waste&quot; means that water in excess of that necessary to wash, wet or clean the dirty or dusty object, such as an automobile, sidewalk, or parking area, flows to waste.

Water utilities (and other media sources) often provide listings of wasteful water-use practices and prohibitions of wasteful uses. Examples include utilities in San Antonio, Texas. Las Vegas, Nevada, California Water Service company in California, and City of San Diego, California. The City of Palo Alto in California enforces permanent water use restrictions on wasteful practices such as leaks, runoff, irrigating during and immediately after rainfall, and use of potable water when non-potable water is available. Similar restrictions are in effect in the State of Victoria, Australia. Temporary water use bans (also known as &quot;hosepipe bans&quot;) are used in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Strictly speaking, water that is discharged into the sewer, or directly to the environment is not wasted or lost. It remains within the hydrologic cycle and returns to the land surface and surface water bodies as precipitation. However, in many cases, the source of the water is at a significant distance from the return point and may be in a different catchment. The separation between extraction point and return point can represent significant environmental degradation in the watercourse and riparian strip. What is &quot;wasted&quot; is the community&#x27;s supply of water that was captured, stored, transported and treated to drinking quality standards. Efficient use of water saves the expense of water supply provision and leaves more fresh water in lakes, rivers and aquifers for other users and also for supporting ecosystems. For example, we should not treat toilet as a trash can. If we flush cigarette butts or tissues in it, we are wasting gallons of water. Because the process of recycling water cannot be accomplished.

A concept that is closely related to water wasting is &quot;water-use efficiency&quot;. Water use is considered inefficient if the same purpose of its use can be accomplished with less water. Technical efficiency derives from engineering practice where it is typically used to describe the ratio of output to input and is useful in comparing various products and processes. For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). The technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured in value terms. This expression of efficiency is referred to as economic efficiency and is incorporated into the concept of water conservation.

<text>Thuja occidentalis, also known as northern white-cedar, eastern white-cedar, or arborvitae, is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to eastern Canada and much of the north-central and northeastern United States. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is not to be confused with &quot;Juniperus virginiana&quot; (eastern red cedar).

== Common names ==
Its additional common names include swamp cedar, American arborvitae, and eastern arborvitae. The name arborvitae is particularly used in the horticultural trade in the United States; it is Latin for &#x27;tree of life&#x27; – due to the supposed medicinal properties of the sap, bark, and twigs. It is sometimes called white-cedar (hyphenated) or whitecedar (one word) to distinguish it from &quot;Cedrus&quot;, the true cedars.

==Description==
Unlike the closely related western red cedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), northern white cedar is only a small or medium-sized tree, growing to a height of tall with a trunk diameter, exceptionally to tall and diameter. The tree is often stunted or prostrate in less favorable locations. The bark is red-brown, furrowed and peels in narrow, longitudinal strips.
Northern white cedar has fan-like branches and scaly leaves. The foliage forms in flat sprays with scale-like leaves long.

The seed cones are slender, yellow-green, ripening to brown, long and broad, with six to eight overlapping scales. They contain about eight seeds each. The branches may take root if the tree falls.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Over 30 synonyms are listed in Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online database.

==Distribution==
Northern white cedar is native to an area in the southern part of eastern Canada and the adjacent part of the northern United States. It extends from southeastern Manitoba east throughout the Great Lakes region and into Ontario, Québec, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Isolated populations occur in west-central Manitoba, and to the south in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois and in the Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. In Canada, its range reaches the Arctic treeline and the southern tip of Hudson Bay. It grows mainly in places with cooler summers, with a typical temperature of in July, and a shorter growing season, from 90 to 180 days.

==Ecology==
Northern white cedar grows naturally in wet forests, being particularly abundant in coniferous swamps, where other larger and faster-growing trees cannot compete successfully. It also occurs on other sites with reduced tree competition, such as cliffs. Although not currently listed as endangered, wild white cedar populations are threatened in many areas by high deer numbers; deer find the soft evergreen foliage a very attractive winter food and strip it rapidly. The largest known specimen is tall and diameter, on South Manitou Island within Leelanau County, Michigan.
Northern white cedars can be very long-lived trees in certain conditions, with notably old specimens growing on cliffs where they are inaccessible to deer and wildfire. As of 2008, the oldest known living specimen was 1,141 years old, but a dead specimen with 1,653 growth rings has been found. Despite their age, these very old trees are small and stunted due to the difficult growing conditions. These individuals&#x27; long lifespans have been attributed to their slow growth and their ability to survive when different sections of the tree are damaged or killed. The Witch Tree, a &quot;T. occidentalis&quot; growing out of a cliff face on Lake Superior in Minnesota, was described by the French explorer Sieur de la Verendrye as being a mature tree in 1731; it is still alive today.
Specimens found growing on cliff faces in southern Ontario are the oldest trees in Eastern North America and all of Canada, having achieved ages in excess of 1,653 years.

==Uses==
&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; is commercially used for rustic fencing and posts, lumber, poles, shingles, and in the construction of log cabins. It is the preferred wood for the structural elements, such as ribs and planking, of birchbark canoes and the planking of wooden canoes.

The essential oil within the plant has been used for cleansers, disinfectants, hair preparations, insecticides, liniment, room sprays, and soft soaps. The Ojibwa reportedly made a soup from the inner bark of the soft twigs. Others have used the twigs to make teas to relieve constipation and headache.

Eastern white cedar – as arborvitae – is a popular ornamental plant used in both residential and commercial landscapes.

&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot; has important uses in traditional Ojibwe culture. Honoured with the name Nookomis Giizhik (Grandmother Cedar), the tree is the subject of sacred legends and is considered a gift to humanity for its myriad of uses, among them crafts, construction, and medicine. It is one of the four plants of the Ojibwe medicine wheel, associated with the north. The foliage is rich in vitamin C and is believed to be the annedda, which cured the scurvy of Jacques Cartier and his party in the winter of 1535–1536. Due to the presence of the neurotoxic compound thujone, internal use can be harmful if used for prolonged periods or while pregnant.

==Cultivation==

&quot;T. occidentalis&quot; is widely used as an ornamental tree, particularly for screens and hedges, in gardens, parks, and cemeteries. Over 300 cultivars exist, showing great variation in colour, shape, and size, with some of the more common ones being &#x27;Degroot&#x27;s Spire&#x27;, &#x27;Ellwangeriana&#x27;, &#x27;Hetz Wintergreen&#x27;, &#x27;Lutea&#x27;, &#x27;Rheingold&#x27;, &#x27;Smaragd&#x27; (or &#x27;Emerald Green&#x27;), &#x27;Techny&#x27;, and &#x27;Wareana&#x27;. It was introduced into Europe as early as 1540.
These cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

<text>Aylesbury Grammar School is an 11–18 boys grammar school in Aylesbury, in the English county of Buckinghamshire, which educates approximately 1300 boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ags.bucks.sch.uk/node/4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1598 by Sir Henry Lee, Champion of Queen Elizabeth I, Aylesbury Grammar School celebrated 100 years on its current site in Walton Road in 2007. It is commonly referred to by its students, staff and others in the local area by the abbreviation &quot;AGS&quot;.

==History==
===Establishment===

Aylesbury Grammar School was founded in 1598 following a bequest from Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, the Champion of Queen Elizabeth I, and its first home was in St Mary&#x27;s Church in Aylesbury. In 1714, Henry Phillips left a sum of £5,000 for the purchase of lands of inheritance for the enlargement and further provision for the Free School in Aylesbury. The money left was to be used to admit a total of 120 boys to be taught gratis, with the school building to be furnished with books, pens, ink and paper. Ten trustees were appointed by the High Court in 1717, becoming the first trustees of what is now the Aylesbury Grammar School Foundation. By the mid-1880s, inadequacies on the school site were becoming more apparent, with a particular issue arising from the lack of games facilities. Additionally, the old buildings of the school were beginning to decay, and suggestions were made that fees of £4 to £6 might be charged with provision of scholarships for poorer boys on grounds of merit from public elementary schools of the district to assist in fundraising to deal with the inadequacies that school was facing. 

===New site, 1907===

In the years that followed, the school moved to a new site in 1907 which is now home to the County Museum, following the school&#x27;s move to its third location on its present site. In May 1907, Aylesbury Grammar School moved to its current location on Walton Road, Aylesbury and the new premises, designed by local architect Fred Taylor A.R.I.B.A, were welcomed to cope with the ever-expanding numbers of students. The guest of honour at the opening ceremony was Lord Rothschild who had offered the land for purchase to Buckinghamshire County Council to build the school. As a condition of a grant from the Council to assist in constructing the new buildings both boys and girls were admitted to the new school.

For a considerable amount of years, the school was a co–educational independent school until 1952 when it became a voluntary controlled schools. Girls were removed from the school in 1959 and moved to a new site, with the girls school becoming known as Aylesbury High School. Concerts, plays and theatre visits help links to be maintained between Aylesbury Grammar School for boys, and the High School for girls. 

In December 1953 damage was caused by a fire, later attributed to faulty electrical wiring. The school fully reopened in the Easter of 1954. The damaged roof was replaced and a new hall, entrance area and classrooms were constructed. 

===Recent history===

The school was a boys&#x27; school from its foundation in 1598 until 1907, when the school relocated to a new site on Walton Road, where it remains to this day. A condition for receiving funding for the new premises was that the school should become co-educational. However, in the mid-1950s the school was rapidly outgrowing its site and so plans for a new school were made; the Council decided to reinstate AGS&#x27;s single-sex status and in 1959 the girls of Aylesbury Grammar School moved into their new school on the opposite side of the road, now called Aylesbury High School.

The current Headmaster is Mark Sturgeon, who took over from Stephen Lehec at the start of the 2014–15 academic year.

On 9 May 2014, boys at the school dressed up as the Jamaican bobsleigh team for their school-leaving celebrations and &#x27;blacked up&#x27; as part of their costume. This came to public attention when an image of the schoolboys was tweeted by the then headmaster Stephen Lehec and was criticised for being racist. Lehec issued a formal apology, though in his analysis &#x27;at no time was there an undertone of any act being of a derogatory or racist nature&#x27;. The matter was widely reported in local and national media.

==Background==
===Admissions===

As a selective state school, AGS&#x27;s entry requirements are dictated by the Buckinghamshire Transfer Test, formerly known as the &#x27;11-plus&#x27;. The school also takes students from outside the catchment area or out-of-county locations such as Thame and Milton Keynes, if spaces remain after all qualified in-catchment candidates have taken up their places. The school educates boys from the age of 11, in Year 7, through to the age of 18, in Year 13. The school has its largest intakes at Year 7 followed by Year 12.

The school is situated east of Aylesbury town centre on the southern side of the A41, between Walton (to the west) and Victoria Park (to the east). This site was built and opened in 1907, replacing an earlier building in St. Mary&#x27;s Square in the town centre, which now forms part of the Buckinghamshire Museum.

===Specialist status===
In September 1997 the school was awarded specialist school status in Technology, and later successfully gained Science College status as its primary specialism. In April 2006 AGS gained a second college status as a Language College and then gained a second secondary college status in Maths and Computing in January 2008. The Specialist School programme was ended by the Government in 2010.

===Academy status===
In July 2011 the school became an Academy.

==Academic performance==

In 2009, the school achieved the highest A-level results in Buckinghamshire. Following a report conducted by OFSTED in November 2022, the school was ranked as &quot;outstanding&quot; in all areas, with inspectors claiming that &quot;pupils flourish in this outstanding school&quot;. Behaviour displayed by boys attending the school was praised, as was the manner in which the boys conduct themselves and their attitudes they apply to their learning. 

Academic attainment results published by the school in 2023 found that 99.5% of boys attending the school achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grades 9 - 4, whilst 78% of boys achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grades 9 - 7. 45% of all boys who were entered for GCSE examinations were graded 9-8, above the National average which stood at 12%.

<doc id="460263" wikidata="Q186035" url="?curid=460263" title="Contemporary dance">
<text>Contemporary dance is a genre of dance performance that developed during the mid-twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominant genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical, modern, and jazz styles, it has come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance. According to the New Grove Musical Dictionary, contemporary dance evolved from the foundations of modern and postmodern dance, emphasizing innovation and a break from traditional forms. Due to its technical similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet, and other classical concert dance styles. It is characterized by a blend of styles that often integrate elements of ballet, modern dance, and cultural or social dance forms.

In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance. Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. In the 1980s, the approach to contemporary dance became more intentional and academically focused, often described as “interdisciplinary” and “collaborative.” This period marked a shift from spontaneous and experimental methods to choreographies grounded in intellectual concepts, such as mathematical structures and repetitive patterns. Contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance, Butoh. Contemporary dance continues to explore natural movement while embracing diverse influences and unconventional staging.

Additionally, contemporary dance also examines the concepts of choreography and dramaturgy. The distinction between composition and improvisation, as well as between finished works and ongoing processes, is collapsed in the style of contemporary dance. This dissolution between previously rigid distinctions parallels broader cultural shifts from what scholar Gabrielle Klein calls the &quot;linguistic turn,&quot; which treated dance as a form of text and choreography as a structured linguistic system, to the subsequent &quot;performative turn&quot; which critiques representational practices and introduces new themes central to contemporary choreography. These themes include liveness, immediacy, authenticity, identity, and the interplay between presence and absence. As a result, contemporary dance works have become platforms for exploring complex themes, such as the unrepresentable and intangible aspects of human existence, which are difficult to represent using traditional and classical movement forms.

==History==
Contemporary dance draws on both classical ballet and modern dance, whereas postmodern dance was a direct and opposite response to modern dance. Merce Cunningham is considered to be the first choreographer to &quot;develop an independent attitude towards modern dance&quot; and defy the ideas that were established by it. In 1944 Cunningham accompanied his dance with music by John Cage, who observed that Cunningham&#x27;s dance &quot;no longer relies on linear elements (...) nor does it rely on a movement towards and away from climax. As in abstract painting, it is assumed that an element (a movement, a sound, a change of light) is in and of itself expressive; what it communicates is in large part determined by the observer themselves.&quot; Cunningham formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in 1953 and went on to create more than one hundred and fifty works for the company, many of which have been performed internationally by ballet and modern dance companies.

Additionally, the emergence of Tanztheater, German for “dance theater,” pushed contemporary dance beyond traditional performance boundaries. This genre incorporated everyday movements and blurred the distinction between art and daily life. Tanztheater steered contemporary dance away from linear narratives toward fragmented and montage-like choreography, giving rise to a style marked by disjointed &quot;dance pieces&quot; rather than narrative styles.

==Cunningham&#x27;s key ideas==
Cunningham&#x27;s key ideas include-
* Contemporary dance does refuse the classical ballet&#x27;s leg technique in favour of modern dance&#x27;s stress on the torso
* Contemporary dance is not necessarily narrative form of art
* Choreography that appears disordered, but nevertheless relies on technique
* Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction 
* Multiple and simultaneous actions
* Suspension of perspective and symmetry in ballet scenic frame perspective such as front, center, and hierarchies
* Creative freedom
* Independence between dance and music
* Dance to be danced, not analyzed
* Innovative lighting, sets, and costumes in collaboration with Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns

Other pioneers of contemporary dance (the offspring of modern and postmodern) include Ruth St. Denis, Doris Humphrey, Mary Wigman, Pina Bausch, Francois Delsarte, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, Paul Taylor, Rudolph von Laban, Loie Fuller, José Limón, Marie Rambert, and Trisha Brown.

==Choreographer&#x27;s role==
There is usually a choreographer who makes the creative decisions and decides whether the piece is an abstract or a narrative one. Dancers are selected based on their skill and training. The choreography is determined based on its relation to the music or sounds that is danced to. The role of music in contemporary dance is different from in other genres because it can serve as a backdrop to the piece. The choreographer has control over the costumes and their aesthetic value for the overall composition of the performance and also in regards to how they influence dancers’ movements.

==Dance technique==

Post-structuralist thought has significantly influenced contemporary dance. This influence has led to a deeper exploration of the dancer’s primary medium, the body, which sparked the development and integration of innovative movement techniques. Dance techniques and movement philosophies employed in contemporary dance may include Contemporary ballet, Dance improvisation, Interpretive dance, Lyrical dance, Modern dance styles from United States such as Graham technique, Humphrey-Weidman technique and Horton technique, Modern dance of Europe Bartenieff Fundamentals and the dance technique of Isadora Duncan (also see Free dance). 

Contemporary dancers train using contemporary dance techniques as well as non-dance related practices such as Pilates, Yoga, the acting practice of Corporeal mime - Étienne Decroux technique and somatic practices such as Alexander technique, Feldenkrais Method, Sullivan Technique and Franklin-Methode, American contemporary techniques such as José Limón technique and Hawkins technique and Postmodern dance techniques such as Contact improvisation and Cunningham technique, and Release technique.

Some well-known choreographers and creators of contemporary dance created schools and techniques of their own. Paul Taylor developed a dance technique called Taylor technique, which is now taught at modern dance schools like The Ailey School in New York City.

Additionally, choreographers like William Forsythe developed techniques that deconstructed classical dance vocabulary and expanded both the technical and conceptual possibilities of contemporary dance. According to the International Encyclopedia of Dance, William Forsythe has established a framework for his conceptual ballets which do not conform to a fixed style but instead integrate elements from various trends in contemporary art and thought. His productions utilize language, song, film, video, sculpture, and electronic sounds, as well as amplified noises generated by the dancers. His choreography incorporates academic dance terminology that imparts a classical quality to all of his works, even his most experimental pieces. William Forsythe has cited Rudolf Laban and his Space Harmony movement as an artistic influence, although his ballet technique is significantly shaped by George Balanchine. Through the combination of these influences, William Forsythe has developed a technique of dance characterized by its fragmented nature, which further expounds the subtle differences and interconnectedness of modern, postmodern, and contemporary dance.

==Dance and technology==
Reflecting the situation in society at large, contemporary dance is increasingly incorporating overtly technological elements, and, in particular, robots. Robotics engineer/dancer Amy LaViers, for example, has incorporated cell phones in a contemporary dance piece calling attention to the issues surrounding our ever-increasing dependence on technology.

<text>Linfield University is a private liberal arts college with campuses in McMinnville, and Portland, Oregon. Linfield Wildcats athletics participate in the NCAA Division III Northwest Conference. Linfield reported a total of 1,755 students after the fall 2022 census date. The institution officially changed its name from Linfield College to Linfield University, effective July 1, 2020.

==History==
=== The 1800s ===
Linfield traces its history back to the earliest days of Oregon Territory, when pioneer Baptists in Oregon City created the Oregon Baptist Educational Society in 1848. This society was organized to establish a Baptist school in the region, which began as Oregon City College in 1849. In 1855, Sebastian C. Adams began to agitate for a school in McMinnville. Adams and his associates were members of the Christian Church, and so the school became a Christian School. To begin, of property were donated by W. T. Newby and a group was formed to establish the school. The group included William Dawson, James McBride, Newby, and Adams, and they bore the major part of the expenses of starting the school. These men built a building and convinced Adams, who was a teacher, to operate the school. After about a year and a half and because of the difficulty of running the school alone and funding problems, Adams suggested that the school be turned over to the Baptists who were attempting to start up the West Union Institute that had been chartered in 1858 by the Oregon Territorial Legislature. The Adams group imposed the condition that the Baptists keep at least one professor employed continuously in the college department. Other accounts indicate that the Baptist group purchased the land in 1857 in order to start their school.
The Oregon Territorial Legislature chartered the Baptist College at McMinnville in 1858. The school later became McMinnville College in 1898.
=== The 1900s ===
In 1922, the name was changed to Linfield College in memory of a Baptist minister, the Rev. George Fisher Linfield whose widow, Frances Eleanor Ross Linfield, gave a substantial donation to the college to promote Christian education and as a memorial to her late husband. Mrs. Linfield served as Dean of Women from 1921 to 1928, and sat on the Board of Directors from 1922 to her death in 1940. Her gift included real estate in Spokane, Washington, valued at $250,000 (a sum worth nearly $4 million in 2020). In his 1938 book, &quot;Bricks Without Straw: The Story of Linfield College&quot;, Professor Jonas A. &quot;Steine&quot; Jonasson quotes from the minutes of the college&#x27;s board of trustees to explain Mrs. Linfield&#x27;s motivation for her large land gift to the college: &quot;Mrs. Linfield&#x27;s dual purpose in making the gift to McMinnville College was to &#x27;perpetuate the name, scholarly attainments and Christian influence of her late husband, Rev. George Fisher Linfield, and to promote the cause of Christian education.

In 1982, the Linfield-Good Samaritan School of Nursing was established when the college entered into an affiliation with Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital &amp; Medical Center and began offering a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in nursing. 

=== The 2000s ===
Linfield offered buyouts to 13 professors in liberal-arts programs with shrinking enrollment in 2019, shortly after President Miles K. Davis arrived. He also announced efforts to shift resources to the nursing and business programs, which account for the majority of students. Those shifts led to strained relationships with some faculty members in the traditional liberals arts disciplines.

Following sexual abuse charges against a former trustee that involved students in 2017 and 2019, faculty members voted 88 to 18 on a motion of no confidence in David C. Baca, the chair of the college&#x27;s board of trustees, in May 2020. The board continued to support Baca who offered to resign. Students then circulated a petition calling for Baca to step down from his position. An outside agency also investigated a claim made by a faculty member of &quot;inappropriate touching&quot; by two trustees.

The school officially changed its name to Linfield University, effective on July 1, 2020. Along with the new name, Linfield unveiled a new logo and seal for the institution. The logo bears the letter &quot;L&quot; inside an acorn with oak leaves. According to the website, Linfield has used an image of an acorn in its logo since 2010. &quot;Linfield has used an image of an acorn as part of its logo design since 2010, and a representation of an oak leaf in years previous to that.&quot;

In April 2021, President Miles K. Davis was accused by several faculty members of making anti-Semitic remarks. Davis denied the allegations in a letter to the Anti-Defamation League, which has suggested an investigation into the claims as well as anti-Semitism and bias training for institutional leaders. An earlier investigation into alleged remarks by Davis substantiated one allegation but was unable to confirm the other claims. One of the faculty members filed a complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, claiming religious retaliation and harassment by Davis and Baca. On April 19, 2021, faculty members passed a resolution of no confidence in Davis and Baca, and called for their resignations. The college fired one of the whistleblowers, a Jewish tenured professor, Daniel Pollack-Pelzner, who filed a lawsuit against the school. Due in part to the termination of Pollack-Pelzner&#x27;s employment, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) censured Linfield for, in the AAUP&#x27;s opinion, not respecting Pollack-Pelzner&#x27;s academic freedom and not following institutional policies. In February, 2023, Linfield reached a $1 million settlement with the fired professor.

In September 2021, Baca stepped down as chair of the board of trustees.

In November, 2023, Davis announced his intention to resign in early 2024. Rebecca L. Johnson was appointed interim president on December 26, 2023. Mark Blegen will become president effective July 1, 2025.

== Campuses ==

=== McMinnville campus ===
Linfield&#x27;s primary location in McMinnville, Oregon, moved to its present location in 1881. The original location was at 5th and C Street closer to downtown McMinnville. From a marker on the present campus: &quot;...The board of Trustees met on August 2, 1881 and took action which resulted in moving (McMinnville) Linfield College from 5th &amp; C streets to its present location, actuated by the gift of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Samuel Cozine.&quot; Pioneer Hall, the oldest building at Linfield University, opened in 1883 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the late 1990s, the institution acquired a former Hewlett-Packard property adjacent to the McMinnville campus, which more than doubled the size of the campus and opened new opportunities for the school.

The McMinnville campus currently sits at 189 acres and houses the College of Arts and Sciences and School of Business.

=== Portland campus ===
Linfield&#x27;s presence in Portland, Oregon, began in 1982. In response to a national trend for nursing education to be a part of colleges and universities, the Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing became the Linfield-Good Samaritan School of Nursing under the auspices of Linfield College.

Founded by Emily Loveridge in 1890, the Good Samaritan Hospital Diploma School of Nursing was the first school of nursing in the Northwest. Loveridge served Good Samaritan Hospital for 40 years and is considered a pioneer in nursing. The Linfield-Good Samaritan School of Nursing remains the longest running nursing school in the Northwest.

The original campus for the Linfield-Good Samaritan School of Nursing was adjacent to the Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital and Medical Center in Northwest Portland. In February 2021, Linfield opened a 20-acre campus in northeast Portland, acquired from the University of Western States, to house its nursing school.

== Events ==

=== Camas Festival ===
The annual Camas Festival started in 2021 and is held during the first weekend of May. Linfield started the festival in partnership with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Yamhill Watershed Council to celebrate camas, or camassia plant, which was once prolific in the region and a prolific food source for the local tribes. Linfield&#x27;s McMinnville campus has a patch of camas growing on it that faculty and students have restored and hope to propagate. The festival features tours of the Cozine Creek area where the camas grows, as well as other educational and cultural tables and activities.

=== Edith Green Distinguished Lectureship ===
This recurring event was named in honor of Congresswoman Edith Green, who served as a trustee for Linfield College starting in 1970. The inaugural event was held in 1988, when former President Gerald Ford delivered the keynote speech.

=== NW Media Fest ===
NW Media Fest is a multiple-day event featuring guests from across the media and entertainment industry, which started in 2022. Guests have included chef Susan Feniger, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Steve Kurkjian, photographer Joey Terrill, Warner Brothers Discovery executive Peter Clem, Dark Horse Comics CEO and founder Mike Richardson, and filmmaker and composer Liz Lachman.

=== Oregon Nobel Laureate Symposium ===
Former Linfield President Charles Walker secured several grants in 1981 to endow a permanent endowment fund dedicated to bringing Nobel laureates to McMinnville. The symposium evolved out of a lecture series organized by Bill Apel, then the campus chaplain and religious studies professor, who had coordinated smaller events on the topic of world peace. Apel organized the Oregon Nobel Laureate Symposium from 1986-1991, when it stopped being an annual event. Past Nobel Prize winners who have spoken at the symposium include Elie Wiesel in 1988, Franco Modigliani in 1989, Oscar Arias in 1998, Jose Ramos-Horta in 2000, and Harold Kroto in 2011. After a 10-year hiatus, the Oregon Nobel Laureate Symposium returned in 2023 featuring Nobel Prize for physics winners William D. Phillips and David J. Wineland.

<doc id="460286" wikidata="Q2642245" url="?curid=460286" title="Saskatchewan Progress Party">
<text>The Saskatchewan Progress Party (SPP) is a liberal political party in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. It was founded in 1905 as the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan, and retained that name until members voted to change it in 2023. Until 2009, the party was affiliated with the Liberal Party of Canada.

The Liberals were a dominant force in Saskatchewan politics during the first half of the twentieth century, forming government for all but five years between 1905 and 1944. With the emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) under Tommy Douglas&#x27; leadership, the Liberals spent the following two decades in Opposition before forming two more majority governments from 1964 to 1971. However, the party lost influence in the latter stages of the twentieth century. Although it reached Opposition status again in the mid-1990s, even that term was disrupted when much of the caucus abandoned the party to form the new Saskatchewan Party in 1997. The 1999 election marked the last time any Liberals were elected to the Legislature.

==History==
=== Early history (1905–1944) ===

==== Political dominance (1905–1929) ====
The Liberal Party dominated Saskatchewan politics from the province&#x27;s earliest days. Saskatchewan entered Confederation in September 1905 alongside neighbouring Alberta. Both provinces were carved out of the Northwest Territories; territorial premier Frederick Haultain had advocated for the creation of one large western province called Buffalo, but Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s federal Liberal government opted to create two provinces instead, wary of the potential strength of a province the size of Buffalo. Haultain responded by seeking the premiership of Saskatchewan under the banner of his Provincial Rights Party, but Saskatchewan voters opted in 1905 for the provincial Liberal Party under the leadership of Walter Scott. This marked the beginning of a long Liberal dynasty in the new Prairie province—the party provided six of the province&#x27;s first seven premiers.

With the Liberals a strong force at the federal level, Saskatchewan voters appear to have preferred a provincial government that had influence at the national level, and there was crossover with Liberal premiers like Charles Dunning and Jimmy Gardiner moving on to key federal cabinet positions. As a consequence, the provincial Liberals presided over the province at a time of tremendous growth as a rapidly expanding population driven by immigration—the province became the third most populous in the country after Ontario and Quebec—established a large agricultural economy.

One of the keys to Liberal success was their close relationship with immigrant communities and especially with the largest farmers&#x27; lobby in the province, the Saskatchewan Grain Growers&#x27; Association. While United Farmer governments took power in both Alberta and Manitoba during the 1920s, and while the agrarian Progressive Party performed well in Saskatchewan at the federal level, the direct entry of farmers into provincial politics was fended off for longer in Saskatchewan by Liberal leadership attuned to farmers&#x27; organizations. Early Liberal premiers were even known to invite key agrarian organizers to the cabinet table.

The Liberals also stood against a rising tide of nativist sentiment in the province in the 1920s. While the Ku Klux Klan gained a foothold in the province—the organization had 25,000 members in Saskatchewan by 1929—and fomented discriminatory attitudes towards French, Catholic, and Eastern European settlers, Premier Gardiner defended his government&#x27;s immigration policies and called the Klan both a foreign entity and a tool of the provincial Conservative Party. The Conservatives were reported to have aided Klan organization by supplying it with membership lists, and the party itself developed a nativist platform in the late 1920s, promising to protect British, Anglo-Saxon values. The Liberals were also heavily criticized for years of blatant patronage, which helped to move farmers closer to greater political participation and, more immediately, solidified a strong anti-Liberal bloc in the province. In the 1929 election, although the Liberals managed to win the most seats with 28, they fell short of a majority for the first time. They proved unable to gain the confidence of the Legislature, resulting in a coalition government under Conservative premier James T.M. Anderson—his party won 24 seats, and gained the support of the handful of Progressive and Independent members to form a coalition that they termed the &quot;Co-operative&quot; government.
==== Opposition and return to power (1929–1944) ====
Anderson&#x27;s government took power at the outset of the Great Depression, which proved to be especially severe for the Prairie provinces and which provided the Liberals with ample opportunity to criticize the government&#x27;s inability to contend with the crisis. In 1932, Anderson even invited Gardiner&#x27;s Liberals into his coalition, but Gardiner refused. At the same time, a new political party was gaining momentum in the province. In 1932, farmers with United Farmers of Canada voted to formally enter politics, and after a merger with the Independent Labour Party did so under the banner of Farmer-Labour; the new party became a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) that same year. The party was explicitly socialist, rapidly changing the dynamics of provincial politics.

Gardiner and the Liberals were able to return to power in 1934; the Conservatives failed to return a single member, and Farmer-Labour became the Official Opposition with five members to the Liberals&#x27; fifty. After the election, Farmer-Labour officially adopted the CCF party name. Almost immediately, Gardiner had to contend with the passage through Saskatchewan of the On-to-Ottawa Trek, a 1935 convoy meant to take the concerns of unemployed workers directly to the federal government. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett declared that the trekkers would not proceed past Regina, which acted as the headquarters to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Gardiner protested, predicting a riot. He was proven correct on July 1 1935, when the Regina Riot led to two deaths and hundreds of injuries.

The Liberals held on to their majority in the 1938 election, but they lost twelve seats as the Depression continued and the CCF gained further momentum. Although the Second World War began to relieve Depression conditions, by 1944 the CCF, under new leader Tommy Douglas, appeared poised to take power.

=== Varying fortunes (1944–1978) ===

==== Opposition to the CCF (1944–1964) ====
In the 1944 election, Saskatchewan elected the first democratic socialist government in North America under Douglas&#x27; CCF. The Liberals were soundly beaten, dropping to only five seats. CCF organizing had effectively captured the Liberals&#x27; traditional base, with farmers and immigrant settlers largely moving to the new party. The CCF&#x27;s 1944 win marked the beginning of twenty years in government over five successive majorities. In Opposition, the Liberals became a vehemently anti-socialist party, persistently railing against the CCF government&#x27;s interventions in the economy and presenting themselves as a free-market alternative. The Liberals staked the 1948 election on the slogan &quot;Tucker or tyranny&quot;, referencing leader Walter Tucker. The CCF was re-elected to a reduced majority. In 1957, future party leader Ross Thatcher famously held a televised debate against Douglas in Mossbank on the topic of the province&#x27;s crown corporations. Accounts tended to label the debate a draw, which was considered an achievement against the formidable Douglas. All the while, the CCF focused intently on building a modern welfare state. 

The biggest battle between the two parties occurred over the introduction of universal health care in the early 1960s. The CCF effectively pitched the 1960 election as a referendum on the issue, and were re-elected to their fifth majority. However, the Liberals under Thatcher came firmly to the support of the province&#x27;s organized medical profession, which was adamantly opposed to the scheme. Douglas resigned his post in the middle of this battle in 1961 to take on the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), and a 1962 doctors&#x27; strike threatened to put an end to the plan. However, the strike was resolved and medicare was introduced in 1962, soon to be expanded nationwide. 

==== Thatcher government (1964–1971) ====
With the province divided over the bitter medicare debate, Thatcher was able to lead the Liberals back to a majority government in the 1964 election, although the popular vote was a virtual tie. Thatcher—who had begun his own career as a member of the CCF—promised to open Saskatchewan for business and to dramatically scale back the government&#x27;s involvement in the economy. His biggest success came in the potash sector; while the industry got off the ground under the CCF, it expanded rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s, so much so that Thatcher ultimately negotiated a minimum price and production cap with American producers. Although Thatcher had opposed the implementation of medicare, his government proved unable to reverse it with the program being rolled out across the country; Thatcher&#x27;s government did, however, controversially introduce limited user fees for medical services.

Thatcher focused on downsizing the civil service, which was greatly expanded by the CCF. During the Thatcher years, many veteran Saskatchewan civil servants found themselves migrating to other provinces or to Lester Pearson&#x27;s federal government—which focused largely on expanding the federal welfare state—and these migrants became known in government circles as the &quot;Saskatchewan Mafia&quot;.

Thatcher called an early election in 1967 and won another majority. However, after the election Thatcher embraced a program of austerity, reducing spending and introducing medicare fees, which became derided as &quot;deterrence fees&quot;. A downturn in the provincial economy further eroded the government&#x27;s popularity. In a 1971 election that the Liberals framed as a choice between capitalism and socialism, the Liberals were soundly beaten by a resurgent CCF—now called the NDP—under the leadership of Allan Blakeney, who promised a return to the CCF approach of economic planning. Thatcher died suddenly just three weeks after the election, leaving the Opposition leaderless for most of the rest of the year. In 1975, the Liberals were able to hold on to their fifteen seats and remain the Opposition, but for the first time in more than forty years, the Conservatives—now the Progressive Conservatives (PCs)—won multiple seats.

===Political wilderness (1978–1995)===
The resurgence of the PCs under Dick Collver&#x27;s leadership sapped support from the Liberals, and in the 1978 election, for the first time in their history, the Liberals failed to win a single seat, dropping to less than 15% support. The result was even worse in 1982; while the PCs surged to power under Grant Devine, Liberals won less than five percent of the vote. Leader Ralph Goodale was able to return the party to the Legislature with his single seat in the 1986 election, a feat repeated by new leader Lynda Haverstock in the 1991 election. But for the better part of two decades the Liberals were largely on the outside of provincial politics. In addition to the PCs staking out a position on the right side of the political spectrum, space the Liberals had taken up firmly since the 1940s, this was exacerbated by the growing unpopularity of the federal Liberal Party in the province; the party&#x27;s unpopular resource policies in the 1970s and early 1980s gave rise to a wave of powerful western alienation sentiment and damaged the Liberal brand. Moreover, Saskatchewan politics had become increasingly divided between perceived urban and rural issues, and the Liberal brand was particularly unpopular in rural areas.

Ahead of the 1995 election, the Liberals appeared poised to take advantage of a scandal-ridden Progressive Conservative Party badly damaged by an expense fraud scandal. For the first time since the 1970s, the Liberals returned to Official Opposition status. However, the party&#x27;s eleven seats to the NDP&#x27;s forty two were seen as a disappointment.

===Dissent and decline (1995–2003)===
Dissatisfaction within the Liberal caucus led to Haverstock&#x27;s resignation as party leader shortly after the election. Jim Melenchuk was selected to replace Haverstock, but internal strife continued. Several of the more conservative members of the Liberal caucus were in discussion with PC members about joining forces and forming a new party. Then, in August 1997, four Liberal members—Bob Bjornerud, June Draude, Rod Gantefoer, and Ken Krawetz—joined four PC members in announcing the founding of the Saskatchewan Party. With eight members, the new party took Official Opposition status away from the Liberals.

In the wake of the defections, remaining Liberals tended to put into question how much the new party was a Liberal-Conservative coalition, suggesting that the Liberals who joined the new party were right-wingers resisting a move towards the centre that much of the Liberal Party felt was necessary. Like the NDP under leader Roy Romanow, the Liberals characterized the Saskatchewan Party as merely a re-branded PC Party.

In the 1999 election, the NDP were reduced to 29 seats, one shy of a majority, while the Saskatchewan Party surged to 25 seats, almost exclusively rural. The Liberals&#x27; four seats gave them the balance of power, and Melenchuk agreed to enter into a coalition government with Romanow along with fellow Liberals Ron Osika and Jack Hillson. While Melenchuk hoped that the move would allow the Liberals to regain some influence, he found the Romanow government itself was quite centrist. The coalition also divided the party again; Melenchuk was removed as leader—he and coalition partner Osika would contest the 2003 election as NDP members—and was replaced by David Karwacki when he defeated Hillson, who himself had withdrawn from the coalition. Karwacki ordered Melenchuk and Osika to withdraw the coalition, but they refused.

=== Recent history (2003–present) ===
Karwacki saw an opportunity to become the more left-wing alternative to the Saskatchewan Party. However, he took over a party that had lost much of its membership and financial backing. The party was shut out of the Legislature in both the 2003 and 2007 elections as the province returned to a two-party system now dominated by the NDP and the Saskatchewan Party; Liberal support dropped from over 20% in 1999 to below 10% in 2007. The losses sparked discussion of Karwacki&#x27;s future as leader. He resigned before the end of 2007, with party president Frank Proto taking over on an interim basis. This marked the beginning of an accelerated period of decline in which the party continued to lose support at the polls. Ryan Bater was introduced as the new Liberal leader in February 2009; at the same time, the party voted to disaffiliate itself from the federal Liberal Party, ending an affiliation that dated back more than a century. This did not change the party&#x27;s fortunes; in the 2011 election, the Liberals ran only nine candidates and support fell to below one percent, with the Green Party surpassing the Liberals in popular support. Bater resigned as leader on January 31, 2012, and Greg Gallager was appointed interim leader. In 2013, Reid Hill was set to be acclaimed the party&#x27;s new leader as the only declared candidate. However, he decided not to take the position, stating that he had hoped for a competitive race to revive public interest in the party, rather than simply being handed the leadership due to lack of interest. Darrin Lamoureux was appointed interim leader on December 16, 2013, and was acclaimed the leader on August 21, 2014, when no other candidates ran for the position.

The party managed to field a full slate of 61 candidates for the 2016 general election, and they finished third among parties with 3.6% support. However, they were once again shut out of the Legislature. Lamoureux resigned as party leader on September 9, 2017, and Tara Jijian was appointed interim leader. Former NDP candidate Naveed Anwar was acclaimed as party leader on May 5, 2018. However, Anwar resigned as leader on September 9, 2020, just weeks before the 2020 election. The party had again been set back by in-fighting, with Anwar and the executive at odds over election candidates and the state of the party. Robert Rudachyk was appointed as the party&#x27;s interim leader for the election. Running only three candidates, the party received just 355 votes, marking the worst performance in party history.

==== Saskatchewan Progress Party ====
Following the 2020 provincial election, the party set about looking for a new permanent leader. In 2021, members unanimously acclaimed University of Regina lecturer Jeff Walters as the new leader. Walters emphasized the need in the province for a centrist alternative to the main parties, as well as the distinction of his &#x27;prairie Liberalism&#x27; from that of the federal Liberals. Walters worked to increase his party&#x27;s visibility in challenging the Saskatchewan Party on its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 5, 2022, Walters organized a rally in front of the Legislature to oppose the end of COVID-19 mandates. Walters also launched &quot;Accountability Saskatchewan&quot;, collecting signatures to trigger a plebiscite on a public inquiry into the government&#x27;s handling of the pandemic. The petition was initially available only online, provoking an official ruling from Elections Saskatchewan affirming the validity of electronic signatures for this purpose in Saskatchewan.

In March 2023, party members voted to change the party name in order to distance themselves from the non-affiliated federal Liberals. In July 2023, the party announced its rebranding as the Saskatchewan Progress Party. Walters stated that the new name was intended to &quot;portray ourselves as visionaries&quot;, and that the party hoped to be a &quot;post-partisan or post-ideological party&quot;. He stated an intention to focus on finance reform, government accountability, and &#x27;green&#x27; energy.

In September 2023, Walters announced his resignation as leader and his intent to step away from politics. He remained on as interim leader of the party until the scheduled leadership election in November 2023. After the scheduled election failed to produce a new party leader, Nathan Bruce was listed as the interim leader in December 2023. In January 2024, Teunis Peters was listed as the party&#x27;s new interim leader. None of those changes improved party fortunes; the party again nominated only three candidates ahead of the 2024 provincial election, and received only a few hundred votes for the second consecutive election, by far the fewest among registered parties.

== Ideology ==
The Saskatchewan Progress Party has undergone a number of ideological shifts over its history, often responding to political developments around it. For the first several decades of the party&#x27;s existence, the Saskatchewan Liberals were relatively closely aligned with the Canadian liberalism espoused by the federal Liberal Party. Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King even successfully represented the Saskatchewan district of Prince Albert in Parliament from 1926 to 1946. However, the emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation as a political force in the province led to a rightward shift for the Liberals, as they began fighting elections as an explicitly free-enterprise and anti-socialist party.

The re-emergence of the Progressive Conservative Party in the 1970s forced another re-evaluation for the Liberals. By the 1990s, the party was attempting a more centrist approach between those of the PCs and the NDP; however, the Liberal caucus itself proved divided between left- and right-leaning members, leading to a split that helped create the Saskatchewan Party. However, another major factor in Liberal party fortunes has been a continued association with the federal Liberals, even after they disaffiliated in 2009. This has been seen as a particularly difficult for the party since the 1970s, when federal Liberal policies inflamed expressions of western alienation.

In recent years, the party has emphasized itself as a centrist party. However, political observers have noted that early in the twenty-first century, Saskatchewan parties had &quot;crowded towards... the ideological centre&quot;, while more recent years have been marked by political polarization. The party&#x27;s most recent permanent leader, Jeff Walters, suggested that the re-branded Saskatchewan Progress Party strove to become &quot;post-ideological&quot;, emphasizing the need to pursue policy that &quot;gives the greatest good to the greatest number of people&quot;.

==Election results==

===Notes===
: The Liberals secured the most seats in 1929, but they were short of a majority and failed to secure the confidence of the Legislature. This enabled a coalition government to form and made the Liberals the Official Opposition.
: The Liberals began this Legislature as the Opposition. However, four Liberal MLAs left the party in 1997 to help form the Saskatchewan Party, which immediately surpassed the Liberals in size and took over as the Opposition.
: Although initial reports had the Liberals winning four seats, the result in Wood River was ultimately overturned by the courts and the ensuing by-election was won by the Saskatchewan Party candidate, leaving the Liberals with three seats.

<text>Maîtresse (English: &quot;mistress&quot; or &quot;teacher&quot;) is a 1975 French sex comedy film co-written and directed by Barbet Schroeder, starring Bulle Ogier and, in one of his earliest leading roles, Gérard Depardieu. The film provoked controversy in the United Kingdom and the United States due to its graphic depictions of BDSM.

==Plot==
Olivier, a naive provincial, comes to Paris and looks up a friend, who enlists him to sell books door to door. Ariane, an attractive young woman in her dressing gown asks them in to help, as the bath she was running has overflowed. Asked about the apartment beneath, she says the owners are away. That night the two break in to rob the place, and find it is the torture chamber of a professional dominatrix. In fact it is Ariane&#x27;s workplace and she catches the intruders, asking Olivier for brief help with a client and paying him afterwards.

Olivier becomes her live-in lover, thinking he will be the strong man for a vulnerable woman, but she is older, tougher, and a lot wiser. She tries to keep her work separate, but he struggles over the number of other men who call and the things she does with them. Eventually, his blundering efforts to take charge lead to a crisis. Her wealthy protector, who has allowed her to enjoy herself by taking a lover and running her own business, shuts it down and takes her to his country house to be with her child. When Olivier tracks her down, she takes him for a drive through the woods and crashes the car as they are making love on the move. Both emerge laughing from the smoking wreckage.

==Cast==
* Bulle Ogier as Ariane
* Gérard Depardieu as Olivier
* André Rouyer as Mario
* Nathalie Keryan as Lucienne
* Roland Bertin as man in cage
* as Emile
* Holger Löwenadler as Gautier

==Release in the United Kingdom==
&quot;Maîtresse&quot; was first submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in 1976. Examiners&#x27; reports agreed that the film was well made and not exploitative, but under their censorship standards of the time it had to be refused a certificate: &quot;the actual scenes of fetishism are miles in excess of anything we have ever passed in this field&quot;. This meant that it could not be shown in a public cinema and instead was given showings in private cinema clubs. However, in 1980, the film was subsequently re-examined for public release by the BBFC, and in February 1981 was granted an &#x27;X&#x27; certificate in a cut version. To gain the certificate, a total of 4 minutes and 47 seconds&#x27; footage was removed from three scenes, most notably the scene in which Ariane nails a client&#x27;s scrotum to a plank of wood, an act that was not simulated (and was not performed onscreen by Bulle Ogier). In 2003, the film was submitted for a third time, and was passed for an 18 certificate with all previous cuts waived.

In November 2012, &quot;Maîtresse&quot; was released in a new Blu-ray Disc/DVD dual-format edition by the BFI, its first appearance on Blu-ray Disc.

The film was rated X in the United States. It was rated R18 in New Zealand for sexual violence, sex scenes and offensive language.

<doc id="460303" wikidata="Q6078218" url="?curid=460303" title="Platycladus">
<text>Platycladus is a monotypic genus of evergreen coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae, containing only one species, Platycladus orientalis, also known as Chinese thuja, Oriental arborvitae, Chinese arborvitae, biota or Oriental thuja. It is native to northeastern parts of East Asia and North Asia, but is also now naturalised as an introduced species in other regions of the Asian continent.

==Description==

A monoecious tree, it is small, slow-growing, reaching and trunk diameter (exceptionally to tall and diameter in very old trees). The foliage forms in flat sprays with scale-like leaves long, which are bright green in colour but may turn brownish or coppery orange in winter. The cones are long, green ripening brown in about eight months from pollination, and have 6–12 thick scales arranged in opposite pairs. The seeds are long, with no wing.

The branches are relatively short, loosely arranged and, usually, sharply directed upwards, and the bark, brownish, is detached in narrow vertical strips. The twigs are compressed and are arranged in vertical planes. The leaves, arranged in four rows, fleshy, opposite, decussate, truncated, imbricated as adults, somewhat curved inwards, of uniform green color and with a resiniferous gland on the underside. The female cones, of pink-salmon color and later bluish-greenish when immature, centimetric and of annual maturation, are oval with 6-8 flattened, thick scales, coriaceous and provided with an apical hook.

==Taxonomy==

Although generally accepted as the only member of its genus, it has been suggested that the closely related species &quot;Microbiota decussata&quot; could be included in &quot;Platycladus&quot;, but this is not widely followed. Other fairly close relatives are &quot;Juniperus&quot; and &quot;Cupressus&quot;, both of these genera being graft-compatible with &quot;Platycladus&quot;. In older texts, &quot;Platycladus&quot; was often included in &quot;Thuja&quot;, which is reflected in one of its common names, &quot;oriental thuja&quot;. But it is only distantly related to the genus &quot;Thuja&quot;. Differences include its distinct cones, wingless seeds, and its almost scentless foliage.

==Etymology==
The binomial &quot;Platycladus&quot; means &#x27;with broad or flattened shoots&#x27; deriving from Greek &quot;platys&quot; &#x27;broad, flat, level&#x27; and &quot;klados&quot; &#x27;branch, shoot of a tree&#x27;. The qualifier &quot;orientalis&quot; refers to its native habitat in China.

==Distribution==
It is native to northwestern China, but it is difficult to distinguish the areas where they are native safely from those where they have been introduced. It is distributed in Manchuria, Russian Far East (Amur and Khabarovsk), and now it is naturalised in Korea, Japan, India, Florida and Iran as well. It is also cultivated in many parts of the world in parks, gardens, home yards, cemeteries and for hedges.

==Uses==
Resistant to drought, it is very often used as an ornamental tree, both in its homeland, where it is associated with long life and vitality, and very widely elsewhere in temperate climates. It is suitable for form cuts and year-round opaque hedges, but also forms impressive slender solitary trees. Several cultivars have been selected, of which &#x27;Aurea Nana&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. 

The wood is used in Buddhist temples both for (lavairos) construction work, and chipped, for incense burning. Its twigs and leaves contain 0.12% essential oil containing pinene and probably caryophyllene. Its use as a memorial tree dates back to the Zhou dynasty in China, where it was the official memorial tree of princes.

<text>The Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (Saskatchewan NDP or Sask NDP), branded as the Saskatchewan New Democrats, is a social democratic political party in Saskatchewan, Canada. The party was founded in 1932 as the Farmer-Labour Group and was known as the Saskatchewan section of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) from 1935 until 1967. While the party is affiliated with the federal New Democratic Party, the Saskatchewan NDP is considered a &quot;distinctly homegrown&quot; party given the role of the province in its development and the party&#x27;s history in the province.

The party currently forms the Official Opposition and is led by Carla Beck.

The CCF emerged as a dominant force in provincial politics under the leadership of Tommy Douglas, forming five consecutive majority governments from 1944 through 1964. The first social democratic government elected in Canada, the CCF created a wide range of crown corporations, normalized government involvement in the economy, and pioneered elements of the modern Canadian welfare state, most notably universal healthcare. With the NDP forming government again from 1971 to 1982 and from 1991 to 2007, the party was long considered Saskatchewan&#x27;s natural governing party. Moreover, Saskatchewan was long seen as the regional centre for CCF and NDP politics on the national stage. However, the party saw its influence diminish after losing government in 2007, posting its weakest election results since the party&#x27;s earliest days in the 1930s.

==== Precursors ====
The CCF can trace its roots to early farmers&#x27; organizations and political movements in the early twentieth century. In 1901, a group of farmers agreed to create the Territorial Grain Growers&#x27; Association—which became the Saskatchewan Grain Growers&#x27; Association (SGGA) when Saskatchewan became a province in 1905—to lobby for farmer&#x27;s rights in the grain trade and with railways. The SGGA represented an early expression of western alienation, and took issue with an economic system that appeared to favour capitalists in central Canada. Farmers movements formed the basis of the Progressive Party, an agrarian and social democratic party that won the second most seats in the 1921 federal election, including 15 of Saskatchewan&#x27;s 16 seats. United Farmers parties rose to power in Alberta and Manitoba, but the political aspirations of farmers in Saskatchewan at the provincial level were largely bound together with the provincial Liberal Party, which dominated provincial politics and carefully maintained a close relationship with the SGGA. The provincial Progressives managed to win only a handful of seats throughout the 1920s, while the American-inspired agrarian Non-Partisan League failed to win any. Organized labour, meanwhile, existed in the province but, largely dependent on the expanding agricultural economy, tended to find itself following the lead of farmers.

In 1921, a left-wing splinter group, unhappy with the SGGA association with the Liberals, left the association to form the Farmer&#x27;s Union of Canada. The groups would reconcile in forming the Wheat Pool producers&#x27; cooperative, and merged in 1926 to form the United Farmers of Canada (UFC) under the leadership of George Hara Williams. The new group was opposed to participating in electoral politics and favoured cooperative development, while building a closer relationship with organized labour. However, when a handful of Progressive MLAs opted to prop up a Conservative government after the 1929 election, the UFC was pushed further towards political participation.

==== Founding and Opposition (1932–1944) ====
The other major factor in pushing the UFC towards political participation was the onset of the Great Depression, which was particularly severe on the Prairies. The apparent unwillingness of the dominant political parties to respond to the crisis created a renewed climate for political engagement and in particular for criticism of the political and economic system. The UFC decided to formalize itself as a socialist political alternative. In 1931, the UFC participated in a march on Regina to protest against government indifference to the farmer&#x27;s plight during the Depression. During the event, the UFC connected with M.J. Coldwell, the leader of the Independent Labour Party. In 1932, the groups agreed to merge and form the Farmer-Labour Group, or Farmer-Labour Party, with Coldwell as leader. The same year, Farmer-Labour participated in the founding conference of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Calgary, a new national party under the banner of &quot;Farmer-Labour-Socialist&quot;, which had a significant social gospel influence. Although it was a founding member and affiliate, the Saskatchewan party opted to maintain the Farmer-Labour name ahead of its first election. At the national party&#x27;s first convention in Regina in 1933, it adopted the Regina Manifesto as its statement of principles, calling for a &quot;full programme of socialized planning&quot; to replace capitalism.

Farmer-Labour first participated in the 1934 provincial election and won five seats, becoming the Official Opposition to the Liberals, who returned to government with a large majority. Following the election, the party officially adopted the CCF name. Coldwell ran for federal office with the CCF in the 1935 federal election and was elected; George Williams took over as party leader. Williams was seen by moderates as too radical; while the party doubled its seat count in the 1938 election and maintained its place as the Opposition, its popular support was actually lower than in 1934. In 1939, Williams&#x27; unwavering support for the war also alienated pacifists, one of whom, Carlyle King, unsuccessfully challenged Williams for the party presidency the following year. Tommy Douglas, a charismatic federal CCF MP and baptist minister, was persuaded to challenge Williams for the leadership and succeeded in defeating him for the party presidency in 1941 and for the party leadership in 1942. In the early 1940s, the party focused intently on grassroots engagement and political education, and party membership expanded accordingly, growing from approximately 4,000 at the outset of the war to approximately 24,000 by 1944.

==== Majority government (1944–1964) ====
Douglas and the CCF swept to power In the 1944 election, winning 47 of 52 seats to form the first socialist government in Canada or the United States. Despite the fact that the province saw tens of thousands of residents move away during the Depression, the province remained the third most populous in the country; it was also the most indebted, and it remained predominantly rural. The party was elected on a highly-detailed platform focusing on socialized health services and educational reform. From the outset, the Douglas government demonstrated a commitment to promoting public, cooperative, and private enterprise as it embarked on an ambitious modernizing program. The new government immediately enacted extensive reforms: in its first sixteen months in office, it passed 192 bills, created numerous new government departments and crown corporations as it expanded the role of the state in the provincial economy—including in the realms of insurance (SGI), utilities (SPC), and transportation (STC)—and approved new labour relations, public service, and farm security acts. The government also pursued some ill-fated business adventures, including shoe, box, and brick factories. In 1947 the government approved the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights, the first of its kind in Canada. The party also pursued modern infrastructure development, building thousands of kilometres of new roads, connecting towns, villages, and farms to a provincial electrical grid, and bringing other modern amenities like natural gas, sewage, and water hook-ups. Overall, the government placed a heavy emphasis on improving the quality of life of Saskatchewan residents, and on ensuring equal access to high standards of welfare, education, and health services.

To manage and pay for these kinds of innovations, the Douglas government placed a heavy emphasis on a robust and professional civil service. Douglas personally recruited George Cadbury from England to lead an influential economic planning advisory board. The CCF placed an increasing emphasis on economic diversification through resource development, which it pursued mainly through promoting private industry; but the party&#x27;s insistence that any such development be in the public interest led to a royalty structure that provided massive revenues from oil, natural gas, and mineral production. As a result, the government managed to achieve surplus budgets throughout much of the 1950s, providing a stronger economic base from which to further expand its welfare state. The CCF was re-elected to majority governments in 1948, 1952, 1956, and 1960.

Arguably, the party&#x27;s most significant accomplishment was the introduction of North America&#x27;s first comprehensive system of public medical insurance. The fight to introduce Medicare in the province was intense due to the opposition of the province&#x27;s doctors, who were backed by the American Medical Association. The AMA feared that public healthcare would spread to other parts of the continent if introduced in one part. In July 1962 the doctors staged the 23-day Saskatchewan doctors&#x27; strike. Despite a concerted attempt to defeat the controversial Medical Care Insurance Act, the strike eventually collapsed and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan agreed to the alterations and terms of the &quot;Saskatoon Agreement&quot;. The program was introduced and was soon adopted across Canada.

After doing much of the preliminary work on Medicare, Douglas resigned as party leader and premier in 1961 to become the founding leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP), which was formed by a merger of the CCF and the Canadian Labour Congress. Woodrow Lloyd, a key Douglas cabinet minister, succeeded him as party leader and premier, and completed the implementation of Medicare. With the creation of the NDP, the Saskatchewan CCF became the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, Saskatchewan Section of the New Democratic Party, or CCF-NDP. This was the name under which the party contested the 1964 election. By then, the fight over Medicare had taken a particular toll, and the CCF-NDP were defeated by Ross Thatcher&#x27;s Liberals.

===Saskatchewan NDP===

==== In transition (1964–1971) ====
At its convention in November 1967, the party fully adopted the NDP name. The change was controversial, in part because it broke with a rich tradition, and also because the merger with organized labour that it represented raised concerns that the party was abandoning its agrarian roots. This came at a time of increasing rural depopulation as the trend of farm consolidation was gaining greater momentum. Moreover, beginning in the late 1960s, the NDP—provincially and nationally—became gripped with a factional dispute with a growing left-wing movement called &quot;The Waffle&quot;. Largely an expression of the &quot;New Left&quot;, part of the 1960s counterculture movement, the Waffle advocated for a return to the party&#x27;s socialist roots, including through the nationalization of key industries; it was particularly concerned with American control of the Canadian economy. The Waffle was contentious. Its Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada was defeated in a vote at the 1969 federal NDP convention. However, one person who voted in support was Woodrow Lloyd, who saw its potential for revitalizing the party. The episode, and resistance to Lloyd&#x27;s willingness to open the party to debate, contributed to Lloyd&#x27;s decision to resign as leader in 1970.

Lloyd&#x27;s resignation triggered a contentious leadership race featuring Allan Blakeney, a former civil servant and cabinet minister in the Douglas and Lloyd governments; Roy Romanow, a young lawyer who had joined the caucus in 1967 and was considered a more right-wing candidate; Don Mitchell, a farmer and Waffle candidate; and George Taylor, who was considered a labour candidate. At the 1970 convention, Mitchell had a strong showing, finishing third with more than 25% of the vote. On the final ballot, Blakeney defeated Romanow, with many Waffle members abstaining. However, despite losing the leadership, party policy at the convention was greatly influenced by the Waffle.

==== Allan Blakeney (1971–1987) ====
Under Blakeney, the NDP returned to power with a strong majority in the 1971 election on a platform entitled the &quot;New Deal for People&quot;. The platform promised greater government intervention in the economy and a focus on equitable social programming, along with support for organized labour. The arrival of the 1970s energy crisis, which rapidly increased energy commodity prices, including for oil and uranium, provided the prospect of windfall resource profits, while also precipitating a series of confrontations between the province, industry, and the federal government over the control of and revenues from resources. Saskatchewan embarked on a programme of nationalizing the province&#x27;s natural resources, including the creation of SaskOil—a central campaign of the Saskatchewan Waffle—PotashCorp, and the Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation, in order to secure significant resource revenue. The NDP, with Romanow as attorney general, also went to court with the federal government over resource taxation, and joined with Alberta in its opposition to the federal National Energy Program, which exacerbated a new wave of western alienation sentiment. These developments were not without controversy; uranium development in particular proved contentious within the NDP as environmental and peace activists favoured a moratorium on the resource. However, the Blakeney government also created a Department of the Environment, introduced environmental assessment standards, and held public inquiries into resource projects. The NDP also introduced progressive reforms to taxation and labour law, and expanded healthcare programs including new prescription drug and dental plans. The NDP was re-elected to majority governments in 1975 and 1979.

Blakeney and the NDP were also governing during the Patriation of the Canadian Constitution in the early 1980s, which became a major focus of Blakeney&#x27;s. Alongside Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed, Blakeney negotiated the recognition of provincial rights over natural resources, which were enshrined in Section 92A of the Constitution. Moreover, Blakeney was instrumental to the development of Section 33 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which enshrined the notwithstanding clause. The clause enables provinces to override sections of the Charter. Blakeney argued that it was an important check on appointed courts by democratically elected governments; while courts could rule on certain legal rights, they had less purview to rule on moral rights—such as the right to healthcare—that can only be enacted and enforced by governments. In essence, Blakeney asserted that certain rights should not be given precedence over others because they were included in the Charter.

Blakeney&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1982 election by the resurgent Progressive Conservatives led by Grant Devine. The loss has been attributed to a variety of factors, including public fatigue with constitutional matters, a loss of union support over NDP support for federal wage and price controls and conflicts with organized labour late in its term, and PC promises to provide tax and interest relief. The NDP was reduced to nine seats in the worst defeat a sitting CCF/NDP government had suffered in Saskatchewan. Despite the defeat, Blakeney continued to lead the NDP in Opposition. In the 1986 election, the NDP narrowly won the popular vote, but the concentration of that vote in urban centres translated to only 25 seats. Winning just nine seats outside of Regina and Saskatoon, the election emphasized how much had changed for a party that had begun as a voice for rural discontent. Devine&#x27;s government, on the other hand, was rural-focused, and spent lavishly on supporting farmers in particular.

==== Roy Romanow &amp; Lorne Calvert (1987–2009) ====
Blakeney resigned in early 1987 and Roy Romanow was acclaimed as the new leader. Romanow would led the party back to power in 1991, when the NDP inherited a fiscal crisis. Provincial debt had soared under the Devine government, to the point that the province was facing the prospect of bankruptcy. Moreover, the PC government&#x27;s privatization of a range of crown corporations, including PotashCorp, constrained government revenue. Romanow appealed to the standard of fiscal management set by the Douglas government to emphasize the need to prioritize the fiscal crisis. However, he and finance minister Janice MacKinnon adopted an austerity approach to dealing with the crisis, which stabilized the province&#x27;s finances, returning to a balanced budget by 1995, but at a cost. Spending cuts included downsizing rural healthcare and schooling as well as agricultural support, further entrenching the growing urban-rural divide in provincial politics. Moreover, the embrace of neoliberal &quot;third way&quot; politics by the NDP was controversial within the party, alienating those who felt it was a betrayal of the party&#x27;s roots and core ideology, and who would have preferred a renewed program of nationalization to increase revenues. One faction even left the party to help found the New Green Alliance, which later became the Saskatchewan Green Party.

After the NDP was re-elected in 1995, neither the PCs nor the Liberal Opposition saw a clear path back to power. In 1997, four MLAs from each party—all representing rural districts—joined together to announce the founding of the Saskatchewan Party in an attempt to unite opposition to the NDP. Former Reform Party MP Elwin Hermanson was chosen as its leader, and with eight MLAs the party immediately formed the Official Opposition. Running on a platform of tax cuts and social conservative policies, Hermanson&#x27;s party had a strong 1999 election performance, narrowly edging out the NDP in the popular vote; however, the new party failed to make inroads in urban centres, and won 25 seats compared to 29 for the NDP, who nearly swept the seats in Regina and Saskatoon. The NDP&#x27;s 29 seats were one shy of a majority, and the party was forced to rely on the support of three elected Liberal MLAs to form government.In 2000, Romanow announced that he would be retiring; this set off a leadership race that differed from 1987, when Romanow was unchallenged for the leadership. The 2001 leadership election was highly contested—the seven candidates on the ballot made it the biggest in the party&#x27;s history. Moreover, for the first time the party employed a one member, one vote policy, rather than a delegated election. The perceived front runner was Chris Axworthy, a former NDP MP and current MLA who was serving as justice minister under Romanow. Three other sitting cabinet ministers also ran in Buckley Belanger, Joanne Crofford, and Maynard Sonntag. They were joined by former MLA and United Church minister Lorne Calvert, former National Farmers Union president Nettie Wiebe, and Scott Banda, who had once served as president of the Young New Democrats. Wiebe ran an explicitly anti-neoliberal campaign, advocating for a leftward shift for the party; Wiebe ultimately finished third with 23% on the third ballot. Calvert, who ran a more traditional social democratic campaign, promising a greater focus on social programs, defeated Axworthy on the final ballot with 58% of nearly 18,000 votes.

With the victory, Calvert immediately succeeded Romanow as premier. Although his government did not represent a radical departure for the NDP, it was, as promised, considered more social democratic than Romanow&#x27;s. Calvert&#x27;s government significantly increased social spending, particularly in education and healthcare. It expanded child care spaces and introduced a number of targeted welfare programs. The government also began reforming immigration systems to attract more immigrants, and expanded investment in renewable energy and energy conservation. Much of this new social spending was made possible by a renewed boom in commodity prices, which led to significant increases in resource revenue for the province. Calvert also purposefully drew a stark contrast between his party&#x27;s support for the province&#x27;s major remaining crown corporations and Hermanson&#x27;s party&#x27;s willingness to consider further privatization. While the Saskatchewan Party led polling heading into the 2003 general election and managed to increase its seat count to 28, the NDP increased its vote share and captured 30 seats to return to a majority government.

After the election, Hermanson resigned as Saskatchewan Party leader and was replaced by Brad Wall. The new leader made a concerted effort to moderate the Opposition&#x27;s image, shifting away from social conservative policies and arguing that it was the best party to manage the booming economy. Importantly, Wall made a commitment not to privatize crowns and promised a continued focus on healthcare. Wall led the Saskatchewan Party to victory in the 2007 general election, ending a long tenure by the NDP. After the election, Calvert said he had no immediate plans to step down as leader, but was unlikely to lead the party into the next election.

==== Out of government (2009–present) ====
In 2008, Calvert announced his intention to retire. The ensuing leadership race included former deputy premier Dwain Lingenfelter, Moose Jaw MLA Deb Higgins, former party president and Regina lawyer Yens Pedersen, and Saskatoon doctor Ryan Meili. Lingenfelter was elected party leader June 6, 2009, with Meili&#x27;s outsider campaign finishing in second with 45% of votes. Lingenfelter led the party into the 2011 election, which proved to be its worst showing in 30 years, with the party reduced to nine seats as Wall&#x27;s Saskatchewan Party secured a large majority. Lingenfelter failed to secure his own Regina seat—a first for a NDP leader—and announced his resignation after the election, triggering another leadership race.

Meili again entered the leadership race and was joined by two MLAs—Trent Wotherspoon and Cam Broten—and former federal NDP candidate Erin Weir. On March 9, 2013, Broten was narrowly elected leader, defeating Meili by 44 votes. Broten fared little better than Lingenfelter. In the 2016 election, the party won ten seats, and Broten became the second straight party leader to lose their own seat. Broten resigned, triggering a third party leadership race in less than a decade. The election, which took place on March 3, 2018, came down to a contest between former contenders Meili—now a sitting MLA—and Wotherspoon, who had finished second and third, respectively, in 2013. Meili, in his third bid for party leadership, was chosen leader with 55% of the vote.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic—during which Meili renewed his medical license to work at testing facilities—the NDP persistently called for the implementation of more public health measures than the governing Saskatchewan Party, now under the leadership of Scott Moe, was implementing; the province was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic in Canada. The 2020 provincial election was held during the pandemic. In the election, the NDP won 13 seats while the Saskatchewan Party won its fourth consecutive majority government. Meili won his seat and vowed to stay on as leader. However, Meili received just 72% support at the party&#x27;s 2021 convention leadership review, and days after the NDP lost a February 2022 by-election in the northern Athabasca district, Meili announced that he would be resigning as party leader. The ensuing leadership race saw Regina MLA Carla Beck defeat Saskatoon lawyer Kaitlyn Harvey—Beck became the first elected female leader of the party, and its fourth leader since Calvert retired in 2009. The leadership election revealed that party membership had decreased substantially since the last race; while more than 13,000 members were eligible to vote in 2018, just over 7,000 were eligible in 2022, with fewer than 5,000 casting ballots.

=====Carla Beck=====
Under Beck&#x27;s leadership, the party began to see a resurgence in popular support. Ahead of the 2024 provincial election, polls showed the NDP leading the Saskatchewan Party as they waged a campaign focusing on healthcare, education, and the cost of living. The party went on to post its best results since 2003 and more than doubled its seat count compared to 2020—this included winning all but one seat in Regina and Saskatoon, with the only loss in those urban centres coming by a margin of fewer than 150 votes. However, the party failed to win any rural seats outside of the far north of the province, or to break through in smaller urban centres, which kept the party in Opposition, albeit the province&#x27;s largest in nearly two decades.

== Ideology ==
The Saskatchewan NDP has undergone a series of ideological transformations over the course of its history, dating back to its days as the CCF. It has also been subject to factional disputes. Overall, what began as an explicitly socialist party in the 1930s had by the turn of the twenty-first century become a more centrist, &quot;third way&quot; social democratic party.

The first national CCF convention in 1933 resulted in the Regina Manifesto, named after the city in which it was presented. While it has been noted that the manifesto broke somewhat from the socialist tradition in favouring a national over an international outlook, the manifesto ended with the statement that &quot;no CCF Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism&quot;, advocating for a &quot;full programme of socialized planning&quot;. However, almost immediately the party demonstrated a willingness to work with other parties and to moderate its platform in its quest for electoral success, and early CCF governments tended to be labeled &quot;democratic socialist&quot;. These CCF governments were also considered populist in nature, which at times tempered its socialist outlook.

The first significant moderation to the overarching CCF platform came with the 1956 Winnipeg Declaration, which downplayed socialism in embracing a mixed-economy model, which the party had done in practice in Saskatchewan since forming government. By the late 1960s, the party at all levels became gripped by a factional dispute with the Waffle Movement, which consisted of NDP members advocating for a return to the party&#x27;s socialist roots, with a greater role for state planning and nationalization of industry. The Waffle was well supported in Saskatchewan—the movement&#x27;s candidate for the 1971 provincial party leadership election finished in third with over 25% of the vote—but was ultimately defeated by the party establishment.

The 1990s brought about a rightward shift in NDP policy under the leadership of Roy Romanow. During that decade, the party embraced &quot;third way&quot; politics, a form of neoliberalism that favours a reduced role for the state in the economy. By the first decade of the twenty-first century, observers noted that the province&#x27;s main parties—the NDP and the Saskatchewan Party, a relatively new conservative party—were &quot;crowding the centre&quot;, with a broad consensus favouring neoliberal approaches to more traditional social democratic approaches. This shift was divisive within the party, seen by parts of the party as a betrayal of its core principles.

In recent years, more left-wing candidates have struggled to gain influence in the party. Ryan Meili, who was seen as left-leaning, took three tries to win the party leadership, and resigned amid rumours that the party favoured a more centrist orientation. In the last leadership race, Carla Beck defeated Kaitlyn Harvey, who was perceived as a left-wing challenger.

<text>A diving cylinder or diving gas cylinder is a gas cylinder used to store and transport high pressure gas used in diving operations. This may be breathing gas used with a scuba set, in which case the cylinder may also be referred to as a scuba cylinder, scuba tank or diving tank. When used for an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba, it may be referred to as a bailout cylinder or [[bailout bottle]]. It may also be used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas . A diving cylinder may also be used to supply inflation gas for a dry suit or buoyancy compensator. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving re-breather.
Diving cylinders are usually manufactured from aluminum or steel alloys, and when used on a scuba set are normally fitted with one of two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator. Other accessories such as manifolds, cylinder bands, protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided. Various configurations of harness may be used by the diver to carry a cylinder or cylinders while diving, depending on the application. Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume (known as water capacity) of between and a maximum working pressure rating from . Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes, such as 0.5, 1.5 and 2 litres, however these are usually used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys, dry suits and buoyancy compensators rather than breathing. Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder, a pair of similar cylinders, or a main cylinder and a smaller &quot;pony&quot; cylinder, carried on the diver&#x27;s back or clipped onto the harness at the side. Paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent. In technical diving, more than two scuba cylinders may be needed.

When pressurized, the gas is compressed up to several hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation is based on the amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labeling for diving cylinders. Periodic testing and inspection of diving cylinders is often obligatory to ensure the safety of operators of filling stations. Pressurized diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labeling may also apply.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;diving cylinder&quot; tends to be used by gas equipment engineers, manufacturers, support professionals, and divers speaking British English. &quot;Scuba tank&quot; or &quot;diving tank&quot; is more often used colloquially by non-professionals and native speakers of American English. The term &quot;oxygen tank&quot; is commonly used by non-divers; however, this is a misnomer since these cylinders typically contain (compressed atmospheric) breathing air, or an oxygen-enriched air mix. They rarely contain pure oxygen, except when used for rebreather diving, shallow decompression stops in technical diving or for in-water oxygen recompression therapy. Breathing pure oxygen at depths greater than can result in oxygen toxicity.

Diving cylinders have also been referred to as bottles or flasks, usually preceded with the word scuba, diving, air, or bailout. Cylinders may also be called aqualungs, a genericized trademark derived from the Aqua-lung equipment made by the Aqua Lung/La Spirotechnique company, although that is more properly applied to an open circuit scuba set or open circuit diving regulator.

Diving cylinders may also be specified by their application, as in bailout cylinders, stage cylinders, decocompression (deco) cylinders, si-demount cylinders, pony cylinders, suit inflation cylinders, etc. The same cylinder, rigged in the same way, may be used as a bailout cylinder, a decompression cylinder or a stage cylinder.

== Parts ==
The functional diving cylinder consists of a pressure vessel and a cylinder valve. There are usually one or more optional accessories depending on the specific application.

===The pressure vessel===

The pressure vessel is a seamless cylinder normally made of cold-extruded aluminum or forged steel. Filament wound composite cylinders are used in fire fighting breathing apparatus and oxygen first aid equipment because of their low weight, but are rarely used for diving, due to their high positive buoyancy. They are occasionally used when portability for accessing the dive site is critical, such as in cave diving. Composite cylinders certified to ISO-11119-2 or ISO-11119-3 may only be used for underwater applications if they are manufactured in accordance with the requirements for underwater use and are marked &quot;UW&quot;. The pressure vessel comprises a cylindrical section of even wall thickness, with a thicker base at one end, and domed shoulder with a central neck to attach a cylinder valve or manifold at the other end.

Occasionally other materials may be used. Inconel has been used for non-magnetic and highly corrosion resistant oxygen compatible spherical high-pressure gas containers for the US Navy&#x27;s Mk-15 and Mk-16 mixed gas rebreathers, and a few other military rebreathers.

====Aluminium====
An especially common rental cylinder provided at tropical dive resorts is the &quot;aluminium-S80&quot; which is an aluminum cylinder design with an internal volume of rated to hold a nominal volume of of atmospheric pressure gas at its rated working pressure of . Aluminum cylinders are also often used where divers carry many cylinders, such as in technical diving in water which is warm enough that the dive suit does not provide much buoyancy, because the greater buoyancy of aluminum cylinders reduces the amount of extra buoyancy the diver would need to achieve neutral buoyancy. They are also sometimes preferred when carried as &quot;side mount&quot; or &quot;sling&quot; cylinders as the near neutral buoyancy allows them to hang comfortably along the sides of the diver&#x27;s body, without disturbing trim, and they can be handed off to another diver or stage dropped with a minimal effect on buoyancy. Most aluminum cylinders are flat bottomed, allowing them to stand upright on a level surface, but some were manufactured with domed bottoms. When in use, the cylinder valve and regulator add mass to the top of the cylinder, so the base tends to be relatively buoyant, and aluminum drop-cylinders tend to rest on the bottom in an inverted position if near neutral buoyancy. For the same reason they tend to hang at an angle when carried as sling cylinders unless constrained or ballasted.

The aluminum alloys used for diving cylinders are 6061 and 6351. 6351 alloy is subject to sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture, but many old cylinders are still in service, and are still legal and considered safe if they pass the periodic hydrostatic, visual and eddy current tests required by regulation and as specified by the manufacturer. The number of cylinders that have failed catastrophically is in the order of 50 out of some 50 million manufactured. A larger number have failed the eddy current test and visual inspection of neck threads, or have leaked and been removed from service without harm to anyone.

Aluminum cylinders are usually manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminum billets in a process which first presses the walls and base, then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminum diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.

====Steel====

In cold water diving, where a person wearing a highly buoyant thermally insulating dive suit has a large excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.
Steel cylinders are more susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It is not difficult to monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.

Steel cylinders are manufactured with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile allows them to stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres (&quot;J&quot;). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.

Steel alloys used for dive cylinder manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard. For example, the US standard DOT 3AA requires the use of open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality. Approved alloys include 4130X, NE-8630, 9115, 9125, Carbon-boron and Intermediate manganese, with specified constituents, including manganese and carbon, and molybdenum, chromium, boron, nickel or zirconium.

Steel cylinders may be manufactured from steel plate discs, which are cold drawn to a cylindrical cup form, in two or three stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising and final inspection.

An alternative production method is backward extrusion of a heated steel billet, similar to the cold extrusion process for aluminium cylinders, followed by hot drawing and bottom forming to reduce wall thickness, and trimming of the top edge in preparation for shoulder and neck formation by hot spinning. The other processes are much the same for all production methods.

====Cylinder neck====
The &quot;neck&quot; of the cylinder is the part of the end which is shaped as a narrow concentric cylinder, and internally threaded to fit a cylinder valve. There are several standards for neck threads, these include:
* Taper thread (17E), with a 12% taper right hand thread, standard Whitworth 55° form with a pitch of 14 threads per inch (5.5 threads per cm) and pitch diameter at the top thread of the cylinder of . These connections are sealed using thread tape and torqued to between on steel cylinders, and between on aluminium cylinders.
Parallel threads are made to several standards:
* M25x2 ISO parallel thread, which is sealed by an O-ring and torqued to on steel, and on aluminum cylinders;
* M18x1.5 parallel thread, which is sealed by an O-ring, and torqued to on steel cylinders, and on aluminum cylinders;
* 3/4&quot;x14 BSP parallel thread, which has a 55° Whitworth thread form, a pitch diameter of and a pitch of 14 threads per inch (1.814 mm);
* 3/4&quot;x14 NGS (NPSM) parallel thread, sealed by an O-ring, torqued to on aluminium cylinders, which has a 60° thread form, a pitch diameter of , and a pitch of 14 threads per inch (5.5 threads per cm);
* 3/4&quot;x16 UNF, sealed by an O-ring, torqued to on aluminium cylinders.
*7/8&quot;x14 UNF, sealed by an O-ring.
The 3/4&quot;NGS and 3/4&quot;BSP are very similar, having the same pitch and a pitch diameter that only differs by about , but they are not compatible, as the thread forms are different.

All parallel thread valves are sealed using an O-ring at top of the neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve.

====Permanent stamp markings====
The shoulder of the cylinder carries &quot;stamp markings&quot; providing required information about the cylinder.

Universally required markings include:
*Identification of the manufacturer
*Manufacturing standard, which will identify the material specification 
*Serial number
*Date of manufacture
*Charging pressure
*Capacity
*Mark of the accredited testing agency
*Date of each re-validation test
A variety of other markings may be required by national regulations, or may be optional.

===The cylinder valve===
The purpose of the &quot;cylinder valve&quot; or &quot;pillar valve&quot; is to control gas flow to and from the pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic &quot;dip tube&quot; or &quot;valve snorkel&quot; screwed into the bottom of the valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.

Cylinder valves are classified by four basic aspects: the thread specification, the connection to the regulator, pressure rating, and other distinguishing features. Standards relating to the specifications and manufacture of cylinder valves include ISO 10297 and CGA V-9 Standard for Gas Cylinder Valves. The other distinguishing features include outlet configuration, handedness and valve knob orientation, number of outlets and valves (1 or 2), shape of the valve body, presence of a reserve valve, manifold connections, and the presence of a bursting disk overpressure relief device.

Cylinder threads may be in two basic configurations: Taper thread and parallel thread. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences. The valve pressure rating must be compatible with the cylinder pressure rating. Parallel threads are more tolerant of repeated removal and refitting of the valve for inspection and testing.

===Accessories===
Additional components for convenience, protection or other functions, not directly required for the function as a pressure vessel.

====Manifolds====

A cylinder manifold is a tube which connects two cylinders together so that the contents of both can be supplied to one or more regulators.
There are three commonly used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is attached to the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.

More recently, manifolds have become available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder side of the valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, as there is no valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.

Cylinders may also be manifolded by a removable whip, commonly associated with dual outlet cylinder valves, and the on board emergency gas supply of a diving bell is usually manifolded by semi-permanent metal alloy pipes between the cylinder valves.

====Valve cage====
Also known as a manifold cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to the neck of the cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use, and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead (roll-off). A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.

====Cylinder bands====
Cylinder bands are straps, usually of stainless steel, which are used to clamp two cylinders together as a twin set. The cylinders may be manifolded or independent. It is usual to use a cylinder band near the top of the cylinder, just below the shoulders, and one lower down. The conventional distance between centre-lines for bolting to a backplate is .

====Cylinder boot====

A cylinder boot is a hard rubber or plastic cover which fits over the base of a diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, and in the case of round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.

====Cylinder net====
A cylinder net is a tubular net which is stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom. The function is to protect the paintwork from scratching, and on booted cylinders it also helps drain the surface between the boot and cylinder, which reduces corrosion problems under the boot. Mesh size is usually about . Some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an entrapment hazard in some environments such as caves and the interior of wrecks. Occasionally sleeves made from other materials may be used to protect the cylinder.

====Cylinder handle====

A cylinder handle may be fitted, usually clamped to the neck, to conveniently carry the cylinder. This can also increase the risk of snagging in an enclosed environment.

====Dust caps and plugs====
These are used to cover the cylinder valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, making it difficult to remove.

==Pressure rating==
The thickness of the cylinder walls is directly related to the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the cylinder. A low-pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high-pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.

===Working pressure===
Scuba cylinders are technically all high-pressure gas containers, but within the industry in the United States there are three nominal working pressure ratings (WP) in common use;
: low pressure (2400 to 2640 psi — 165 to 182 bar),
: standard (3000 psi — 207 bar), and 
: high pressure (3300 to 3500 psi — 227 to 241 bar).
US-made aluminum cylinders usually have a standard working pressure of , and the compact aluminum range have a working pressure of .
Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10%, and this is indicated by a &#x27;+&#x27; symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate higher standard periodical hydrostatic test.

Those parts of the world using the metric system usually refer to the cylinder pressure directly in bar but would generally use &quot;high pressure&quot; to refer to a working pressure cylinder, which can not be used with a yoke connector on the regulator. 232 bar is a very popular working pressure for scuba cylinders in both steel and aluminum.

===Test pressure===
Hydro-static test pressure (TP) is specified by the manufacturing standard. This is usually 1.5 × working pressure, or in the United States, 1.67 × working pressure.

===Developed pressure===

Cylinder working pressure is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15 °C or 20 °C. and cylinders also have a specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65 °C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable in terms of the standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified working pressure stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65 °C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.

===Pressure monitoring===


The internal pressure of a diving cylinder is measured at several stages during use. It is checked before filling, monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed. This can all be done with the pressure gauge on the filling equipment.

Pressure is also generally monitored by the diver. Firstly as a check of contents before use, then during use to ensure that there is enough left at all times to allow a safe completion of the dive, and often after a dive for purposes of record keeping and personal consumption rate calculation.

The pressure is also monitored during hydrostatic testing to ensure that the test is done to the correct pressure.

Most diving cylinders do not have a dedicated pressure gauge, but this is a standard feature on most diving regulators, and a requirement on all filling facilities.

There are two widespread standards for pressure measurement of diving gas. In the United States and perhaps a few other places the pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), and the rest of the world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.

== Capacity ==
There are two commonly used conventions for describing the capacity of a diving cylinder. One is based on the internal volume of the cylinder. The other is based on nominal volume of gas stored.

===Internal volume===
The internal volume is commonly quoted in most countries using the metric system. This information is required by ISO 13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This has resulted in the term &#x27;water capacity&#x27;, abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It&#x27;s almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at two decimal places accuracy.

====Standard sizes by internal volume====
These are representative examples, for a larger range, the on-line catalogues of the manufacturers such as Faber, Pressed Steel, Luxfer, and Catalina may be consulted. The applications are typical, but not exclusive.

===Nominal volume of gas stored===
The nominal volume of gas stored is commonly quoted as the cylinder capacity in the USA. It is a measure of the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include &#x27;free gas volume&#x27; or &#x27;free gas equivalent&#x27;. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.

The nominal working pressure is not necessarily the same as the actual working pressure used. Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a &#x27;+&#x27; symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.

For example, common Aluminum 80 (Al80) cylinder is an aluminum cylinder which has a nominal &#x27;free gas&#x27; capacity of when pressurized to . It has an internal volume of approximately .

====Standard sizes by volume of gas stored====
* Aluminum C100 is a large (13.l l), high-pressure () cylinder. Heavy at .
* Aluminum S80 is probably the most common cylinder, used by resorts in many parts of the world for back gas, but also popular as a sling cylinder for decompression gas, and as side-mount cylinder in fresh water, as it has nearly neutral buoyancy. These cylinders have an internal volume of approximately and working pressure of . They are also sometimes used as manifolded twins for back mount, but in this application the diver needs more ballast weights than with most steel cylinders of equivalent capacity.
* Aluminium C80 is the high-pressure equivalent, with a water capacity of 10.3 L and working pressure .
* Aluminum S40 is a popular cylinder for side-mount and sling mount bailout and decompression gas for moderate depths, as it is small diameter and nearly neutral buoyancy, which makes it relatively unobtrusive for this mounting style. Internal volume is approximately and working pressure .
* Aluminum S63 (9.0 L) , and steel HP65 (8.2 L) are smaller and lighter than the Al80, but have a lower capacity, and are suitable for smaller divers or shorter dives.
* Steel LP80 and HP80 (10.1 L) at are both more compact and lighter than the Aluminium S80 and are both negatively buoyant, which reduces the amount of ballast weight required by the diver.
* Steel HP119 (14.8 L), HP120 (15.3 L) and HP130 (16.0 L) cylinders provide larger amounts of gas for nitrox or technical diving.

== Physical dimensions ==
Cylinders made from seamless steel and aluminium alloys are described here. The constraints on filament wound composite cylinders will differ:

There are a small number of standardised outside diameters as this is cost effective for manufacture, because most of the same tooling can be shared between cylinders of the same diameter and wall thickness. A limited number of standard diameters is also convenient for sharing accessories such as manifolds, boots and tank bands. Volume within a series with given outside diameter is controlled by wall thickness, which is consistent for material, pressure class, and design standard, and length, which is the basic variable for controlling volume within a series. Mass is determined by these factors and the density of the material. Steel cylinders are available in the following size classes, and possibly others:
* OD = 83mm, 0.8 to 1.8 litres
* OD = 100mm, 2.0 to 4.75 litres
* OD = 115mm, 2.5 to 5.0 litres
* OD = 140mm, 4.0 to 15.0 litres
* OD = 160mm, 6.0 to 16.0 litres
* OD = 171mm, 8.0 to 23.0 litres
* OD = 178mm, 8.0 to 35.0 litres
* OD = 204mm, 10.0 to 40.0 litres
* OD = 229mm, 20.0 to 50.0 litres
* OD = 267mm, 33.0 to 80.0 litres

Wall thickness varies depending on location, material, pressure rating and practical considerations. The sides of the cylindrical section are sufficient to withstand the stresses of a large number of cycles to test pressure, with an allowance for a small amount of material loss due to general corrosion and minor local damage due to abrasion and normal wear and tear of use, and a limited depth of local damage due to pit and line corrosion and physical damage. The amount of damage and material loss allowed is compatible with the visual inspection rejection criteria. Steel cylinders are designed for test stresses to be below the fatigue limit for the alloy. The wall thickness is roughly proportional to diameter for a given test pressure and material strength – if the diameter is double, the basic wall thickness will also double. Wall thickness is also proportional to working pressure and test pressure for a given diameter and material specification. The cylindrical section has the lowest wall thickness, and it is consistent within manufacturing tolerances for the entire cylindrical section.

End thickness allows for considerably more wear and tear and corrosion on the bottom of the cylinder, and the shoulder is made thicker to allow for the variabilities inherent in the manufacturing process for closing the end, and for any stress raisers due to the process of permanent stamp marking. To a large extent bottom thickness distribution of a steel cylinder and shoulder thickness of all metal cylinders are influenced by the manufacturing process, and may be thicker than strictly necessary for strength and corrosion tolerance.

Faber steel cylinders to CE standards have slightly decreased in mass for the same cylinder size from 2023. A 200 bar 15 litre cylinder with 203mm outside diameter domed bottom, reduced from 16.2kg to 145kg. The equivalent 232 bar cylinder reduced from 18.2 to 16.7kg.

=== Buoyancy characteristics ===
The density of a cylinder is concentrated in the ends, which are relatively thick walled and have a lower enclosed volume per unit mass. The details vary depending on the specification, but this tendency is common to both steel and aluminium cylinders, and is more extreme in flat or dished ends. As a consequence, long narrow cylinders are less dense than short wide cylinders for the same material and the same end configuration, while for the same internal volume, a short wide cylinder is heavier than a long narrow cylinder.

Buoyancy of a diving cylinder is only of practical relevance in combination with the attached cylinder valve, scuba regulator and regulator accessories, as it will not be used underwater without them. These accessories are attached to the top of the cylinder, and both decrease the buoyancy of the combined unit and move the centre of gravity towards the top (valved end). This affects the cylinder orientation for sling and side mount.

Back mounted cylinder sets are generally not removed during a dive, and the buoyancy characteristics can be allowed for at the start of the dive, by ensuring that the diver has sufficient reserve buoyancy to float with the cylinders full, and sufficient ballast to remain submerged when the cylinders are all empty. The buoyancy compensator must be sufficient to provide some positive buoyancy at all depths with full cylinders. Adjustments to ballasting can compensate for other buoyancy variables. Inability to remain consistently immersed at the shallowest decompression stop can lead to incomplete decompression and increased risk of decompression sickness.

The change in buoyancy of a diving cylinder during the dive can be more problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may be separated from the diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be or handed off to another diver should not change the diver&#x27;s buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached, as they are likely to be detached for staging or handed off when relatively full. This is less likely to be a problem for a solo diver&#x27;s bailout set, as there will be fewer occasions to remove it during a dive. Side-mount sets for tight penetrations are expected to be swung forward or detached to pass through tight constrictions, and should not grossly affect trim or buoyancy during these maneuvers.

A major manufacturer of steel cylinders, Faber Industrie Spa, claim that their steel cylinders are neutral or slightly negative when empty, but do not specify which pressure rating this refers to, or whether this takes into account the cylinder valve.

== Applications and configurations ==
Divers may carry one cylinder or multiples, depending on the requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when the dive is deeper requires decompression stops, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.

Diving cylinders may serve different purposes. One or two cylinders may be used as a primary breathing source which is intended to be breathed from for most of the dive. A smaller cylinder carried in addition to a larger cylinder is called a &quot;pony bottle&quot;. A cylinder to be used purely as an independent safety reserve is called a &quot;bailout bottle&quot; or emergency gas supply (EGS). A pony bottle is commonly used as a bailout bottle, but this would depend on the time required to surface.

Divers doing technical diving often carry different gases, each in a separate cylinder, for each phase of the dive:
* travel gas is used during the descent and ascent. It is typically air or nitrox with an oxygen content between 21% and 40%. Travel gas is needed when the bottom gas is and therefore is unsafe to breathe in shallow water. The travel gas may also be used as a decompression gas.
* bottom gas is only breathed at depth. It is typically a helium-based gas which is low in oxygen (below 21%) or hypoxic (below 17%).
* decompression gas, or deco gas, is used during the ascent and at the decompression stops, and is generally one or more nitrox mixes with a high oxygen content, or pure oxygen, to accelerate decompression.
* a is a cylinder holding reserve, travel or deco gas. They are usually carried side slung (sling mounted), clipped on either side of the diver to the harness of the backplate and wing or buoyancy compensator, rather than on the back, and may be left on the distance line to be picked up for use on return (stage dropped). The term originally implied that the cylinder was intended for use during a specific stage of the dive, but is also generically used for any independent open circuit scuba set other then back gas carried by a scuba diver. Commonly divers use aluminium stage cylinders, particularly in fresh water, because they are nearly neutrally buoyant and can be removed underwater with less effect on the diver&#x27;s overall buoyancy.
* Suit inflation gas may be taken from a breathing gas cylinder or may be supplied from a small independent cylinder. Helium based gases are avoided for this use because they have a higher thermal conductivity. Argon can be used for this purpose as it is a better insulator than air.
* Bailout gas is sometimes carried in an additional independent scuba cylinder with its own regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies if the primary breathing gas supply should fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra equipment is not needed or used. This extra cylinder is known as a bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.

=== Open-circuit scuba ===
For open-circuit scuba divers, there are several basic options for the combined cylinder and regulator system configuration:

==== Single cylinder back mount====
A single cylinder configuration is usually a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply and no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers to rely on a buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most entry level scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.

A single cylinder with dual regulators consists of a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. This system is mostly used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional regulator redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, it is hard to reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.

====Main cylinder plus a small independent cylinder====
This configuration uses a larger, back mounted main cylinder along with an independent smaller cylinder, often called a &quot;pony&quot; or &quot;bailout cylinder&quot;. The diver has two independent systems, but the total &#x27;breathing system&#x27; is now heavier, and more expensive to buy and maintain.

The pony is typically a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines the depth of dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver&#x27;s buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver&#x27;s back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver&#x27;s side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.

Another type of small independent air source is a hand-held cylinder filled with about of free air with a diving regulator directly attached, such as the Spare Air. This source provides only a few breaths of gas at depth and is most suitable as a shallow water bailout.

====Independent twins====

 or independent doubles consists of two independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets only work well with air-integrated dive computers which can monitor two or more cylinders. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver&#x27;s back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.

====Plain manifolded twins====
Plain manifolded twin sets, or manifolded doubles with a single regulator, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold but only one regulator is attached to the manifold. This makes it relatively simple and cheap but means there is no redundant functionality to the breathing system, only a double gas supply. This arrangement was fairly common in the early days of scuba when low-pressure cylinders were manifolded to provide a larger air supply than was possible from the available single cylinders. It is still in use for large capacity bailout sets for deep commercial diving.
====Isolation manifolded twins====
 or manifolded doubles with two regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In the event of a problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolation valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.
====Sling cylinders====
 are a configuration of independent cylinders used for technical diving and solo diving. They are independent cylinders with their own regulators and are carried clipped to the harness at the side of the diver. Their purpose may be to carry stage, travel, decompression, or bailout gas while the back mounted cylinder(s) carry bottom gas. Stage cylinders carry gas to extend bottom time, travel gas is used to reach a depth where bottom gas may be safely used if it is hypoxic at the surface, and decompression gas is gas intended to be used during decompression to accelerate the elimination of inert gases. Bailout gas is an emergency supply intended to be used to surface if the main gas supply is lost.
====Side mount cylinders====
Side-mount cylinders are cylinders clipped to the harness at the diver&#x27;s sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders. They may be used in conjunction with other side-mounted stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. Side mounting is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.

====Hand-off cylinders====

A is a scuba set, usually rigged for sling or side-mount, that can be passed (handed off) to another diver for use during a contingency or a planned part of a dive, by a rescuer or a support or stand-by diver. The handing off of the cylinder allows the receiving diver to maneuver independently of the donor, and the hand-off procedure should not compromise either diver&#x27;s ability to maintain neutral buoyancy if it is needed for safety. In most cases it will be easier for the receiving diver to adjust buoyancy by adding gas to their buoyancy compensator to compensate for the mass of gas in a cylinder that is neutrally buoyant when empty than to have to dump gas from the BC when the gas in the cylinder is used up, if correctly weighted.

====Drop cylinders====
Drop cylinders, or stage drop cylinders, are cylinders complete with regulator and pressure gauge, usually rigged as sling or side mount cylinders, which are intended to be taken off and left at the guideline during the early part of a dive, to be collected on the way back.

=== Rebreathers ===
Diving cylinders are used in rebreather diving in two roles:

* As part of the rebreather itself. The rebreather must have at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder; many have two and some have more cylinders. Due to the lower gas consumption of rebreathers, these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open-circuit dives. Rebreathers may use internal cylinders, or may also be supplied from &quot;off-board&quot; cylinders, which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather, but connected to it by a flexible hose and coupling and usually carried side slung. 
:* oxygen rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder
:* semi-closed circuit rebreathers have a cylinder which usually contains nitrox or a helium based gas.
:* closed circuit rebreathers have an oxygen cylinder and a &quot;diluent&quot; cylinder, which contains air, nitrox or a helium based gas.

*Rebreather divers also often carry an external bailout system if the internal diluent cylinder is too small for safe use for bailout for the planned dive. The bailout system is one or more independent breathing gas sources for use if the rebreather should fail:
** Open-circuit: One or more open circuit scuba sets. The number of open-circuit bailout sets, their capacity and the breathing gases they contain depend on the depth and decompression needs of the dive. So on a deep, technical rebreather dive, the diver will need a bail out &quot;bottom&quot; gas and a bailout &quot;decompression&quot; gas(es). On such a dive, it is usually the capacity and duration of the bailout sets that limits the depth and duration of the dive - not the capacity of the rebreather.
** Closed-circuit: A second rebreather containing one or more independent diving cylinders for its gas supply. Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.

=== Surface supplied diver emergency gas supply ===

Surface supplied divers are usually required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient to allow them to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver&#x27;s safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted on the side of the helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.

=== Emergency gas supply on diving bells ===

Diving bells are required to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.

===Suit inflation cylinders===
Suit inflation gas may be carried in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may also need to be colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant.

===Other uses of compressed gas cylinders in diving operations===
Divers also use gas cylinders above water for storage of oxygen for first aid treatment of diving disorders and as part of storage &quot;banks&quot; for diving air compressor stations, gas blending, surface supplied breathing gas and gas supplies for decompression chambers and saturation systems. Similar cylinders are also used for many purposes not connected to diving. For these applications they are not diving cylinders and may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as cylinders used underwater.

== Gas calculations ==

It is necessary to know the approximate length of time that a diver can breathe from a given cylinder so that a safe dive profile can be planned.

There are two parts to this problem: The capacity of the cylinder and the consumption by the diver.

=== The cylinder&#x27;s capacity to store gas ===
Two features of the cylinder determine its gas carrying capacity:

* internal volume : this normally ranges between 3 litres and 18 litres for single cylinders.
* cylinder gas pressure : when filled this normally ranges between , but the actual value should be measured for a real situation, as the cylinder may not be full.

At the pressures which apply to most diving cylinders, the ideal gas equation is sufficiently accurate in almost all cases, as the variables that apply to gas consumption generally overwhelm the error in the ideal gas assumption.

To calculate the quantity of gas:

:Volume of gas at atmospheric pressure = (cylinder volume) x (cylinder pressure) / (atmospheric pressure)

In those parts of the world using the metric system the calculation is relatively simple as atmospheric pressure may be approximated as 1 bar,
So a 12-litre cylinder at 232 bar would hold almost 12 × 232 / 1 =  of air at atmospheric pressure (also known as free air).

In the US the capacity of a diving cylinder is specified directly in cubic feet of free air at the nominal working pressure, as the calculation from internal volume and working pressure is relatively tedious in imperial units. For example, in the US and in many diving resorts in other countries, one might find aluminum cylinders of US manufacture with an internal capacity of filled to a working pressure of ; Taking atmospheric pressure as 14.7 psi, this gives 0.39 × 3000 / 14.7 = 80 ft3 These cylinders are described as &quot;80 cubic foot cylinders&quot;, (the common &quot;aluminum 80&quot;).

Up to about 200 bar the ideal gas law remains useful and the relationship between the pressure, size of the cylinder and gas contained in the cylinder is approximately linear; at higher pressures this linearity no longer applies, and there is proportionally less gas in the cylinder. A 3-litre cylinder filled to 300 bar will only carry contain of atmospheric pressure air and not the expected from the ideal gas law. Equations have been proposed which give more accurate solutions at high pressure, including the Van der Waals equation. Compressibility at higher pressures also varies between gases and mixtures of gases.

=== Diver gas consumption ===

There are three main factors to consider:
* the rate at which the diver consumes gas, specified as surface air consumption (SAC) or respiratory minute volume (RMV) of the diver. In normal conditions this will be between 10 and 25 litres per minute (L/min) for divers who are not working hard. At times of extreme high work rate, breathing rates can rise to 95 litres per minute. For International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) commercial diving gas planning purposes, a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used, whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies. RMV is controlled by blood CO2 levels, and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures, so does not change with depth. The very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long the supply will last, and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible. Scuba divers are expected to monitor the remaining gas pressure sufficiently often that they are aware of how much is still available at all times during a dive.
* ambient pressure: the depth of the dive determines this. The ambient pressure at the surface is at sea level. For every in seawater the diver descends, the pressure increases by . As a diver goes deeper, the breathing gas is delivered at a pressure equal to ambient water pressure, and the amount of gas used is proportional to the pressure. Thus, it requires twice as much mass of gas to fill the diver&#x27;s lungs at as it does at the surface, and three times as much at . The mass consumption of breathing gas by the diver is similarly affected.
* time at each depth. (usually approximated as time at each depth range)

To calculate the quantity of gas consumed:

: gas consumed = surface air consumption × time × ambient pressure

Metric examples:
:A diver with a RMV of 20 L/min at 30 msw (4 bar), will consume 20 × 4 × 1 = 80 L/min surface equivalent. 
:A diver with a RMV of 40 L/min at 50 msw (6 bar) for 10 minutes will consume 40 × 6 × 10 = 2400 litres of free air – the full capacity of a 12-litre 200 bar cylinder.

Imperial examples:
:A diver with a SAC of 0.5 cfm (cubic feet per minute) at 100 fsw (4 ata) will consume 0.5 × 4 × 1 = 2 cfm surface equivalent.
:A diver with a SAC of 1 cfm at 231 fsw (8 ata) for 10 minutes will consume 1 × 8 × 10 = 80 ft3 of free air – the full capacity of an 80 ft3 cylinder

Keeping this in mind, it is not hard to see why technical divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.

=== Breathing gas endurance ===
The amount of time that a diver can breathe from a cylinder is also known as air or gas endurance.

Maximum breathing duration (T) for a given depth can be calculated as

: T = available air / rate of consumption

which, using the ideal gas law, is

: T = (available cylinder pressure × cylinder volume) / (rate of air consumption at surface) × (ambient pressure)

This may be written as

: (1) T = (PC-PA)×VC/(SAC×PA)

with

: T = Time 
: PC = Cylinder Pressure 
: VC = Cylinder internal volume 
: PA = Ambient Pressure 
: SAC = Surface air consumption 
in any consistent system of units.

Ambient pressure (PA) is the surrounding water pressure at a given depth and is made up of the sum of the hydrostatic pressure and the air pressure at the surface. It is calculated as

: (2) PA = D×g×ρ + atmospheric pressure

with

: D = depth 
: g = Standard gravity 
: ρ = water density 
in a consistent system of units

For metric units, this formula can be approximated by

: (3) PA = D/10 + 1
with depth in m and pressure in bar

Ambient pressure is deducted from cylinder pressure, as the quantity of air represented by PA can in practice not be used for breathing by the diver as it required to balance the ambient pressure of the water.

This formula neglects the cracking pressure required to open both first and second stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, both of which are variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.

However, in normal diving usage, a reserve is always factored in. The reserve is a proportion of the cylinder pressure which a diver will not plan to use other than in case of emergency. The reserve may be a quarter or a third of the cylinder pressure or it may be a fixed pressure, common examples are 50 bar and 500 psi. The formula above is then modified to give the usable breathing duration (BT = breathing time) as

: (4) BT = (PC-PR)×VC/(SAC×PA)

where PR is the reserve pressure.

For example, (using the first formula (1) for absolute maximum breathing time), a diver at a depth of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020 kg/m3 (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.

Using the same conditions and a reserve of 50 bar, the formula (4) for usable breathing time is as follows:

: Ambient pressure = water pressure + atmospheric pressure = 15 msw/10 bar per msw + 1 = 2.5 bar
: Usable pressure = fill pressure - reserve pressure = 200 bar - 50 bar = 150 bar
: Usable air = usable pressure × cylinder capacity = 150 bar × 18 litres per bar = 2700 litres
: Rate of consumption = surface air consumption × ambient pressure = 20 litres per minute per bar × 2.5 bar = 50 litres/min
: Usable breathing time = 2700 litres / 50 litres per min = 54 minutes

This would give a dive time of 54 min at 15 m before reaching the reserve of 50 bar.

=== Reserves ===
It is strongly recommended by diver training organisations and codes of practice that a portion of the usable gas of the cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve. The reserve is intended to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.

The size of the reserve depends upon the risks involved during the dive. A deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive. In recreational diving for example, it is recommended that the diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in the cylinder of 500 psi, 50 bar or 25% of the initial capacity, depending on the teaching of the diver training organisation. This is because recreational divers practicing within &quot;no-decompression&quot; limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency. On technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible (due to overhead obstructions) or dangerous (due to the requirement to make decompression stops), divers plan larger margins of safety. The simplest method uses the rule of thirds: one third of the gas supply is planned for the outward journey, one third is for the return journey and one third is a safety reserve.

Some training agencies teach the concept of minimum gas, rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows a diver to calculate an acceptable reserve to get two divers to the surface in an emergency from any point in the planned dive profile.

Professional divers may be required by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas to enable them to reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.

===Weight of gas consumed===
The density of air at sea level and 15 °C is approximately 1.225 kg/m3. Most full-sized diving cylinders used for open circuit scuba hold more than of air when full, and as the air is used, the buoyancy of the cylinder increases by the weight removed. The decrease in external volume of the cylinder due to reduction of internal pressure is relatively small, and can be ignored for practical purposes.

As an example, a 12-litre cylinder may be filled to 230 bar before a dive, and be breathed down to 30 bar before surfacing, using 2,400 litres or 2.4 m3 of free air. The mass of gas used during the dive will depend on the mixture - if air is assumed, it will be approximately .

The loss of the weight of the gas taken from the cylinder makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant towards the end of the dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.

== Filling ==

Diving cylinders are filled by attaching a high-pressure gas supply to the cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, both of which are hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed. Rate of filling must be limited to avoid excessive heating, the temperature of cylinder and contents must remain below the maximum working temperature specified by the applicable standard. A flexible high pressure hose used for this purpose is known as a filling whip.
=== Pre-fill inspection and recording of details===
Before filling a cylinder the filling operator may be required by regulations, code of practice, or operations manual, to inspect the cylinder and valve for any obvious external defects or damage, and to reject for filling any cylinder that does not comply with the standards. It may also be required to record cylinder details in the filling log.

=== Filling from a compressor ===

Breathing air supply can come directly from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.

The quality of compressed breathing air for diving is usually specified by national or organisational standards, and the steps generally taken to assure the air quality include:
* use of a compressor rated for breathing air,
* use of compressor lubricants rated for breathing air,
* filtration of intake air to remove particulate contamination,
* positioning of the compressor air intake in clean air clear of known sources of contaminants such as internal combustion exhaust fumes, sewer vents etc.
* removal of condensate from the compressed air by water separators. This may be done between stages on the compressor as well as after compression.
* filtration after compression to remove remaining water, oil, and other contaminants using specialized filter media such as desiccants, molecular sieve or activated carbon. Traces of carbon monoxide may be catalyzed to carbon dioxide by Hopcalite.
* periodical air quality tests,
* scheduled filter changes and maintenance of the compressor

===Filling from high-pressure storage===

Cylinders may also be filled directly from high-pressure storage systems by decanting, with or without pressure boosting to reach the desired charging pressure.
Cascade filling may be used for efficiency when multiple storage cylinders are available. High-pressure storage is commonly used when blending nitrox, heliox and trimix diving gases, and for oxygen for rebreathers and decompression gas.

Nitrox and trimix blending may include decanting the oxygen and/or helium, and topping up to working pressure using a compressor, after which the gas mixture must be analysed and the cylinder labeled with the gas composition.

=== Temperature change during filling ===
Compression of ambient air causes a temperature rise of the gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.

Charging an empty dive cylinder also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank at room temperature decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but the temperature of the gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.

Wet filling: Excess heat can be removed by immersion of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also increase the risk of water contaminating the valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into the cylinder during filling.

Dry filling: Cylinders may also be filled without water-bath cooling, and may be charged to above the nominal working pressure to the developed pressure appropriate to the temperature when filled. As the gas cools to ambient temperature, the pressure decreases, and will reach rated charging pressure at the rated temperature.

=== Safety and legal issues ===
Legal constraints to filling scuba cylinders will vary by jurisdiction.

In South Africa cylinders may be filled for commercial purposes by a person who is competent in the use of the filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong outflow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.

=== Gas purity and testing ===
Diving cylinders should only be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.

=== Handling of specialty gases ===
Special precautions need to be taken with gases other than air:
* oxygen in high concentrations is a major cause of fire and rust.
* oxygen should be very carefully transferred from one cylinder to another and only ever stored in containers that are cleaned and labeled for oxygen service.
* gas mixtures containing proportions of oxygen other than 21% could be extremely dangerous to divers who are unaware of the proportion of oxygen in them. All cylinders should be labeled with their composition.
* cylinders containing a high oxygen content must be cleaned for the use of oxygen and their valves lubricated only with oxygen service grease to reduce the chance of combustion.

Specialty mixed gas charging will almost always involve supply cylinders of high purity gas sourced from an industrial gas supplier.
Oxygen and helium should be stored, mixed and compressed in well ventilated spaces. Oxygen because any leaks could constitute a fire hazard, and helium because it is an asphyxiant. Neither gas can be identified by the unaided human body.

=== Gas contamination ===
Contaminated breathing gas at depth can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable at the surface ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide – a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide – a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.

Keeping the cylinder slightly pressurized at all times during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of the cylinder with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper than where the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.

Contamination by water during filling may be due to two causes. Inadequate filtration and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly to the extent that it may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.

=== Catastrophic failures during filling ===
The blast caused by a sudden release of the gas pressure inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.
Tank bursting due to over-pressure may be prevented by a pressure-relief burst disc fitted to the cylinder valve, which bursts if the cylinder is over-pressurized and vents air at a rapid controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also occur during filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.

Other failure modes that are a hazard while filling include valve thread failure, which can cause the valve to blow out of the cylinder neck, and filling whip failure.

==Periodic inspection and testing of diving cylinders==

Most countries require diving cylinders to be checked on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may be very different from the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment.
A hydrostatic test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 of the working pressure) and measuring its volume before and after the test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.

An inspection includes external and internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria vary according to the published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding. Very few cylinders are failed by the hydrostatic test. Almost all cylinders that fail are failed according to visual inspection criteria.

When a cylinder is manufactured, its specification, including &quot;manufacturer&quot;, &quot;working pressure&quot;, &quot;test pressure&quot;, &quot;date of manufacture&quot;, &quot;capacity&quot; and &quot;weight&quot; are stamped on the cylinder. After a cylinder passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date in some countries such as Germany), is punched into the shoulder of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time. The international standard for the stamp format is &quot;ISO 13769, Gas cylinders - Stamp marking&quot;.

Filling station operators may be required to check these details before filling the cylinder and may refuse to fill non-standard or out-of-test cylinders. 

===Intervals between inspections and tests===
A cylinder is due to be inspected and tested at the first time it is to be filled after the expiry of the interval as specified by the United Nations &quot;Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations&quot;, or as specified by national or international standards applicable in the region of use.

*In the United States, an annual visual inspection is not required by the USA DOT, though they do require a hydrostatic test every five years. The visual inspection requirement is a diving industry standard based on observations made during a review by the National Underwater Accident Data Center.
*In European Union countries a visual inspection is required every 2.5 years, and a hydrostatic test every five years.
*In Norway a hydrostatic test (including a visual inspection) is required 3 years after production date, then every 2 years.
*Legislation in Australia requires that cylinders are hydrostatically tested every twelve months.
*In South Africa a hydrostatic test is required every 4 years, and visual inspection every 2 years for cylinders to be refilled by a filling station within the jurisdiction of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. Eddy current testing of neck threads must be done according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations.

===Procedures for periodic inspections and tests===

If a cylinder passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests can be applied to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.
Before starting work the cylinder must be identified from the labelling and permanent stamp markings, and the ownership and contents verified, and the valve must be removed after depressurising and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. Before inspection the cylinder must be clean and free of loose coatings, corrosion products and other materials which may obscure the surface.

The cylinder is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations and excessive wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination to identify any damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove a significant amount of wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.

While the valve is off, the threads of cylinder and valve are checked to identify the thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves that are to be reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.

After the tests have been satisfactorily completed, a cylinder passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking will include the registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.

===Cleaning===

Internal cleaning of diving cylinders may be required to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.

External cleaning may also be required to remove contaminants, corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, which may not be exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.

===Service life===
The service life of steel and aluminium diving cylinders is limited by the cylinder continuing to pass visual inspection and hydrostatic tests. There is no expiry date based on age, length of service or number of fills.

== Safety ==
Before any cylinder is filled, verification of inspection and testing dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions, and are prudent even if not legally required. Inspection dates can be checked by looking at the visual inspection label and the hydrostatic test date is stamped on the shoulder of the cylinder.

Before use the user should verify the contents of the cylinder and check the function of the cylinder valve. This is usually done with a regulator connected to control the flow. Pressure and gas mixture are critical information for the diver, and the valve should open freely without sticking or leaking from the spindle seals. Failure to recognize that the cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre-dive check. Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell. If the gas does not smell right it should not be used. Breathing gas should be almost free of smell, though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common. No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible.

A neatly assembled setup, with regulators, gauges, and delicate computers stowed inside the BCD, or clipped where they will not be walked on, and stowed under the boat bench or secured to a rack, is the practice of a competent diver.

As the scuba set is a life support system, no unauthorised person should touch a diver&#x27;s assembled scuba gear, even to move it, without their knowledge and approval.

Full cylinders should not be exposed to temperatures above 65 °C and cylinders should not be filled to pressures greater than the developed pressure appropriate to the certified working pressure of the cylinder.

Cylinders should be clearly labelled with their current contents. A generic &quot;Nitrox&quot;, &quot;Heliox&quot;, or &quot;Trimix&quot; label will alert the user that the contents may not be air, and must be analysed before use. A nitrox label requires analysis of oxygen fraction, and assumes that the rest is nitrogen, and a trimix label requires analysis of both oxygen and helium fractions for full information for decompression. In some parts of the world a label is required specifically indicating that the contents are air, and in other places a colour code without additional labels indicates by default that the contents are air. In other places the default assumption is that the contents of any cylinder with a scuba cylinder valve are air, regardless of cylinder colour, unless specifically labelled to indicate other contents.

In a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. If the vessel contents are ignitable or a contaminant is present this event may result in an explosion.

===Manufacturing standards===

High pressure gas storage cylinders are manufactured to a number of national and international standards. National standards may refer to other national standards as accepted alternatives. When a standard is superseded, cylinders manufactured to previously accepted standards usually remain legal for continued use provided that they continue to pass inspections and testing as currently required.

=== Accidents ===
The major diving accident and fatality research studies that have been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network, the Diving Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with the diving cylinder.

Some recorded accidents associated with diving cylinders:
*Valve ejected due to mix up with valve threads 3/4&quot;NPSM and 3/4&quot;BSP(F) caused damage to a dive shop compressor room.
*A valve ejected during filling due to incompatible thread killed the operator by impact to the chest.
*A valve failed on a diver&#x27;s emergency cylinder on a diving support vessel during preparation for a dive injuring five divers. The cylinder valve was ejected at 180 bar due to incompatible thread. Pillar valve was M25x2 parallel thread and cylinder was a 3/4″x14 BSP parallel thread.
*A valve ejected due to incompatible thread (metric valve in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by impact on the back of the helmet during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by the helmet.
*Diving instructor&#x27;s leg nearly amputated by ejected valve while attempting to remove valve from pressurised cylinder.
*Valve ejected during filling due to thread failure, sank dive boat. Vented bursting disk retainers in the cylinder valves had been replaced by solid screws.
*Filling hose failure severely injured operator when the hose hit his face. The wound exposed the jaw bone, and 14 stitches were needed to close the wound.

Cases of lateral epicondylitis have been reported caused by the handling of diving cylinders.

=== Handling ===
Cylinders should not be left standing unattended unless secured so that they can not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.

=== Long-term storage ===
Breathing quality gases do not normally deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminum cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65 °C. If there is any doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would be an indication that the cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.

Aluminum cylinders have a low tolerance for heat, and a cylinder containing less than may lose sufficient strength in a fire to explode before the internal pressure rises enough to rupture the bursting disc, so storing aluminum cylinders with a bursting disc has a lower explosion risk in case of fire if stored either full or nearly empty.

=== Transportation ===
Diving cylinders are classified by the UN as dangerous goods for transportation purposes (US: Hazardous materials). Selecting the Proper Shipping Name (well known by the abbreviation PSN) is a way to help ensure that the dangerous goods offered for transport accurately represent the hazards.

IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) 55th Edition defines the Proper Shipping Name as &quot;the name to be used to describe a particular article or substance in all shipping documents and notifications and, where appropriate, on packagings&quot;.

The International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) defines the Proper Shipping Name as &quot;that portion of the entry most accurately describing the goods in the Dangerous Goods List which is shown in upper-case characters (plus any letters which form an integral part of the name).&quot;


====International air====
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air states that provided that pressure in diving cylinders is less than , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies have the right to refuse the carriage of certain items.

====Europe====

Since 1996 the carriage of dangerous goods legislation of the UK has been harmonized with that of Europe.

Road transport

The 2009 (amended 2011) UK Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations (CDG Regulations) implement the European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR). Dangerous goods to be carried internationally in road vehicles must comply with standards for the packaging and labelling of the dangerous goods, and appropriate construction and operating standards for the vehicles and crew.

The regulations cover transportation of gas cylinders in a vehicle in a commercial environment. Transportation of pressurised diving gas cylinders with a combined water capacity of less than 1000 litres on a vehicle for personal use is exempt from ADR.

Transport of gas cylinders in a vehicle, for commercial purposes, must follow basic legal safety requirements and, unless specifically exempted, must comply with ADR. The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the safety of the vehicle and any load being carried, and insurance for the vehicle should include cover for the carriage of dangerous goods.

Diving gases, including compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and argon, are non-toxic, non flammable, and may be oxidizer or asphyxiant, and are rated in Transport category 3.
The threshold quantity for these gases is 1000 litres combined water capacity of the cylinders. Pressure must be within the rated working pressure of the cylinder.
Empty air cylinders at atmospheric pressure are rated in Transport category 4, and there is no threshold quantity.

Commercial loads below the 1000 litres threshold level are exempt from some of the requirements of ADR, but must comply with basic legal and safety requirements, including:
* Driver training
* Cylinders should be transported in open vehicles, open containers or trailers, with a gas-tight bulkhead separating driver from load. If cylinders must be carried inside a vehicle it must be well ventilated.
* Ventilation. Where gas cylinders are carried inside a vehicle, in the same space as people, the windows should be kept open to allow air to circulate.
* Cylinders must be secured so that they cannot move during transport. They shall not project beyond the sides or ends of the vehicle. It is recommended that cylinders are transported vertically, secured in an appropriate pallet.
* Cylinder valves must be closed whilst in transit and checked that there are no leaks. Where applicable, protective valve caps and covers should be fitted to cylinders before transporting. Cylinders should not be transported with equipment attached to the valve outlet (regulators, hoses etc.).
* A fire extinguisher is required on the vehicle. 
* Gas cylinders may only be transported if they are in-date for periodic inspection and test, except they may be transported when out of date for inspection, testing or disposal.
* Cylinders should be kept cool (at ambient temperatures) and not stowed in places where they will be exposed to sources of excessive heat. 
* Product identification labels attached to cylinders to identify the contents and provide safety advice must not be removed or defaced.
* It is not necessary to mark and label the vehicle if carrying dangerous goods below the threshold level. The use of hazard labels can assist the emergency services, and they may be displayed, but all hazard labels must be removed when the relevant dangerous goods are not being transported.
* When the journey is complete the gas cylinders should be immediately unloaded from the vehicle.

All loads above the threshold must comply with the full requirements of ADR.

==== United States ====
Transportation of hazardous materials for commercial purposes in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200 kPa (29.0 psig/43.8 psia) or greater at 20 °C (68 °F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400 psi) by several manufacturers.

Surface transport

Commercial transportation of breathing gas cylinders with a combined weight of more than 1000 pounds may only be done by a commercial HAZMAT transportation company. Transport of cylinders with a combined weight of less than 1000 pounds requires a manifest, the cylinders must have been tested and inspected to federal standards, and the contents marked on each cylinder. Transportation must be done in a safe manner, with the cylinders restrained from movement. No special licence is required. DOT regulations require content labels for all cylinders under the regulations, but according to PSI, labelling of breathing air will not be enforced. Oxygen or non-air oxidizing (O2 ≥ 23.5% ) mixtures must be labelled. Private (non-commercial) transport of scuba cylinders is not covered by this regulation.

Air transport

Empty scuba tanks or scuba tanks pressurized at less than 200 kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials. Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if the cylinder valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder and the cylinder has an open end to allow for a visual inspection inside.

== Surface finish, colour-coding and labeling ==

Aluminium cylinders may be marketed with an external paint coating, a low temperature powder coating, plain or coloured anodised finish, bead-blasted matt finish, brushed finish, or mill finish (no surface treatment). The material is inherently fairly corrosion resistant if kept clean and dry between uses. Coatings are generally for cosmetic purposes or for legal colour coding requirements.

Steel cylinders are more sensitive to corrosion when wet, and are usually coated to protect against corrosion. The usual finishes include hot-dip galvanisation, zinc-spray, and heavy duty paint systems. Paint may be applied over zinc coatings for cosmetic purposes or color coding. Steel cylinders without anti-corrosion coatings rely on the paint to protect against rusting, and when the paint is damaged, they will rust on the exposed areas. This can be prevented or delayed by repair of the painted finish.

===Worldwide===
The colours permitted for diving cylinders vary considerably by region, and to some extent by the gas mixture contained. In some parts of the world there is no legislation controlling the colour of diving cylinders. In other regions the colour of cylinders used for commercial diving, or for all underwater diving may be specified by national standards.

In many recreational diving settings where air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are identified with a green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.

Cylinders that are used for partial pressure gas blending with pure oxygen may also be required to display an &quot;oxygen service certificate&quot; label indicating they have been prepared for use with high partial pressures and gas fractions of oxygen.

===European Union===

In the European Union gas cylinders may be colour-coded according to EN 1098-3. In the UK this standard is optional. The &quot;shoulder&quot; is the domed top of the cylinder between the parallel section and the pillar valve. For mixed gases, the colours can be either bands or &quot;quarters&quot;.

* Air has either a white (RAL 9010) top and black (RAL 9005) band on the shoulder, or white (RAL 9010) and black (RAL 9005) &quot;quartered&quot; shoulders.
* Heliox has either a white (RAL 9010) top and brown (RAL 8008) band on the shoulder, or white (RAL 9010) and brown (RAL 8008) &quot;quartered&quot; shoulders.
* Nitrox, like Air, has either a white (RAL 9010) top and black (RAL 9005) band on the shoulder, or white (RAL 9010) and black (RAL 9005) &quot;quartered&quot; shoulders.
* Pure oxygen has a white shoulder (RAL 9010).
* Pure helium has a brown shoulder (RAL 9008).
* Trimix has a white, black and brown segmented shoulder.

These breathing gas cylinders must also be labeled with their contents. The label should state the type of breathing gas contained by the cylinder.

====Offshore====

Breathing gas containers for offshore use may be coded and marked according to IMCA D043. IMCA colour coding for individual cylinders allows the body of the cylinder to be any colour that is not likely to cause misinterpretation of the hazard identified by the colour code of the shoulder.


===South Africa===
Scuba cylinders are required to comply with the colours and markings specified in the current revision of SANS 10019. This requirement applies where the cylinders will be filled or used in any situation where the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 applies.
*Cylinder colour is Golden yellow with a French grey shoulder.
*Cylinders containing gases other than air or medical oxygen must have a transparent adhesive label stuck on below the shoulder with the word NITROX or TRIMIX in green and the composition of the gas listed.
*Cylinders containing medical oxygen must be black with a white shoulder.

==Manufacturers==

Cylinder manufacturers identify their products using their registered stamp marking on the cylinder shoulder.

<text>In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, a nuclear reaction is a process in which two nuclei, or a nucleus and an external subatomic particle, collide to produce one or more new nuclides. Thus, a nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another. If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle, they then separate without changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply referred to as a type of nuclear scattering, rather than a nuclear reaction.

In principle, a reaction can involve more than two particles colliding, but because the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the same place is much less than for two nuclei, such an event is exceptionally rare (see triple alpha process for an example very close to a three-body nuclear reaction). The term &quot;nuclear reaction&quot; may refer either to a change in a nuclide induced by collision with another particle or to a spontaneous change of a nuclide without collision.

Natural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between cosmic rays and matter, and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear energy, at an adjustable rate, on-demand. Nuclear chain reactions in fissionable materials produce induced nuclear fission. Various nuclear fusion reactions of light elements power the energy production of the Sun and stars. Most nuclear reactions (fusion and fission) results in transmutation of nuclei (called also nuclear transmutation).

==History==
In 1919, Ernest Rutherford was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen at the University of Manchester, using alpha particles directed at nitrogen 14N + α → 17O + p.  This was the first observation of an induced nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus. Eventually, in 1932 at Cambridge University, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford&#x27;s colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton, who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7, to split the nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as &quot;splitting the atom&quot;, although it was not the modern nuclear fission reaction later (in 1938) discovered in heavy elements by the German scientists Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann.

== Nuclear reaction equations ==

Nuclear reactions may be shown in a form similar to chemical equations, for which invariant mass must balance for each side of the equation, and in which transformations of particles must follow certain conservation laws, such as conservation of charge and baryon number (total atomic mass number). An example of this notation follows:

To balance the equation above for mass, charge and mass number, the second nucleus to the right must have atomic number 2 and mass number 4; it is therefore also helium-4. The complete equation therefore reads:

or more simply:

Instead of using the full equations in the style above, in many situations a compact notation is used to describe nuclear reactions. This style of the form A(b,c)D is equivalent to A + b producing c + D. Common light particles are often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d for deuteron, α representing an alpha particle or helium-4, β for beta particle or electron, γ for gamma photon, etc. The reaction above would be written as 6Li(d,α)α.

==Energy conservation==
Kinetic energy may be released during the course of a reaction (exothermic reaction) or kinetic energy may have to be supplied for the reaction to take place (endothermic reaction). This can be calculated by reference to a table of very accurate particle rest masses, as follows: according to the reference tables, the nucleus has a standard atomic weight of 6.015 atomic mass units (abbreviated u), the deuterium has 2.014 u, and the helium-4 nucleus has 4.0026 u. Thus:
* the sum of the rest mass of the individual nuclei = 6.015 + 2.014 = 8.029 u;
* the total rest mass on the two helium-nuclei = 2 × 4.0026 = 8.0052 u;
* missing rest mass = 8.029 – 8.0052 = 0.0238 atomic mass units.

In a nuclear reaction, the total (relativistic) energy is conserved. The &quot;missing&quot; rest mass must therefore reappear as kinetic energy released in the reaction; its source is the nuclear binding energy. Using Einstein&#x27;s mass-energy equivalence formula &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2, the amount of energy released can be determined. We first need the energy equivalent of one atomic mass unit:


Hence, the energy released is 0.0238 × 931 MeV = 22.2 MeV.

Expressed differently: the mass is reduced by 0.3%, corresponding to 0.3% of 90 PJ/kg is 270 TJ/kg.

This is a large amount of energy for a nuclear reaction; the amount is so high because the binding energy per nucleon of the helium-4 nucleus is unusually high because the He-4 nucleus is &quot;doubly magic&quot;. (The He-4 nucleus is unusually stable and tightly bound for the same reason that the helium atom is inert: each pair of protons and neutrons in He-4 occupies a filled 1s nuclear orbital in the same way that the pair of electrons in the helium atom occupy a filled 1s electron orbital). Consequently, alpha particles appear frequently on the right-hand side of nuclear reactions.

The energy released in a nuclear reaction can appear mainly in one of three ways:
*kinetic energy of the product particles (fraction of the kinetic energy of the charged nuclear reaction products can be directly converted into electrostatic energy);
*emission of very high energy photons, called gamma rays;
*some energy may remain in the nucleus, as a metastable energy level.

When the product nucleus is metastable, this is indicated by placing an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) next to its atomic number. This energy is eventually released through nuclear decay.

A small amount of energy may also emerge in the form of X-rays. Generally, the product nucleus has a different atomic number, and thus the configuration of its electron shells is wrong. As the electrons rearrange themselves and drop to lower energy levels, internal transition X-rays (X-rays with precisely defined emission lines) may be emitted.

==Q-value and energy balance==
In writing down the reaction equation, in a way analogous to a chemical equation, one may, in addition, give the reaction energy on the right side:

For the particular case discussed above, the reaction energy has already been calculated as &quot;Q&quot; = 22.2 MeV. Hence:

The reaction energy (the &quot;Q-value&quot;) is positive for exothermal reactions and negative for endothermal reactions, opposite to the similar expression in chemistry. On the one hand, it is the difference between the sums of kinetic energies on the final side and on the initial side. But on the other hand, it is also the difference between the nuclear rest masses on the initial side and on the final side (in this way, we have calculated the Q-value above).

==Reaction rates==
If the reaction equation is balanced, that does not mean that the reaction really occurs. The rate at which reactions occur depends on the energy and the flux of the incident particles, and the reaction cross section. An example of a large repository of reaction rates is the REACLIB database, as maintained by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics.

==Charged vs. uncharged particles==
In the initial collision which begins the reaction, the particles must approach closely enough so that the short-range strong force can affect them. As most common nuclear particles are positively charged, this means they must overcome considerable electrostatic repulsion before the reaction can begin. Even if the target nucleus is part of a neutral atom, the other particle must penetrate well beyond the electron cloud and closely approach the nucleus, which is positively charged. Thus, such particles must be first accelerated to high energy, for example by:
*particle accelerators;
*nuclear decay (alpha particles are the main type of interest here since beta and gamma rays are rarely involved in nuclear reactions);
*very high temperatures, on the order of millions of degrees, producing thermonuclear reactions;
*cosmic rays.

Also, since the force of repulsion is proportional to the product of the two charges, reactions between heavy nuclei are rarer, and require higher initiating energy, than those between a heavy and light nucleus; while reactions between two light nuclei are the most common ones.

Neutrons, on the other hand, have no electric charge to cause repulsion, and are able to initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to thermal equilibrium at room temperature), the neutron&#x27;s de Broglie wavelength is greatly increased, possibly greatly increasing its capture cross-section, at energies close to resonances of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons &quot;may&quot; be even more reactive than high-energy neutrons.

==Notable types==
While the number of possible nuclear reactions is immense, there are several types that are more common, or otherwise notable. Some examples include:
*Fusion reactions – two light nuclei join to form a heavier one, with additional particles (usually protons or neutrons) emitted subsequently.
*Spallation – a nucleus is hit by a particle with sufficient energy and momentum to knock out several small fragments or smash it into many fragments.
*Induced gamma emission belongs to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation.
*Fission reactions – a very heavy nucleus, after absorbing additional light particles (usually neutrons), splits into two or sometimes three pieces. This is an induced nuclear reaction. Spontaneous fission, which occurs without assistance of a neutron, is usually not considered a nuclear reaction. At most, it is not an &quot;induced&quot; nuclear reaction.

===Direct reactions===
An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10−21 second) event. Energy and momentum transfer are relatively small. These are particularly useful in experimental nuclear physics, because the reaction mechanisms are often simple enough to calculate with sufficient accuracy to probe the structure of the target nucleus.

====Inelastic scattering====
Only energy and momentum are transferred.
*(p,p&#x27;) tests differences between nuclear states.
*(α,α&#x27;) measures nuclear surface shapes and sizes. Since α particles that hit the nucleus react more violently, elastic and shallow inelastic α scattering are sensitive to the shapes and sizes of the targets, like light scattered from a small black object.
*(e,e&#x27;) is useful for probing the interior structure. Since electrons interact less strongly than do protons and neutrons, they reach to the centers of the targets and their wave functions are less distorted by passing through the nucleus.

==== Charge-exchange reactions ====
Energy and charge are transferred between projectile and target. Some examples of this kind of reactions are:

* (p,n)
* (3He,t)

====Nucleon transfer reactions====
Usually at moderately low energy, one or more nucleons are transferred between the projectile and target. These are useful in studying outer shell structure of nuclei. Transfer reactions can occur:
* from the projectile to the target - stripping reactions
* from the target to the projectile - pick-up reactions
Examples:
*(α,n) and (α,p) reactions. Some of the earliest nuclear reactions studied involved an alpha particle produced by alpha decay, knocking a nucleon from a target nucleus.
*(d,n) and (d,p) reactions. A deuteron beam impinges on a target; the target nuclei absorb either the neutron or proton from the deuteron. The deuteron is so loosely bound that this is almost the same as proton or neutron capture. A compound nucleus may be formed, leading to additional neutrons being emitted more slowly. (d,n) reactions are used to generate energetic neutrons.
*The strangeness exchange reaction (K, π) has been used to study hypernuclei.
*The reaction 14N(α,p)17O performed by Rutherford in 1917 (reported 1919), is generally regarded as the first nuclear transmutation experiment.

====Reactions with neutrons====
Reactions with neutrons are important in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. While the best-known neutron reactions are neutron scattering, neutron capture, and nuclear fission, for some light nuclei (especially odd-odd nuclei) the most probable reaction with a thermal neutron is a transfer reaction:

Some reactions are only possible with fast neutrons:
*(n,2n) reactions produce small amounts of protactinium-231 and uranium-232 in the thorium cycle which is otherwise relatively free of highly radioactive actinide products.
*9Be + n → 2&quot;α&quot; + 2n can contribute some additional neutrons in the beryllium neutron reflector of a nuclear weapon.
*7Li + n → T + &quot;α&quot; + n unexpectedly contributed additional yield in the Bravo, Romeo and Yankee shots of Operation Castle, the three highest-yield nuclear tests conducted by the U.S.

=== Compound nuclear reactions===
Either a low-energy projectile is absorbed or a higher energy particle transfers energy to the nucleus, leaving it with too much energy to be fully bound together. On a time scale of about 10−19 seconds, particles, usually neutrons, are &quot;boiled&quot; off. That is, it remains together until enough energy happens to be concentrated in one neutron to escape the mutual attraction. The excited quasi-bound nucleus is called a compound nucleus.
*Low energy (e, e&#x27; xn), (γ, xn) (the xn indicating one or more neutrons), where the gamma or virtual gamma energy is near the giant dipole resonance. These increase the need for radiation shielding around electron accelerators.

<text>Gustaf Fröding (; 22 August 1860 – 8 February 1911) was a Swedish poet and writer from Alster, Värmland. The family moved to Kristinehamn in the year 1867. He later studied at Uppsala University and worked as a journalist in Karlstad.

==Poetry==
His poetry combines formal virtuosity with a sympathy for the ordinary, the neglected and the down-trodden, sometimes written in his own regional dialect. It is highly musical and lends itself to musical setting; many of his poems have been set to music and recorded by Swedish singers such as Olle Adolphson, Monica Zetterlund, the Värmland group Sven-Ingvars and the Swedish band Mando Diao. 

Fröding wrote openly about his personal problems with alcohol and women and had to face a trial for obscenity.

== Sickness ==
The latter part of his life he spent in different mental institutions and hospitals to cure his mental illness and alcoholism, and eventually diabetes. During the first half of the 1890s he spent a couple of years at the Suttestad institution in Lillehammer, Norway, where he finished his work on his third book of poetry &quot;Stänk och flikar&quot;, which was published in 1896. He wrote much of the material at a mental institution in Görlitz, Germany. In 1896 he moved back to Sweden. But as the year neared Christmas, his sister Cecilia made the difficult decision to make him stay at a hospital in Uppsala. Under the care of professor Frey Svenson Fröding got away from liquor and women, except one, Ida Bäckman. Fröding never married Ida, but grew fond of a nurse named Signe Trotzig. When he left hospital in Uppsala she stayed with him to the day he died.

A play by Swedish playwright Gottfrid Grafström, called &quot;Sjung vackert om kärlek&quot;, about Fröding&#x27;s time at the mental institution in Uppsala was first performed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1973 and has had periodic revivals since.

<text>Jiaozhou Bay (; ;) is a bay located in the prefecture-level city of Qingdao (Tsingtau), Shandong Province, China.

The bay has historically been romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German.

==Geography and ecology==
Jiaozhou Bay is a natural inlet of the Yellow Sea, with a depth of and deeper, dredged channels to three major ports around the bay: Qingdao, Huangdao, and Hongdao, all of which are ice-free during winter.

The bay is located on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in East China, and separates Huangdao District from Qingdao City and borders on Jiaozhou City.

The bay is long and wide with a surface area of , approximately two-thirds the area of 100 years ago. According to official data, the surface area has decreased from in 1928 to by 2003 due to sustained land reclamation activities in recent decades.

The marine species have also decreased by two-thirds during the last 50 years due to urban and industrial development and growth of adjacent areas around the bay. Out of 170 species of organisms found in the northwestern part of the basin during the 1970s, only 17 were found in 1989. False killer whales still occasionally appear in the waters which were a regular range for the species until the 1980s. On the other hand, Jiaozhou Bay may serve as a suitable location for studying recoveries of coastal marine ecosystems.

==History==



Jiaozhou Bay was known formerly as Jiao&#x27;ao (). During the Qing dynasty, it developed a large junk trade when a customs station was established near its shores, in Qingdao. 

The area became widely known to Europeans after the German Empire in March 1898 concluded a lease with the Qing government of China. Through this lease, the area was transferred to German rule on a 99-year lease (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories and as the French did in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan), and it became known as the Kiautschou Bay concession. The village of Tsingtau became the German colony of Tsingtau, and the area became a focus for German commercial development in China, while for the Imperial German Navy it was the base for their East Asia Squadron.

Because of land speculation in Germany&#x27;s African colonies, a land value tax was introduced as the only tax in the colony. It was a great success, bringing wealth quite rapidly to the colony and also financial stability. The colony was the only government authority ever to exclusively rely on the single tax on land value, and is used as an academic case study to this day about the viability of such a tax system. The German colony also issued currency.

With the outbreak of World War I, the Republic of China cancelled the Kiautschou lease with the German Empire. This came into force on 23 August 1914, the day of Japan&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany, after a Japanese ultimatum for unconditional German evacuation of the colony had expired. Following a two month military siege by British and Japanese forces, the colony was forced to surrender. It was then occupied by the British and Japanese.

The Republic of China declared war on Imperial Germany on 14 August 1917, since as a member of the victorious allies, China fully expected the former German colony would be returned to them. Instead, the Treaty of Versailles acceded to Japanese demands at the Paris Peace Conference and assigned all former German Pacific territories and islands north of the equator to Japan, including Jiaozhou Bay. This unexpected decision led to China-wide protests known as the &quot;May Fourth Movement&quot;, which is now regarded as a significant event of modern Chinese history. As a result, the Beiyang government refused to sign the Treaty.

This situation was known as the &quot;Shandong Problem&quot;. It eventually was resolved through mediation by the United States, which led to the former colony&#x27;s return to Chinese sovereignty in February 1922.

==Connection project==
Jiaozhou Bay is situated wholly within the administrative boundaries of Qingdao. Counterclockwise, the bordering divisions are Shinan District, Shibei District, Sifang District, Licang District, Chengyang District, Jiaozhou City, Jiaonan City, and Huangdao District. The entrance to the bay is 6.17 km wide. In 1993, Qingdao City decided to build a traffic corridor for the Jiaozhou Bay region, which includes a tunnel under the inlet and a bridge across Jiaozhou Bay. In December 2006, the construction process started with an estimated completion target of 2011.

* The Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, at , is the world&#x27;s longest bridge over water, surpassing the cross-sea Donghai Bridge in length. The total budget is estimated at approximately 9.938 billion yuan (~USD 1.5 billion). It is estimated that it will shorten travel time from Qingdao to the outlying region by more than half and relieve pressure on the existing Jiaozhou Bay Expressway.
* The Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel connects central Qingdao with Huangdao District with a length of over with 3 billion yuan (~USD 440 million) budgeted for its construction. Travel time is estimated at approximately 10 minutes by automobile from central Qingdao to Huangdao District.

<text>Leonardo Fea (Turin 24 July 1852 – Turin 27 April 1903) was an Italian explorer, zoologist, painter, and naturalist.

==Biography==
Fea was born in Turin, a son of Paolo Fea, who was professor of painting at Accademia Albertina, and Anna Roda. In 1872 he became an assistant at the Museum of Natural History in Genoa. He made several foreign trips to collect specimens, including visits to Burma (1885–89) and the Cape Verde Islands (1898), the islands in the Gulf of Guinea (São Tomé, Príncipe, Fernando Po, Annobón, 1900–02) and Cameroon and French Congo (1902). He spent four years in Burma, accumulating large collections of insects and birds. He then planned an expedition to Malaysia, but his poor health made it necessary to choose somewhere with a drier climate, hence his visit to the Cape Verdes. He was disappointed by the amount of wildlife he found there, but was still able to collect forty-seven species of birds, eleven of which were new for the islands. His collections are in the Genoa museum.

While on the Cape Verde Islands Fea collected a specimen of an unknown petrel. This was named Fea&#x27;s petrel in 1900 by his friend Tommaso Salvadori.

==Taxa named in his honour==
Several species have been named to commemorate his work as naturalist and zoologist:
*Fea&#x27;s short-legged toad, &quot;Brachytarsophrys feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s viper, &quot;Azemiops feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s muntjac, &quot;Muntiacus feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s tube-nosed bat, &quot;Murina feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s tree rat, &quot;Chiromyscus chiropus&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s bow-fingered gecko, &quot;Cyrtodactylus feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s petrel, &quot;Pterodroma feae&quot; 
*Ugly worm lizard, &quot;Cynisca feae&quot; 
*St. Thomas beaked snake, &quot;Letheobia feae&quot; 
*Fea&#x27;s chameleon, &quot;Trioceros feae&quot; 
*the horseweed species &quot;Conyza feae&quot; 
*the woodlice genus &quot;Feadillo&quot;

<text>State Route 133 (SR 133) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, serving as an urban route in Orange County. It connects SR 1 in Laguna Beach through the San Joaquin Hills with several freeways in Irvine, ending at the SR 241, a toll road in the latter city. It is built as an expressway from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road (just south of I-405 in Irvine), and past this, SR 133 is a freeway (the Laguna Freeway) to I-5, and a tollway (part of the Eastern Transportation Corridor operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies) to SR 241 near the Santa Ana Mountains.

SR 133 was constructed as a county road by the 1910s; the portion from I-405 to I-5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later. The state canceled plans to extend the freeway segment south, and the southern part of the road remains an undivided highway. In 1998, most of the Eastern Transportation Corridor opened, and the connector between I-5 and SR 241 was designated as a toll extension of SR 133.

==Route description==

SR 133 begins at SR 1, the Pacific Coast Highway, as Broadway in Laguna Beach, a block from the Pacific Ocean. The name changes to Laguna Canyon Road as the highway leaves downtown Laguna Beach and enters Laguna Canyon, soon narrowing to one lane in each direction. After entering the canyon, which lies between Laguna Coast Wilderness Park (west side of SR 133) and Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park (east side of SR 133), the first major intersection is with El Toro Road (CR S18). SR 133 widens to four lanes and becomes an expressway after its interchange with SR 73, the San Joaquin Hills Toll Road.

As it continues through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment on the west side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in Irvine. North of the park, the highway becomes the Laguna Freeway after crossing an at-grade intersection with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, I-405, the San Diego Freeway. SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the I-5, the Santa Ana Freeway. After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the Eastern Transportation Corridor along the northwest side of Orange County Great Park (built on the site of the decommissioned Marine Corps Air Station El Toro), crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at SR 241.

SR 133 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System north of SR 73, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
As part of its construction of concrete roads, started by a 1913 bond issue, Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon, connecting State Highway Route 2 (the forerunner of US 101 and I-5) at Irvine with Laguna Beach, by 1917. The road was added to the state highway system in 1933 as Route 185, an unsigned designation. The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959; the planned upgrade had already been named the Laguna Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26, 1957. The highway received a sign route number—State Route 133—in the 1964 renumbering.

The opening of the first—and only—piece of the Laguna Freeway was celebrated in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, connecting the north end of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a trumpet interchange and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. Other than the interchange at I-405, no other access was present along the Laguna Freeway between Laguna Canyon Road and I-5 until ramps connecting to and from Barranca Parkway were completed in August 1990. The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975, and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System. Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2006, moving the road out of the canyon bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.

A new SR 231 was added to the state highway system in 1988, connecting I-5 northwest of Irvine with SR 91, and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133, with the old route becoming SR 261. To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended SR 241. The Eastern Transportation Corridor, which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast.

==Tolls==

The tolled portion of SR 133 (from I-5 in the south to SR 241 in the north) employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged flat-rate tolls based on what particular toll booths they pass through. Since May 13, 2014, the road has been using an all-electronic, open road tolling system. And on October 2, 2019, the license plate tolling program, under the brand name &quot;ExpressAccount&quot;, was discontinued. Drivers may still pay using the FasTrak electronic toll collection device, or via a one time payment online 5 days before or after their trip on the toll road. Drivers who do not pay after 5 days will be assessed an additional toll violation penalty.

Tolls are collected at the northbound exit and southbound entrance of Irvine Boulevard and at the Orange Grove toll gantry, the latter of which spans the on-and off-ramps to SR 241 north (traffic to and from SR 241 south instead, pay at the Tomato Springs toll gantry located on SR 241 immediately south of the SR 241 interchange). , the standard two-axle car toll for both the northbound offramp and southbound onramp of Irvine Boulevard is a flat rate of $2.20. The Orange Grove toll gantry instead uses a variable pricing scheme based on the time of day for FasTrak users (it is not truly congestion priced because toll rates come from a preset schedule and are not based on actual congestion); non-FasTrak drivers must pay the $3.64 maximum toll regardless of the day and time.

<text>The Reverend James Bulwer (21 March 179411 June 1879) was an English collector, naturalist, artist and conchologist. He was a close friend and patron of the artist John Sell Cotman. He is considered to be a member of the Norwich School of painters.

==Life==
James Bulwer was born at Aylsham in the English county of Norfolk, the son of James Bulwer and Mary Seaman, and was baptised by his parents on 23 March 1794, at St Michael and All Angels, the town&#x27;s parish church. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge. During his time at Cambridge he took drawing lessons from the landscape artist John Sell Cotman and became a fellow of the Linnean Society due to his interest in molluscs, one of his three proposers being William Elford Leach.

In 1818 he was made a deacon and in 1822 he became a priest. In 1823 he became curate of Booterstown in Dublin, moving to Bristol in 1831 and St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly in 1833. He spent several winters travelling in Spain, Portugal and the Madeira Islands, sometimes in the company of the philosopher and traveller Alfred Lyall. In the spring of 1825 Bulwer collected a specimen of an unknown petrel in the Madeira Islands. This was described by William Jardine and P. J. Selby in 1828 and given the common name of Bulwer&#x27;s petrel. The petrel genus of &quot;Bulweria&quot; was also named for him.

Bulwer left London in 1839 and moved back to Norfolk, becoming curate of Blickling Hall and later of Hunworth. He renewed his acquaintance with Cotman when his sons attended King&#x27;s College School, and several of his sketches of Spain and Madeira inspired Cotman&#x27;s watercolours.

His son James Redfoord Bulwer became a lawyer and a Member of parliament and also played first-class cricket.

<text>Ralph Lauren ( ; born October 14, 1939) is an American fashion designer of Belarusian descent, philanthropist, and billionaire businessman, best known for founding the brand Ralph Lauren, a global multibillion-dollar enterprise. He has become well known for his collection of rare automobiles, some of which have been displayed in museum exhibits. He stepped down as CEO of the company in September 2015 but remains executive chairman and chief creative officer. As of April 2024, his net worth was estimated at US$8.8 billion.

==Early life ==
Lauren was born on October 14, 1939, in the Bronx, New York City, to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants Frieda Lishitz (née Cutler) and Frank Lifshitz (né Efraim Lifshitz), an artist and house painter, from Pinsk, Second Polish Republic (now Belarus). His mother was from Drohiczyn, Second Polish Republic (now Drahichyn, Belarus). The youngest of four siblings, he has two brothers and one sister. At the age of 16, he and his brother George Poitras Lauren legally changed their last name from Lifshitz to Lauren, due to bullying at school. His choice of the name followed his older brother Jerry Lauren, who had first done so after experiencing bullying in the U.S. Air Force.

Lauren attended day school followed by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy, before eventually graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1957. He attended Baruch College of the City University of New York (CUNY), where he studied business, although he dropped out after two years.

He was one of several design leaders raised in the Jewish community in the Bronx, along with Calvin Klein and Robert Denning.

==Career==
===Early career===
From 1962 to 1964 Lauren served in the United States Army. After his discharge, he worked briefly for Brooks Brothers as a sales assistant before becoming a salesman for Rivetz, a necktie company. At age 28, working for tie manufacturer Beau Brummell, Lauren convinced the company president to let him start his own line. He launched The Ralph Lauren Corporation in 1967 with men&#x27;s ties.

===Polo===
Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear &#x27;Polo&#x27; in 1968. He worked out of a single &quot;drawer&quot; from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself. By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale&#x27;s sold Lauren&#x27;s men&#x27;s line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale&#x27;s had given a designer their own in-store boutique.
In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem to the world for the first time, appearing on the shirt&#x27;s cuff. The first full women&#x27;s collection was launched the following year. In 1971 Lauren also opened a store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California; this was the first freestanding store for an American designer.

In 1972, the Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colors. Featuring the polo player logo at the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s signature styles. The tagline for the ad campaign was: &quot;Every team has its color – Polo has seventeen.&quot;

In 1974, he outfitted the male cast of the film &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in costumes from his Polo line – a 1920s-style series of men&#x27;s suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford&#x27;s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren&#x27;s clothes throughout Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;.

===Fragrance===

The first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd. were launched at Bloomingdale&#x27;s in March 1978. Lauren, a fragrance for women, on March 12 and Polo, cologne for men, on March 26. This was the first time that a designer had introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously. The company entered the European market, and went international in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store for an American designer on New Bond Street in the West End of London, England.

===Later 20th century===
Ralph Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986. Lauren re-created the building&#x27;s original opulence with a young design consultant named Naomi Leff, with whom he had previously worked on Ralph Lauren Home. The Polo Sport line was introduced in 1992 followed by over ten additional lines and acquired brands, including Ralph Lauren Purple Label in 1995 and Lauren Ralph Lauren in 1996.

On June 12, 1997, the company became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.

The 98-seat restaurant &quot;RL&quot; opened in March 1999 in Chicago in a newly constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – &quot;Ralph&#x27;s&quot; at 173 Boulevard Saint-Germain, Paris flagship store in 2010 and &quot;The Polo Bar&quot; at Polo&#x27;s flagship in New York in 2015.

===Later years===
In 2000 the company launched polo.com as its website and online shop, through RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the web site was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In 2008, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a brand called American Living, exclusively for JCPenney. It was the largest cross-category brand launch in the history of Ralph Lauren and JCPenney. On September 29, 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company&#x27;s founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.

Lauren has appeared on over 100 magazine covers including &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;TIME&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot;.

Lauren celebrated the 50th anniversary of his brand in a fashion show at Bethesda Terrace in Central Park on September 8, 2018. Attendees included Oprah Winfrey, Hillary Clinton, Kanye West, Robert De Niro, and Jessica Chastain.

==Personal life==
===Family===
On December 20, 1964, Lauren married Ricky Ann Loew-Beer in New York City. The two had met six months earlier, in a doctor&#x27;s office where she was working as a receptionist; on alternate days, she was teaching dance. She is the author of &quot;The Hamptons: Food, Family and History&quot;. The Laurens are members of the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, leading the synagogue&#x27;s capital campaign that ended in 2019.

They have three children, including David Lauren and Dylan Lauren. In September 2011, David married Lauren Bush, the niece of former U.S. President George W. Bush.

In April 1987, Ralph Lauren underwent surgery to remove a benign brain tumor and made a full recovery.

Lauren owns a 17,000-acre cattle ranch in Ridgway, Colorado, and a 17,000 sq foot manor built in 1919 in Bedford, New York.

===Automobile collection===

Ralph Lauren is well known as a collector of automobiles, with about 100 automobiles, some being extremely rare. He owns a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, two Ferrari TRs, three 1996 McLaren F1s (one of them an ultra-rare McLaren F1 LM), a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing, a 1929 Bentley 4½ Litre (&quot;Blower Bentley&quot;), one Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, a 1937 Bugatti Type 57SC Gangloff, a Porsche 911 GT3 RS, a Bugatti Veyron, a 1930 Mercedes-Benz SSK &quot;Count Trossi&quot; (aka &quot;The Black Prince&quot;), a 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Mille Miglia. and a rare Lamborghini Reventón Roadster.

His cars have won &quot;Best of Show&quot; at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance twice, his 1938 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic won in 1990 and his 1930 Mercedes-Benz SSK &quot;Count Trossi&quot; roadster won in 1993. In 2005 his collection was displayed at Boston&#x27;s Museum of Fine Arts. Seventeen cars from his collection were exhibited at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, in 2011. In 2017, Lauren&#x27;s now $600 million car collection took center stage during New York Fashion Week.

===Philanthropy===
Lauren has focused a substantial amount of his philanthropy to address cancer. In 1989, he co-founded the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington D.C. in memory of the late &quot;Post&quot; fashion correspondent, Nina Hyde. He served as chairman and created the name and symbol for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer, a charitable initiative of the CFDA that founded in 1994 that marshals the goodwill and services of the fashion industry to raise public awareness and funds for breast cancer internationally. In 2003, Lauren supported the establishment the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. The center is a collaboration between Ralph Lauren, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and North General Hospital in Harlem. In 2014, the Ralph Lauren Corporation partnered with the Royal Marsden, the largest and most comprehensive cancer center in Europe, to develop a world-class breast cancer research facility. They opened the Royal Marsden Ralph Lauren Center for Breast Cancer Research in 2016. In 2023, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Prevention was opened at the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center of Georgetown University.

In 2000, the Ralph Lauren Corporation launched its Volunteer Program, which energizes employees and creates meaningful connections with the communities in which they work. On Friday, September 15, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched the Pink Pony Campaign, a national initiative to reduce disparities in cancer care by raising awareness as well as enhancing prevention, screening, and treatment in poor and underserved communities. Similarly, in 2006, the Polo Jeans G.I.V.E. (Get Involved, Volunteer, Exceed) campaign was created to inspire and encourage community service through volunteerism by supporting the efforts of dedicated volunteers and their causes, including Habitat for Humanity.

The Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation established the American Heroes Fund following the September 11th attacks to allow Polo&#x27;s 10,000 employees worldwide, as well as their customers, the opportunity to participate in the relief effort.

The Polo Fashion School was established in 2004, in which company executives work with inner-city youth to offer insights into the fashion business.

The Star-Spangled Banner, the original 1813 flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write the United States National Anthem, was preserved by a $10 million contribution to Save America&#x27;s Treasures from Polo Ralph Lauren in 1998. The flag was then unveiled on Wednesday, November 19, 2008, in a new gallery at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="460353" wikidata="Q248421" url="?curid=460353" title="Golden Key International Honour Society">
<text>The Golden Key International Honour Society (formerly Golden Key National Honor Society) is an international collegiate honor society and non-profit organization based in the United States. It was founded in 1977 to recognize academic achievement among college and university students.

Golden Key has over 400 chapters at colleges and universities in Australia, The Bahamas, Canada, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States. It has initiated more than 2.1 million members.

==History==
Golden Key National Honour Society was founded by James W. Lewis at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia in 1977. The original intent of the society was to create a new academic honor organization that was the equal of longstanding honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, but which did not carry the same perceived elitism of older institutions, operating more strictly on standards (by accepting students in the top fifteen percent of their college classes and permitting part-time and transfer students who excelled academically).

The society expanded throughout the 1980s on a minimal budget, increasing the number of schools at which it had chapters and membership at those chapters. Lewis moved the institution&#x27;s headquarters to a former Church of Christ Scientist building in the Druid Hills area of Atlanta in 1984. In the late 1980s, the society began attracting corporate sponsorships, providing data about its students to its sponsors, and holding large sponsored networking events, arguing that the strategy increased students&#x27; competitiveness in the job market. 

Golden Key became an international society when it expanded to the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia in 1993. It changed its name to Golden Key International Honour Society in 2000 in order &quot;to reflect [its] international presence&quot;.

Lewis, who by the late 1990s was making more than $300,000 as chairman of the organization, stepped down in January 2000 after being pressured by his board. He was replaced by Carl Patton who resigned in 2002 after a round of negative press coverage about the society. By 2002, the society was &quot;one of the largest collegiate honor societies in the world&quot;, with an annual budget of US$10.9 million and over 120,000 inductees annually.

Golden Key sought and was denied acceptance to the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) in 1984 and 1997. Golden Key was accepted by the ACHS in 2005. In 2012, the society had 393 active chapters, 82,415 active members, and 2,106,099 total initiates. Golden Key resigned from the Association of College Honor Societies in December 2013 after what the ACHS indicated was &quot;a series of on-going discussions and correspondence.&quot;

Golden Key&#x27;s main office is in Dunwoody, Georgia, with regional offices in Sydney, Australia, and Pretoria, South Africa. It manages approximately 400 campus chapters worldwide. The organization operates as a non-profit under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 

== Symbols ==
Golden Key&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot; or &quot;Unlock your potential&quot;. The society&#x27;s core values or pillars are integrity, collaboration, innovation, respect, diversity, excellence and engagement.

At commencement, Golden Key members may wear a royal blue and golden yellow ribbon attached to their mortar board or a gold and royal blue cord. Its honor stole is a gold satin sash embroidered with a Golden Key logo in blue. The Gold Key medallion is gold colored and hangs from a ribbon that is royal blue and gold. Members who have the highest GPA in four undergraduate divisions may wear the medallion.

==Membership==
Golden Key membership is open to sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduate students, and alumni who graduated in the past year. Membership is by invitation and is offered to students in any academic field who are in the top fifteen percent of their class and have a GPA of 3.75 or better. The society also awards honorary memberships to non-students who are impactful or noteworthy leaders on campus and in the university&#x27;s community.

==Activities==
In its early years, Golden Key anticipated volunteerism drives on college campuses by organizing community service efforts, such as working in soup kitchens, reading to children at libraries, and doing tax preparation help for low-income and immigrant populations. Since chapters are not centrally managed, charity and volunteer efforts are now fostered through a system called SPARK a Change, which allows chapters to determine the causes they support and the level of involvement of students.

Golden Key offers résumé and graduate program assistance, career planning and opportunities, leadership opportunities in local chapters, and networking events. It also offers scholarships, awards, research grants, travel support for academic conference attendance, and student loan debt relief to its members.

==Controversies==
A 1999 article in the University of British Columbia student newspaper, &quot;The Ubyssey&quot;, examined the society&#x27;s finances and scholarship practices after it established a chapter on campus in 1998. &quot;Ubyssey&quot; obtained the organization&#x27;s IRS filings for 1997 and noted &quot;Golden Key spent just $289,461 (US dollars) on scholarships, less than 5 percent of their total expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1997.&quot; Golden Key reported on its website in 2009 that it had increased scholarship disbursals to over $500,000 annually, but a later report indicated that spending on member events and scholarships in 2014 was less than $200,000. A 2002 report by &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported that there were conflicts within the society&#x27;s administration over the lowering of academic standards required for admission and inflated recruitment numbers from local university chapters. The society&#x27;s aggressive marketing techniques toward eligible members were criticized in 2002 by the president of the National Collegiate Honors Council.

The business practices of Golden Key also attracted the &quot;Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s notice, as well as that of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Sponsoring corporations, who paid a minimum of $55,000 a year (2002) to access Golden Key&#x27;s membership lists, sent students &quot;mass mailings for such products as credit cards and auto insurance.&quot; Golden Key responded to these criticisms by stating that it was standard practice among alumni groups and honor societies. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; quoted former employees who thought the institution&#x27;s expenditures on parties and upper executive salaries, as well as its maintenance of the Druid Hills headquarters, were lavish and inconsistent with the former ideal of &quot;a student-centered, nonprofit organization.&quot; The &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported poor accounting practices under Lewis&#x27;s tenure in the late 1990s, and investigators were unable to determine exactly how much he was paid due to bookkeeping discrepancies. A 2016 investigation by Australian student newspaper &quot;Honi Soit&quot; found that Golden Key continued to release data about students, without their consent, to corporate sponsors.

Some students reported to student newspaper investigators that they were unsure of the society&#x27;s benefits or did not find the society&#x27;s networking opportunities worth the cost of membership. &quot;Honi Soit&quot; also noted that society staffers altered the Golden Key International Honour Society Wikipedia page to burnish the institution&#x27;s image.

<doc id="460360" wikidata="Q2918736" url="?curid=460360" title="L. Fletcher Prouty">
<text>Leroy Fletcher Prouty (January 24, 1917 – June 5, 2001) served as Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President John F. Kennedy. A colonel in the United States Air Force, he retired from military service to become a bank executive. He subsequently became a critic of U.S. foreign policy, particularly the covert activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which he believed was working on behalf of a secret world elite.

Prouty&#x27;s commentary on the Kennedy assassination circulated widely from the 1970s to 1990s, as a key source for conspiracy theories about it. He was the inspiration for the character &quot;X&quot; in Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot;.

==Early life==
===Family===
Prouty was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on January 24, 1917, to Marie Ozias Desautels, age 32, and Leroy Fletcher Prouty, a municipal government employee, age 28. He was the first child in a growing family and would eventually become one of five, with two brothers and two sisters.

His first brother Robert Vincent was born one year later on May 9, 1918, and they were joined by a sister Muriel two years after that on September 28, 1920. Another baby girl joined the family on March 24, 1921, and was named Corinne Marie; she later went by Corinne Toole. The youngest of the Prouty children, a boy named Norman Peter, was born 1926. Corinne was his only sibling to survive him.

Prouty married Elizabeth Ballinger on October 5, 1942, and with her he fathered three children: David Fletcher, Jane Elizabeth, Lauren Michele.

===Education===
Prouty attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst (then known as Massachusetts State College), and on September 20, 1936, he was elected president of his freshman class, &quot;the Class of 1940,&quot; succeeding Daniel G. Lacey. He later pursued his graduate studies in banking at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Graduate School of Banking.

Prouty belonged to a handful of membership organizations: the National Defense Transportation Association, the American Bankers Association, the Tokyo Toastmasters Club, and the Army Navy Club.

==Government service==
===World War II===
Prouty was commissioned as a reserve 2nd lieutenant in the cavalry on June 9, 1941, and began his military career with the 4th Armored Division in Pine Camp, New York. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on February 1, 1942. He transferred to the United States Army Air Forces on November 10, 1942, and earned his pilot wings that same month. He arrived in British West Africa (specifically the British Gold Coast colony) in February 1943 as a pilot with Air Transport Command.

In the summer of 1943 he was the personal pilot of General Omar Bradley, General John C. H. Lee and General C. R. Smith (founder and president of American Airlines), among others. He flew the U.S. Geological Survey Team in Saudi Arabia, October 1943, to confirm oil discoveries in preparation for the Cairo Conference. He was assigned to special duties at the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference November–December 1943. He flew Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Chinese delegation (T. V. Soong&#x27;s delegates) to Tehran.

An important mission he was involved in was the evacuation of the British commandos made famous by the novel &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; involved in the Battle of Leros from Leros to Palestine. He was promoted to captain on February 1, 1944. In 1945 he was transferred to the Southwest Pacific and flew in New Guinea, Leyte and was on Okinawa at the end of war. He landed near Tokyo at the time of the surrender with the first three planes carrying General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s bodyguard troops. He flew out with American POWs.

===Post-war service===
After the war, Prouty accepted an assignment from the U.S. Army in September 1945 to inaugurate the ROTC program at Yale University, where he also taught during each scholastic year from 1946 to 1948. This timeline intersects with the years that George Bush and William F. Buckley, Jr. also spent at Yale. Prouty fondly recalled Buckley at that time in his role as editor of the Yale Daily News, and Prouty later told an interviewer in 1989 that he had written for Buckley on several occasions.

In 1950 he transferred to Colorado Springs to build Air Defense Command. From 1952 to 1954 he was assigned to Korean War duties in Japan, where he served as Military Manager for Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) during the post-war U.S. occupation.

In 1955 he was assigned to the coordination of operations between the fledgling U.S. Air Force and the CIA. As a result of a CIA commendation for this work he was awarded the Legion of Merit by the U.S. Air Force, promoted to colonel, and assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Following the creation of the Defense Intelligence Agency and termination of the OSO by Secretary Robert McNamara, Prouty was transferred to the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and charged with the creation a similar organization on a global scale.

From 1962 to 1963 he served as Chief of Special Operations with the Joint Staff. In a chance encounter with Edward Lansdale in the hallways of the Pentagon, a &quot;month or two before&quot; the assassination (as Prouty tells it), Lansdale informed Prouty he had arranged for him [Prouty] to accompany a group of VIPs to the South Pole from November 10 to 23, in the capacity of Military Escort officer.

The ostensible purpose of the trip was the activation of a nuclear power plant at the United States Navy Base at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, to provide heat, light, and sea water desalination. Prouty later described his confusion at the unusual assignment, but he expected the job to be a &quot;paid vacation&quot; and accepted the task.

Prouty retired in 1964 as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. As recognition of his long and distinguished career in the service of his country, he was awarded one of the first three Joint Service Commendation Medals by General Maxwell D. Taylor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

==Post-military==
===Railroads===
He was a senior director of public affairs for Amtrak during the 1970s, and a director of the National Railroad Foundation and Museum. During this period he worked out of the Amtrak Corp. office in Washington, D.C.

===Writing===
Prouty authored two major books during his life, &quot;The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World&quot; in 1973 and &quot;&quot; in 1992.

He served alongside friend and fellow researcher Eustace Mullins as contributing editor for a conspiracy magazine titled &quot;Criminal Politics&quot;.

Prouty also published articles in a wide variety of publications, from pornographic magazines to peer-reviewed journals to academic textbooks, illustrating the wide diversity in his intended audiences for different writings. His areas of expertise were cultivated by direct experience as well as research, and they range from railroads to assassinations to transportation to military strategy and logistics.

His writings even include entries on Railroad Engineering and Foreign Railroad Technology for McGraw-Hill&#x27;s &quot;Scientific Encyclopedias&quot; and &quot;Scientific Yearbooks&quot;, as well as contributions to ROTC textbooks.

===Church of Scientology===
In the early 1980s, Prouty&#x27;s services as an expert witness were retained by the legal team of the Church of Scientology to act as consultant in the investigation of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s military record.

By early 1985, Hubbard&#x27;s naval record was again the subject of increasing scrutiny. Julie Christofferson Titchbourne of Portland, Oregon brought her case against the Church at that time, and Scientology&#x27;s lawyers again turned to Prouty to help them manage the public relations fallout. Prouty was forthcoming with an affidavit on their behalf by February. In it, he stated his belief that the records released by the U.S. Navy documenting Hubbard&#x27;s service in the armed forces &quot;are incomplete ... those materials and records provided give ample evidence that proves the existence of other records that have been concealed, withheld and overlooked.&quot;
&quot;...to provide proof of the fact that the records, data and related materials provided by the U.S. Navy (USN) and other government sources, all said to be the complete record and file on the military service, active and inactive, of Mr. L. Ronald Hubbard, formerly Lt. Commander, U.S. Navy Reserve, are incomplete ... [and] to attest to the fact that those materials and records provided give ample evidence that proves the existence of other records that have been concealed, withheld and overlooked.&quot;
Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, had said that he sustained combat injuries during his military service in World War II and that he healed himself through measures that would become Dianetics. However, Hubbard&#x27;s military record does not show that he was wounded in combat. Church officials have stated that those records were incomplete and may have been falsified. Prouty, according to Church of Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis, reported that Hubbard was an intelligence agent, and because of this his military discharge papers were &quot;sheep dipped,&quot; meaning two sets of government records were created documenting Hubbard&#x27;s service.

Prouty&#x27;s association with Scientology also provided him with a platform for his writing over the following decades, serving as senior editor of &quot;Freedom&quot; magazine, an official publication of the Church. Between 1985 and 1987, &quot;Freedom&quot; published a 19-part series by Prouty which it described as having &quot;provided a unique and highly informative view of the events which led up to the Vietnam War.&quot; The magazine later covered his perspective on the Jonestown affair. At times, he has described himself as &quot;an editorial adviser to publications of the Church of Scientology.&quot;

===Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;JFK&quot; film===
Prouty served as a technical adviser to Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;. He was the inspiration for the mysterious &quot;X&quot; (played by Donald Sutherland), who assists Jim Garrison in the movie.

==Later life==
Colonel Prouty died on June 5, 2001, at the Inova Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia. His funeral service was held the next day at the Fort Myer Chapel, and he was subsequently buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==Controversy==
As a critic of the CIA, Prouty pointed out its influence in global matters, outside the realm of U.S. congressional and government oversight. His works detailed the formation and development of the CIA, the origins of the Cold War, the U-2 incident, the Vietnam War, and the John F. Kennedy assassination. Prouty wrote that he believed Kennedy&#x27;s assassination was a coup d&#x27;état, and that there is a secret, global &quot;power elite,&quot; which operates covertly to protect its interests—and in doing so has frequently subverted democracy around the world.

===Alexander Butterfield===
On July 12, 1975, prior to closed-door questioning by the staff of the House Select Intelligence Committee, Prouty told reporters that Alexander Butterfield was a contact for the CIA at the White House. He said he had learned the information over four years earlier from E. Howard Hunt while doing work for the National League of Families. Prouty said that most federal government departments, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, had similar CIA contacts and that he assumed that former president Richard Nixon was aware of Butterfield&#x27;s role. Senator Frank Church said the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities had found no evidence that the CIA planted an undercover agent within the White House or other government agencies.

A few days later, Prouty partially walked back his comments in a telephone interview: &quot;They may have told me the wrong name in order to cover up the real informer.&quot; In a telephone statement to UPI that same day, Butterfield called the allegations &quot;wholly false and defamatory&quot; and stated that he had never met nor seen Hunt and had just recently heard of Prouty. In an interview with CBS News from Eglin Air Force Base where he was serving his prison term for his involvement in the Watergate scandal, Hunt denied the allegation calling it an &quot;unfortunate invention on Mr. Prouty&#x27;s part.&quot; Also interviewed by CBS, Prouty again stated it was Hunt who told him about Butterfield.

In a personal letter sent to Roger Feinman at CBS News Radio on July 14, 1975, Harold Weisberg expressed his belief that &quot;the clear inference of the Prouty connection is that as a CIA man Butterfield pulled the plug on Nixon.&quot;

On July 19, Church said that his committee found that there was &quot;no scintilla of evidence&quot; to support Prouty&#x27;s allegations, and that his committee had ruled out the possibility that Butterfield served as a liaison officer for the CIA. Church also stated, &quot;on close interrogation, Mr. Prouty is unable to substantiate his earlier statement and acknowledges this to be the case.&quot;

===Kennedy assassination===
According to Prouty, people within the intelligence and military communities of the United States government conspired to assassinate Kennedy. He maintained that their actions were a coup d&#x27;état to stop the President from taking control of the CIA after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Prouty stated that the assassination was orchestrated by Edward Lansdale (&quot;General Y&quot; in Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;JFK&quot;) and that Lansdale appeared in photographs of the &quot;three tramps.&quot;

In 1975, Prouty appeared with Richard Sprague at a news conference in New York to present what they believed was photographic evidence of a conspiracy. According to Prouty, the movement of Kennedy after a bullet struck his head was consistent with a shot from the grassy knoll. He also suggested that the actions of a man with an umbrella, the &quot;Umbrella Man&quot;, were suspicious.

===1960 U-2 incident===
In his 1973 book &quot;The Secret Team&quot;, Prouty provided an alternative view of the 1960 U-2 incident. He charged that the flight was sabotaged in such a way by anticommunist elements in our government as to cause the U-2 to lose altitude mid-flight, allowing the Soviets to shoot it down. Prouty believed the ultimate purpose of the operation was the engineering of the subsequent international incident that put an end to the increasingly amicable U.S.–Soviet relations and doomed any hope for a positive outcome between Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the Four Power Paris Summit set to begin May 16. The summit began as scheduled but quickly collapsed as a result of fallout from the incident.

William Blum made his own case for Prouty&#x27;s version of events in his own book, &quot;Killing Hope&quot;, published in 2008.

Prouty&#x27;s version of events was rejected by former CIA director Richard Helms, Richard Bissell, Walter Pfoigheimer, and other career officers of the Central Intelligence Agency. Helms commented on Prouty&#x27;s reframing of the interests and outcomes of the incident, offering the following: &quot;I simply don&#x27;t believe that Prouty is accurate. There is no substance to the charge.&quot; Bissell later claimed that Prouty was not authorized for access to U-2 information and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t see what information there could have been aboard that aircraft that could have helped the Russians&quot; to bring down Powers&#x27; U2.

===Antisemitic association===
Prouty was a featured speaker at the 1990 convention of the Liberty Lobby. Prouty was also named to the advisory board for the Lobby&#x27;s Populist Action Committee. Prouty also sold the reprint rights for &quot;The Secret Team&quot; to the Noontide Press, the publishing arm for the Institute for Historical Review, a holocaust denial organization.

Prouty denied having known of the racist and antisemitic associations of the Lobby, noted that he also spoke at a ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and assured Oliver Stone &quot;... that he was neither a racist nor an anti-Semite... but merely a writer in need of a platform.&quot; In a response to an article about Prouty in &quot;Esquire&quot;, which he labeled a &quot;character assassination,&quot; Stone lamented Prouty&#x27;s association with the Liberty Lobby but questioned its relevance to Prouty&#x27;s reliability as a source. In an obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Michael Carlson wrote that &quot;[a]lthough Prouty himself never espoused such [anti-semitic] beliefs, the connection enabled critics to dismiss his later writings.&quot;

<text>Charles Barney Cory (January 31, 1857 – July 31, 1921) was an American ornithologist, golfer, outdoorsman, and author.

==Early life==
Cory was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father had made a fortune from a large import business, ensuring that his son never had to work. At the age of sixteen Cory developed an interest in ornithology and began a skin collection. Due to his ability to travel anywhere he wished, this soon became the best collection of birds of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico in existence.

In February 1876, the nineteen year old Cory was elected a member of Nuttall Ornithological Club, America&#x27;s first ornithological organization. It was here that he met the leading ornithologists of Massachusetts at the time, such as William Brewster, Henry Henshaw, Ruthven Deane, Charles Johnson Maynard, with Joel Asaph Allen soon to join as well.

Starting in 1876, he briefly attended Harvard and the Boston University School of Law but soon left to continue his travelling. In 1877, he went collecting in Florida, followed by a trip to the Magdalen Islands in 1878, and another to the Bahamas the next year. In 1880, he collected in Europe, and then he returned to the West Indies in 1881.

==Career==
In 1883, he was one of the forty-eight ornithologists invited to become founders of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union and one of those who attended the founding convention in New York City. The next year he visited the Dakota Territory and Montana with his friend, Martin A. Ryerson, to collect specimen. The rest of the 1880s saw him in Cuba, Mexico, and Canada. In 1887, Cory was made the curator of birds at the Boston Society of Natural History.

In 1882, Cory purchased Great Island in West Yarmouth, Massachusetts as a summer retreat and game preserve, and set about the restoration of its Point Gammon Light as an ornithological observatory. While summering there on Cape Cod, Cory entertained dignitaries such as President Grover Cleveland, and frequently sponsored community sporting and cultural events.

From 1888 to 1892, he and friend Charles Richard Crane funded and played on the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. At Cory and Crane&#x27;s expense, various well-known professional and amateur players were brought in to play alongside the Hyannis locals. In 1888, Cory outfitted his club in &quot;suits which were of the best white flannel and red stockings,&quot; and secured the services of pitcher Dick Conway and catcher Mert Hackett, both formerly of the major league Boston Beaneaters. In 1889, Cory brought back Hackett, and also enlisted Barney Gilligan, who had played for the 1884 major league champion Providence Grays. After the 1891 season, Cory published an extended ode to his ballclub in the style of Ernest Thayer&#x27;s &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot;.

When Cory&#x27;s collection of 19,000 bird specimens became too large to keep in his house he donated them to The Field Museum in Chicago, and he was given the position of Curator of Ornithology. Cory&#x27;s collection of 600 ornithological volumes were purchased by Edward E. Ayer in 1894, and in turn donated to the museum. Cory lost his entire fortune in 1906, and took a salaried position at the museum as Curator of Zoology, remaining there for the rest of his life. Cory made routine collecting trips in Florida and the West Indies. He sometimes financed trips for other naturalists.

Cory was a director in many corporations.

Cory wrote many books, including &quot;The Birds of Haiti and San Domingo&quot; (1885), &quot;The Birds of the West Indies&quot; (1889) and &quot;The Birds of Illinois and Wisconsin&quot; (1909). His last major work was the four-part &quot;Catalogue of Birds of the Americas&quot;, two of which were completed after his death by Carl Edward Hellmayr; Hellmayr later extended the series to 15 parts.

Cory was the first person to describe Cory&#x27;s shearwater as a species. It had previously been described by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769, but he had believed it to be a race of another shearwater.

Cory participated in the 1904 Summer Olympics as a golfer. He competed in the individual event but did not finish.

<doc id="460367" wikidata="Q2396652" url="?curid=460367" title="Recreational diver training">
<text>Recreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of scuba equipment so that the diver is able to dive for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training.

Not only is the underwater environment hazardous but the diving equipment itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur. Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effective if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures, and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage, or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered.

Many diver training organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a &quot;diving certification card,&quot; also known as a &quot;C-card,&quot; or qualification card. This diving certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence. Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course. The International Organization for Standardization has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the (United States) RSTC are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards:

The initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer. Dive operators, dive shops, and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their diving cylinders filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation.

== Types of training ==
Most recreational diver training is for certification purposes, but a significant amount is for non-certification purposes such as introductory scuba experience, refresher training, and regional orientation. Mainstream recreational diver training starts with an entry-level course, focused on the skills of operating the equipment safely, which is intended to be followed by further training focused on the environment and other skills, but many recreational divers never progress further than their entry level certification, and may not dive often enough to maintain the basic skills learned on the course. Refresher courses are offered by many diving schools to remedy this possible loss of competence due to lack of practice.

===Entry-level===

The entry-level course is for certification of competence to dive in open water to a limited depth and not incurring a decompression obligation requiring decompression stops, so that the diver can make a direct ascent to the surface at any time at an acceptable level of risk. Entry level training does not generally require the diver to be competent to rescue another diver, though some training in sharing breathing gas is standard, and divers are expected to dive in the company of a dive buddy of equivalent certification. Entry level certification to the internationally recognised Autonomous diver standard ISO 24801-2 and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-2 is most widely accepter.

Supervised diver certification is offered by some training agencies as an entry-level programme, and a certificate is issued, but the diver is required to dive only under the direct supervision of a recreational diving professional, such as a divemaster or instructor. The certification aligns with international standard ISO 24801-1, and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-1. Most diving organizations recommend not to exceed a diving depth of 10 to 12 metres. In some parts of the world there is a minimum requirement which corresponds to the Autonomous Diver certification and an in-date medical certificate for hiring diving equipment and taking part in recreational diving. In these places a certificate which corresponds to the Supervised Diver is regarded as insufficient.

====Refresher courses====

A scuba refresher course is a voluntary training intervention which mainly targets the autonomous diver, which is the certification level most likely to be associated with inactive recreational divers, and which includes the most basic knowledge and skills. In principle a refresher course could be a checkout at any certification level, and could cover either or both skills and knowledge, but in practice the most common refresher courses are offered for the divers most likely to need one, which are entry-level divers with little experience and a long gap since their last dive.

The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) course is called ReActivate, and Scuba Schools International (SSI) offers a similar course named Scuba Skills Update. They include a theory component which can be done on-line, and a practical skills component that can be done under the supervision of a divemaster or instructor, and starts with checkout of setting up the scuba equipment and water entry techniques, and continues with assessing critical skills like mask recovery and clearing, neutral buoyancy, ditching weights and ascent using an alternative air source. PADI suggest a refresher after six months inactivity, but the actual need depends on the previous experience and skill of the diver.

A refresher course almost always includes a confined water skill practice session, and may include an open water dive. Some schools expect the diver to revise the theory as well. This would typically be on-line, but there may be a live discussion and feedback session.

===Further training===

Further training is focused on core diving skills, skills associated with the environment and equipment (specialty courses), safety and mutual assistance (Rescue diver), dive group leadership (Dive leader) and training other divers (Diving instructor). Some training providers require or encourage the diver to gain experience at their current level between training programmes, others are willing to enroll the diver on the next course as soon as they are available to start. Dive planning and safety relevant to the current skill level is included in each course. Some agencies approach further training by packaging a significant number of skills together and provide the training as an integrated unit, which is relatively efficient in overall time and cost, while others break it down into smaller programs, each dealing with a limited group of associated skills, which can be sold to the customer separately, which can be convenient if the diver does not want to invest the time and effort to do it all at once, but will generally cost more in total.

===Dive leadership training===

Dive leader describes the minimum requirements for dive leader training and certification for recreational scuba divers in international standard ISO 24801-3 and the equivalent European Standard EN 14153-3. Various organizations offer training that meets the requirements of the dive leader standard. Some agencies use the title &quot;Dive Leader&quot; for their equivalent certification, but several other titles are also used, &quot;Divemaster&quot; may be the most widespread, but &quot;Dive Supervisor&quot; is also used, and should not be confused with the very different status and responsibilities of a professional diving supervisor. CMAS affiliates certifications which meet the requirements of CMAS 3-star diver should meet the standard by default.

Scuba dive leaders are considered competent to plan, organise and conduct dives and to lead other recreational divers on open water dives, and for specialised recreational scuba diving activities for which they have been trained. They are also considered competent to conduct emergency procedures associated with these activities and the relevant diving environment. They may require orientation for unfamiliar local environmental conditions. Additional specialised training and experience is required to lead divers on more demanding dives.

The term is also used by BSAC for a specific certification.

===Recreational diving instructor training===

Minimum requirements to attend a recreational diving instructor training programme vary between certification agencies. The requirements for PADI Instructor Development Course (IDC) are 6 months as a certified diver, Registration as a PADI Divemaster, with 60 logged dives, a medical statement that the applicant does not suffer from a disqualifying medical condition and recent participation in PADI Emergency First Response training. The IDC takes five to seven days, and comprises two parts, Assistant Instructor training and Open Water Scuba Instructor training. During the IDC the candidate will learn PADI Standards and Procedures, The PADI system of instruction, diver safety and risk management, The role of the diving instructor in the recreational diving industry, and marketing and sales counseling for recreational diving business. 100 logged dives are required before the applicant can take the two-day Instructor Examination. PADI puts more emphasis on the business side of recreational diving than most other organisations. Other certification agencies often have more stringent requirements,

Certification as an entry-level instructor authorises the holder to train entry-level divers and usually also specialties the instructor also holds. Training in specialties generally requires the instructor to be qualified in those specialties, but in several cases they are prerequisites for training as an instructor.

===Technical diving training===

Technical diving is legally a type of recreational diving, but generally requires significantly greater competence to manage the higher risks of the environment, equipment and physiological challenges chosen by the technical diver. Errors and malfunctions that may be merely inconvenient in shallow open-water recreational dives within the no-decompression limits, may be rapidly fatal in overhead or deep, staged decompression dives. The necessary level of understanding of the principles, hazards and possible consequences, and the skills and procedures for managing the equipment and foreseeable contingencies is commensurately greater.

===Rebreather diver training===

Rebreather diving for recreational purposes is generally classed as technical diving, and the training is provided by the technical diver certification agencies. Training in the use of rebreathers has two components: Generic training for the class of rebreather, including the theory of operation and the general procedures, and specific training for the model of rebreather, which covers the details of preparation, testing, user maintenance and troubleshooting, and those details of normal operating and emergency procedures which are specific to the model of rebreather. Crossover training from one model to another generally only requires the second aspect if the equipment is similar in design and operation.

== Training providers==
Many diver training organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a &quot;diver certification card,&quot; also known as a &quot;C-card,&quot; or qualification card. This diver certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence.

Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course.

==Duration of training==
Recreational diver training courses range from minor specialties which require one classroom session and an open water dive, and which may be completed in a day, to complex specialties which may take several days to weeks, and require several classroom sessions, confined water skills training and practice, and a substantial number of open-water dives, followed by rigorous assessment of knowledge and skills. Details on the approximate duration of training can be found on the websites of most certification agencies, but accurate schedules are generally only available from the specific school or instructor who will present that course, as this will depend on the local conditions and other constraints.

The initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer.

== Location of training lessons ==
Initial training typically takes place in three environments:
* Classroom - where material is presented and reviewed. This may be partially or wholly substituted by on-line learning, which may include on-line assessment.
* Confined water (Swimming pool or equivalent natural body of water) - where skills are taught by demonstration and initially practiced.
* Open water - where the learner demonstrates and refines the skills he or she has learned in an environment reasonably similar to the expected actual diving environment, and gains some experience of realistic conditions in a typical diving environment.

The usual sequence for learning most diving skills is to be taught the theory in the classroom, be shown the skills and practice them in a swimming pool or sheltered and shallow open water using the minimum equipment, then practice again in open water under supervision in full equipment and only then use the skill on real dives. Typically, early open water training takes place in a local body of water such as a lake, a flooded quarry or a sheltered and shallow part of the sea. Advanced training mostly takes place at depths and locations similar to the diver&#x27;s normal diving environment.

===Referral systems===
Some certification agencies use a diver referral system, where a diver&#x27;s open water training can be completed by another instructor at a place where diving conditions are more desirable. This allows the learner to complete their training on a vacation while not wasting vacation time on classroom and pool training sessions. The Universal Referral Program allows the open-water training to be done by an instructor from a different agency,

== Training topics ==

Most entry-level training is similar across the diver training agencies, although some may emphasize certain topics earlier in the program, such as the inclusion of diver rescue in syllabuses such as CMAS 1* and NAUI, and its absence from other equivalent courses such as PADI Open Water Diver.

==Scuba training for minors ==

Most training agencies have minimum ages for diving and often restrict younger children to snorkeling. BSAC allows 6-year-olds to train for the &quot;Dolphin Snorkeller&quot; grade.

From the age of 8 years old PADI has the &quot;SEAL Team program&quot; and SSI have &quot;SCUBA Rangers&quot; which teach diving in shallow swimming pools. PADI allows 10-year-olds to do the full Open Water Diver course. They are called &quot;Junior Open Water&quot; divers. There are restrictions on their depth and group size when diving. Also they must dive with their parents or a professional. When they reach the age of 12 they can dive with a qualified adult. Over 15 they are considered capable of diving with others of the same age or above.

BSAC allows 12-year-olds to do the full entry-level diving course - the Ocean Diver course. This qualification has no restrictions for the young diver, but individual branches of BSAC are free to set their own minimum age for branch membership.

The German Society for Pediatric Sports Medicine (Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Sportmedizin]) has developed a consensus statement on the subject of children&#x27;s diving by the &#x27;Children&#x27;s Diving&#x27; working group, which was presented to the public as the &quot;Eisenacher Erklärun&quot; at the International Boat Show in Düsseldorf in 2015. The major diving organizations in Germany, including international organizations, have agreed to this declaration. This &#x27;Eisenach Statement&#x27; contains the essential rules of conduct when diving (dive training) with children.

==International standards equivalence==

The International Organization for Standardization has approved recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide.

The listed standards developed by the (United States) RSTC are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards:
===ISO training standards===
The ISO training standards are published by the International Organisation for Standards, and are minimum standards. These standards also generally have an equivalent EN standard designation. A diver training agency can follow the standard as long as all the requirements are met, and can add as much additional course material as they see fit. Gas density limits are specified for rebreather training, with a preferred value of 5.2g/L and a maximum of 6.3g/L. These limits also effectively address narcotic limits.
* ISO 11107 &quot;Recreational diving services – Requirements for training programmes on enriched air nitrox (EAN) diving&quot;
* ISO 11121 &quot;Recreational diving services – Requirements for introductory training programmes to scuba diving&quot;
*ISO 24801 &quot;Recreational diving services — Requirements for the training of recreational scuba divers&quot; (EN 14153)
** &quot;Part 1: Level 1 — Supervised diver (ISO 24801-1)&quot;
** &quot;Part 2: Level 2 — Autonomous diver (ISO 24801-2)&quot;. ISO.
** &quot;Part 3: Level 3 — Dive leader (ISO 24801-3:2014)&quot;
*ISO 24802 &quot;Recreational Diving Services - Safety related minimum requirements for the training of scuba instructors&quot; (EN 14413)
** &quot;Part 1: Level 1 scuba instructor&quot;
** &quot;Part 2: Level 2 scuba instructor&quot;
*ISO 24803 specifies performance requirements for the recreational diving service provider, also known as the &quot;Dive Center&quot; (EN 14467)
*ISO 24804 &quot;Recreational Diving Services – Requirements for recreational rebreather diver training – No-decompression diving&quot;
*ISO 24805 &quot;Recreational Diving Services – Requirements for recreational rebreather diver training – Decompression diving to 45m&quot;
*ISO 24806 &quot;Recreational Diving Services – Requirements for recreational rebreather diver training – Decompression diving to 60m&quot;
*ISO 24807 &quot;Recreational Diving Services – Requirements for recreational rebreather diver training – Decompression diving to 100m&quot;This does not limit divers to a maximum depth of 100m, but the training is not required to go below 100m.
*ISO 24808 &quot;Recreational Diving Services – Requirements for recreational rebreather instructor training&quot;There are four parts within this standard addressing the levels of instructor certification for training each of the diver levels.

<doc id="460370" wikidata="Q1811605" url="?curid=460370" title="Rother District">
<text>Rother is a local government district in East Sussex, England. Its council is based in Bexhill-on-Sea. The district is named after the River Rother which flows within its boundaries.

The neighbouring districts are Wealden, Tunbridge Wells, Ashford, Folkestone and Hythe, and Hastings. Aside from its coast, Hastings is surrounded by Rother.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Battle Rural District was established in 1934 from a merger of Battle Urban District Council with the rural district councils of Battle, Hastings, Rye and Ticehurst. The council was based at Watch Oak on Chain Lane, Battle.
*Bexhill Municipal Borough was established by Royal Charter in 1902 and was based at Bexhill Town Hall, built for Bexhill Urban District Council in 1895. 
*Rye Municipal Borough Coucil met at Rye Town Hall.
The new district was named Rother after the River Rother which flows through the district.

==Governance==
Rother District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by East Sussex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2019 election, being led by a coalition called the &#x27;Rother Alliance&#x27; comprising Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and some of the independent councillors. The independents in the Rother Alliance formed a local political party in January 2023 called the &#x27;Rother Association of Independent Councillors&#x27; (RAOIC).

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Bexhill Town Hall on London Road in Bexhill, which was built in 1895 for the Bexhill Urban District Council, which became Bexhill Borough Council in 1902. The building continued to serve as the seat of local government following the reorganisation in 1974 which created Rother District.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 38 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Parishes==

The lowest level of local government is the civil parish; there are 34 within Rother. The parish councils for the three parishes of Battle, Bexhill-on-Sea and Rye take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The two parishes of Ashburnham and Penhurst share a grouped parish council. The parish of East Guldeford has a parish meeting rather than a parish council due to its small population.

==Geography==
Rother District covers two areas of relief: to the south, a section of the High Weald; and to the north the lower land, named the Rother Levels, across which flow the River Rother, which rises on the Weald and flows easterly towards Rye Bay, and its tributaries. For much of the course of the main river it constitutes the boundary between East Sussex and Kent, and is given the alternative title of the ’’Kent Ditch’’. Tributaries of the river include the Rivers Dudwell, Tillingham and Brede.

The district reaches the coast in the vicinity of Bexhill, and on the shores of Rye Bay.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Demographics==
Rother has one of the oldest populations (with a median age of 52 years) and the lowest per capita income in the UK. A study using 2011 census data found that 47% of the resident population lived in urban areas, 23% in rural towns and their fringes, and 29% in rural villages or dispersed. 

==Transport==
There are several main roads crossing the district. The major trunk road is the A21, London to Hastings road; it is joined by the A28 road from Ashford road near Hastings; which in turn is crossed by the A268 Hawkhurst to Rye road. There is also the A259 coastal route

The Hastings Line, East Coastway Line and the Marshlink Line are the three railway lines in the District; The Kent and East Sussex Railway tourist line terminates at Bodiam.

Long-distance footpaths include the Sussex Border Path; and the Saxon Shore Way, which links with the 1066 Country Walk.

==Landmarks==
Major landmarks include Bodiam and Camber Castles; and Battle Abbey.

<doc id="460371" wikidata="Q774542" url="?curid=460371" title="New Democratic Party of Manitoba">
<text>The New Democratic Party of Manitoba (Manitoba NDP; ), branded as Manitoba&#x27;s NDP, is a social democratic political party in Manitoba, Canada. It is the provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party, and is a successor to the Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. It is currently the governing party in Manitoba.

==Formation and early years==
In the federal election of 1958, the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was reduced to only eight seats in the House of Commons of Canada. The CCF&#x27;s leadership restructured the party during the next three years, and in 1961 it merged with the Canadian Labour Congress to create the New Democratic Party (NDP).

Most provincial wings of the CCF also transformed themselves into &quot;New Democratic Party&quot; organisations before the year was over, with Saskatchewan as the only exception. There was very little opposition to the change in Manitoba, and the Manitoba NDP was formally constituted on November 4, 1961. Future Manitoba NDP leader Howard Pawley was one of the few CCF members to oppose the change. Outgoing CCF leader Russell Paulley easily won the new party&#x27;s leadership, defeating two minor figures who offered little in the way of policy alternatives. For all intents and purposes, the CCF caucus in the Manitoba Legislative Assembly became the NDP caucus.

The NDP did not initially achieve an electoral breakthrough in Manitoba, falling from eleven seats to seven in the provincial election of 1962. They recovered to ten seats in the 1966 election, but still failed to challenge Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government seriously.

==Modern era==
===Party leadership contest in 1968===
Many in the NDP considered Paulley&#x27;s leadership a liability, especially after the 1966 election. Paulley was known as an old-style labour politician, and could not appeal to the broader constituency base that the party needed for an electoral breakthrough. In 1968, he was challenged for the party leadership by Sidney Green, a labour lawyer from north-end Winnipeg.

The 1968 leadership challenge was unusual, in that many of Paulley&#x27;s supporters wanted him to resign the following year so that he could be replaced by federal member of Parliament (MP) Edward Schreyer. Some also regarded the challenge as reflecting ideological divisions in the party, with Green depicted as a candidate of the radical left. Green&#x27;s supporters tended to be from the party&#x27;s youth wing, while Paulley was supported by the party establishment and organized labour.

Paulley won the challenge 213 votes to 168 and resigned the following year. Edward Schreyer entered the contest to replace him and defeated Green by 506 votes to 177.

===Provincial election of 1969===
The NDP won 28 of 57 seats in the 1969 election and formed a minority government after gaining the support of maverick Manitoba Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Laurent Desjardins. Although the party had been expected to increase its parliamentary presence, its sudden victory was a surprise to most political observers.

The question of leadership was important to the NDP&#x27;s victory. After Dufferin Roblin resigned as Premier of Manitoba in 1967, the Progressive Conservatives chose Walter Weir as his replacement. While Roblin was a Red Tory, Weir was from the party&#x27;s rural conservative wing, and alienated many urban and centrist to centre-left voters who had previously supported the Tories. The Liberals, for their part, called former cabinet minister Robert Bend out of a decade-long retirement to lead the party before the election. Like Weir, Bend was a rural populist who had difficulty appealing to urban voters. He campaigned on a &quot;cowboy/rodeo&quot; theme that made both himself and his party look dated.

Schreyer, by contrast, was a centrist within the NDP. He was not ideologically committed to democratic socialism, and was in many respects more similar to federal Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau than to the province&#x27;s traditional NDP leadership. He was also the first of Manitoba&#x27;s social-democratic leaders who was not from an Anglo-Saxon and Protestant background. A Catholic of German–Austrian descent from rural Manitoba, he appealed to constituencies that were not previously inclined to support the NDP.

===Early years in power===
During the years of NDP government, major tax and social reforms were carried out, a major hydroelectricity development project was launched in the north of Manitoba, while the province spent heavily on public housing. Schreyer&#x27;s first administration introduced several important changes to the province. It amalgamated the city of Winnipeg, introduced public auto insurance, and significantly reduced Medicare premiums. Schreyer&#x27;s cabinet was divided on providing provincial funding for denominational schools (Green led the opposition to any such funding) but resolved the issue by a compromise. The government also continued energy development projects in northern Manitoba.

Schreyer&#x27;s government was re-elected with a parliamentary majority in the 1973 provincial election. His second ministry was less ambitious on policy matters than was his first, though the government did introduce a new tax on mining resources. In the 1977 election, the Tories under former cabinet minister Sterling Lyon upset Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats.

Schreyer resigned as party leader in 1979, after being appointed Governor General of Canada. Howard Pawley was chosen as interim leader over Sidney Green and Saul Cherniack in a caucus vote. He later defeated Muriel Smith and Russell Doern to win the party&#x27;s leadership at a delegated convention. Green left the NDP soon thereafter, claiming &quot;the trade union movement and militant feminists&quot; had taken control of the party. In 1981, Green formed the Progressive Party of Manitoba, joined by New Democratic MLAs Ben Hanuschak and Bud Boyce.

Despite these defections, Pawley&#x27;s New Democrats won a majority government in the 1981 election. Pawley&#x27;s government introduced progressive labour legislation and entrenched French language services in Manitoba&#x27;s parliamentary and legal systems. Doern, who had served as a cabinet minister in Schreyer&#x27;s government, left the NDP in 1984 on the language issue.

===Declining popularity in the late 1980s===
The New Democrats were re-elected with a narrow majority in the 1986 election. Over the next two years, the party suffered a significant decline in its popularity. Auto insurance premiums rose significantly during this period, and the government&#x27;s support for the Meech Lake Accord also alienated some voters. Future party leader Gary Doer has claimed that an internal party poll put the NDP at only 6% popular support in early 1988.

Early in 1988, disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding voted with the opposition against his government&#x27;s budget. This defection brought about the government&#x27;s defeat in the house and forced a new election before the NDP could recover its support base. Pawley immediately resigned as party leader, though he continued to lead a caretaker administration as premier.

Gary Doer narrowly defeated Len Harapiak on the third ballot of the leadership convention which followed. Doer declined to be sworn in as premier after the convention.

The Pawley government&#x27;s achievements included the construction of the Limestone hydro project in northern Manitoba, and the enactment of the Manitoba Human Rights Code which included, for the first time in Manitoba, protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

===Electoral defeat and years in opposition (1988–1999)===
The NDP was defeated in the 1988 election, winning only 12 seats out of 57. Led by Gary Filmon, the Tories won 25 seats, and the Liberal Party under Sharon Carstairs won 20 seats to supplant the NDP as the official opposition. Most of the NDP&#x27;s seats were in north-end Winnipeg and the north of the province. Doer was not personally blamed for his party&#x27;s poor performance and remained as leader.

Filmon called another provincial election in 1990 to seek a majority mandate. He was successful, but Doer brought the NDP back to official opposition status with 20 seats, benefiting from a strong personal showing at the leaders&#x27; debate.

The NDP began the 1995 election well behind the Tories and Liberals, but received a last-minute surge in popular support and came very close to forming government. The party won 23 seats, with the Liberals falling to only three.

Filmon&#x27;s Tories lost much of their popular support between 1995 and 1999, due to increased unemployment, the privatization of Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS; now Bell MTS) and a vote-manipulation scandal in the 1995 election. Voters were also unnerved by Filmon&#x27;s announcement that his government would undertake a further shift to the right if reelected. With the Liberals suffering from internal divisions, the NDP could present themselves as the only viable alternative. The 1999 election was considered too close to call until election day, but the NDP benefited from a decline in Liberal support and won 32 seats to form a majority government. After eleven years when the NDP was in opposition, Doer was sworn in as premier.

===Return to government (1999–2016)===
====Doer government====
The Doer government did not introduce as many radical initiatives as the Schreyer and Pawley governments, though it retained the NDP&#x27;s traditional support for organized labour. Manitoba had the lowest unemployment rate in Canada , and Doer&#x27;s government remained generally popular with the electorate.

In the 2003 election, the NDP were re-elected with 35 seats and almost 50% of the popular vote, an impressive result in a three-party system. Doer was re-elected in his northeast-Winnipeg riding of Concordia with over 75% of the popular vote, and the NDP also made inroads into traditional Tory bastions in south-end Winnipeg.

Doer became the only NDP premier in Manitoba history to capture a third majority when his party was re-elected during the 2007 provincial election. It increased its seat count again to 36. Again, support was gathered from the southern and western areas of Winnipeg which were traditionally thought to be safe for the Progressive Conservatives.

Under Doer, the NDP ran a moderate government that introduced a succession of balanced budgets. Doer&#x27;s first budget, delivered in 2000, removed 15,000 low-income Manitobans from the tax rolls and introduced $150 million in tax breaks over three years while projecting a $10 million surplus. His 2003 budget, the last of his first term, reduced provincial taxes by $82.7 million and increased spending by about 5%, mostly in health and education.

Despite a series of economic setbacks, the government posted another balanced budget in 2004 through increased taxes and drug premiums as well as civil service reduction through attrition. Tobacco and liquor taxes were increased and the provincial sales tax expanded to cover more services, although Doer rejected a panel recommendation to increase the sales tax by 1%.

The government introduced a more expansive budget in 2005 after an infusion of federal revenues, reducing personal and property taxes, increasing spending by 3.5% and putting $314 million into a &quot;rainy day&quot; fund. Doer&#x27;s 2006 and 2007 budgets introduced further tax cuts; the 2007 budget also offered increased education spending and a new child benefit to assist low-income families.

At the Manitoba NDP&#x27;s March 2009 convention, Doer announced that Manitoba would continue its commitment to education, training and research despite a global economic downturn and a slowing economy. He argued that the province was still recovering from the Filmon government&#x27;s spending cuts during the economic downtown of the 1990s and that his policies would allow Manitoba to emerge from the recession in a strong, competitive position. His government introduced a balanced budget with economic stimulus programs a few weeks later, even as the global recession forced other provincial governments across Canada into deficit.

====Selinger government====
After leading the party for over two decades, Doer retired as premier and leader of the NDP on 27 August 2009. The following day, Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada, nominated him to become Canadian Ambassador to the United States. Following Doer&#x27;s retirement, Finance Minister Greg Selinger became leader of the party at the leadership convention in October 2009. Despite gloomy predictions, Selinger led the NDP to its fourth straight majority government in the October 2011 general election, surpassing Doer&#x27;s record and winning 37 seats.

In April 2013, the Selinger government broke an earlier promise not to increase the provincial sales tax. It instead implemented a 1-percentage-point increase in the sales tax from 7% to 8%, which resulted in a precipitous decline in popular support, in addition to record deficits and massive interest payments for debt services, for the government and, ultimately, a caucus revolt against Selinger&#x27;s leadership culminating in the resignation of five cabinet ministers. Due in part to the unpopularity of the tax increase, the NDP fell far behind the Progressive Conservatives in public opinion polls and did not recover for years afterward. In the fall of 2014, several cabinet ministers privately asked Selinger to resign in hopes that the party would recover under a new leader. However, Selinger declined. In September 2014, during a caucus retreat, several MLAs openly told Selinger that he needed to resign. However, he refused again. A month later, at the end of October, Jennifer Howard, (Fort Rouge), minister of finance, Stan Struthers (Dauphin), minister of municipal government, Theresa Oswald (Seine River), minister for jobs and the economy, Andrew Swan (Minto), minister of justice and Erin Selby (Southdale), minister of health, and several senior party officials went public with their call for Selinger&#x27;s resignation. On November 3, the five ministers resigned from cabinet due to their opposition to Selinger&#x27;s continued leadership. They did, however, remain in the NDP caucus as backbench MLAs. Selinger responded on November 9 by asking the party executive to hold a leadership election during the party&#x27;s annual convention scheduled for March 6–8, 2015, stating his intention to be a candidate. The party executive subsequently agreed. Theresa Oswald, one of the five rebel ex-ministers, challenged Selinger for the leadership, as did Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation Steve Ashton, who had not vocally opposed Selinger but who resigned from cabinet to enter the leadership contest. At the March 8, 2015 leadership election, Ashton was eliminated on the first ballot and Selinger prevailed on the second ballot with 50.93% of ballots cast, defeating Oswald by 33 votes.

After trailing in opinion polling for almost four years, the NDP was heavily defeated at the April 19, 2016 provincial election. It dropped to only 14 seats, the party&#x27;s worst showing since 1988. Notably, it lost several previously safe seats by wide margins. The Progressive Conservatives under Brian Pallister were elected to a majority government. Selinger announced his intention to resign as party leader in his concession speech. Logan MLA Flor Marcelino was named interim leader on May 7, 2016.

===Recent years (2016–present)===
Prominent Indigenous broadcaster and first-term MLA Wab Kinew was elected as permanent leader at the 2017 leadership convention. He won over 70% of the votes cast and defeated former cabinet minister Steve Ashton, who had lost his seat at the 2016 election.

====In opposition====
Kinew led the Manitoba NDP into the 2019 provincial election, which Premier Brian Pallister called early to avoid conflict with the celebrations planned in 2020 for the 150th anniversary of Manitoba joining Confederation. While the party increased its share of the popular vote and gained six seats in Winnipeg and the Northern Regions of the province, the PCs were re-elected with a slightly smaller majority government than before the election. The new 18-member NDP caucus was sworn in on September 27, 2019, and the new positions in the shadow cabinet were announced later that day. 

====Kinew government====
Kinew stayed as Manitoba NDP leader and led them into the 2023 election, with the party leading the Progressive Conservatives in polls for most of the term. The party won a majority government with 34 seats, mainly on the strength of taking all but four seats in Winnipeg: Fort Whyte, Roblin, Tuxedo, and Tyndall Park. Kinew became the first provincial premier of First Nations descent.

==Membership==
Like its federal counterpart, the Manitoba NDP has historically had more long-term members than other registered parties in the province. It also has fewer short-term members who are signed up to influence nomination contests.

<text>The &quot;Formidable&quot; class of battleships were a three-ship class of pre-dreadnoughts designed by Sir William White and built for the Royal Navy in the late 1890s. The class comprised , , and . They were armed with a battery of four guns, they had top speed of , and they marked the adoption of Krupp armour in British battleship designs. The class formed the basis for the nearly identical of five ships, and those ships are sometimes included in the &quot;Formidable&quot; class. &quot;Formidable&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, and &quot;Implacable&quot; were built between 1898 and 1901 at the Portsmouth, Chatham, and Devonport Dockyards, respectively.

All three ships served in the Mediterranean Fleet early in their careers, before returning to British waters in the late 1900s for duty in the Home Fleet, Channel Fleet, and the Atlantic Fleet. By 1912, all three ships had been assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron, Home Fleet, where they remained until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. They patrolled the English Channel in the early months of the war and escorted troopships carrying elements of the British Expeditionary Force and other British Army units across the Channel to France. On the night of 31 December 1914 – 1 January 1915 while on patrol in the Channel, the 5th Squadron encountered a German U-boat that torpedoed and sank &quot;Formidable&quot;. &quot;Irresistible&quot; was sent to the Dardanelles Campaign in February 1915, and after engaging in a series of attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications, she struck a naval mine and sank.

&quot;Implacable&quot;, the sole surviving member of the class, joined the Dardanelles operations in March 1915 and saw action during the landings at Cape Helles in April. She was later withdrawn, first in May 1915 to reinforce the Italian fleet guarding the Adriatic Sea and then to Salonika in November that year. After being recalled to Britain in July 1917, she was converted into a depot ship and used to support the Northern Patrol. After the war, she was sold for scrap in 1921 and was broken up in 1922.

==Design==
Design work on what became the &quot;Formidable&quot; class began with a meeting of the Board of Admiralty on 3 May 1897, where the general parameters of the new class was discussed. The Board concluded that repeating the would not be a workable solution, since the Imperial Japanese Navy had begun building larger, battleships and the &quot;Canopus&quot; design was too small to carry the new 40-calibre Mk IX guns, which were significantly heavier than the shorter 35-calibre BL 12-inch Mk VIII guns. The design staff determined that it was possible to construct a new ship that incorporated the advances of the &quot;Canopus&quot; class—namely, Krupp armour and improved engines and water-tube boilers—on a larger hull like the earlier s without increasing displacement and keeping the same speed as the &quot;Canopus&quot; class.

The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, provided two design options, both modified versions of the basic &quot;Majestic&quot; form. Both variants had a main battery of four 12-inch guns, belt armour that was thick, and a top speed of . The main difference between the designs was the number of secondary guns; the first had twelve guns and the second had fourteen of the guns. Displacement differed by just 200 tons, at for the 12-gun variant and for the other one. White preferred the 14-gun version, though the consensus of the Board was that twelve guns were sufficient, on the basis that the two additional guns would overcrowd the upper deck, where they would have been placed, and would have increased the size of the crew too much. Additionally, a secondary battery of twelve guns was deemed to be sufficient in comparison to most other foreign battleships. And while an increase in offensive power would have been welcome, members of the Board decided that the weight savings gained by omitting the two guns could be used to strengthen the ships&#x27; armour, which they preferred at a time where naval guns were becoming increasingly powerful.

The board adopted the 12-gun version, along with a request to increase the belt to . The thicker armour increased displacement to . The board requested that White prepare drawings for this new design on 19 June. A model was created by 17 August, which allowed the design staff to refine the hull shape. The staff cut away the deadwood forward and aft, which made the vessels more handy.

Due to their similarity, some like historian Tony Gibbons consider the five s to be part of the &quot;Formidable&quot; class, though most historians view them as a distinct class. The five &quot;London&quot;-class ships differed from the &quot;Formidable&quot;s in their protection layout, which abandoned the forward armoured bulkhead in favour of an armoured belt that extended all the way to the stem. Regardless, the &quot;Formidable&quot; design provided the basis for the five &quot;London&quot;s that were ordered under the 1898 programme. The only extant British built pre-dreadnought remaining, the Japanese battleship was also built to a slightly modified design, the chief difference being the addition of another pair of 6-inch guns.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Formidable&quot; class were long between perpendiculars, long at the waterline, and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of normally and fully loaded. The three ships displaced between normally and up to fully loaded. Freeboard was forward, amidships, and aft.

They had two pole masts fitted with fighting tops; each top carried a searchlight, and four additional searchlights were mounted on the forward and aft bridges. Their crew size varied over the course of their careers; &quot;Irresistible&quot; had a crew of 788 officers and ratings in 1901, and in 1910, &quot;Formidable&quot; had a crew of 711. After having been withdrawn from active service in 1917, &quot;Implacable&quot; had a crew of just 361. The ships carried a number of small boats that varied over the course of their careers, including a variety of steam and sail pinnaces, sail launches, cutters, galleys, whalers, three gigs, dinghies, and rafts.

The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two inward-turning screws, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms and were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The boilers proved to be troublesome in service, with all three members of the class experiencing problems with them, particularly as the ships aged, between 1909 and 1914. The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships were rated for a top speed of from . The ships&#x27; normally carried of coal for the boilers, but had a total capacity of , which provided a cruising range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
&quot;Formidable&quot; and her sisters had four 40-calibre Mk IX guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. Shell allowance was 80 rounds per gun. The &quot;Formidable&quot; class were the first to carry these guns, which featured several improvements over the earlier Mk VIII guns used in older battleships, including a stronger barrel design and higher muzzle velocity. &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;Implacable&quot; had BVI type mountings for their guns, while &quot;Irresistible&quot; received newer BVII mounts, the primary difference between the two types being the arrangement of the shell hoists and other equipment. Both types of mountings had a range of elevation from -5 degrees to of 13.5 degrees. The BVI mounts required the guns to return to 4.5 degrees to be loaded, while the BVII mounts allowed for loading at any angle. The guns had a muzzle velocity of , and they were capable of penetrating 12 inches of Krupp armour at a range of . At their maximum elevation, the guns had a range of . The guns had a rate of fire of one shot every eighty seconds.

The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, which were supplied with 200 rounds per gun. The guns had a muzzle velocity of . These guns could penetrate 6 inches of Krupp armour at . Maximum elevation was 14 degrees, which allowed the guns to engage targets out to . For close-range defence against torpedo boats, they carried ten 12-pounder guns with 300 rounds per gun and six 3-pounder guns with 500 shells per gun. As was customary for battleships of the period, they were also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull.

The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships made more extensive use of Krupp steel than the preceding &quot;Canopus&quot; class, with most of their side armour consisting of the stronger steel. They had an armoured belt that was thick and extended from the forward main battery barbette to the aft barbette; the transverse bulkheads on either end of the belt were 9 in thick forward and thick aft. The belt extended from main deck level ( above the waterline) to below the waterline. The ships&#x27; side plating forward of the belt was thick, while it was only aft of the belt. The ships were fitted with two armoured decks; the first was a flat deck that was thick, above the main deck, which was 2 in on the flat portion and increased slightly to 3 in on the sloped sides, where it connected to the belt armour.

The ships&#x27; main battery turrets sides and faces were thick—reduced slightly compared to earlier ships to account for the heavier belt armour—with thick rears. The turret roofs were 3 in thick. The turrets sat atop 12 in thick barbettes, though &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s barbette armour was reduced in thickness to 10 in behind the belt. Above the main belt was a strake of armour that protected the casemate guns, which was 6 inches thick; behind the casemates, an interior bulkhead that was thick protected the interior of the ship. Their forward conning tower had thick sides, with a communication tube below the tower that had armour protection that was thick. The aft conning tower had 3 in thick sides with a 3 in tube below.

==Ships in class==
==Service history==
The ships of the &quot;Formidable&quot; class had uneventful peacetime careers. All three ships of the class served with the Mediterranean Fleet as their first station; in 1908, &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;Irresistible&quot; were recalled to the Channel Fleet, though the former remained there for just a year, transferring to the Home Fleet and then shortly thereafter to the Atlantic Fleet in 1909. That year, &quot;Implacable&quot; joined her sister ship in the Atlantic Fleet. Between 1911 and 1912, all three ships were assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron of the Home fleet, where they remained for the rest of their peacetime careers. Throughout their peacetime careers, the ships were repeatedly overhauled and had minor modifications carried out, including alterations to their light armament, addition of searchlights, and installation of improved fire-control and wireless systems.

All three ships were mobilized as part of the 5th Battle Squadron at Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War in August 1914. They were initially based in the English Channel, and they helped to escort the British Expeditionary Force and later the Portsmouth Marine Battalion across the Channel in August. In October &quot;Implacable&quot; was temporarily detached to guard against a rumoured German cruiser attack. Shortly after midnight on 1 January 1915, &quot;Formidable&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat off Portland Bill while on patrol in the Channel. Most of the ship&#x27;s crew—35 officers and 512 men—were killed in the sinking. The following month, &quot;Irresistible&quot; was sent to the eastern Mediterranean Sea to join the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. She took part in repeated, failed attacks on the Ottoman defences guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles over the course of February and March. During a major Anglo-French attack on the coastal fortifications on 18 March, &quot;Irresistible&quot; struck a naval mine and sank, though most of her crew was evacuated; around 150 men were killed in her final battle.

&quot;Implacable&quot; was ordered to join the Dardanelles campaign in March 1915, and she arrived shortly after the loss of &quot;Irresistible&quot;. She supported the landings at Cape Helles and at Anzac Cove, the beginning of the land portion of the Gallipoli Campaign. On the day of the attack, 25 April, the ship steamed off X Beach at Cape Helles, bombarding Ottoman defences as men went ashore. In recognition of the critical support she had provided the troops as they attacked Ottoman positions, they named the landing site &quot;Implacable Beach&quot;. She continued to support the ground forces into May, including during the First and Second Battles of Krithia. In May, she was reassigned to the 2nd Detached Squadron, which was tasked with supporting the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) in the Adriatic Sea, where it contained the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In November, she was again transferred, this time to the 3rd Detached Squadron, based in Salonika, Greece. The ship was recalled to Britain in July 1917, later being converted into a depot ship for the Northern Patrol. &quot;Implacable&quot; was ultimately sold for scrap in 1921 and was broken up the following year in Germany.
