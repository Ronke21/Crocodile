<text>Jastrowie () is a town in northwestern Poland in Złotów County, Greater Poland Voivodeship. It has 8,900 inhabitants (1998) and lies on the edge of the Gwda River valley. The town is located on the Osoka stream.

==History==

Jastrowie was one of the southernmost centres of the Pomeranians. The territory became a part of the emerging Polish state under its first historical ruler, Mieszko I, in the 10th century. At the beginning of the 14th century, it belonged to the Ujście castellany. Jastrowie was a royal village of the Kingdom of Poland, administratively located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. On May 5, 1602, Jastrowie received the town rights granted by Piotr Potulicki and confirmed by King Sigismund III Vasa.

Protestantism was introduced in 1587 when the Catholic pastor converted, and in 1600, the old church was demolished and replaced by a new building. However, the Protestants could only keep the former Catholic parish church until 1619 because that year, the preacher Martin Goldbach converted to Catholicism, after which the church was returned to the Catholics.

In the 17th century, the town developed quickly. New settlers arrived, including Germans from Pomerania, Scots and Jews.

The religious struggle in Jastrowie reached its climax in 1768 when soldiers belonging to the Polish nobleman Roskowski killed the Lutheran preacher Willich.

After the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by Prussia. For the time being, the Lutherans went to the church services in the neighboring Pomeranian villages of Zamborst and Flederborn, but later - after 1773 - got their church with the support of the Prussian government. One of the main escape routes for surviving insurgents of the Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the town.

In the 19th century, Jastrowie, then officially called &quot;Jastrow&quot; in German, became one of the most important centres of horse trade. During World War II, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs in the town. The Polish resistance conducted espionage on German activity in the town. During the war, the town was an important point of the Pomeranian Wall, one of the most important German lines of fortification in the East. Polish troops eventually captured the town on 2 February 1945 and then restored to Poland.

Currently, Jastrowie is the site of several wood and bicycle factories. It was part of the Piła Voivodeship from 1975 until 1998 when the Greater Poland Voivodeship superseded the administrative region. Jastrowie&#x27;s most important cultural event is its International Folk Festival, &quot;Bukowińskie Spotkania&quot;.

<text>The national flag of Tanzania () consists of a gold-edged black bend, divided diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with a green upper triangle and light blue lower triangle. Adopted in 1964 to replace the individual flags of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, it has been the flag of the United Republic of Tanzania since the two states merged that year. The design of the present flag incorporates the elements from the two former flags. It is one of a relatively small number of national flags incorporating a diagonal line (heraldic bend, bend sinister), with other examples including the DR Congo, Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago and Brunei.

==History==
The United Kingdom – together with its dominion South Africa and fellow Allied power Belgium – occupied the majority of German East Africa in 1916 during the East African Campaign. Three years later, the British were tasked with administering the Tanganyika Territory as a League of Nations mandate. It was turned into a UN Trust Territory after World War II, when the LN dissolved in 1946 and the United Nations was formed. In 1954, the Tanganyika African Association – which spoke out against British colonial rule – became the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) under the leadership of Julius Nyerere and Oscar Kambona. The aim of the political party was to attain independence for the territory; its flag was a tricolour consisting of three horizontal green, black and yellow bands. Shortly before independence in 1961, elections were held in Tanganyika. After the TANU won comprehensively, the British colonial leaders advised them to utilise the design of their party&#x27;s flag as inspiration for a new national flag. As a result, yellow stripes were added, and Tanganyika became independent on 9 December 1961.

The Sultanate of Zanzibar – which was a British protectorate until 1963 – used a red flag during its reign over the island. The last sultan was overthrown in the Zanzibar Revolution on 12 January 1964, and the Afro-Shirazi Party – the ruling political party of the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of Zanzibar – adopted a national flag the next month that was inspired by its own party flag. This consisted of a tricolour with three horizontal blue, black and green bands.

In April 1964, both Tanganyika and Zanzibar united in order to form a single country – the United Republic of Tanzania. Consequently, the flag designs of the two states were amalgamated to establish a new national flag. The green and black colours from the flag of Tanganyika were retained along with the blue from Zanzibar&#x27;s flag, with a diagonal design used &quot;for distinctiveness&quot;. This combined design was adopted on 30 June 1964. It was featured on the first set of stamps issued by the newly unified country.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colors and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green alludes to the natural vegetation and &quot;rich agricultural resources&quot; of the country, while black represents the Swahili people who are native to Tanzania. The blue epitomizes the Indian Ocean, as well as the nation&#x27;s numerous lakes and rivers. The thin stripes stand for Tanzania&#x27;s mineral wealth, derived from the &quot;rich deposits&quot; in the land. While Whitney Smith in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and Dorling Kindersley&#x27;s &quot;Complete Flags of the World&quot; describe the fimbriations as yellow, other sources – such as &quot;The World Factbook&quot; and Simon Clarke in the journal &quot;Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa&quot; – contend that it is actually gold.

<text>The national flag of Togo consists of five horizontal stripes, alternating between green and yellow, with a red square bearing a five-pointed white star in the canton. It is one of many African flags that use the pan-African colours of green, yellow, and red. Togolese artist Paul Ahyi designed the flag in 1960, just before its adoption on 27 April of that year, coinciding with Togo&#x27;s proclamation of independence. When Togo was an autonomous republic within the French Union (the successor to the French colonial empire), it flew a green flag with the French tricolour in the canton and two five-pointed yellow stars, one in the lower hoist and one in the upper fly.

== Design ==
Togolese artist Paul Ahyi (1930–2010) was the designer of the flag. Ahyi studied art in France and graduated from the École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in Paris in 1959 before returning to Togo. The following year, he designed the flag of Togo, which was adopted upon the country&#x27;s proclamation of independence on 27 April 1960.

The design of the flag is outlined in Title I, Article 3 of the Constitution of Togo, 1992 (2019 revision). It states:

The proportions of the flag are not mentioned in the constitution and sources differ as to the exact ratio. American vexillologist Whitney Smith, writing in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, stated that the width-to-length ratio is approximately 3:5. Polish vexillologist Alfred Znamierowski meanwhile stated that the ratio is 2:3. It has also been claimed that Ahyi followed the golden ratio (represented by the Greek letter phi, 𝜑) when designing the flag, which would make it a golden rectangle. In other words, its width-to-length ratio would be 1:𝜑, where .

=== Symbolism ===
The flag uses the pan-African colours of green, yellow, and red, which were adopted by several other African countries upon independence. Its five stripes represent the five regions of Togo. The office of the Togolese president gives the following significance to the flag&#x27;s colours and symbols: green represents forests, agriculture, and hope; yellow represents natural resources, faith, and maturity; red represents the blood shed by those who fought for Togolese independence; and the white star represents peace, intelligence, and light.

== Historical flags ==
During the colonial era, Togo flew the flag of its colonial ruler: Germany from 1884 to 1914 (as part of German Togoland) and France from 1916 to 1960. The United Nations trusteeship system established after World War II obliged France to move Togo (then French Togoland) towards self-government. Togo was made an autonomous republic within the French Union on 24 August 1956, and a new flag was adopted along with a motto, an anthem, and a national day. The flag was a green field with the French tricolour in the canton and two five-pointed yellow stars, one in the lower hoist and one in the upper fly. The green field represented agriculture, hope, and youth, while the two stars represented Togo&#x27;s northern savannas and southern coastal plains.

== Coat of arms ==
The flag of Togo is featured on the country&#x27;s coat of arms. Its inclusion is described in the Togolese constitution:

<doc id="459336" wikidata="Q188072" url="?curid=459336" title="Flag of Tonga">
<text>The national flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton charged with a red couped cross. Adopted in 1875 after being officially enshrined into the nation&#x27;s constitution, it has been the flag of the Kingdom of Tonga since that year. The constitution stipulates that the national flag can never be changed.

==History==
The British first arrived in Tonga in the late-18th century, when Captain James Cook made three visits to the islands between 1773 and 1777. Approximately fifty years later, English Wesleyan Methodist missionaries came to Tonga and began converting its people to Christianity. In 1831, they succeeded in converting &quot;paramount chief&quot; Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou, who became King George Tupou I in 1845. It was during this time (circa 1840s) that the first Tongan flag was adopted. It consisted of a white field with a cross (either red or blue in colour) at all four corners, and the letters &quot;A&quot; (in red) and &quot;M&quot; (in blue) at the centre that symbolise the king.

Upon his accession to the throne, the king sought to design a new flag for the nation, one that would represent Christianity. He befriended Shirley Waldemar Baker – a member of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Tongan mission who later became the Prime Minister of Tonga – and they worked together to formulate a new flag, coat of arms and national anthem for Tonga. According to Whitney Smith (Flags and Arms across the World, Maidenhead 1980) the chief designer was Prince Uelingatoni Ngu Tupoumalohi. The new design resembled the British Red Ensign, in that three-quarters of it consisted of a simple red field, with a &quot;distinctive canton&quot; featured in the upper hoist section; this was first used in 1866. A new constitution for the kingdom was formulated and proclaimed on 4 November 1875. It codified the new flag design, and marks when it was adopted as the national flag. Under Article 47 of the Constitution, the flag can &quot;never be altered&quot; and &quot;shall always be the flag&quot; of Tonga.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The red couped cross alludes to Christianity, the religion practised by approximately 97% of the country&#x27;s population. It is one of 28 national flags to contain overtly Christian symbols. The white epitomizes purity, while the red evokes the sacrifice of the Blood of Christ, which was shed during the Crucifixion.

===Similarities===
The previous design of the flag featured a plain white field charged with the red couped cross. However, it was later discovered that this flag was almost identical to the emblem of the International Red Cross, which had been adopted in 1863. As a result of this finding, the Tongan flag was set at the canton of a red field instead, leading to the present design of the flag. The previous design, nonetheless, remains a national symbol of Tonga. The current flag of Tonga also has some similarities with the flags of Switzerland and Georgia.

<text>The flag of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] was adopted upon independence from the United Kingdom on 31 August 1962. Designed by Carlisle Chang (1921–2001), the flag of Trinidad and Tobago was chosen by the independence committee of 1962. Red, black and white symbolise fire (the sun, representing courage), earth (representing dedication) and water (representing purity and equality).

It is one of the few national flags incorporating a diagonal line (&quot;heraldic bend&quot;), with other examples including the DR Congo, Tanzania, Namibia, and Brunei. It is one of two national flags with two-fold rotational symmetry, symmetry group C2, the other being the Union Jack.

==Design==

The flag of Trinidad and Tobago is a red field with a white-edged black diagonal band from the upper hoist side to the lower fly-side. In blazon, &quot;Gules, a bend Sable fimbriated Argent&quot;. It was designed by Carlisle Chang.

==Construction==

The width of the white stripes is of the flag length and the width of the black stripe is . The total width of the three stripes together is, therefore, of the length.
==Other flags==
The civil ensign is the national flag in a 1:2 ratio. The naval ensign (used by Coast Guard vessels) is a British white ensign with the national flag in the canton.

===British colonial flag===
Prior to independence from the United Kingdom in August 1962, Trinidad and Tobago used a British blue ensign defaced with a badge depicting a ship arriving in front of a mountain.

<text>The national flag of Turkmenistan () features a white crescent and five stars representing the five regions of the country and the Five Pillars of Islam. Placed upon a green field is a symbolic representation of the country&#x27;s famous carpet industry. It was introduced as the flag of Turkmenistan on 27 September 1992 to replace the Soviet-era flag which consisted of a red background with two light blue bars in the middle. The modified version with a 2:3 ratio was adopted on 23 January 2001. State Flag and Constitution Day is celebrated on 18 May.

==Design==

===Description===
It features a green field with a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs) stacked above two crossed olive branches similar to those on the flag of the United Nations; a white waxing crescent moon, typical of Turkic and Islamic symbology, and five white five-pointed stars appear in the upper corner of the field just to the fly side of the red stripe.

===Colors===
===Symbolism===
While no official explanation has been given for the symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colors or white symbols, there are several leading theories. Some such as the Russian Centre of Vexillology and Heraldry claim that the green field stands for life, land, grass, prosperity, and peace, while the crescent moon symbolizes the clear sky above Turkmenistan&#x27;s people. They claim the stars represent the five provinces (&quot;welaýatlar&quot;) of Turkmenistan: Ahal, Balkan, Daşoguz, Lebap and Mary. Soon after the flag was adopted, multiple newspapers gave their own explanations of the flag&#x27;s symbolism, claiming that the color green was chosen to resemble banners historically used by the Turkmen people, and the color white was chosen to represent the brightness of life. They also reported that the five points on the stars represented the five states of matter, solid, liquid, gas, plasma, and crystal, while the number of stars represented the five main preconditions of life, light, sound, taste, smell, and feeling. The newspapers stated that stars and crescent moon together symbolized the belief in a bright future.

The five traditional carpet guls represent the five major tribes of Turkmenistan, and form motifs in the country&#x27;s state emblem and flag. The Turkmen tribes in traditional order (as well as top to bottom) are the Teke, Yomut, Saryk, Chowdur, and Ersari. The middle design may also represent the Salur, a tribe that declined as a result of military defeat before the modern period.

==History==
===Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic===

On October 6, 1926, the Constitution of the Turkmen SSR was adopted, instating the first flag of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. The flag was a red field, with a gold-bordered red star and golden hammer and sickle in its canton. On March 2, 1937, a new constitution was adopted, changing the flag to a red banner with the gold letters &quot;T.S.S.R.&quot; in its canton. On July 19, 1940, the Latin letters in the canton were changed to Cyrillic letters, to match the Republic&#x27;s new alphabet. The letters in the canton were now &quot;T.C.C.P.&quot;. On August 1, 1953, a decree from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR changed the flag to a red field with two horizontal blue bars in its middle, and a golden hammer and sickle and gold-bordered red star in its canton. The state constitution was amended to address this change. On September 23, 1974, the Presidium again modified the flag, moving the star and hammer and sickle to border the hoist. No modifications would be made to the flag&#x27;s design until Turkmenistan gained independence.

===Modern flag===
After independence in 1991, the government of Turkmenistan decided to change its national symbols, including the flag. In early February 1992 an exhibition was held at the hall of the Union of Artists in Ashgabat, which displayed proposed flags and coats of arms from across the country. That same month, members of the 13th meeting of the Supreme Soviet were tasked with choosing a flag from the proposed designs. On February 19, 1992, the new flag was signed into law. On March 21, 1992, the Turkmen New Year, president Saparmurat Niyazov raised the flag for the first time. 

On January 29, 1997, amendments were made to the Law of Turkmenistan On the State Flag of Turkmenistan. The image of the UN emblem— olive branch was added to the national flag following the United Nations&#x27; proclamation of Turkmenistan&#x27;s permanent neutrality on December 12, 1995. This was done to commemorate the principles of neutrality in the national symbols of Turkmenistan. The positioning of the crescent and stars was also changed, with the crescent positioned roughly to its current position but with the stars in a much more uneven position. 

In 24 January 2001, the flag&#x27;s proportion was changed from 1:2 to 2:3 and the green field was made lighter.

In 2008, a giant flagpole standing 133 meters tall was installed in front of the The State Museum of the State Cultural Center of Turkmenistan in Ashgabat. The flag flying on this pole measures 52.5 by 35 meters and weighs 420 kg. This flagpole was entered into the Guinness World Records. An honorary guard is stationed at its base.

<text>James Robert Laxer (22 December 1941 – 23 February 2018), also known as Jim Laxer, was a Canadian political economist, historian, public intellectual, and political activist who served as a professor at York University. Best known as co-founder of the Waffle, on whose behalf he ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 1971, he was the author of more than two dozen books, mostly on Canadian political economy and history.

==Early life and family==
Laxer was born in Montreal, Quebec, on 22 December 1941 and was the son of Edna May Quentin and Robert Laxer, a psychologist, professor, author, and political activist. His father was Jewish and his mother was from a Protestant family. Her father, Reverend A.P. Quentin, a missionary to China for 30 years, had changed the family name from Quirmbach around the time of World War I.

Both of Laxer&#x27;s parents were members of the Communist Party of Canada and its public face, the Labor-Progressive Party, with Robert Laxer being a national organizer for the party. The Laxers left the party, along with many other members, following Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech revealing Joseph Stalin&#x27;s crimes, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. James Laxer wrote about his experiences growing up during this period in his memoir &quot;Red Diaper Baby: A Boyhood in the Age of McCarthyism&quot;. His father came to serve as a significant influence on his political worldview.

His paternal grandfather was a rabbi and his maternal grandfather was a minister and Christian missionary to China, where Laxer&#x27;s mother was born. His brother, Gordon Laxer, became a political economist, author, and founder of the Parkland Institute.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto and Master of Arts (following approval of his thesis &quot;French-Canadian Newspapers and Imperial Defence, 1899–1914&quot; in 1967) and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Queen&#x27;s University. He was an active student journalist both at &quot;The Varsity&quot; at the University of Toronto and later at the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Journal&quot; and was elected president of Canadian University Press in 1965.

Laxer married three times. He married Diane Taylor in 1965, from whom he was divorced in 1969. He married Krista Maeots in 1969. They had two children: Michael and Katherine (known as &quot;Kate&quot;). She was a producer at CBC Radio for This Country in the Morning with Peter Gzowski, and then created and was executive producer of CBC Radio&#x27;s Morningside program with Don Harron. She committed suicide by drowning at Niagara Falls in 1978. Laxer and Maeots were separated at the time of her death in 1978. Laxer married Sandra Price in 1979. They had two children: Emily and Jonathan.

==Political career==
In 1969, Laxer, along with his father Robert Laxer, Mel Watkins, and others, founded the Waffle, a left-wing group influenced by the New Left, the anti–Vietnam War movement, and Canadian economic nationalism, that tried to influence the direction of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Laxer was a principal author of their Manifesto for an Independent Socialist Canada in 1969 alongside Ed Broadbent and Gerald Caplan. The manifesto was debated at the 1969 federal NDP convention and was rejected by the delegates in favour of a more moderate declaration.

In 1971, Laxer ran for the leadership of the federal NDP and shocked the convention by winning one-third of the vote on the fourth and final ballot against party stalwart David Lewis. The Waffle was ultimately forced out of the NDP and briefly became a political party under the name Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada. Laxer and other Wafflers unsuccessfully ran for Parliament in 1974. This electoral failure led to the Waffle&#x27;s demise, and Laxer concentrated on his work at York University, where he was a professor of political science for 47 years, and in broadcasting.

In 1981, he was hired as director of research for the federal NDP, but left in controversy in 1983 when he published a report critiquing the party&#x27;s economic policy as being &quot;out of date&quot;.

==Academic, writer, and broadcaster==
Laxer hosted &quot;The Real Story&quot;, a nightly half-hour current affairs program on TVOntario in the early 1980s. He also variously wrote a column and op-ed pieces for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; from the 1980s until shortly before his death, as well as op-ed pieces for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He also played &quot;Talleyrand&quot;, a mock political insider, on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morningside&quot; in the 1980s.

Laxer co-wrote and presented the five-part National Film Board documentary series &quot;Reckoning: The Political Economy of Canada&quot; in 1986, which examined Canada&#x27;s economic and political relationships with the United States and Canada&#x27;s place in the changing global economy. Laxer and his co-writer won a Gemini Award in 1988 for Best Writing in an Information/Documentary Program or Series for episode one of &quot;Reckoning&quot; titled &quot;In Bed with an Elephant&quot;. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation refused to air the series due to its critical view of free trade with the United States, which was being negotiated at the time, and it aired instead on TVOntario and other educational channels in Canada as well as a number of PBS stations in the United States.

A democratic socialist, Laxer believed that Canadian economic nationalism was a progressive force against the United States and American imperialism. He wrote extensively about the influence of American multinational corporations in the Canadian economy, particularly in the oil and gas industry, and his agitation helped lead to the creation of Petro-Canada. The creation of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the Canadian Development Corporation in the 1970s is also attributed in part to the work of Laxer, Watkins, and the Waffle. In the 1980s he strongly opposed the adoption of the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement, though he still believed that free trade agreements were capable of being used to the advantage of the political left through the entrenchment of social charters.

Laxer died suddenly and unexpectedly in Paris of heart-related problems on 23 February 2018 while in Europe researching a book on Canada&#x27;s role in the Second World War.

<doc id="459347" wikidata="Q103037" url="?curid=459347" title="Flag of Uganda">
<text>The national flag of Uganda () was adopted on 9 October 1962, the day that the nation became independent from the British Empire. It consists of six equal horizontal bands of black, yellow, and red from top to bottom. A white disc is superimposed at the centre and depicts the national symbol, a grey crowned crane, facing the hoist&#x27;s side.

During the colonial era, the British used a Blue Ensign that was defaced with the colonial badge, as prescribed in 1865 regulations. Buganda, the largest of the traditional kingdoms in the colony of Uganda, had its own flag. However, in order to avoid appearing to give preference to one region of the colony over any other, the British colonial authorities selected the crane emblem for use on the Blue Ensign and other official banners.

==History==
When the Democratic Party ruled the country, it proposed a flag design with vertical stripes of green-blue-green, separated by narrower yellow stripes, and in the centre the silhouette of a yellow crane. After the party lost the national elections on 25 April 1962, the newly elected Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) rejected the former design and instead proposed the current design. It was based on the UPC flag, a tricolour having horizontal strips of red, yellow and black. The British administration gave its approval to the new flag before the country&#x27;s independence. The flag was designed by C. Todd, Professor of Fine Art at Makerere University. He also designed the Uganda Coat of Arms and various ceremonial items, which he registered with the College of Arms, in London.

==Features on the Uganda flag==
The three colours are representative of native ethnic groups of Africa (black), Africa&#x27;s sunshine (yellow), and African brotherhood (red being the colour of blood, through which all Africans are connected). The grey crowned crane is fabled for its gentle nature and was also the military badge of Ugandan soldiers during British rule. The raised leg of the crane symbolises the forward movement of the country.

<doc id="459350" wikidata="Q127974" url="?curid=459350" title="Flag of Ukraine">
<text>The national flag of Ukraine (, ) consists of equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow.

The blue and yellow bicolor flag was first seen during the 1848 Spring of Nations in Lemberg (Lviv), the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria within the Austrian Empire. It was later adopted as a state flag by the short-lived Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, and the Ukrainian State following the Russian Revolution. 

In March 1939, it was also adopted by Carpatho-Ukraine. However, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, the use of the bicolor flag was banned, and it was replaced by the flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. This flag featured a red background, with an azure bottom and a golden hammer and sickle, along with a golden-bordered red star on top. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the bicolor flag gradually returned to use before being officially adopted again on 28 January 1992 by the Ukrainian parliament.

Ukraine has celebrated the Day of the National Flag on 23 August since 2004.

==Design==
Ukrainian law states that the colours of Ukrainian flag are &quot;blue and yellow&quot;, but other state bodies have determined the colours. In the table below, the colours are presented according to DSTU 4512:2006 technical specifications: (The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine made this standard mandatory for military funeral flags in 2021.)

There has been disagreement over the shade of blue used in the flag. Both dark blue () and sky blue () flags were historically used. When the flag was approved in 1992, the dark blue colour was chosen over sky blue for practical reasons: sky blue flags fade very quickly in the sun. Although the official standard was introduced in 2006, some manufacturers keep producing flags that do not match the standard.


The flag is similar to that of the Austrian state of Lower Austria, the German city of Chemnitz, historical Kingdom of Dalmatia (now Croatia) and the Hungarian city of Pécs, but all of those flags have a darker shade of blue. The flag is also somewhat similar to that of the Malaysian state of Perlis and the English county of Durham (without the cross), but has a reversed colour arrangement, lighter shades of blue and yellow, and a different aspect ratio.

==Protocol and use==
Article 20 of the Constitution of Ukraine states that &quot;the State Flag of Ukraine is a banner of two equally sized horizontal bands of blue and yellow colour.&quot; ().
In addition to the normal horizontal format, many public buildings, such as the Verkhovna Rada, use vertical flags. Most town halls fly their town flag together with the national flag in this way; some town flags in Ukraine exist only in vertical form. The proportions of these vertical flags are not specified. When hung like a banner or draped, the blue band should be on the left. When flown from a vertical flagpole, the blue band must face the mast.

The flag did not appear on Ukrainian postal stamp issues until 1992, when they depicted the flag with the state coat of arms. Since then, the flag has frequently appeared on stamps. Cinderella stamps of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists were printed outside Ukraine during the Soviet period for patriotic purposes.

===Decoration===
Traditionally, the flag may be decorated with a golden fringe surrounding the perimeter of the flag, as long as it does not deface the flag proper. The tradition began with the flag of the Ukrainian SSR. In addition, the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; shows a flag decorated with a gold star. Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in parades or on indoor posts, often use a fringe to enhance the allure of the flag. No specific law governs the use of the fringe. Traditionally, the Army, Guard, Navy and Air Force use a fringed flag for parades, colour guards and indoor displays, while the Office of the President and local authorities use a fringed flag on all occasions.

===Places of continuous display===
Ukrainian flags are customarily displayed continuously in certain locations.
* Maidan Nezalezhnosti, main square of Kyiv, traditional site for political rallies, including large-scale radical protest campaigns (Orange Revolution and Euromaidan)
* Presidential Administration Building, Verkhovna Rada building and Government Building
* Kyiv City Council
* Lviv High Castle
* Vernadsky Research Base
* State Border Guard Service of Ukraine sites
* National, regional and local government buildings
* Ukrainian embassies and consulates

===Particular days for display===
The flag is hoisted up to its full staff on the following days:
* 1 January: New Year&#x27;s Day
* 7 January: Christmas (Julian)
* 22 January: Ukrainian Unity and Freedom Day
* 8 March: International Women&#x27;s Day
* 1 &amp; 2 May: International Workers&#x27; Day
* 8 May: Day of Remembrance and Victory over Nazism
* 28 June: Constitution Day
* 23 August: Flag Day
* 24 August: Independence Day
* 13 October: Defenders of Ukraine Day
* 21 November: Day of Dignity and Freedom
* 6 December: Armed Forces Day
* 25 December: Christmas (Gregorian/Neo-Julian)

===Display at half-staff===
The flag is displayed at half-staff (or half-mast) as a sign of respect or mourning. When done nationwide, such a step is proclaimed by the president. Half-mast means flying a flag two-thirds of the way up a flagpole; the top of the flag must be at least a flag&#x27;s height from the top of the flagpole. Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that can not be lowered to half-mast.
* 4th Saturday of November: Holodomor Memorial Day
* Other historical cases: mass victims of accidents, Russo-Ukrainian War and Euromaidan; death and state funeral of Lech and Maria Kaczyński, funeral of Pope John Paul II and September 11 attacks.

==Flag Day==

The Day of the National Flag in Ukraine is celebrated on 23 August; it began in 2004. Previously, 24 July was National Flag Day in Kyiv. The first ceremonial raising of the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag in modern times took place on 24 July 1990, at the flagstaff of the Kyiv City Council, two years before the flag was officially adopted as the National flag. Since 1992, the Independence Day of Ukraine has been celebrated on 24 August. Following a government decree, the flag must be flown from public buildings on this date and certain other holidays; not all are public holidays. Flags must also be flown on parliamentary election days and regional-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags are flown at half-mast), can be declared at the discretion of the Cabinet of Ministers. When flags are flown at half-mast, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the mast if hung from a pole, or to each end of the flag&#x27;s supporting cross-beams if flown like a banner.
==History==


The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from pre-Christian times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies, reflecting fire and water. The most solid proof of yellow and blue colours can be traced back as far as the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, in which militia formations from the Ruthenian Voivodeship participated.

Blue-yellow, red-black, crimson-olive and especially raspberry colour banners were widely used by Ukrainian Cossacks between the 16th and 18th centuries. These were not the only possible combinations, since normally Cossacks would fly their hetman&#x27;s banners, which were similar to the coats of arms of the nobility. Also, yellow and blue were the colours common on coats of arms in Galicia. In fact, the coat of arms of Lviv to this day remains a golden lion on a blue field.

Some put the starting point of the adoption of the current national flag of Ukraine to 1848 when, during the Spring of Nations on 22 April 1848, a blue-and-yellow banner was adopted by the Supreme Ruthenian Council in Lemberg (Lviv), the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (a crownland of the Austrian Empire). On 25 June 1848 two blue and yellow banners flew over the city&#x27;s magistrate (Rathaus) for the first time. It is unknown who hang the banners and the Austrian authorities dissociated themselves from this action, as did the Supreme Ruthenian Council itself. The banners hung for almost a week. At the request of the Supreme Ruthenian Council, on 15 May 1849 a yellow-and-blue flag hang again on the Rathaus, this time for one day. Although this move did not have significant consequences, the newly formed Ukrainian divisions in the Imperial-Royal Landwehr of the Austro-Hungarian Army used blue-and-yellow banners in their insignia.

During the Russian Revolution of 1905, this flag was used by Ukrainians of the Dnieper Ukraine.

===Early independence: 1917–1921===

Both blue-yellow and yellow-blue flags were widely used during the Ukrainian struggle for independence in 1917. For the first time in the history of the Russian Empire, the blue-yellow flag was flown on 25 March 1917 in Petrograd during a 20,000-strong mass demonstration. On the territory of Ukraine the national flag was flown for the first time in Kyiv on 29 March 1917 by soldiers. On 1 April 1917, Kyiv saw a 100,000-strong demonstration where over 320 national flags were flown. Afterwards, similar demonstrations with Ukrainian flags took place across the entire Russian Empire, even beyond ethnic Ukrainian lands. Numerous famous Ukrainian politicians wrote about the 1 April demonstration, including Mykhailo Hrushevsky and Serhiy Yefremov, noting that there were blue-and-yellow flags, while Dmytro Doroshenko claimed that they were yellow and blue. The blue-yellow flag was flown at the First Ukrainian Military Congress on 18 May 1917.

The official flag established by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in 1918 was blue-yellow. Instead, they refer to the decision on the Fleet Flag, which was to be light blue–yellow, as an indication that the official flag was light blue–yellow. Also adopted were several other service flags of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

The official flag of Pavlo Skoropadsky&#x27;s Hetmanate was also light blue-yellow and remained the same under the Directorate of Symon Petlura. The flag of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was blue-yellow. The stateless Makhnovshchina, which existed during the Ukrainian War of Independence, used the black flag.

Among Ukrainian immigrant organisations, there were proponents of both blue-yellow and yellow-blue flags. Eventually, an agreement was reached to use the blue-yellow flag until the issue could be resolved by an independent Ukraine.

===Soviet Ukraine: 1922–1991===
During Soviet rule, the Ukrainian flag was banned, and anyone displaying it could be criminally prosecuted for &quot;anti-Soviet propaganda&quot;. The first flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 10 March 1919, to serve as the symbol of state of Soviet Ukraine. Details of the official flag changed periodically before the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but all were based on the red flag of the October Revolution in Russia and an exact replica of the flags of the neighbouring Russian SFSR.
The first flag was red with the gold Cyrillic sans-serif letters (U.S.S.R., acronym for in the Russian language). In the 1930s, a gold border was added to the flag. In 1937, a new flag was adopted, with a small gold hammer and sickle added above the gold Cyrillic serif (U.R.S.R., for in the Ukrainian language).

===Interbellum and Reichskommissariat Ukraine===
The Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists is a Ukrainian political organisation which as a movement was originally created in 1929 in Western Ukraine (interwar Poland at the time). For a long time, the OUN did not officially have its own flag; however, during the Hungarian and Polish aggression against the Republic of Carpathian Ukraine in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarised wing of the OUN, adopted as its flag a design taken from the OUN&#x27;s emblem – a golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalised and only officially adopted by the organisation in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists.

The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a Ukrainian nationalist paramilitary and later partisan army that engaged in a series of guerrilla conflicts during World War II against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and both underground and communist Poland. The group was the military wing of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists — Bandera faction (the OUN-B), originally formed in Volyn in the spring and summer of 1943. Its official date of creation is 14 October 1942. The battle flag of the UPA was a 2:3 ratio red-and-black banner. The flag continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colours of the flag symbolise &#x27;Ukrainian red blood spilled on Ukrainian black earth&#x27;.

In 1949, the flag of the Soviet Ukraine was changed once again. The Soviet Union managed to obtain two additional seats in the United Nations by adding Ukraine and Byelorussia as member states. The flag change came about because all the Soviet flags were the same. The new Ukrainian flag consisted of red (top, 2/3) and azure (bottom, 1/3) stripes, with the golden star, hammer and sickle in the top left corner. Communist party leaders such as Nikita Khrushchev and Lazar Kaganovich feared using words like &#x27;light blue&#x27; and &#x27;blue&#x27; in the official flag colours, as they were the terms used by the Ukrainian diaspora.

During the Soviet period, multiple unsanctioned attempts to hoist the national blue-and-yellow flag were made. In 1958, an underground group was established in the village of Verbytsia, Khodoriv Raion; its members raised national flags and spread anti-Soviet pamphlets under cover of darkness.

===Return of the national flag===
Under the influence of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of perestroika and glasnost, individual Soviet republics gained a strengthened sense of national identity, leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. This was particularly true for the three Baltic states and Western Ukraine, which were the last territories annexed into Soviet Union. The national awakening was accompanied by attempts to restore historical national symbols. In 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR re-established Lithuania&#x27;s national flag and coat of arms as the state symbol. The parliaments of Latvia and Estonia soon followed suit.

The events in the Baltic countries soon led to similar patterns in Ukraine. In particular, West Ukraine and the Ukrainian SSR&#x27;s capital city of Kyiv were the scenes of near-constant political demonstrations, in which yellow-and-blue flags were waved by demonstrators.
* On 14 March 1990, the Ukrainian flag was raised for the first time since the establishment of the Soviet Union in the small city of Stryi.
* On 20 March 1990, the Ternopil town council voted on the use and re-establishment of the yellow-and-blue flag and the &quot;tryzub&quot; and &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy&quot; national anthem. The same day, the yellow-and-blue national flag was flown for the first time in 80 years on a governmental building in Kyiv, replacing the then-official red-azure flag of the Ukrainian SSR.
* On 28 April 1990, the Lviv oblast council (&quot;oblasna rada&quot;) also allowed the use of the national symbols of Ukraine within the Oblast.
* On 29 April 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown from the Ternopil city theatre&#x27;s flagstaff without the flag of the Soviet Union hanging above it.
* After 24 July 1990, the yellow-and-blue flag was flown for the first time over an official governmental building, the Kyiv City Council, on &quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot; Square of &quot;Khreshchatyk&quot; Street.
* After the declaration of independence of Ukraine on 24 August 1991, the national yellow-and-blue flag flew for the first time over the Ukrainian Parliament (&quot;Verkhovna Rada&quot;) building on 4 September 1991.

As the Soviet red and azure flag remained the &quot;de jure&quot; flag of the newly-independent Ukraine, the blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in August 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before officially being restored on 28 January 1992 by the Parliament of Ukraine. At the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, landmarks all over the world were lit up with the colours of the Ukrainian flag, while numerous cities raised the Ukrainian flag in solidarity. Kastuś Kalinoŭski Regiment, an independent Belarusian volunteer regiment, also adopted the colours of the Ukrainian flag in its insignia.

==Controversies and criticism==
===Origin===
One claimed version is that, since one of the first known coloured depictions of the coat of arms of Kyiv was mainly in yellow-blue colours, this tradition may have existed since the time of the Nordic-Slavic Grand Prince of Kyiv Volodymyr the Great. However, the blue-yellow colouring dates back to Kievan Rus’, as an early version of the &quot;Tryzub&quot;, Ukraine&#x27;s national coat of arms, sported the same colouring as the seal of Sviatoslav I of Kyiv (c. AD 945). During the 1709 Battle of Poltava, the Cossacks following Mazepa fought under yellow-blue banners, while their Swedish allies were under yellow ones. Some Cossacks and noblemen had coats of arms in yellow and blue.

===Yellow-blue versus blue-yellow===
Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as &quot;yellow and light blue&quot; (, )—a different version of the flag used during UNR (Ukrainian National Republic) years (1917–1921) with yellow on the top and blue on the bottom. The yellow on the top allegedly represents golden domes (cupolas) of Christian churches and the blue the Dnieper river.

The head of the Ukrainian Heraldry Society, Andriy Grechylo, points to the fact that the discussion about order of colours was taking place as far back as 1918. Nonetheless, both governments of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic as well as the Ukrainian State defined that the upper half would be light-blue, while the lower would be yellow. During 1918 it was taken into consideration that light blue would lose its shade under sun, therefore it was decided to make the colour darker.

Already in the 1918 draft of the Constitution of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the order of colours was defined as blue and yellow. The same order could be found in legislative acts of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic for November 1918 and the Republic of Carpathian Ukraine on 15 March 1939. The argument on the order of colours was taking place in the Ukrainian diaspora as well. In 1949 it was decided that, until Ukraine defined a single state flag, the diaspora would use the blue-and-yellow banner.

===Attempts to revive Soviet flags===
On 21 April 2011, the Verkhovna Rada passed a law allowing the Victory Banner to be raised on Victory Day. The current Victory Banner was adopted in Russia in 2007. On 20 May 2011, the law was signed by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. On 17 June 2011, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine recognised the law as unconstitutional and proposed that the parliament implement required amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine.

On 9 April 2015, the Ukrainian parliament passed legislation on decommunization, banning the promotion of symbols of &quot;Communist and National Socialist totalitarian regimes&quot;. Since then, Soviet symbols, like the Victory Banner, have only been allowed in cemeteries.

Soviet flags have been flown in territories outside of the government&#x27;s control after Russia invaded the country in 2022.

==Flag of the head of state==
Throughout the history of Ukraine, various heads of state have used different flags. The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in Ukraine at the time. The first flag to be used by a head of state of Ukraine was that of Pavlo Skoropadskyi. A standard for the President of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in exile appeared around 1930. The current design, the flag of the president of Ukraine, was adopted in 1999. In 2022, the president of Ukraine used a variant where the left side of the blue upper-half contains the yellow &quot;Tryzub&quot;.

<doc id="459351" wikidata="Q197341" url="?curid=459351" title="Zhang Zhao (Eastern Wu)">
<text>Zhang Zhao (156–236), courtesy name Zibu, was a Chinese calligrapher, essayist, military general, and politician. He served as an official of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Zhang Zhao started his career as a scholar in his native Xu Province before the chaos towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty forced him to flee south to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region for shelter. In Jiangdong, Zhang Zhao became an adviser to the rising warlord Sun Ce. After Sun Ce&#x27;s death in the year 200, Zhang Zhao played a key supporting role to Sun Ce&#x27;s younger brother and successor, Sun Quan, as he consolidated power and his control over the Jiangdong territories. In 208, Zhang Zhao strongly urged Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao, a rival warlord, because he believed that they stood no chance against an impending invasion by Cao Cao. However, Sun Quan refused to listen to Zhang Zhao and instead heeded the advice of Lu Su and Zhou Yu. Sun Quan&#x27;s forces ultimately scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208. From 200 until his death in 236, Zhang Zhao served under Sun Quan through the collapse of the Eastern Han dynasty and into the Three Kingdoms period after Sun Quan became the founding emperor of the Eastern Wu state. Throughout his career, Zhang Zhao was known for being a stern, uncompromising and intimidating figure who commanded respect from both his colleagues and Sun Quan. Despite Zhang Zhao&#x27;s seniority and experience, Sun Quan passed him over twice as a candidate for the position of Imperial Chancellor in 222 and 225 as he believed that Zhang Zhao was so headstrong and stubborn that he would not be able to effectively lead the administration. Nevertheless, Sun Quan paid his due respects to Zhang Zhao as a mentor-like figure who saw him through his formative years to his accession to the throne.

==Early life==
Zhang Zhao was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty in the Pengcheng State (), a principality in Xu Province centred around present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu. As a youth, he was known for being diligent in his studies and for specialising in the clerical script style of calligraphy. He studied the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; and &quot;Chunqiu&quot; under the tutelage of Bohou Zi&#x27;an (), and was known for being well read in history. He was also a close friend of two other well-known scholars, Zhao Yu () and Wang Lang.

When Zhang Zhao reached the age of adulthood around 19, he was nominated as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; (civil service candidate) to serve in the government. However, he declined the offer and chose to join Wang Lang in compiling an essay on the ancient use of taboo names. They received praise from other Xu Province scholars, such as Chen Lin, for their work. The essay contradicted the arguments of Ying Shao, another celebrated scholar from Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day central Henan).

Sometime later, when Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, nominated Zhang Zhao as a &quot;maocai&quot; (茂才; outstanding candidate) to serve in the government, Zhang Zhao declined the offer again. Tao Qian perceived Zhang Zhao&#x27;s rejection as an insult, so he ordered the latter&#x27;s arrest. However, Zhao Yu, who was serving in Tao Qian&#x27;s administration at the time, managed to convince the governor to pardon Zhang Zhao.

==Service under Sun Ce==
When chaos broke out throughout China in the 190s, many people living in Xu Province fled their homes and crossed the Yangtze River to take shelter in Yang Province (or the Jiangdong region) in the south. Zhang Zhao followed suit and moved from Pengcheng State to Jiangdong.

Between 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce conquered the territories in Jiangdong and established his own regime in the region. During this time, he heard of Zhang Zhao and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. After Zhang Zhao agreed and joined him, he was so delighted that he told Zhang Zhao: &quot;Now that I have expanded my domain in all the four corners, I should treat learned and virtuous men with the utmost respect. I won&#x27;t treat you in any degrading manner.&quot; He then appointed Zhang Zhao as a Colonel () and honoured him like a teacher.

Later on, Sun Ce made Zhang Zhao his Chief Clerk () and promoted him from Colonel to General of the Household Who Pacifies the Army (). Apart from paying his respects to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s mother and treating Zhang Zhao like an old friend, Sun Ce also consulted Zhang Zhao on various matters related to civil and military policy.

===Receiving flattering letters===
While serving under Sun Ce, Zhang Zhao received several flattering letters from his fellow literati in the north. He faced a dilemma on how to deal with those letters. On one hand, he was afraid that if he kept quiet about those letters, Sun Ce would start questioning his loyalty. On the other hand, he was also worried that others would scorn him for being boastful if he revealed the letters.

When Sun Ce found out, he laughed and told Zhang Zhao: &quot;In the past, when Guan Zhong was the chancellor of Qi, he was called &quot;zhongfu&quot;. With his help, Duke Huan of Qi became a hegemon among the feudal lords. Today, as I have a virtuous talent like Zibu to assist me, isn&#x27;t his glory also mine?&quot;

===Sun Ce entrusting Sun Quan to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s care===
In the year 200, before Sun Ce died, he entrusted his younger brother and successor, Sun Quan, to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s care. He told Zhang Zhao: &quot;If Zhongmou turns out to be incompetent, you may replace him. If there is no way to overcome the difficulties, you can gradually retreat back to the west where you will have no worries.&quot;

After Sun Ce&#x27;s death, Zhang Zhao led all of Sun Ce&#x27;s former subjects to support Sun Quan and pledge their allegiance to him. Zhang Zhao also wrote a memorial to the Han central government to inform them about Sun Ce&#x27;s death and that Sun Quan had succeeded his brother. He also wrote to all the key appointment holders throughout Sun Quan&#x27;s domain to order them to continue performing their duties as before.

==Service under Sun Quan==
===Assisting Sun Quan in consolidating power===
When an 18-year-old Sun Quan first came to power, he was so overwhelmed with grief over his brother&#x27;s death that he spent his time mourning instead of taking charge of the regime established by his brother in Jiangdong. Zhang Zhao told him: 

Sun Quan&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that Zhang Zhao told the young Sun Quan: 

Sun Quan heeded Zhang Zhao&#x27;s advice. He changed out of his mourning attire, got onto horseback with Zhang Zhao&#x27;s help, and inspected his troops as they assembled in formation. Sun Ce&#x27;s former subjects accepted Sun Quan&#x27;s leadership and pledged their allegiance to him. Sun Quan also appointed Zhang Zhao as his Chief Clerk () and ordered him to perform the same duties as he did under Sun Ce.

With Zhang Zhao&#x27;s assistance, Sun Quan managed to consolidate his control over the unstable Jiangdong regime left behind by Sun Ce. Apart from pacifying and winning over the people, he also recruited many talented and capable persons to serve in his administration. Whenever Sun Quan went into battle, he left Zhang Zhao behind to guard his base and oversee day-to-day affairs in the Jiangdong territories. During this time, Zhang Zhao suppressed an uprising by remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels.

===Battle of Jiangxia===
In the spring of 208, Gan Ning, who had recently joined Sun Quan, pointed out to Sun Quan that Cao Cao, the warlord who controlled the Han central government and most of northern China, was planning to attack Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to the west of the Jiangdong (or Wu) territories. He also noted that Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, was incapable of defending his domain, so it would be better for Sun Quan to seize Jing Province before Cao Cao could do so. The first step in Gan Ning&#x27;s plan was to attack Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which was guarded by Liu Biao&#x27;s subordinate Huang Zu.

Sun Quan approved Gan Ning&#x27;s plan, but Zhang Zhao strongly objected and said: &quot;The territories in Wu have not been completely pacified yet. If we proceed with this campaign, I am afraid there will be chaos.&quot; Gan Ning rebuked Zhang Zhao: &quot;Our lord has entrusted responsibilities to you as if you were Xiao He. If you can&#x27;t even be confident that there won&#x27;t be chaos under your watch, how can you expect to be like Xiao He?&quot;

Sun Quan ignored Zhang Zhao and put Gan Ning in charge of planning and leading the campaign. They emerged victorious in the campaign as they killed Huang Zu in battle and conquered Jiangxia Commandery.

===Battle of Red Cliffs===
In the late autumn of 208, Cao Cao launched a military campaign aimed at eliminating all forces in southern China who opposed him. He swiftly conquered Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) after the provincial governor Liu Cong surrendered without a fight. When Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects heard that Cao Cao had gained control of Jing Province along with its tens of thousands of land and naval troops, they became fearful as they knew that Cao Cao&#x27;s next target was Sun Quan&#x27;s territories in the Jiangdong region. Sun Quan summoned them for a meeting and showed them a threatening letter he received from Cao Cao, in which Cao Cao claimed that he had 800,000 troops.

Some of Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects, including Zhang Zhao and Qin Song, suggested that Sun Quan surrender to Cao Cao because, in their opinion, they could not win a battle against Cao Cao. However, Sun Quan ultimately heeded the advice of Lu Su and Zhou Yu and hardened his decision to go to war with Cao Cao. He also told Lu Su and Zhou Yu privately that he was deeply disappointed with Zhang Zhao, Qin Song and those who advised him to surrender to Cao Cao. After making up his mind, he summoned all his subjects, drew his sword, slashed the table in front of him and said: &quot;Any of you who dares to speak of surrendering to Cao Cao shall end up like this table!&quot;

In the winter of 208–209, Sun Quan and his ally Liu Bei scored a decisive victory over Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. After the Battle of Red Cliffs, while Zhou Yu led Sun Quan&#x27;s forces to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s garrison at Jiangling, Sun Quan personally led another army to attack Hefei, a heavily fortified city under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. During the campaign, he ordered Zhang Zhao to lead a separate detachment of troops to assault Kuangqi (), another of Cao Cao&#x27;s fortresses in Guangling Commandery (廣陵郡; around present-day Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu). Sun Quan and Zhang Zhao did not manage to capture Hefei and Kuangqi, while Zhou Yu successfully conquered Jiangling.

Zhang Zhao later led Sun Quan&#x27;s forces to attack and eliminate bandit forces led by Zhou Feng () in Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi). After this battle, Zhang Zhao hardly assumed positions of military command again as Sun Quan decided to keep him by his side as a strategist and adviser. Sun Quan also treated him very respectfully because of his senior status in the administration.

In late 209 or early 210, after Sun Quan received the appointment of acting General of Chariots and Cavalry () from the Han central government through Liu Bei&#x27;s nomination, he appointed Zhang Zhao as his Army Adviser ().

===Lecturing Sun Quan on hunting excursions===
Sun Quan enjoyed going on hunting excursions as a leisure activity. On one occasion, while he was hunting a tiger on horseback with a bow and arrows, the tiger suddenly attacked him and clawed at his saddle.

When Zhang Zhao heard about it, he lectured Sun Quan: Sun Quan then apologised to Zhang Zhao: &quot;I am young and lacking in wisdom. Sir, I am sorry for letting you down.&quot;

Despite being lectured, Sun Quan was unwilling to give up on his favourite pastime so he designed a chariot for his hunting excursions. The chariot had squarish openings but no roof. Accompanied by only a driver to drive the chariot, Sun Quan fired arrows at wild beasts through the openings. When they encountered animals who left their packs/herds and came very close to the chariot, Sun Quan got out and took pleasure in hand-to-hand combat with the animal. When Zhang Zhao found out, he repeatedly urged Sun Quan to stop engaging in such dangerous activities but the latter laughed and ignored him.

===Service under the King of Wu===
In late 220, Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Cao Wei (or Wei) with himself as the emperor. This event marked the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China.

In September 221, Sun Quan pledged nominal allegiance to Cao Pi and agreed to become a vassal of Wei. In return, Cao Pi sent an emissary, Xing Zhen (), to confer the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; () on Sun Quan. On 23 September that year, when Xing Zhen arrived at Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), the capital of Sun Quan&#x27;s domain, for the conferment ceremony, he did not dismount from his carriage when he reached the city gates. Zhang Zhao told him: Upon hearing what Zhang Zhao said, Xing Zhen immediately got off the carriage and entered the city on foot.

After Sun Quan became the King of Wu, he awarded Zhang Zhao the appointment of General Who Pacifies Distant Lands () and the peerage of Marquis of Youquan (). Zhang Zhao, along with Sun Shao, Teng Yin, Zheng Li () and others, drafted the rules of imperial protocol for the Kingdom of Wu based on those of the Zhou and Han dynasties.

====Lecturing Sun Quan on making merry====
When Sun Quan was in Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), he once hosted a drinking party on a terrace and invited all his subjects to attend. He ordered his servants to splash water at everyone, after which he jokingly declared: &quot;The party shall not end until everyone gets dead drunk.&quot;

Zhang Zhao did not say anything, put on a stern face, walked out of the party, and sat inside his carriage alone. Sun Quan sent someone to ask him to come back, and then asked him: &quot;This is a time for all of us to make merry and be happy. Sir, why are you angry?&quot; Zhang Zhao replied: Sun Quan fell silent and looked embarrassed after hearing Zhang Zhao&#x27;s words. He then called off the party.

====Not chosen to be Imperial Chancellor====
In November 222, Sun Quan broke ties with Cao Pi and declared himself an independent ruler of his Kingdom of Wu by adopting an era name for his reign. After that, he wanted to create the position of Imperial Chancellor () in his government, so he consulted his subjects on suitable candidates to fill in this post. Although all of them came to the consensus that Zhang Zhao was the best candidate, Sun Quan said: &quot;We are living in times of chaos. Such key appointments are to be filled by persons capable of shouldering great responsibilities; they shouldn&#x27;t be treated like honorary positions.&quot; Sun Quan ultimately selected Sun Shao to be the first Imperial Chancellor of Wu.

After Sun Shao died in office in the summer of 225, Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects nominated Zhang Zhao to succeed Sun Shao as Imperial Chancellor. However, Sun Quan refused again and said: &quot;It&#x27;s not that I am being unkind towards Zibu (by not choosing him). The person holding the position of Imperial Chancellor has to deal with so many issues on a daily basis. (Zhang Zhao) is too headstrong. If people don&#x27;t listen to him, there will be a lot of conflicts. It won&#x27;t be helpful at all.&quot; He then chose Gu Yong to be the second Imperial Chancellor of Wu.

===Service under the Emperor of Wu===
In the summer of 229, after Sun Quan declared himself emperor of Wu, Zhang Zhao retired from active service on the grounds of old age and poor health. He resigned from his position as General Who Pacifies Distant Lands () and returned command of his troops to the Wu government.

====Sun Quan embarrassing Zhang Zhao in public====
According to the &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot;, although Sun Quan highly respected Zhang Zhao for his loyal, bold and forthright character, he never forgot that Zhang Zhao had advised him to surrender to Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. After he became emperor, he told all his subjects: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have become an emperor today if there wasn&#x27;t Zhou Yu to assist me.&quot; Just as Zhang Zhao prepared to hold up his &quot;hu&quot; and congratulate Sun Quan, the emperor remarked: &quot;If I had listened to Lord Zhang, I&#x27;d be begging for food today.&quot; Zhang Zhao felt deeply embarrassed and he broke out in a cold sweat as he sank to his knees.

Pei Songzhi, in his annotations to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, argued that Zhang Zhao had never intended to help Sun Ce or Sun Quan become rulers in their own right; all he desired was to assist them in bringing peace to the common people living under their control. When he saw that Cao Cao had pacified northern China and conquered Jing Province just before the Battle of Red Cliffs, he advised Sun Quan to surrender to Cao Cao because he saw that as an opportunity for the fragmented Han Empire to be reunified under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. If the Han Empire were reunified, there would be no more conflicts among the warlords, and the common people would finally be able to live in peace. Pei Songzhi thus concluded that although Zhang Zhao may not be considered loyal towards Sun Quan, he had the greater interests of the common people at heart.

The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny believed that this account from the &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; is probably false because Sun Quan stood to gain little for his own reputation and authority from making such an extraordinary public insult at Zhang Zhao.

====Life in retirement====
Although Zhang Zhao had effectively retired, Sun Quan still gave him an honorary position as General Who Assists Wu (), whose status was just below the Three Ducal Ministers in the hierarchy of the Eastern Wu government. Sun Quan also changed Zhang Zhao&#x27;s peerage from the Marquis of Youquan () to the Marquis of Lou (), and awarded him a marquisate comprising 10,000 taxable households.

Zhang Zhao stayed at home after retiring and he spent his time writing a guide to the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; and an annotated copy of the &quot;Analects&quot;.

Sun Quan once asked Yan Jun to recite something he memorised in his childhood. Yan Jun thus recited &quot;The Scope and Meaning of the Treatise&quot;, the opening paragraph of the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;. Zhang Zhao, who was also present, remarked: &quot;Yan Jun is a mediocre scholar. I humbly seek permission to recite for Your Majesty.&quot; After Sun Quan approved, Zhang Zhao recited &quot;The Service of the Ruler&quot;, another paragraph in the &quot;Classic of Filial Piety&quot;. Sun Quan&#x27;s other subjects agreed that Zhang Zhao had a good understanding of what he should recite in front of the emperor.

====Quarrel with Sun Quan====
Zhang Zhao was known for being very outspoken, forthright and blunt in his speech whenever he spoke up in Sun Quan&#x27;s imperial court. On one occasion, after he openly defied an order from Sun Quan, he was not allowed to enter the imperial court for some time.

During this time, Wu&#x27;s ally state Shu sent an ambassador to Wu for an official visit. The Shu ambassador sang praises about Shu in front of Sun Quan and his imperial court. Some Wu officials tried to challenge the Shu ambassador but failed. Sun Quan sighed: &quot;If Lord Zhang were here, (the Shu ambassador) would feel intimidated before he could even debate with us, much less boast about his state!&quot;

The following day, Sun Quan sent a messenger to visit Zhang Zhao at his residence and invite him back to the imperial court. When Zhang Zhao showed up, he apologised to Sun Quan but refused to take his seat, so Sun Quan knelt down and begged him to stop. Zhang Zhao then sat down, with his eyes looking up, and said: Sun Quan apologised to him and left.

====Quarrel with Sun Quan over the Liaodong issue====
In 233, the Liaodong-based warlord Gongsun Yuan pledged allegiance to Sun Quan and expressed willingness to become a vassal of Eastern Wu. Sun Quan was delighted as he saw Gongsun Yuan as a potential ally against Wu&#x27;s rival state, Wei. He then wanted to send Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan () as his representatives to Liaodong to meet Gongsun Yuan and grant him the title &quot;King of Yan&quot; (). However, Zhang Zhao strongly objected and said: 

Sun Quan and Zhang Zhao had a heated quarrel over this issue; Zhang Zhao, adamant that he was right, stubbornly refused to yield. Sun Quan eventually lost his temper, placed his hand on the hilt of his sword, and angrily told Zhang Zhao: &quot;When the people of Wu enter the palace, they pay respects to me. Outside the palace, they pay respects to you. My respect for you has already reached the maximum possible extent, yet you humiliate me in front of everyone. I am really afraid that I will lose control of myself and end up hurting you.&quot; Zhang Zhao stared at Sun Quan for some time before replying: He then broke down in tears. Sun Quan dropped his sword and started crying too.

When Sun Quan ultimately sent Zhang Mi and Xu Yan to Liaodong, Zhang Zhao felt so frustrated with the emperor for not heeding his advice that he claimed that he was sick and refused to show up in the imperial court. An angry Sun Quan then ordered the entrance of Zhang Zhao&#x27;s residence to be sealed by piling up earth in front of it to block people from entering or leaving. In response, Zhang Zhao also ordered his servants to pile up earth too and block the entrance from the inside.

In the autumn of 233, Gongsun Yuan betrayed Sun Quan and executed Zhang Mi and Xu Yan. When Sun Quan heard about it, he realised that he was in the wrong. After Zhang Zhao ignored his apologies several times, Sun Quan personally went to Zhang Zhao&#x27;s residence and called him to come out but Zhang Zhao refused and claimed that he was ill. Sun Quan then set fire to the entrance of Zhang Zhao&#x27;s residence to scare him and force him to come out. His plan backfired as Zhang Zhao not only refused to come out, but also shut all the doors and windows of his residence. Left with no choice, Sun Quan ordered his servants to put out the fire, and he stood at the entrance for a long time. Zhang Zhao&#x27;s sons then helped their father out, while Sun Quan arranged for a carriage to fetch Zhang Zhao to his palace. At the palace, Sun Quan apologised profusely to Zhang Zhao, who finally forgave him and returned to work.

The Jin dynasty historian Xi Zuochi praised Sun Quan for acknowledging his mistake and doing his best to show his remorse and apologise to Zhang Zhao. However, he also criticised Zhang Zhao for his pompous and condescending attitude towards Sun Quan. He argued that Zhang Zhao, as a subject of a ruler, should know his place and refrain from pushing things to such an extreme even if he was right.

===Death===
Throughout his life, Zhang Zhao was known for maintaining a dignified and solemn appearance, and for having an awe-inspiring bearing. His colleagues in the Wu imperial court saw him as an intimidating figure. Sun Quan once said: &quot;When I speak to Lord Zhang, I don&#x27;t dare to say anything in jest.&quot;

Zhang Zhao died at the age of 81 (by East Asian age reckoning) in 236 during the Jiahe era (232–238) of Sun Quan&#x27;s reign. Before he died, he gave instructions that he wanted to be buried in a coffin of simple design and to be dressed in plain clothes. Sun Quan donned mourning garments and attended his funeral in person. He also honoured Zhang Zhao with the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Wen&quot; ().

==Family==
Zhang Zhao was survived by at least two sons, who both served as military generals in Eastern Wu. His first son, Zhang Cheng, had already received a peerage of his own, so his second son Zhang Xiu inherited his peerage and became the next Marquis of Lou ().

Zhang Zhao&#x27;s nephew, Zhang Fen (), designed a war chariot to serve as a siege engine when he was only 19. Bu Zhi recognised his talent and recommended him to serve in the Wu army. However, Zhang Zhao disapproved as he told Zhang Fen: &quot;You are still young. Why do you want to put yourself through hardship by serving in the army?&quot; Zhang Fen replied: &quot;In the past, Wang the boy died a hero while Ziqi governed E. I may be untalented but I am no longer young.&quot; He then served in the army and rose through the ranks to become a general. The highest appointment he held was Chief Controller of Pingzhou (). He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Lexiang Village ().

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou, who wrote Zhang Zhao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, appraised him as follows: &quot;Zhang Zhao received a mission to assist (Sun Quan). His contributions were outstanding. He was loyal, outspoken and upright; his actions were not for his own interests. However, he was feared because he was too stern, and he was shunned by others because he liked to assume the moral high ground. He was given neither the role of a chancellor nor an imperial tutor. Instead, he had a rather unimpressive career and spent his old age in retirement. This shows that Sun Quan was not as wise as Sun Ce.&quot;

The &quot;Dianlue&quot; () recorded that Liu Biao, the governor of Jing Province, once wrote a letter to Sun Ce. Before sending, he showed it to Mi Heng, who disdainfully remarked: &quot;Is this letter for children in Sun Ce&#x27;s domain to read out? Or is it for Zhang Zibu&#x27;s perusal?&quot; This remark showed that even the notoriously haughty Mi Heng acknowledged Zhang Zhao&#x27;s literary talent.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Zhang Zhao&#x27;s fictionalised persona in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; is generally similar to its historical counterpart. In the novel, he first appears in Chapter 15 when Zhou Yu recommends him and Zhang Hong (not related to Zhang Zhao), who are collectively referred to as the &quot;Two Zhangs&quot; () of Jiangdong&quot;, as talents to assist Sun Ce. Sun Ce then visited them at their homes and succeeded in recruiting them to serve as his advisers. In Chapter 29, when Sun Ce is about to die, he says that if Sun Quan cannot make decisions on domestic and external issues, he can consult Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu respectively.

In chapters 43 to 49, when Sun Quan is discussing with his subjects about how to counter an impending invasion by Cao Cao just before the Battle of Red Cliffs, his subjects are divided into two camps: one advocating surrender to Cao Cao, and the other advocating going to war with Cao Cao. Zhang Zhao is one of the leading figures in the former camp. Chapter 43, in particular, describes a fictitious debate between Zhuge Liang and the various scholar-officials serving under Sun Quan. Zhang Zhao is the first among those scholar-officials to challenge Zhuge Liang, who manages to silence all of them through his eloquent responses to their queries and comments, as well as taunts and insults.

<doc id="459352" wikidata="Q1302051" url="?curid=459352" title="Abatement (heraldry)">
<text>An abatement (or rebatement) is a modification of a coat of arms, representing a less-than honorable augmentation, imposed by an heraldic authority (such as the Court of Chivalry in England) or by royal decree for misconduct. The practice of inverting the entire escutcheon of an armiger found guilty of high treason has been attested since the Middle Ages and is generally accepted as reliable, and medieval heraldic sources cite at least one instance of removing an honourable charge from a coat of arms by royal decree as an abatement of honour. Other abatements of honour implied by the addition of dishonourable stains and charges, appearing in late 16th-century texts, have never been reliably attested in actual practice. Additionally, as many heraldic writers note, the use of arms is not compulsory, so armigers are more likely to relinquish a dishonored coat of arms than to advertise their dishonor.

==Inverted arms==
The earliest mention in heraldic writing of a dishonorable display of arms (and, according to Fox-Davies, the only one reliably attested in actual use; see historical examples below) was inverting the entire shield, first documented by Johannes de Bado Aureo in his heraldic treatise &quot;Tractatus de armis&quot; (c. 1394). Contemporary accounts of executions for treason describe the traitor being marched to his execution in a paper tabard displaying his inverted arms, and other accounts tell of displaying the inverted arms of prisoners, released on parole, who refuse to pay their ransom.

Note that inverted arms can also indicate the death of the holder, and do not necessarily indicate dishonour.

==Theoretical abatements==
Eight other abatements were introduced in the late 16th century, each prescribing a specific charge in a specific stain for a specific offense; though the charges themselves were uncommon but no less honourable than any other charge (if colored in any standard tincture or fur), it was only when displayed in the prescribed position and stain that these charges were supposed to be considered dishonourable.

Leigh (1562) enumerated the nine abatements thus:

#Point dexter parted tenné, for false claims of valor
#Point champaine tenné, for killing a prisoner who has demanded quarter
#Plain point sanguine, for one who lies to his sovereign
#Point in point sanguine, for cowardice
#Gusset sanguine borne to dexter, for adultery, or to sinister for a drunkard [&quot;a truncation of the shield&quot;]
#Gore sinister tenné, for cowardice in the face of the enemy
#Delf [&quot;shovelful of earth&quot;] tenné, for revoking a challenge
#Inescutcheon reversed sanguine, for any man who &quot;discourteously entreateth eyther maid or widow against her will, or flieth from his Soveraignes banner&quot;
#The entire escutcheon inverted, for treason

Scottish herald Thomas Innes of Learney mentioned abatements in marital situations: &quot;The law of arms provides for abating the arms of an adulterer by two gussets sanguine, and where the bearing of arms is necessary this, and one gusset (they will be close-gussets) for non-adulterous divorcees, are, at least in Patents, applied in the case of divorcees.&quot;

Several notable modern heraldists have asserted that the execution of this system of abatements has never been attested in fact, and that the whole system was in all likelihood a theoretical exercise created by heralds for the purpose of discouraging armigers from committing dishonourable acts.

==Breaking or erasing charges==

As another form of abatement, some coats of arms were reportedly modified through breaking or cutting, reversing, or altogether erasing some existing charges, at least as they occur in patents, though the armiger&#x27;s actual display of these defaced arms has not been documented and is unlikely.

In French heraldry the term &quot;diffamé&quot; is used to denote a lion or other animal whose tail is cut off, or may refer more broadly to arms which have been altered to signify loss of honor. A lion with its tail between its hind legs is termed &quot;couard&quot; (coward), and has also been cited as a mark of infamy.

Though lions are traditionally depicted with male genitals, a recent trend toward omitting the genitals has been controversial, prodding claims that emasculated lions have also been an historical form of abatement. Commenting on the newly castrated lion in the arms of the Nordic Battle Group in 2007, Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the Swedish National Archives since 1994, was critical of the politically motivated decision, stating, &quot;once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; in London, however, noted a growing recent trend toward heraldic &quot;castration&quot;, pointing to the lions passant on the royal coat of arms of England, as well as the lions rampant on those of Norway, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scotland, all of which have recently been depicted without genitals; in conclusion, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;some crests are ambiguous, but the message remains clear: the lions are supposed to display courage and nothing else.&quot; While such arms are clearly not intended as an abatement in modern times, no known examples of castrated lions have been found in medieval heraldry.

==Reported historical examples==
A few examples of historical abatements of arms have been recorded, though none of these reflect the addition of stained ordinaries as detailed above. Rather, these include broken chevrons, disarmed lions, and reversed or erased charges.

One of these rare historical examples was Amery of Pavy, who was appointed governor of Calais by King Edward III of England in 1347, and whose arms were abated by royal decree in 1349 after the failed French siege of Calais on the last day of December 1348, which resulted from Sir Amery&#x27;s attempt to sell Calais to Sir Geffrey Charney, the French governor of nearby Saint-Omer, for 20,000 crowns. As stated by Sir George Mackenzie: &quot;And Edward the Third of England ordained two of six stars which a gentleman had in his arms to be effaced, because he had sold a seaport of which he was made governor.&quot; Pursuivant of arms John Guillim, writing circa 1610, gave the story in considerable detail, adding that Sir Amery&#x27;s arms were also inverted for his treachery. Guillim further explained that this humiliation is not inherited by the traitor&#x27;s heirs, up to and including capital crimes, except in cases of high treason.

An example of a lion &quot;diffamée&quot; is that of Jean d&#x27;Avesnes who insulted his mother, Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, in the presence of King Louis IX. He is supposed to have seen the lion in his arms &quot;diffamée&quot; (i.e. the tail removed) and &quot;morné&quot; (i.e. the teeth and claws removed).

<text>The flag of the United Arab Emirates () contains the Pan-Arab colors red, green, white, and black. It was designed in 1971 by Abdullah Mohammed Al Maainah, who was 19 years old at that time, and was adopted on 2 December 1971 after winning a nationwide flag design contest. The main theme of the flag&#x27;s four colors is the sovereignty and unity of the Arab states.

Merchant ships may fly the alternative civil ensign, a red flag with the national flag in the canton. Emirates Airlines uses the UAE flag as part of their livery.

All seven emirates use the federal flag interchangeably as the flag of the emirate.

==Flag of each emirate==
Each of the seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates belonged to either the Hinawi or Ghafiri tribal confederations; both had a red banner representing the Hashemite dynasty and allegiance to the prophet Muhammad. The Qawasim, although part of the Ghafiri, had their own flag (a green, white, and red banner) which used to distinguish them as a maritime power. In 1820, after the British Empire campaign on Ras Al Khaimah, six out of the seven emirates signed the General Maritime Treaty with the British Empire, which compelled them to be under the British Protectorate rule and protection in the region. A white segment was imposed, to be added to each emirate&#x27;s flag. At the time, Fujairah, not recognized as an emirate by the British and thus not a signatory of the 1820 general treaty, continued to use its plain red flag.

On 6 November 1975, Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi took down the British-imposed flag, the White Pierced Red flag, from Sharjah, stating:

After defeating the Al-Qawasim tribe, the British occupiers gave the Qawasim this flag to replace their own flag, which used to have three horizontal colours: green, white and red from top to bottom, with a Quranic inscription &#x27;A victory from Allah and an imminent conquest&#x27; on the white part. The loss of our national flag occurred on Saturday 8 January 1820. So what I have done now is restore dignity to the citizens of Sharjah of today and to the citizens of Sharjah of the past, all of whom have been forced to salute the flag of the very aggressors who had removed our own flag, a flag that had symbolized the struggle of Al-Qawasim.
On 15 November 1975, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah followed suit and replaced their flags with the federation flag. Soon after, the flags of the other emirates were lowered and the UAE flag was raised.

===Abu Dhabi===
The flag of Abu Dhabi is a red flag with a white rectangle at the top-left corner. According to the 1820 General Maritime Treaty with the British, in times of war a full red flag would be used by the Bani Yas (Abu Dhabi and Dubai).
Although per the treaty, Abu Dhabi was supposed to fly the White Pierced Red Trucial States flag, in practice it continued to fly a plain red flag. Percy Cox, the British Colonial Office administrator in the Middle East, was unsuccessful in convincing Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan to adopt the Trucial States flag, which, Zayed argued, represented the Al Qawasim tribal federation. Abu Dhabi later adopted a red flag with a top left white rectangle to distinguish it from the surrounding emirates. 
===Ajman and Dubai===

The flags of Ajman and Dubai are identical. They are both plain red with a white bar at the hoist, i.e. closest to the flag staff. The flag is known as the White Red Halved and was adopted as an alternative to the Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah White Pierced Red by the Emirate of Dubai and Ajman to distinguish their authority from the Al Qawasim in defiance of the bonds of the 1820 General Maritime Treaty with the British. To the British, this flag was titled as Trucial Coast Flag No.1 and Abu Dhabi and Umm Al Quwain were also expected to adopt it. According to the treaty, in times of war a full red flag would be used by the Bani Yas (Abu Dhabi and Dubai) and a full white flag by Ajman.

The Shihuh of Musandam Peninsula (Ruus Al Jibal) also had a similar flag.
===Fujairah===

Before 1952, the flag of Fujairah was plain red. Fujairah did not sign the general treaty in 1820 with the British and therefore continued using its red plain flag. From 1952 to 1961, the emirate&#x27;s name was added to the flag, and a red flag with a white Arabic calligraphy of the emirate name () was adopted as an ensign to distinguish it from the surrounding emirates. In 1975, the plain red flag was abolished and the national flag of the United Arab Emirates is now used for official purposes.

===Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah===
The flags of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah are identical as they are ruled by two branches of the same house. The flags have a large red rectangle on a white background. The flag, known as the White Pierced Red flag, was the intended flag for all the Trucial States according to the 1820 Maritime Treaty with the British. It was widely attributed to the Al Qawasim tribal federation. Percy Cox, the British Colonial Office administrator in the Middle East, was unsuccessful in convincing the rest of the emirates&#x27; Sheikhs to adopt it. To the British, this flag was titled as Trucial Coast Flag No. 2. According to the treaty, in times of war the original Al Qassimi flag (green, white and red flag) was to be used by the Qawasim.
===Umm Al Quwain===

The flag of Umm Al Quwain consists of a red background, a white bar at the hoist similar the flags of Ajman and Dubai, and a large white star and crescent in the center, a symbol of Islam representing allegiance to the Islamic world. The Umm Al Quwain flag was supposed to be the same White Red Halved flag as the one used by both Dubai and Ajman, but a star and crescent were added to distinguish it from the other emirates.

<doc id="459354" wikidata="Q2878093" url="?curid=459354" title="Proposed expansion of the New York City Subway">
<text>Since the opening of the original New York City Subway line in 1904, and throughout the subway&#x27;s history, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. The first major expansion of the subway system was the Dual Contracts, a set of agreements between the City of New York and the IRT and the BRT. The system was expanded into the outer reaches of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens, and it provided for the construction of important lines in Manhattan. This one expansion of the system provided for a majority of today&#x27;s system.

Even with this expansion, there was a pressing need for growth. In 1922, Mayor John Hylan put out his plan for over 100 miles of new subway lines going to all five boroughs. His plan was intended to directly compete with the two private subway operators, the IRT and the BMT. This plan was never furthered. The next big plan, and arguably the most ambitious in the subway system&#x27;s history, was the &quot;Second System&quot;. The 1929 plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines, the Second System would take over existing subway lines and railroad rights-of-way. This plan would have expanded service throughout the city with 100 miles of subway lines. A major component of the plan was the construction of the Second Avenue Subway. The Stock Market Crash of 1929 put a halt to the plan, however, and subway expansion was limited to lines already under construction by the IND.

During the 1930s and 1940s, the plans were revised, with new plans such as a line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Main Line was first proposed as a branch of the still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines became improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El in the Bronx, and other extensions in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis in the 1970s.

Until the 1990s, there was little focus on expansion of the system because the system was in a state of disrepair, and funds were allocated to maintaining the existing system. In the 1990s, however, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit mostly unfunded.

==Triborough System==

The Triborough System was a proclamation for new subway lines to the Bronx and Brooklyn. The new lines include the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, IRT Pelham Line, and IRT Jerome Avenue Line. The Manhattan Bridge line described below later became the BMT West End Line, BMT Fourth Avenue Line, the BMT Sea Beach Line, and the Nassau Street loops.

The route of the new subway ... comprises a main trunk north and south through Manhattan Borough on Lexington Avenue and Irving Place from the Harlem River to Tenth St. and on Broadway, Vesey and Church Sts. from Tenth St. to the Battery; two branches in Bronx Borough, one northeast via 138th St. Southern Boulevard and Westchester Ave. to Pelham Bay Park. the other northerly via River Ave. and Jerome Ave. to Woodlawn Road, connecting with the Manhattan trunk by a tunnel under the Harlem River; a Manhattan-Brooklyn line extending from the North River via Canal Street across the East River on the Manhattan Bridge to connect with the Fourth Avenue subway in Brooklyn now being built, which thus becomes an integral part of the larger system; two branches southerly from the Fourth Ave. line extending south to Fort Hamilton and southeast to Coney Island; and a loop feeder line in Brooklyn through Lafayette Ave. and Broadway, connecting with the Fourth Ave. line at one end. and at the other crossing the Williamsburg Bridge and entering the Centre Street Loop subway in Manhattan which is thus also incorporated in the system.

In 1911, William Gibbs McAdoo, who operated a competing subway company called the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad, proposed building a line under Broadway between Hudson Terminal and Herald Square. He later proposed that the Broadway line be tied into the IRT&#x27;s original subway line in Lower Manhattan. The Broadway line, going southbound, would merge with the local tracks of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in the southbound direction at 10th Street. A spur off the Lexington Avenue Line in Lower Manhattan, in the back of Trinity Church, would split eastward under Wall Street, cross the East River to Brooklyn, then head down the Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, with another spur underneath Lafayette Avenue.

The Triborough System later became part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913 and also known as the Dual Subway System. These were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in New York City. The contracts were &quot;dual&quot;, in that they were signed between the City and the IRT and Municipal Railway Company, a subsidiary of the BRT (later BMT).

Some lines proposed under the Contracts were not built, most notably an IRT line to Marine Park, Brooklyn (at what is now Kings Plaza) under either Utica Avenue, using a brand-new line, or Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, using the then-new IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.

==Mayor Hylan&#x27;s plan==

On August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan unveiled his own plans for the subway system, which was relatively small at the time. His plan included building over of new lines and taking over nearly of existing lines. By the end of 1925, all of these routes were to have been completed. The lines were designed to compete with the IRT and BMT.

Hylan&#x27;s plan contained the following lines:

* A line running along Manhattan&#x27;s West Side, stretching from the edge of the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it would turn down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.
* A First Avenue line, consisting of four tracks, would stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the line would cease to be a four-track line, with the line splitting into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while the other would go to a new Lafayette Avenue line in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the line would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other would continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road Line at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.
* A line from Astoria, Queens, likely connecting to the BMT Astoria Line, across the East River and via 125th Street (near today&#x27;s Henry Hudson Parkway).
* A line running from Hunters Point in Queens heading southeast to Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. The line would consist of between two and four tracks, and at Lafayette Avenue, the line would split. Two of them would continue as a Lafayette Avenue, but would then become four tracks. The remaining two tracks would run to Franklin and Flatbush Avenues.
* A new 4-track trunk line along Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn from Borough Hall to Bedford Avenue. The line would narrow to three tracks to Broadway. Then the line would have continued underneath the BMT Jamaica Line to 168th Street. By running underneath the Jamaica Line, the line would directly compete with the BMT. A two-track connection would also be provided to a First Avenue line.
* A new line running under Utica Avenue to Flatlands Avenue. The line would be a branch of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line.
* A four-track Flatbush Avenue line to Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, before turning west to Surf Avenue in Coney Island via Emmons Avenue. Service to Floyd Bennett Field would be provided with a branch via Flatbush Avenue.
* The BMT Canarsie Line would be extended past 121st Street in Queens to the BMT Jamaica Line.
* A new line, which would run from 90th Street to Prospect Avenue, that would go via Fort Hamilton Parkway and 10th Avenue would be used by BMT Culver Line trains.
* Extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, south to Bay Ridge–95th Street.
* Extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line east to the Fort Hamilton Parkway Line and the BMT West End Line.
* A two-track line from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line at 67th Street to Staten Island via the Staten Island Tunnel.
* Extension of the IRT New Lots Line from New Lots Avenue to Lefferts Boulevard.
* The IRT Flushing Line would be extended eastward to Bell Boulevard in Bayside via Main Street, Kissena Boulevard, and Northern Boulevard.
* At Roosevelt Avenue a branch would be constructed off the IRT Flushing Line to Jamaica.

Only some of Hylan&#x27;s planned lines were built to completion. Completed lines included:

* An extension of the Fourth Avenue Line to 95th Street.
* Two major trunk lines in midtown Manhattan, with one running under Eighth Avenue and one under Sixth Avenue, which already had an elevated line.
* A crosstown subway under 53rd Street (connecting with the Eighth and Sixth Avenue subways) running under the East River to Queens Plaza (Long Island City), meeting with a Brooklyn–Queens crosstown line, and continuing under Queens Boulevard and Hillside Avenue to 179th Street, where bus service would converge.
* A subway under the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, diverging from the Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan at 145th Street and Saint Nicholas Avenue.

Major Phillip Mathews disagreed with the Board of Transportation&#x27;s plan, and in response, he published a report, on December 24, 1926, titled &quot;Proposed Subway Plan for Subway Relief and Expansion&quot;. He said that that congestion would not be addressed for Brooklyn and the Bronx; only the planned Grand Concourse line would alleviate congestion, in this case congestion on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. There would be little relief on the two lines jointly-operated between the IRT and the BMT. He came up with his own plan. He proposed that the Eighth Avenue Line, through a connection from Fulton or Wall Streets to Chambers Street, be connected to the BMT&#x27;s lines to Coney Island, with a possible connection at the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s south side.

In Manhattan, he proposed a new four-track line running down Third Avenue from City Hall, with connections to the White Plains Road and Pelham Lines in the Bronx. The line would therefore have to be built to IRT clearances. At the line&#x27;s southern end, a connection would be built to the Eastern Parkway Line near Franklin Avenue via a new set of tubes under the East River. To alleviate congestion on the Queens lines, a new trunk line would run from Eighth Avenue in Manhattan to Jamaica, with transfers to the north–south lines in Manhattan and to Brooklyn Crosstown service. This would later be built as the IND Queens Boulevard Line.

To round out expansion in Manhattan, he proposed that an extension of the BMT Canarsie Line to Eighth Avenue. This was built at a later date. To connect the outer boroughs, a four-track Brooklyn-Queens crosstown line would be designed, with the possibility for future extensions into the Bronx and Staten Island.

==Subways to New Jersey==
In 1926, a loop subway service was planned to be built to New Jersey. The rationale given was:

Principal features of a comprehensive plan for passenger transportation between communities in the nine northern counties of New Jersey and the city of New York are outlined in a report submitted on Jan. 15 to the Legislature of the state by the North Jersey Transit Commission. A preliminary report presented about a year ago was abstracted in &quot;Electric Railway Journal&quot; for Feb. 7, 1925... The ultimate object of the program recommended is the creation of a new electric railway system comprising of route, and the electrification of of railroad now operated by steam. As the first step it is proposed to construct an interstate loop line in length connecting with all of the north Jersey commuters&#x27; railroads and passing under the Hudson River into New York City by two tunnels, one uptown and one downtown. A new low-level subway through Manhattan would complete the loop. Construction costs of this preliminary project are estimated at $154,000,000, with $40,000,000 additional for equipment. The cost of power facilities is not included in this estimate.

Because it would be utilized in both directions, the capacity of the proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.

In 1954, Regional Plan Association advocated for an extension of the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40 million. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn&#x27;t would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.

In 1963, three major commuter groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals. One of them would have involved an extension of the IRT Flushing Line under the Hudson River with a three-track tunnel and then connect with the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad.

In 1986, the Regional Plan Association suggested extending the IRT Flushing Line to New Jersey&#x27;s Meadowlands Sports Complex.

On November 16, 2010, the plan was revisited yet again, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s administration had been working on a plan to extend the 7 service across the Hudson River to Hoboken and continue to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, where it would connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. This was being planned as an extension of the already-under construction 7 Subway Extension (see below). 

In April 2012, citing budget considerations, the director of the MTA, Joe Lhota, said that it was doubtful the extension would be built in the foreseeable future, suggesting that the Gateway Project was a much more likely solution to congestion at Hudson River crossings. A feasibility study commissioned by the city and released in April 2013 revived hope for the project, however, with Mayor Bloomberg saying &quot;Extending the 7 train to Secaucus is a promising potential solution ... and is deserving of serious consideration.&quot;

In 2017, a further extension of the 7 train to New Jersey was suggested once again, this time as an alternative to constructing a replacement for the Port Authority Bus Terminal. An alternative would include a new terminal at Secaucus Junction in conjunction with the 7 extension. In February 2018, it was revealed that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had advertised for consultants to write a feasibility study for such an extension, and that it had received bids from several companies. This extension was being planned along with the Gateway Project and, if built, would be able to accommodate a projected 38% increase in the number of people commuting between the two states. The 18-month study would include input from the Port Authority, the MTA, and NJ Transit. If the New Jersey subway extension were to be constructed, it could complement the Gateway Project, which might become overcrowded by 2040.

==1929–1939 plans==
Before unification in 1940, the government of New York City made plans for expanding the subway system, under a plan referred to in contemporary newspaper articles as the IND Second System (due to the fact that most of the expansion was to include new IND lines, as opposed to BMT/IRT lines). The first one, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. Very few of these far-reaching lines were built, though provisions were made for future expansion on lines that intersect the proposals.

The core Manhattan lines of the expansion were the Second Avenue Line (with an extension into the Bronx) and the Worth Street Line, connecting to the Rockaways. The Rockaways were eventually served by the subway via a city takeover of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch. A segment of the proposed Second Avenue Subway opened for passenger service in January 2017. The majority of the proposed lines were to be built as elevated subways, likely a cost-cutting measure. The majority of the expansion was to occur in Queens, with the original proposal suggesting of track be built in Queens alone.

===Details===
The first plan was made on September 15, 1929 (before the IND even opened), and is detailed in the table below. Cost is only for construction, and does not include land acquisition or other items.
===Other plans during the same time===

====Revised 1932 plan====
The IND expansion plan was revised in 1932. It differs from the 1929 plan, but there are , of which are in Manhattan, in the Bronx, in Brooklyn, and in Queens. It would include a new 34th Street crosstown line, a Second Avenue Subway line, a connection to the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, and extensions of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line, IRT Flushing Line, and BMT Astoria Line. It would have created a subway loop bounded by 2nd and 10th Avenues, and 34th and 125th Streets. This plan included no extensions to Whitestone, Queens, however, with the plan to instead serve more densely populated areas such as Astoria and the Roosevelt Avenue corridor.

The plan would also take over the local tracks of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, and the Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.

The table of route miles is as follows:

====Smaller plans====
Other plans, proposed during the same time as the IND Second System plans, included the following:
* (1931 plan) A line splitting from the Second Avenue Line north of Houston Street, running southeast under East 16th Street, turning southwest under Avenue C, merging with the Houston Street Line, and crossing the East River from Stanton Street towards the huge line under South Fourth Street.
* (1931 plan) A line splitting from the Crosstown Line where it turns from Lafayette Avenue to Marcy Avenue, continuing under Lafayette Avenue and Stanhope Street to a junction with the line under Myrtle Avenue.
* (1932 plan) A rapid transit shuttle operating from a terminal adjacent to the IRT Flushing Line and Whitestone Landing operating over the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Whitestone Branch. The line would have been under private operation and would have had a five-cent fare.
* (1939 plan) A line splitting from the South Brooklyn (Culver) Line at Fort Hamilton Parkway or Church Avenue, and running under Fort Hamilton Parkway to 86th Street. A branch would split to run under Ovington Avenue and Senator Street, with a tunnel under the Narrows to Staten Island at the St. George Terminal. The line would split, with the north branch ending at Westervelt Avenue around Hamilton Avenue, and the south branch ending at Grant Street around St. Pauls Street. It was presumably designed this way to provide future service to both the Main Line and North Shore Staten Island Railway lines. The Staten Island Tunnel commenced construction in 1923 to serve the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, but was not completed.
* (1940 plan, revised 1945) The IND Fulton Street Line would connect to what is now the IND Rockaway Line. A branch of the IND Fulton Street Line would run to a stub-end terminal at 105th Street. The line, east of Euclid Avenue, would be four tracks until Cross Bay Boulevard, where the two branches would split.
* (unknown date) A third two-track tunnel under the East River, from the north side of the South Fourth Street/Union Avenue station (as built for six tracks) west to Delancey Street.
* (unknown date) A line splitting from the Stuyvesant Avenue line, going southeast under Broadway.
* (unknown date) A line under Flushing Avenue from the huge line under Beaver Street to Horace Harding Boulevard (Long Island Expressway).
* (unknown date) A four-track subway under Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn connecting to the Worth Street Subway and Second Avenue Subway.
An earlier plan in 1920 had an even more expansive plan, with several dozen subway lines going across all five boroughs.

===Provisions for new lines===
The following provisions were made for connections and transfers to the new lines. It is of note that only four of these provisions were completed.
*At Second Avenue on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, the ceiling drops at the west end. Above the ceiling is a provision for a four-track IND Second Avenue Line. The future Second Avenue Line will not utilize this provision; it will instead be built under the station, if a transfer station is ever built.
*At East Broadway on the IND Sixth Avenue Line (under Rutgers Street at this station), part of a two-track station was built for the IND Worth Street Line under East Broadway, above the existing line. Most of the constructed portion is now part of the mezzanine, with a small unused section blocked by a door.
*At Broadway on the IND Crosstown Line, traces of passageways are visible going towards a six-track station on the line to Utica Avenue, as well as a stair to an upper mezzanine on top of the unfinished station.
*At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above can be seen in the ceiling of the existing station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.
*At Roosevelt Avenue on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, a two-track upper level was built for the Winfield Spur towards the line to the Rockaways. Unlike the other stations, this one was completed, except for track.
*Hillside Avenue considerably widens between 218th Street and 229th Street in Queens Village, and gains a very wide median. This section was widened in the 1930s to accommodate construction of the proposed eastern terminus of the IND Queens Boulevard Line at Springfield Boulevard and Rocky Hill Road (Braddock Avenue) and to accommodate an underpass for Hillside Avenue underneath Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue. Six station entrances would have been provided at Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue. The station would have stretched as far east as 88th Avenue. The two tracks would have continued to 229th Street.
*The center tracks on the IND Sixth Avenue Line dead end at the curve from Houston Street to Essex Street; these were planned to continue through a new East River tunnel to Williamsburg and south to the proposed Utica Avenue line towards Sheepshead Bay.
*The tracks that the IND 63rd Street Line uses to split from the IND Sixth Avenue Line were built for a similar proposed line under 61st Street, connecting to the Second Avenue Subway.
*The Lexington Avenue–63rd Street subway station has two island platforms, which were originally built with now-demolished walls on their northern sides. The platforms were designed to provide a cross-platform interchange to the Second Avenue Subway.
*The upper level relay tracks east of 179th Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line were intended to continue toward Floral Park, and the tunnel is designed to allow for such a future extension.
*The relay tracks east of Euclid Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line were intended to continue toward Cambria Heights in Queens.
*The Nevins Street station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line has an unused center trackway and an unused lower level intended for expansion into northern or southern Brooklyn.
*South of the 36th Street station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, there are three trackways that diverge from the line at a flying junction. These trackways end under the eastern curb of Fourth Avenue.
*The BMT Fourth Avenue Line has provisions for two more tracks south of 59th Street, where the line becomes double-tracked:
*#There are four trackways on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line bridge over the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch despite the fact that only the northernmost two tracks are in use.
*#The 86th Street station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line appears to have &quot;escapes&quot; in the wall bricked over along the Manhattan-bound track, for the never-built fourth tracks.
*#The northbound side platforms of Bay Ridge Avenue and 77th Street do not have platform pillars because the platforms were supposed to be temporary; the southbound platforms do have pillars, however.
*Bellmouths for uncompleted lines are scattered in numerous stations, including 21st Street–Queensbridge, 59th Street, 63rd Drive–Rego Park, Bowery, Canal Street, and Woodhaven Boulevard:
*#East of 21st Street–Queensbridge, before the IND 63rd Street Line connects to the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the tracks veer left while the tunnel wall goes straight. The bellmouths were part of a proposed super-express bypass running under the LIRR mainline between Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills. This plan was not in the original Second System plan, but rather, as part of the Program for Action plan that had the tracks from 21st Street–Queensbridge go straight to Forest Hills.
*#There are bellmouths and space for two additional trackways (for a total of six) on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line south of 59th Street. These provisions were for the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have intersected with the line south of 59th Street.
*#East of 63rd Drive–Rego Park on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, bellmouths were built for a proposed connection to the LIRR&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch. They may be used if the northern portion of the Rockaway Beach Branch were ever reused for subway service.
*#A line to the Rockaways would have split from the IND Eighth Avenue Line (under Church Street at this point), east under Worth Street. The junction was built and is used by the local tracks to World Trade Center. The branch to the Rockaways was purchased from the LIRR and connected to the IND Fulton Street Line in 1956.
*Two bellmouths have since been completed, but were previously unused.
*#The completed IND 63rd Street Line, which the uses to cross the East River, was designed and built with bellmouths to allow for the construction of connections to the planned Second Avenue Subway for service to/from the north and south along Second Avenue. These bellmouths were completed and opened in 2017.
*#A junction was built on the IND Queens Boulevard Line for the line under Van Wyck Boulevard. The junction was completed and has been connected to the IND Archer Avenue Line.

====Shells built====
The South Fourth Street shell, if complete, was supposed to handle service as follows:
Note: The locals would have short-turned here. There would have been two tunnels under the East River: East Houston Street and Grand Street.

Another plan for the South Fourth Street shell was simpler (and was the plan that was partially completed):
Note: The Flushing Avenue local would have diverged off to the IND Crosstown Line. There would have been three tunnels under the East River: East Houston Street, Stanton Street, and Grand Street.

The Utica Avenue station shell, if complete, would be in the standard local-express-express-local platform configuration.

The Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue shell, a two-trackbed island-platformed station, would have been for local trains terminating at the station. Express trains would have stopped at the lower level (IND Queens Boulevard Line) platforms.

==1940–1999 plans==

After World War II and up until the late 1990s, the New York City Subway did not expand much. Only 28 stations opened in that time, compared to the remaining 393 stations, which opened from the 1880s to before World War II. As such, there have been many plans to expand the system during this time period.

===1938–1940===
The New York City Board of Transportation revised its plans for subway expansion, and released them in 1938 and 1940.

*The remnant of the IRT Ninth Avenue Line at 155th Street would connect with the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, giving riders of the Jerome Avenue Line service to Manhattan&#x27;s West Side. This project was never undertaken because of the high cost of modifying the third rail in the Sedgwick Avenue and Anderson–Jerome Avenues tunnel section to accommodate new subway cars.
*The New York, Westchester and Boston Railway&#x27;s abandoned right-of-way would have been rehabilitated and connected to the IRT Pelham Line.
*The IND Concourse Line would have been extended eastward to Gun Hill Road from 205th Street.
*The Second Avenue Subway would originate at Harding Avenue in the Bronx, and connect into the Court Street station in Brooklyn as a two-track and four-track line. A yard would have been constructed to store the line&#x27;s equipment. The first phase would end the line at East 139th Street. The Main Line and its connections to other subway lines was to have cost $213.95 million, while the future Bronx extension would have cost $130.16 million.
*An extension of the IRT Lenox Avenue Line would have been built so it could connect with the IRT Ninth Avenue Line.
*Two express tracks would be built on the IND Sixth Avenue Line between West 9th Street and West 31st Street for $19.27 million. This was viewed as a requirement for a Second Avenue Line.
*The Seventh Avenue Line Extension would extend the Broadway Line north from 59th Street via a tunnel under Central Park to 72nd Street, before turning east into Queens via Northern Boulevard to Jackson Heights. It was to have been built as a two-track and four-track line, and it would have cost $89 million. The second phase would extend the line as a two-track line along Corona Avenue and Horace Harding Boulevard from Jackson Heights to Marathon Parkway. A storage yard would be built. This phase would have cost $51.82 million. A connection between the new line and the Crosstown Line was to have been built at 23rd Street (Ely Avenue) for $10.95 million.
*A connection between the Seventh Avenue Extension and the Rockaway Line would be built at 99th Street, costing $9.2 million.The Rockaway Beach Branch of the LIRR would be purchased and converted for subway operation. Service to the Rockaway would be provided through a connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line. The extension would have cost $42.38 million. In addition, $2.55 million would be spent on a two-track subway an open-cut connection between the Rockaway Line and the Fulton Street Line. Only the portion south of Liberty Avenue was completed.
*An extension of the BMT Broadway Line, from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue to 145th Street, would run via Central Park and Morningside Drive.
*A crosstown line via Worth Street would serve as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line&#x27;s local tracks. The line would have branched off at Church Street, from where it would run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment would have cost $15.2 million. The line would then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18.5 million. The South Fourth Street junction would be completed.
*The IND Queens Boulevard Line and BMT Broadway Line would be connected through the construction of a connection at 11th Street. The connection would be between the Queens Boulevard Line&#x27;s local tracks at Queens Plaza and the BMT 60th Street Tunnel.
*The IND Queens Boulevard Line would be extended from 178th to 184th Streets.
*The IRT Flushing Line would be extended from Main Street to Bell Boulevard, as a two-track and a four-track line, along Roosevelt Avenue. The line would be constructed in a tunnel, embankment, and an open cut, costing $12.07 million. An additional extension would be constructed to College Point, running along 149th Street and 11th Avenue as an elevated line from Roosevelt Avenue to 122nd Street, costing $14.1 million.
*Subway service would be extended eastward along Hillside Avenue to Little Neck Parkway. The line would be an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line as a four-track line to 212th Street, and then as a 2-track line to its terminus at Little Neck Parkway. The segment to 184th Street was to have cost $3.455 million, while the segment to 212th Street was to have cost $16.355 million.
*The provision at Van Wyck Boulevard for a future line would be completed, and a new two-track line would be built to Rockaway Boulevard.
*The IND Fulton Street Line would get an eastward extension; it would first be extended to 106th Street as a four-track line, where it would connect to the IND Rockaway Line. Afterwards, the line would stretch along Linden Boulevard to 229th Street in Eastern Queens. The line was to go to a two-track terminal at 105th or 106th Streets, with intermediate stops at 75th or 76th Streets and at 84th or 85th Streets (both proposed local stops), as well as at Cross Bay Boulevard (a proposed express stop). In 1951, these relay tracks east of Euclid Avenue were still planned to go as far as 105th Street, with a connection to the IND Rockaway Line east of Cross Bay Boulevard. In May 2004, this idea resurfaced, with an attached track map drawn up. If the line were ever built, Pitkin Avenue would have been routed to the east rather than to the southeast at 80th Street, and Linden Boulevard between Conduit and Rockaway Boulevards would have been built to facilitate the line.
*A new IND line would run from the Lower East Side to Avenue U in Brooklyn, with a possible extension to Floyd Bennett Field. The new line would run via Houston Street and Essex Street in Manhattan, and via Utica Avenue and Flatbush Avenue.
*Service on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line would be extended down Nostrand Avenue to Voorhies Avenue in Sheepshead Bay as a two-track line. The extension would be constructed as a subway until Avenue T, where it would emerge as an elevated line to Voorhies Avenue. It would have cost $22.7 million.
*The IND would be extended to South Brooklyn with a connection at Cortelyou Road between its South Brooklyn Line and the BMT&#x27;s Culver Line. This was the only completed Brooklyn proposal.
*Dyker Heights would get service with the construction of a branch of the BMT Culver Line via 37th Street, Fort Hamilton Parkway and 10th Avenue to 86th Street. In the vicinity of Fort Hamilton Parkway, a connection would be constructed between the BMT West End Line and the IND South Brooklyn Line. Extension work was approved sometime before 1940, and plans were drawn up.
*A connection between the BMT Franklin Avenue Line and the IND Crosstown Line would be built through the construction of a line under Lafayette Avenue.
*Subway service would be provided to Staten Island for the first time, with the construction of a tunnel under the Narrows connecting at 68th Street to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and with the Staten Island Railway at New Brighton and Tompkinsville.

The IND Concourse Line got funding to be extended eastward past 205th Street, but Bronx residents wanted to rehabilitate the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway right-of way. This funding was reallocated, and the old NYW&amp;B line became the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in December 1941, and the IND Concourse Line extension was not brought up again until 1968.

===1940s: Smaller plans===
In 1942, Mayor Benjamin F. Barnes of Yonkers proposed that the Getty Square Branch of the New York Central&#x27;s Putnam Division be acquired for an extension of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from Van Cortlandt Park. This service would replace the service operated by the New York Central, which was slated to be discontinued by the New York Central.

A rail link to LaGuardia Airport was proposed in 1943, when the city Board of Transportation proposed an extension of the BMT Astoria Line (currently served by the ) from its terminus at Ditmars Boulevard. The line would have run along Ditmars Boulevard, and would have cost $10.5 million.

In 1946, the Board of Transportation issued a $1billion plan that would extend the subway to the farthest reaches of the outer boroughs.
* A branch of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line at 59th Street under the Narrows to Saint Nicholas Street and Grent Street in Staten Island.
* A branch of the IND Fulton Street Line running via Utica Avenue to Avenue U.
* An extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line from Flatbush Avenue to Voohries Avenue.
* A line branching off of the IND Crosstown Line running via Franklin Avenue connecting with the BMT Brighton Line. This would have replaced the BMT Franklin Avenue Line.
* The extension of the IND Fulton Street Line to Euclid Avenue would continue to be built, and would be extended to 229th Street and Linden Boulevard.
* The completion of the Culver Ramp, connecting the IND Culver Line with the BMT Culver Line.
* A branch of the IND Culver Line running via Tenth Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway to 86th Street, with a connection to the BMT West End Line. West End service would run via the Culver Line and would alleviate congestion at DeKalb Avenue Junction. In order to provide access to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, the Culver Shuttle would be extended to 36th Street.
Even though the Board of Transportation did not approve these ideas, they were still proposed.
* A line branching off of the IND Eighth Avenue Line running via Worth Street and East Broadway and running under the East River to Driggs Avenue.
* A new trunk line built along Second Avenue with a connection at Court Street to the IND Fulton Street Line.
* Lines in Queens to the Rockaways, LaGuardia Airport, Idlewild Airport (now called JFK Airport), College Point, Bayside, Little Neck, Douglaston, Saint Albans and Bellerose.

In 1949, the Board of Transportation issued a $504 million plan to increase capacity on several subway lines through the construction of a new trunk line under Second Avenue.
* The rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue that would remove the bottleneck and increase capacity by 18 tph.
*IND Sixth Avenue Line express tracks between West Fourth Street and 34th Street.
*A new subway line under 57th Street connecting the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the proposed Second Avenue trunk line.
*A four-track Second Avenue Subway would originate from a connection to the IRT Pelham Line at 138th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. The connection to the Pelham Line would allow for eight additional trains per hour operating between Manhattan and the Pelham Line. It would then be possible to operate 10-car trains via the line and it would also be possible to operate full express service via the line&#x27;s center express track. The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.
*The IRT Pelham Line would be rebuilt to accommodate the wider BMT-IND cars to operate via the Second Avenue Line. The connection would provide the Pelham Line with direct service to Sixth Avenue, Second Avenue and Brooklyn. The station platforms, and third rail would have had to be adjusted as they were put in place for the narrower IRT trains. The line was built with this conversion in mind, however. Westchester Yard would have been expanded to accommodate the additional trains added to the line. Since trains to the Pelham Line would no longer use the Lexington Avenue Line, there would be additional capacity for trains to run via the IRT White Plains Road Line and the IRT Jerome Avenue Line. Improved service on the Pelham Line was projected to stimulate growth in the areas of the East Bronx served by the line. The East Bronx was seen to have great potential for industrial growth and other areas suitable for development as residential and recreational areas.
*An improved connection between the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road Line would be built using the tunnel under the Harlem River used by the IRT Pelham Line, and would allow for the full use of the capacity on the White Plains Road Line and the Jerome Avenue Line. Eight additional trains per hour would be added to the White Plains Road Line and fourteen additional trains per hour would be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue Line would make use of the third track for express service.
*The Second Avenue Line trunk would be extended to 149th Street to allow for a transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated. This would permit the demolition of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street, which was seen as uneconomical to operate, ugly and a hindrance of the avenue below it.
*Connection of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to the IRT White Plains Road Line. The direct service was predicted to stimulate growth along its route.
*Connections would be made to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. The Sixth Avenue Line would also be connected to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. The connection between the Nassau Street Line and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks would be eliminated. This would allow for thirty additional trains to operate between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.
*The lengthening of platforms on the BMT lines in Brooklyn would increase capacity and would allow 10-car trains from Second Avenue to run over any section of the BMT and IND.
*Increase in capacity on the BMT Brighton Line, BMT Sea Beach Line, BMT West End Line, and the BMT Fourth Avenue Line by 8 tph in total by adding a connection from the BMT Culver Line to the IND Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue. The additional capacity would result from the fact that trains operating via the former BMT Culver Line would not run through DeKalb Avenue Junction.
* A connection between the IND Queens Boulevard Line at Queens Plaza to the BMT 60th Street Tunnel that would increase capacity between Queens and Manhattan by 20 tph. This connection would permit the full use of the capacity of the Queens Boulevard local tracks.
* The construction of a ramp connecting the IND Fulton Street Line with the Fulton Street Elevated on Liberty Avenue. Six stations on the elevated would have their platforms extended to accommodate 10-car trains. This would make possible the demolition of the BMT Fulton Street Line between Grant Avenue and Rockaway Avenue and the demolition of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line.

===1950–1951===
On June 21, 1950, a plan was created by the Board of Transportation and sent to Mayor O&#x27;Dwyer concerning rapid transit expansions in Queens. The total cost of the plan would have been $134.5 million. Many things were planned:
*The rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue that would increase capacity by 18 tph.
*IND Sixth Avenue Line express tracks
*A four-track Second Avenue Subway between 149th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan.
*Connections would be made to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. The Sixth Avenue Line would also be connected to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges.
*The Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) would be acquired by the City and an embankment would be created with two bridges for the right-of-way over Jamaica Bay. To provide a connection to the rest of the subway system, a track connection would be built to the IND Fulton Street Line.
*The Rockaway Beach Branch would run alongside the LIRR main line tracks as a super-express bypass. Once in Woodside, the line would go underground running under Sunnyside Yards and Long Island City to the East River. It would then go under the East River and 76th Street in Manhattan to the Second Avenue Line.
*The bypass would also have a connection to the LIRR&#x27;s Port Washington Branch with subway service running to Bayside.
**Connections to the IRT Pelham Line at Third Avenue–138th Street and to the IRT White Plains Road Line at Third Avenue–149th Street.

On September 13, 1951, the Board of Estimate approved a plan put forth by the New York Board of Transportation that would cost $500 million. Many things were planned:
*A six-track Second Avenue Subway between 149th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. This line would handle 68 trains per hour (tph) (34 tph on the express tracks and 34 tph on the local tracks).
**The line would have a track connection to the IRT Pelham Line at Third Avenue–138th Street and there would be a branch terminating at Third Avenue–149th Street to permit a transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated in the Bronx. This would allow for the elimination of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street.
**A tunnel to the IND Sixth Avenue Line via 57th Street.
**A super-express bypass line to the LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch with a new tunnel under the East River.
*** A connection from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the Rockaway Beach Branch and IND Rockaway Line.
*Various Bronx IRT projects:
**Increase in capacity on the IRT Pelham Line.
**Connection of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to the IRT White Plains Road Line.
**Increase in capacity on the IRT White Plains Road Line north of Gun Hill Road by 8 trains per hour. (At the time, the IRT Third Avenue Line still connected to the IRT White Plains Road Line at Gun Hill Road.)
**Increase in capacity on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line by 9 trains per hour.
*The Chrystie Street Connection:
**IND Sixth Avenue Line express tracks.
**DeKalb Avenue rebuilding, including closure of the Myrtle Avenue station. This would increase capacity by 18 tph.
***Increase in capacity on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line&#x27;s local tracks by 4 tph.
***Increase in capacity on the BMT Sea Beach Line by 9 tph.
***Increase in capacity on the BMT West End Line by 5 tph.
**Connection of the IND Second Avenue and IND Sixth Avenue Lines to the BMT Jamaica Line and to the Manhattan Bridge.
*Increase in capacity on the BMT Brighton Line by 8 tph by adding a connection from the BMT Culver Line to the IND Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue.
*60th Street Tunnel Connection.
*Extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line to Voorhies Avenue.
*Construction of the IRT Utica Avenue Line from Crown Heights–Utica Avenue to Kings Plaza.
The Board of Estimate requested that the Board of Transportation evaluate a spur of the IRT Pelham Line to Throggs Neck in the Bronx.

===1954===
The Board of Estimate accepted the following items into its 1954 budget from the New York City Transit Authority:
* The elimination of the DeKalb Avenue bottleneck on the BMT.
* The construction of the Nostrand Avenue extension to Avenue U. It would have cost $51.7 million.
* The extension of the IND Fulton Street Line to the BMT Liberty Avenue Elevated.
* A start on the Second Avenue Subway in Chrystie Street.
* Adding express tracks to the IND Sixth Avenue Line.

In March 1954, the Transit Authority issued a $658 million construction program including the following projects:
* A Second Avenue trunk line, which would have allowed 34 more trains to midtown per hour.
* A tunnel at 76th Street that would connect to the Second Avenue Line that would run under the East River and connect with the existing Long Island Rail Road main line.
* An increase of service on the IRT White Plains Road Line by eight trains per hour due to the construction of the Second Avenue Line.
* The connection of the IRT White Plains Road Line and the IRT Dyre Avenue Line was nearing completion and would provide direct service to Manhattan and Brooklyn.
* Fourteen additional trains per hour would be able to operate on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line if the IRT Pelham Line was connected to the Second Avenue Subway. Service would have been tripled on the Pelham Line.
* The completion of the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, which was under construction, would increase service to Jamaica by fifteen trains per hour.
* The addition of two tracks to the IND Sixth Avenue Line would allow express service.
* The elimination of the DeKalb Avenue bottleneck on the BMT, which would allow eighteen more trains to be operated per hour.
* The construction of the Nostrand Avenue extension to Avenue U.
* The construction of the Chrystie Street Connection.
* The connection of the IND South Brooklyn Line and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue would be opened in the spring, and would have allowed eight more trains to run per hour on the BMT Brighton Line.
* Bottlenecks would be removed at Grand Central on the IRT East Side Line and at 96th Street on the IRT West Side Line.
In 1954, Regional Plan Association advocated for an extension of the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40 million. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn&#x27;t would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission would do the construction.

===1961===
John T. Clancy, a Democratic incumbent running for Queens Borough President in 1961 proposed third tracking the BMT Jamaica Elevated Line to provide express service, and reactivating the Rockaway Beach Branch from Rego Park to Liberty Avenue.

===1962–1963===
In July 1962, the NYCTA announced that it had asked the city for money to build a $190 million high-speed, non-stop subway line from Midtown to the Bronx. The line would have only operated during rush hours. It was estimated that if the funds were given to the project, it would be completed in 1970. The line would be a two-track line running from 59th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues to the Bronx, running under Central Park. Running non-stop for 6.5 miles, it would have been the longest continuous run in the subway system. The line, on its southern end, would connect to the BMT Broadway Line at Seventh Avenue near 59th Street and to the IND Sixth Avenue Line near 58th Street and Sixth Avenue.

The line would then run through a deep tunnel under Central Park until 110th Street. There would be provisions for a future crosstown line under 76th Street to Queens. The line would then turn east and run along Madison Avenue to 138th Street. One branch would connect to the express track of the IRT Pelham Line, which would be converted to accommodate larger B Division trains. In the morning rush hour, trains from Pelham Park would only make express stops. A new stop would be built at 138th Street and Grand Concourse where transfers would have been available to the IRT White Plains Road and IRT Jerome Avenue Line trains.

The second branch would continue under the Grand Concourse until 161st Street where it would connect to the IND Concourse Line at 161st Street. This connection would allow for the diversion of Concourse Line express trains onto the new line, allowing for the addition of an equal number of trains to the IND Central Park West express service and provide relief to that line. The construction of this line was viewed as necessary to relieve the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.

In February 1963, the New York City Transit Authority issued a preliminary proposal for rapid transit expansion in the borough of Queens. The plan was designed to relieve congestion on the IRT Flushing Line and IND Queens Boulevard, to deal with expected population growth, and to provide service to areas of the borough without transit service. To expand service to other areas of the borough a new trunk line would be built to provide the necessary capacity. The planned extensions were expected to relieve crowding on the IRT Flushing Line by 22 percent and on the IND Queens Boulevard Line by 19 percent.

The first phase of the transit expansion would build a trunk line connecting the IND Queens Boulevard Line&#x27;s local tracks at Steinway Street and Broadway using existing provisions with the IND Sixth Avenue Line and BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan. The new line would have run under 34th Avenue, a new tunnel under the East River, and 76th Street before turning south under Central Park. Connections would be made to the IND Sixth Avenue Line at 58th Street and to the BMT Broadway Line&#x27;s stub tracks at 59th Street and Seventh Avenue. In Manhattan, there would have been a transfer connection to the 77th Street station on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and a station in Central Park at 70th Street.

Provisions would be built for a planned extension to the Bronx. At Steinway Street, switches would be constructed to all GG trains from Brooklyn to terminate there. The new line would have provided an additional 30 trains per hour between Queens and Manhattan with a future northern extension. Initially, the line would be used for 15 trains per hour running to the IND Sixth Avenue Line from the IND Queens Boulevard Line. The construction of the trunk line was expected to cost $138.6 million, of which $37.4 million would be spent for the section south of 76th Street. The earliest possible date for the completion of the line would have been 1970.

To provide service to unserved areas of Queens, three additional routes were considered. The first route would have served northern and northeastern Queens, running along 34th Avenue, Northern Bouelvard, Main Street, Kissena Boulevard, Parsons Boulevard, and one of the Horace Harding Expressway service roads to Springfield Boulevard. The -line would have consisted of two tracks and would have cost $219.4 million. The second route would be a branch of the IND Fulton Street Line heading under Linden Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard to Springield Boulevard.

Two options were considered for this line. The first option would have branched off of the Fulton Street Line near Pitkin Avenue and Euclid Avenue using existing provisions in the tunnel. The second option would have extended the Liberty Avenue Elevated from Lefferts Boulevard. This option would have required the acquisition of private property to widen Liberty Avenue so that the line could transition from an elevated line to a subway line and to make the turn from Liberty Avenue and Linden Boulevard. The subway option would have been long and would have cost $116 million while the elevated/subway option would have been and would have cost $80.8 million.

The third route would have connected the IND Rockaway Line to the IND Queens Boulevard Line using the Rockaway Beach Branch and an existing provision in the tunnel east of 63rd Drive. The Rockaway Beach Line had been abandoned by the Long Island Rail Road on June 8, 1962. A new stop would be built at Linden Boulevard to connect with a new subway line. This line was expected to cost $39.9 million.

In addition to expanding service to Queens, service to the Bronx would have been expanded as well. The new trunk line connecting the BMT Broadway Line and IND Sixth Avenue Line to Queens south of 76th Street would have been used for the new line to the Bronx. This line would have run under the center of Central Park and then running via Fifth Avenue once out of the park at 110th Street, and would continue under the East River with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which would have been modified in order to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch continuing up the Grand Concourse and then connecting to the IND Concourse Line.

In May 1963, the New York City Planning Commission proposed the following in response to the NYCTA&#x27;s proposal:
* An implementation of skip-stop service on the BMT Jamaica Line.
* An extension of a proposed Madison Avenue Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which would have had to be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA&#x27;s proposed routes.

* A two-track Madison Avenue Line would have run from the proposed 59th Street tunnel via Madison Avenue and would have tied into the then-underutilized BMT Broadway Line in the vicinity of Madison Square.
* In the vicinity of City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan, a connection between the BMT Nassau Street and Broadway Lines would have carried the Madison Avenue service through the financial district at Wall Street and Broad Street. Another connection in Lower Manhattan would have been built connecting the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line in the area of the former Hudson Terminal (today&#x27;s World Trade Center).

===1968===

====Proposed lines====
Similar plans were made by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. They included:
* The IND Second Avenue Line with connections to IRT Dyre Avenue Line at East 180th Street, and the IRT Pelham Line at Whitlock Avenue
* A crosstown line under 34th Street from 12th Avenue to 1st Avenue
* IND/BMT 63rd Street Line
* A new line running along Park Avenue in the Bronx to replace the Third Avenue Elevated
* Super-express bypass of IND Queens Boulevard Line
* New line splitting from the IND Queens Boulevard Line under the Long Island Expressway to Kissena Boulevard in Phase I and to Springfield Boulevard in Phase II
* Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard branching off of the BMT Jamaica Line at 127th Street and off of the Queens Boulevard Line at bellmouths railroad north of the Van Wyck Boulevard station.
* IRT Nostrand Avenue Line extension to Avenue W in Sheepshead Bay. This was by then the fifth time that the Nostrand Avenue extension was proposed.
* A new line branching off of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and running under Utica Avenue to Avenue U
* Extension of the BMT Canarsie Line to Nostrand Avenue or JFK Airport
* Extension of the IRT New Lots Line to Linwood Street and Flatlands Avenue
* Extension of the IND Concourse Line to White Plains Road

====Completed lines====
The Archer Avenue Lines are two lines, split between the BMT and IND, mostly running under Archer Avenue in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. Conceived as part of these 1968 expansion plans, they opened on December 11, 1988. There are stub-end tunnels east of the line&#x27;s northern terminus, Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer, on both levels, which extend past the station for possible future extensions.

The 63rd Street Lines are two lines also split between the BMT and IND. The short BMT line connects the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line from 57th Street–Seventh Avenue to Lexington Avenue–63rd Street, where it now runs through to the Second Avenue subway. The IND line runs from the IND Sixth Avenue Line at 57th Street in Manhattan east under 63rd Street and the East River through the 63rd Street Tunnel to the IND Queens Boulevard Line in Queens. There is a stub-end tunnel at the northern terminus of the IND line that is intended for the Queens super-express bypass.

===1970s===
In Lower Manhattan, plans were made for the following:

*A new terminal for IRT Seventh Avenue locals to South Ferry
*A track connection between the Hudson Terminal (now World Trade Center) on the IND Eighth Avenue Line and Cortlandt Street on the BMT Broadway Line, both in Manhattan.
**RR trains would be discontinued south of City Hall, as the station would permanently become a terminal. The City Hall station is located one block east of Hudson Terminal. The segment between City Hall in Manhattan and Bay Ridge–95th Street would be replaced by two other services.
**B Sixth Avenue express trains would be rerouted to the Eighth Avenue Lines, replacing the AA and CC Eighth Avenue locals. B trains would run south through the connection and continue through the Montague Street Tunnel and BMT Fourth Avenue Line, thereby replacing the RR between Cortlandt Street in Manhattan and 59th Street in Brooklyn.
**JJ trains would operate via the Montague Street Tunnel and Fourth Avenue line, with an extension to Bay Ridge–95th Street.
*A Second Avenue Subway would operate along Second Avenue in Manhattan, connecting New Jersey with both Queens and the Bronx.
**T and Y would run the entire length of the Second Avenue line from New Jersey, then run toward Queens and the Bronx respectively.
**EE trains would be rerouted onto the southernmost section of the subway into New Jersey via the BMT Broadway express tracks, which turn eastward toward the Manhattan Bridge. The EE would then diverge southward, merging with the Second Avenue main line.

===1986===
In 1986, the Regional Plan Association suggested extending the IRT Flushing Line across the Hudson River to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

In 1986, the MTA issued a study on expanding transit options on the west side of Manhattan. It was proposed to use the West Side Line viaduct (today&#x27;s High Line), and various means of transportation were proposed, including monorail, passenger rail trains, or subway trains. It also proposed to extend the IRT Flushing or BMT Canarsie Lines ( and , respectively).

===1990===
In 1990, the MTA proposed a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. The line would have operated over the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. There would be stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica. The system was proposed to cost $2billion. The MTA estimated that the rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, and the frequency of service would initially be every 15minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, as well as at least two trains heading in each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would have been about 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT Flushing Line would be 47minutes.

===1998–99===

In 1998, an extension of the BMT Astoria Line to LaGuardia Airport was planned, but the plan was canceled in 2003 following community opposition.

In 1999, the Regional Plan Association considered a full-length Second Avenue Subway from Broad Street to 125th Street, along with the LIRR East Side Access. It also planned the following extensions:

*a Co-op City extension of the Second Avenue Subway via the Amtrak right-of-way through the northeast Bronx
*a Grand Central Terminal spur of the Second Avenue Subway
*a super-express bypass from the Atlantic Terminal via the LIRR Atlantic Branch
*an extension to JFK Airport via the Van Wyck Expressway
*an extension to Laurelton via the LIRR Atlantic Branch
*a branch off the Second Avenue Subway at 14th Street to Avenue C, to merge with the IND Sixth Avenue Line at Essex Street
*a connection to the BMT Nassau Street Line near Delancey Street
*a super-express bypass of the Queens Boulevard Line from east of 21st Street–Queensbridge to east of Forest Hills–71st Avenue
*a new interlocking at Prince Street to allow easy switching of trains between local and express tracks

The new set of extensions proposed by the RPA, dubbed &quot;MetroLink&quot;, would make use of existing commuter rail infrastructure, so as to make it interoperable with the New York City Subway. Nine hundred fifty &quot;Rx&quot; hybrid railcars would be ordered, with yard expansions and new yards being built. MetroLink, consisting of 31 new metro stations (not counting three recycled commuter rail stations) and 19 new route‑miles of track () (not including existing commuter rail and then-under construction AirTrain JFK route miles) would have reduced the load on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Two of these stations would be in Brooklyn, three in Queens, nine in the Bronx, and twenty in Manhattan. Five services would be run:

#The Co-op City–Second Avenue–Broadway–Whitehall Street service
#The 125th Street–Second Avenue–Atlantic Terminal Bypass–Jamaica Center service
#The Grand Central–Second Avenue–Atlantic Terminal Bypass–JFK Airport service
#The Grand Central–Second Avenue–Fourth Avenue–West End Line to Coney Island service
#The Laurelton–Jamaica Center–Queens Bypass–Second Avenue–Lower East Side–Culver Express to Avenue X service

Stations would have been located at:
* New Second Avenue Subway (15 stations):
** Lexington Avenue at 125th Street (transfer with )
** Grand Central Terminal (transfer with )
** Second Avenue at 116th, 106th, 96th, 86th, 72nd, 55th (transfer with ), 44th, 34th, 23rd, 14th (transfer with ), and Houston Streets
** Bowery/Canal Street
** Water Street at Wall/Fulton Streets and at Whitehall/Broad Streets
* New Lower East Side Line (4 stations):
** First Avenue at 14th Street (transfer with )
** Avenue C at 8th Street and at Houston Street
** East Broadway at Pitt Street
* New Co-op City Line (9 stations):
** Co-op City North, Central, and South stations
** Bronx Municipal Hospital Center
** East Tremont Avenue at White Plains Road and at West Farms Square (transfer with at the latter)
** Boston Road at 169th Street
** Third Avenue at 161st and 149th Street (transfer with at the latter)
* Atlantic Branch (5 stations):
** Jay Street–MetroTech (transfer with )
** Atlantic Terminal (transfer with )
** Linden Boulevard
** Locust Manor
** Laurelton

The AirTrain JFK, Atlantic Branch, Main Line ROW, and Northeast Corridor would all be &quot;recycled&quot; to accommodate subway service under this plan. The Nostrand Avenue and East New York LIRR stations would also have been closed under MetroLink.

==21st-century expansion==

The New York City Subway has opened five subway stations since 2009, and up to 15 more subway stations are planned. However, the 21st-century expansion plans pale in comparison to some of the subway system&#x27;s other previous plans.

===Current or completed plans===

====7 Subway Extension====

The 7 Subway Extension was devised in the late 1990s to extend the IRT Flushing Line, which carries the local and express services, further westward into Manhattan. The extension stretches a total of from its former terminus at Times Square to a new western terminus at 34th Street and 11th Avenue. The tunnels are actually long. A second station at 10th Avenue–41st Street was dropped from the plans in October 2007, but could be restored if funding can be found. The extension&#x27;s opening had been delayed to June 2014, with the rest of the 34th Street station to open at the end of 2015.

Michael Horodniceanu, chief of MTA Construction Company, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that complications in the installation of the inclined elevator would likely cause a further delay of about three months, bringing the opening date to very late summer or early fall of 2014. Further complications in February 2014 brought the projected date of the opening to November 2014, then to February 2015, then spring 2015, and to summer 2015. The station opened in September 2015.

As proposed under the RPA&#x27;s Fourth Regional Plan, a second 7 Subway Extension would be built, serving 23rd Street before connecting with the existing 14th Street/Eighth Avenue station.

====Second Avenue Subway====

The Second Avenue Subway was repeatedly delayed and shaved back from a six-track combined local/express line to a two-track superexpress line since 1919 (with occasional construction between 1972 and 1976). Construction of the Second Avenue Subway began in 2007. A tunnelling contract was awarded to the consortium of Schiavone/Shea/Skanska (S3) by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) on March 20, 2007. This followed preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design completed by a joint venture between AECOM and Arup. Parsons Brinckerhoff is the Construction Manager of the project. This contract, and the full funding grant agreement with the Federal Transit Administration, which was received in November 2007, is for Phase I of the project, a new line between the existing 63rd Street Line and 96th Street and Second Avenue. The total cost of the line is expected to top $17billion.

A ceremonial ground-breaking for the Second Avenue Subway was held in April 2007. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) began digging the tunnels for Phase I in May 2010 and completed its excavations in September 2011. Phase I, consisting of of tunnel and three stations, was opened in January 2017. It cost $4.45 billion. A , $6 billion second phase is in planning; land acquisition for Phase 2 started in April 2022. , Phase 2 was set to open in early 2032.

The RPA&#x27;s Fourth Regional Plan proposed two northward extensions. Phase 2B would be an extension of Phase 2 under 125th Street from Lexington Avenue to Broadway. Phase 2C would be a spur to Third Avenue–149th Street, connecting with the IND Concourse Line.

===Proposals===
====Triboro RX====

A proposal for the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch would have the New York City Subway use the tracks to link Brooklyn, Queens (both already linked by the G train) and the Bronx via the Hell Gate Bridge. Based on Paris&#x27;s RER commuter rail system, the Triboro RX proposal would create a partial loop around the city. In 1996, the Regional Plan Association conducted a study to determine the feasibility of the rail link. The original proposal would have terminated at Yankee Stadium. The proposed line, discussion of which was revived in 2012, would connect to all non-shuttle subway services at 12 stations. 

The line in this proposal would have terminated at Hunts Point. The line was brought back in the 2015 report &quot;The Overlooked Boroughs&quot; by the Regional Plan Association. The line would be long and would consist of 22stations, would cost $1billion and is projected to have more than 100,000 daily riders. Plans for the line date back to 1995.

Obstacles for the proposal include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, the lack of electrification on the line, as well as the single-tracking in some parts of the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hell Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA&#x27;s 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, as well as in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.

====Interborough Express====

In mid-October 2019, the MTA announced that it would study the feasibility of restoring passenger service on the Bay Ridge Branch portion of the route. In early January 2022, as part of her State of the State address New York governor Kathy Hochul announced that the state would move forward with the Bay Ridge Branch Line by conducting an environmental study on the Interborough Express (IBX), a corridor using the existing Bay Ridge Branch and Fremont Secondary from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to Jackson Heights, Queens. End-to-end travel times are expected to be less than 40 minutes, and weekday ridership is projected to be 115,000. The route would connect up to 17 subway lines and the Long Island Rail Road. The MTA indicated in September 2022 that it wanted to construct the IBX as a light rail line, and Hochul announced in January 2023 that the project would proceed as a light rail corridor.

====Rockaway Line====
The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) abandoned the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962; ever since it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line has not been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the homeowners who live along the right-of-way. One group, QueensLink, wants the line to be reactivated between the 63rd Drive–Rego Park station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the north and the IND Rockaway Line to the south, providing a north-south connection in Queens. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired by the success of the High Line in Manhattan. A third group consists of homeowners who would have nothing done, keeping the line as is.

Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented &quot;The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can&#x27;t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation.&quot; Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said people who live in the Rockaways, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates Resorts World casino and have been asked to construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch&#x27;s route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. U.S. Representatives Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.

The line would cost $1 billion, if built in its full length with a connection to the IND Queens Boulevard Line, and would stretch across , providing connections to several subway services as well as the LIRR. Another possible option would have Long Island Rail Road service restored with service to seven stations along the right-of-way, with service ending in Howard Beach. The line would serve upwards of 250,000 passengers per day and would provide access to JFK Airport from Midtown Manhattan. In February 2015, the Regional Plan Association suggested having some F trains, after running through the 63rd Street Tunnel, be rerouted to operate over the Lower Montauk Branch of the LIRR running through underserved Maspeth and Glendale and then meeting up with the Rockaway Beach Branch in Rego Park.

====LaGuardia Airport extension====
The BMT Astoria Line extension to LaGuardia Airport was suggested as part of LaGuardia&#x27;s long-range expansion/renovation plan. Currently, no New York City Subway routes service the airport directly, but provisions for a subway connection are part of a 2014 long range rebuilding plan by the MTA. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot;″ editorial board came out in support of this extension on February 21, 2017, detailing why this route is superior to Governor Andrew Cuomo’s plan for an AirTrain from LaGuardia to Willets Point. 

==== Utica Avenue and Nostrand Avenue Lines ====
In April 2015, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new plan for building a subway line under Utica Avenue in Brooklyn. Previous plans, most recently the Program for Action, had provisions for such a line. It would branch off from the IRT Eastern Parkway Line () at Crown Heights–Utica Avenue. The new line being proposed is part of de Blasio&#x27;s &quot;One New York&quot; plan, which aims to improve transit, reduce emissions, and fight poverty. If built, the line would go to Flatbush Avenue, near Kings Plaza. Since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had budget shortages , however, it is unclear how the line would be funded or built.

The MTA Board allocated $5 million for a feasibility study, the Utica Avenue Subway Extension Study, for this proposal in the MTA&#x27;s 2015–2019 Capital Program. In August 2016, it was reported that the MTA was looking into an extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line along Flatbush Avenue to Marine Park, which would allow trains to serve Kings Plaza. Both the Utica Avenue and Nostrand Avenue proposals for extensions to Kings Plaza have been proposed since the 1910s. Planning on the Utica Avenue Line stalled because it was no longer viewed as a priority by the MTA. Planning resumed in April 2019 when New York City Transit joined city agencies in launching the Utica Avenue Transit Improvement Study. The study will look into a subway extension, improved bus rapid transit, and a new light rail line. Since the study occurred concurrently with the 2020 redesign of Brooklyn bus routes, the MTA decided to prioritize the Utica Avenue transit study.

In November 2017, the RPA suggested building both lines as part of its fourth plan. The Nostrand Line was envisioned as a three-stop extension to Avenue Z, while the Utica Line was planned as a five-stop spur to Kings Plaza.

====RPA plans====
The Regional Plan Association (RPA) released its fourth Regional Plan in November 2017, twenty-one years after its previous Regional Plan had been published. The fourth plan included several lists of suggestions on how to improve the city&#x27;s transit system, of which subway expansion was a major component. Under the RPA&#x27;s plan, the Second Avenue Subway would be completed to its full length within Manhattan and then extended to the Bronx. The 7 Subway Extension would expand in scope, with the IRT Flushing Line being extended to 14th Street and Eighth Avenue.

Both the Utica Avenue and Nostrand Avenue Lines in Brooklyn would be realized. Queens would see three subway expansions, including two new Queens lines: one along Northern Boulevard to Flushing or College Point and one along Jewel Avenue to Alley Pond Park. A one-stop extension of the Astoria Line would be built to serve western Astoria. Ultimately, the plan included eight extensions with at least 40 stations in total.

====Subway station in Red Hook====
In January 2018, Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the MTA to conduct a study on the feasibility of building a subway station in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in order to redevelop the area. If approved, the station would likely be built as part of an extension of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line past South Ferry in Lower Manhattan with a station at Governors Island possible, but unlikely due to cost and benefit.

, a potential extension of the BMT Broadway Line to Red Hook (to be served by the W train) is being evaluated as part of the MTA&#x27;s 2025–2044 20-Year Needs Assessment.

====Other proposals====
, a potential extension of the IRT New Lots Line (to be served by the 3 train) to Spring Creek, Brooklyn, is being evaluated as part of the 2025–2044 20-Year Needs Assessment.

As part of the 2025–2044 20-Year Needs Assessment, the MTA is also evaluating the possibility of extending the Second Avenue Subway westward under 125th Street following the completion of Phase 2. The line might be extended westward to Broadway and 125th Street, connecting with the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line&#x27;s 125th Street station; to Broadway and 137th Street, connecting with the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line&#x27;s 137th Street–City College station; to Riverside Drive and 137th Street; or to St. Nicholas Avenue and 135th Street, merging with the IND Eighth Avenue Line.

===Discontinued plans===

====PATH-Lexington Avenue connection====
After the PATH&#x27;s World Trade Center station was destroyed during the September 11 attacks, there was a proposal to connect the PATH and the New York City Subway. Whereas the original World Trade Center station consisted of five north-south balloon loops that sent eastward trains back west to New Jersey, the rebuilt PATH station would have been built in an east–west alignment. The tracks would have extended eastward by to the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station on the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Lexington Avenue Line. The benefits of this connection, called PATH-Lex by its supporters, would have consisted of a one-seat ride from Newark and Jersey City through Lower Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and the Bronx. While the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was interested in the plan, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey dismissed the idea altogether, due to the complexity of connecting the two separate systems.

<text>Cao Zhang () (189? – 1 August 223), courtesy name Ziwen, nickname &quot;The Yellow Goatee&quot; (黃鬚兒), was a prince of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was a son of Cao Cao, a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation of Wei. Cao Zhang was said to have wrestled and killed wild animals with his bare hands. He also served as a general under his father, having led his troops to significant victories against Wuhuan incursions on the northern frontier.

==Background==
The second of Cao Cao&#x27;s four sons by Lady Bian, Cao Zhang was said to excel and obsessed in archery and armed combat in his youth so much so that he would fight fierce beasts with his bare hands. Though Cao Cao criticised his lack of academic knowledge, Cao Zhang had always aspired to pursue a career in the military. Once, his father sent him to the imperial university to study, but Cao Zhang lamented to his aides, saying a real man should command the army to make a name for himself instead of becoming a Academician (博士; &quot;boshi&quot;).

==As a general==
When the Wuhuan tribe rebelled on the northern frontier in May 218, Cao Zhang, holding the rank of Northern General of the Household, acting on the authority of General of the Resolute Cavalry (驍騎將軍), led a force of 1,000 infantry and several hundreds of cavalry from the central government to suppress the revolt. Before his departure, Cao Cao summoned him and specially warned him: &quot;We are father and son at home, but we are supervisor and subordinate when assigned a task: the law will be applied straightly if you ever made any mistake. Keep this in mind.&quot; When Cao Zhang arrived at the battlefield, his force had not been joined by that of the local government as planned. Outnumbered by the enemy, Cao Zhang took up a passive stance and defended the vital passes and routes. The rebels could not gain an advantage and dissipated. Cao Zhang then led his force out in pursuit, displaying great valour in the ensuing battles. Cao Zhang personally fought against the enemy soldiers at close quarters and shot down many enemy horsemen with arrows. Several arrows were embedded in his armor by the end of a half-day long battle. Despite opposition from his subordinates, he ordered the pursuit be continued after the initial victory. One of his staff came out and reminded him that Cao Cao&#x27;s order was that the army could not cross the jurisdiction of Dai, and further pursuit was straightly prohibited, but Cao Zhang argued that a good general did not follow dull orders, and threatened if anyone did not join the pursuit would be penalised with death sentence; thus, they performed a 24-hour dash to catch up with the Wuhuan cavalry, and dealt the latter a major blow which caused a few thousands casualties. The Xianbei tribe leader Kebineng had led a 10,000-strong cavalry force nearby to observe the ongoing war between the Cao Wei and Wuhuan tribes. Having seen the splendid victories Cao Zhang scored, Kebineng submitted to him. Unrest on the northern frontier was then quelled.

Cao Zhang then hurried west to take part in the Hanzhong Campaign against Liu Bei. Upon reaching Chang&#x27;an, however, he found out that the war had already been lost. Cao Cao then promoted his son to General of the Elite Cavalry (越騎將軍) and left him to defend Chang&#x27;an against probable advances of Liu Bei.

According to unofficial supplementary records works by Wang Jia from the Eastern Jin dynasty, Cao Zhang once said that he had personally tamed a White elephant from Nanyue, which was sent through king Sun Quan of Eastern Wu. The act caused the audience to be amazed.

==Death==
Shortly after returning to Luoyang in 220, Cao Cao fell ill. He died in March, as Cao Zhang was en route to see him. His successor Cao Pi then sent all his brothers, including Cao Zhang, back to their individual fiefdoms, for fear that they might contest his position. In 222, Cao Zhang was enfeoffed as the Prince of Rencheng (任城王). In the following year, Cao Zhang died due to sickness while attending court at the capital, most likely poisoned to prevent any contenders to the stolen throne. He received the posthumous title &quot;Prince Wei&quot; (威王), literally meaning awe-inspiring prince.

===Legends===
There are ahistorical legends surrounding the death of Cao Zhang. The most famous of these legends is that Cao Zhang was poisoned by Cao Pi. The collection of anecdotes &quot;Shishuo Xinyu&quot; states that after Cao Cao died, Cao Pi summoned Cao Zhang to the palace to meet him. During a casual conversation, Cao Zhang asked his brother if he could see his imperial seal. This got Cao Pi worried that his brother wanted to usurp his throne so Cao Pi decided to kill him. Cao Pi knew that Cao Zhang was their mother&#x27;s favourite son, so in order to get away with it, he had to make Cao Zhang&#x27;s death seem natural. A few weeks later, Cao Pi invited his brother to a game of weiqi during their mother&#x27;s birthday. The match was very close in the middle game when Cao Pi&#x27;s servants brought some prunes, some that were poisoned. Cao Pi made sure he ate the unmarked ones that were not poisonous and make sure his brother ate the other ones. When Cao Zhang realised that he had been poisoned, he screamed for help. Empress Bian got to the scene on her bare feet and tried to search for water to flush down the poison that was now in Cao Zhang&#x27;s body. But unfortunately for Cao Zhang, the crafty Cao Pi had secretly placed all the containers away beforehand and so Empress Bian failed to get the water; Cao Zhang then died at the hands of his own brother. Professor Ye Jiaying pointed out several loopholes in the story.

==Family==
==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

&quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, a 14th-century historical novel, is a romanticisation of the events that occurred before and during the Three Kingdoms era. The author probably exaggerated the tension between Cao Zhang and his elder brother Cao Pi just after their father Cao Cao&#x27;s death.

Cao Pi, the eldest surviving son of Cao Cao and the rightful heir, succeeded his late father. However, news came that Cao Zhang, leading a 100,000-strong army from Chang&#x27;an, was approaching the capital. Cao Pi was gripped by fear that his brother would contest the heirship with the military power he held.

Jia Kui, an adviser to Cao Pi, then volunteered to persuade Cao Zhang to desist. Jia Kui then went out of the city to meet Cao Zhang and ask him if he came as a mourner or a rival claimant to the throne. &quot;I come as a mourner with no ulterior motive,&quot; replied Cao Zhang. &quot;That being so, why bring in your soldiers?&quot; Jia Kui said, whereupon Cao Zhang ordered his troops to wait outside the city while he entered alone. When the brothers met, they embraced and wept. Cao Zhang then passed the command of his force to Cao Pi and returned to his own fiefdom. Thus Cao Pi&#x27;s position was more or less secured.

<text>The national flag of Uruguay (), officially known as the National Pavilion (), is one of the three official flags of Uruguay along with the Artigas flag and the flag of the Treinta y Tres. It has a field of nine equal horizontal stripes alternating white and blue. The canton is white, charged with the Sun of May, from which 16 rays extend, alternating between triangular and wavy. The flag was first adopted by law on 18 December 1828, and had 19 alternating stripes of white and blue until 11 July 1830, when a new law reduced the number of alternating stripes to nine. The flag was designed by Joaquín Suárez.

==Symbolism and design==
The horizontal stripes on the flag represent the nine original departments of Uruguay, based on the U.S. flag, where the stripes represent the original 13 colonies. The first flag designed in 1828 had 9 light blue stripes; this number was reduced to 4 in 1830 due to visibility problems from distance. These stripes of blue and white were inspired by the flag of Argentina, making the flag of Uruguay part of both the Stars and Stripes and Belgrano flag families.

The golden Sun of May represents the May Revolution of 1810; the Sun of May is a figurative sun that represents Inti, the sun god and mythological founder of the Incan Empire. It also appears in the flag of Argentina and the coat of arms of Bolivia.

==Colors scheme==
The specific color hues of the flag are not officially defined by law. However, most representations use the following:
== Co-official flags ==
The National Pavilion shares its official status with two other flags, although it possesses a higher hierarchical position amongst them:

During the Great Siege of Montevideo (1843–1851) Uruguay had two parallel governments, with two different flags:
== Protocol ==
In accordance with Law No. 9,935 of June 14, 1940, in all public and private educational institutes &quot;the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag will be solemnly performed on June 19.&quot; Likewise, Article 28 of the Law No. 9,943, establishes that every natural or legal citizen of Uruguay must take an Pledge of Allegiance to the National Flag.

On June 19 of each year, the Promise of Allegiance to the Flag is taken for first-year primary school children and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag is taken for first-year secondary school children.

Public educational institutes that do not carry out the ceremony may be subject to administrative sanctions and private ones may be fined. The lack of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag carries sanctions such as the impossibility of issuing professional or technical titles, and access to work in the public service.

<doc id="459357" wikidata="Q483774" url="?curid=459357" title="Flag of Uzbekistan">
<text>The national flag of Uzbekistan, officially the State Flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan, consists of a horizontal triband of azure, white and green, separated by two thin red fimbriations, with a white crescent moon and twelve white stars at the canton. Adopted in 1991 to replace the flag of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, it has been the flag of the Republic of Uzbekistan since the country gained independence in that same year. The design of the present flag was partly inspired by the former one.

== Design ==

=== Symbolism ===
The azure colour on the flag is a symbol of the sky and of clear water. Azure is also the colour of the Turkic peoples. White is the traditional Uzbek symbol of peace and good luck. Green is a symbol of nature, new life, and good harvest. The red fimbriations represent the power of life.

The image of the crescent moon is connected with Uzbek historical imagery as well as being a symbol of the birth of a new nation. The stars represent spirituality and divinity, as well as an allusion to Uzbek historical tradition and calendar. The stars are also a symbol of the pursuit of perfection and happiness of Uzbek people in their homeland.

The government of Uzbekistan does not specify which hues should be used on its flag and instead generalizes them as azure, white, green, and red.

=== Legal protection ===
On 27 December 2010, President Islam Karimov signed an amendment to the law that strengthened the protection of the country&#x27;s symbols, including its flag and emblem. It banned the utilization of the flag of Uzbekistan for promotional and commercial purposes, including its usage in advertisements and documents. It also forbade any organizations that are not affiliated with the Uzbek government from adopting logos that resemble the national symbols.

=== Construction sheet ===
== History ==
Under Soviet rule, the Union Republic – situated in what is now modern-day Uzbekistan – utilised a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and representing Communism, that was approved in 1952. The flag is similar to the Soviet design but with the blue stripe in 1/5 width and the two 1/100 white edges in between.

Uzbekistan declared itself independent on 1 September 1991, approximately three months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A search for a national flag began soon after, with a contest being held to determine the new design. More than 200 submissions were made, and a commission was formed in order to evaluate these suggestions coming from a variety of stakeholders. The winning design was adopted on 18 November 1991, after being selected at an extraordinary session of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet. In doing so, Uzbekistan became the first of the newly independent republics in Central Asia to choose a new flag. Pertaining to its tricolour combination of horizontal stripes of blue, white and green colour, it is similar to the flags of Lesotho, an enclaved country within the border of South Africa, and Puntland, a Somali federal state at the tip of the Horn.

<text>The national flag of Vanuatu () was adopted on 18 February 1980.

In 1977 a flag of almost the same colours and symbolism as the future national flag was designed by local artist Kalontas Malon and adopted by the Vanua&#x27;aku Pati. When the party led the New Hebrides to independence as Vanuatu in 1980, the colours of the party flag (red, green, black and yellow) were chosen to be the basis for the national flag on Independence Day, 30 July 1980. A parliamentary committee chose the final design based on submissions from local artists.

==Symbolism==

The green represents the richness of the islands, the red symbolises blood which unites humanity as humans, and the black the ni-Vanuatu people. The Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Walter Lini, requested the inclusion of yellow and black fimbriations to make the black stand out. The yellow Y-shape (pall) represents the shape of Vanuatu islands on the map and the light of the gospel going through the pattern of the islands in the Pacific Ocean (approximately 83% of the people of Vanuatu profess Christianity).

The emblem in the black is a boar&#x27;s tusk—the symbol of customs and tradition but also prosperity. It is worn as a pendant on the islands—along with two leaves of the local &quot;namele&quot; tree.

<text>The current national flag of Venezuela was introduced in 2006. The basic design includes a horizontal tricolour of yellow, blue, and red, dating to the original flag introduced in 1811, in the Venezuelan War of Independence.

Further modifications have involved including a set of stars, multiple changes to the placement and number of stars and inclusion of an optional coat of arms at the upper-left corner.

==Original flag==

The flag is essentially the one designed by Francisco de Miranda for his unsuccessful 1806 expedition to liberate Venezuela and later adopted by the National Congress of 1811. It consisted of three equal horizontal stripes of yellow, blue and red. Miranda&#x27;s flag is also the inspiration for the flags of Colombia and Ecuador. The flag of the short-lived Republic of Spanish Haiti was also based on Miranda&#x27;s tricolore and resembles the current Venezuelan flag. This original design was first flown on 12 March 1806, at Jacmel, Haiti, as Miranda&#x27;s expedition prepared to make the final leg of its voyage to Venezuela. The flag was first flown over Venezuelan soil at La Vela de Coro, on 3 August. Until 3 August 2006, Flag Day was celebrated in Venezuela on 12 March. Since 2006 it has been celebrated on 3 August.

Miranda gave at least two sources of inspiration for his flag. In a letter written to Count Semyon Vorontsov in 1792, Miranda stated that the colours were based on a theory of primary colours given to him by the German writer and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Miranda described a late-night conversation he had with Goethe at a party in Weimar during the winter of 1785. Fascinated with Miranda&#x27;s account of his exploits in the United States Revolutionary War and his travels throughout the Americas and Europe, Goethe told him that, &quot;&quot;Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.”&quot; He proceeded to clarify what he meant by this:

&quot;First he explained to me the way the iris transforms light into the three primary colours […] then he proved to me why yellow is the warmest, noble and closest to [white] light; why blue is that mix of excitement and serenity, a distance that evokes shadows; and why red is the exaltation of yellow and blue, the synthesis, the vanishing of light into shadow&quot;.

&quot; It is not that the world is made of yellows, blues, and reds; it is that in this manner, as if in an infinite combination of these three colours, we human beings see it. […] A country starts out from a name and a flag, and it then becomes them, just as a man fulfills his destiny.&quot;
After Miranda later designed his flag based on this conversation, he happily recalled seeing a fresco by Lazzaro Tavarone in the Palazzo Belimbau in Genoa that depicted Christopher Columbus unfurling a similar-coloured flag in Veragua during his fourth voyage.

In his military diary, Miranda gave another source of inspiration: the yellow, blue and red standard of the Burgers&#x27; Guard (&quot;Bürgerwache&quot;) of Hamburg, which he also saw during his travels in Germany. The idea of the flag is documented in his 1801 plan for an army to liberate Spanish America, which he submitted unsuccessfully to the British cabinet. In it Miranda requested the materials for &quot;ten flags, whose colours shall be red, yellow and blue, in three zones.&quot;

The symbolism traditionally ascribed to the colours is that the yellow band stands for the wealth of the land, the red for courage, and the blue for the independence from Spain, or &quot;golden&quot; America separated from bloody Spain by the deep blue sea.

==Colours and symbolism==
According to the current interpretation, the colours signify:
* 

==19th-century changes==
During the first half of the 19th century, seven stars were added to the flag to represent the seven signatories to the Venezuelan declaration of independence, being the provinces of Caracas, Cumaná, Barcelona, Barinas, Margarita, Mérida, and Trujillo.

After the Guayana campaign, Simón Bolívar added the eighth star to the national flag (the so-called Flag of Angostura) in the representation of the newly freed province. Bolívar issued the following decree:
: Simón Bolívar. Supreme Leader of the Republic and Captain-in-chief of the Armies of Venezuela and New Granada. Since the number of provinces that compose the Republic of Venezuela has increased with the incorporation of Guyana decreed on October 15, I hereby decree the following: Sole article.- One star shall be added to the seven stars present on the Venezuelan national flag as a symbol of the province of Guayana in such a way that the flag will feature eight stars from now on. Given and signed by my hand, sealed with the provisional seal of the State and countersigned by the Secretary of Office in the Government Palace of the city of Angostura on November 20, 1817. Simón Bolívar.

==1954 changes==

The &quot;Law of the National Flag, Coat of Arms and Anthem&quot; added the Coat of arms to the flag on February 17, 1954. The coat of arms was not incorporated into the Civil or Maritime Flag, which is intended for non-governmental purposes, such as civilian use, merchant craft, and international sports competition.

==2006 changes==
In November 2005, the President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez announced plans to add an eighth star to the flag of Venezuela to bring about a much-belated fulfillment to Bolívar&#x27;s 1817 decree. The eighth star represents the Guayana Province, one of the Provinces of Venezuela at the time of the declaration of independence. The Coat of Arms was also changed to a white horse galloping left instead of cantering to the right, a bow and arrow, and a machete. Although the new flag was approved by the Venezuelan government, opposition spokesperson Óscar Pérez stated that they would not use the new flag.

The new flag change is controversial for another reason, being that the eighth star represents the Guayana Province, which now belongs to modern-day the States of Amazonas, Bolivar, Delta Amacuro and two-thirds of Guyana, a country that Venezuela has ongoing tensions with over a border dispute of the entire region west of the Essequibo River, which was ruled in Guyana&#x27;s favour by an international tribunal.

==Customs and regulations==

As with most other national flags, the Venezuelan flag should be flown every day by the legally registered public institutions from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m. Private institutions, businesses, and citizens should fly the flag on national holidays or on days determined by the National Executive. Institutions which should fly the flag by obligation are:

*The Federal Legislative Palace, when the National Assembly is in session and buildings in which a legislative council is being held,
*Public national, state and municipal offices on national holidays and other days determined by special resolution of the relevant authorities,
*Embassies, legations, consulates, and other national agencies abroad, on national holidays or when required by the protocol of the host nation,
*Miraflores Palace, the residence and office building of the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, daily,
*Buildings of the Armed Forces, fortresses and other military buildings, as determined by the law and pertinent regulations,
*Venezuelan merchant ships, using the civil ensign, since they operate in a civil capacity.

There is currently no regulation as to the dimensions of the flag, its use inside private or public institutions or by the public in general, its form and protocol. The conventions that currently exist have been freely determined. Nevertheless, educational institutions currently follow a protocol modeled on the regulations issued for the armed forces for use in raising the flag on special days.

Out of respect for the flag, popular culture holds that upon raising the flag, the national anthem should be played and all civilians present should stand still, straight, with closed hands at the sides and without any headgear, while military and police personnel out of formation must salute.

===Folding the flag===
Although there is no official regulation on the manner in which the flag should be folded, there is, as in other countries, a procedure with widespread acceptance in schools, scout groups, and military institutions. Its origins are not known, but there are several possibilities, such as the adoption of the custom from other South American nations, in which this singular way of folding a flag originated. In the Venezuelan case, there are two ways of folding the flag depending on whether it is a civil or state flag.

*For the state flag, the flag is lowered and taken to the place where it will be folded. It is then held at all four corners by at least two people. The red stripe is folded over the blue and then the yellow over the red so that the yellow stripe and the national arms are on top and the blue stripe with stars on the bottom. The flag is then folded under in a triangular manner from the fly to the hoist such that at the end the remaining material is tucked into the last fold and the resulting triangle is all yellow with the national arms.
*For the civil flag, the flag is also lowered in the same manner as above but the yellow stripe is folded first over the blue one, then the red one over the yellow stripe, with the blue stripe and stars facing down. The flag is then folded over in a triangular manner so that the resulting triangle is only blue with stars.

==Flag anthem==
The flag has its own anthem, which was composed in 1889 with music by Francisco Araldi and lyrics by Zolessi Geronimo, which reads:

==Student oath to the flag==
Similarly, a Flag Oath has also been written for students to be said on 3 August, which is as follows:
This is followed by the following pledge for those in schools:

Versions of this oath and pledge are used for the National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Policia Nacional Bolivariana, but in this case, only the pledge is used during graduation and passing out parades.

<doc id="459363" wikidata="Q713575" url="?curid=459363" title="Han Bennink">
<text>Han Bennink (born 17 April 1942) is a Dutch drummer and percussionist. On occasion his recordings have featured him playing soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, trombone, violin, banjo and piano.

Though perhaps best known as one of the pivotal figures in early European free jazz and free improvisation, Bennink has worked in essentially every school of jazz, and is described by critic Chris Kelsey as &quot;one of the unfortunately rare musicians whose abilities and interests span jazz&#x27;s entire spectrum.&quot; Known for often injecting slapstick and absurdist humor into his performances, Bennink has had especially fruitful long-term partnerships with pianist Misha Mengelberg and saxophonist Peter Brötzmann. Han is a brother of saxophonist Peter Bennink.

== Early life and education ==
Bennink was born in Zaandam, the son of a classical percussionist. He played the drums and the clarinet during his teens.

== Performing career ==

Through the 1960s he was the drummer with a number of American musicians visiting the Netherlands, including Dexter Gordon, Wes Montgomery, Sonny Rollins and Eric Dolphy (he is present on Dolphy&#x27;s recording, &quot;Last Date&quot; (1964)).

He subsequently became a central figure in the emerging European free improvisation scene. In 1963 he formed a quartet with pianist Misha Mengelberg and saxophonist Piet Noordijk which performed at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival. In 1967 he was a co-founder of the Instant Composers Pool with Mengelberg and Willem Breuker, which sponsored Dutch avant garde performances. From the late 1960s, he played in a trio with saxophonist Peter Brötzmann and Belgian pianist Fred Van Hove, which became a duo after Van Hove&#x27;s departure in 1976. Through much of the 1990s, he played in Clusone 3 (also known as the Clusone Trio), a trio with saxophonist/clarinetist Michael Moore and cellist Ernst Reijseger. He has often played duos with Mengelberg and collaborated with him alongside other musicians.

From the late 1980s through the early 2000s, Bennik collaborated closely with Dutch post-punk band The Ex, appearing on their 1995 album &quot;Instant&quot; and travelling and playing with them on their first tour to Ethiopia.

==Recordings==
As well as playing with these long-standing groups, Bennink has performed and recorded solo (&quot;Tempo Comodo&quot; (1982) being among his solo recordings) and played with many free improvisation and free jazz musicians including Derek Bailey, Conny Bauer, Don Cherry and Alexander von Schlippenbach, as well as more conventional jazz musicians such as Lee Konitz. In 1983 he collaborated with boogie-woogie pianist and vocalist Little Willie Littlefield for his album, &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood&quot;.

== Style ==

Bennink&#x27;s style is wide-ranging, running from conventional jazz drumming to highly unconventional free improvisation, for which he often uses whatever found objects happen to be onstage (chairs, music stands, instrument cases), his own body (a favourite device involves putting a drumstick in his mouth and striking it with the other stick), and the entire performance space—the floor, doors, and walls. He makes frequent use of birdcalls and whatever else strikes his fancy (one particularly madcap performance in Toronto in the 1990s involved a deafening fire alarm bell placed on the floor).

<text>The flag of the British Virgin Islands was adopted by Royal Warrant on 15 November 1960 after the islands were made into a separate British colony. Previously, the territory was administered as part of the British Leeward Islands.

==Description==

The flag of the British Virgin Islands features a defaced Blue Ensign with the Union Flag in the canton, and defaced with the coat of arms of the British Virgin Islands. The coat of arms, which date to the early nineteenth century, features Saint Ursula holding a flaming gold oil lamp and surrounded by a further eleven lamps, which represent her 11,000 virgin followers. The islands were named after these virgin followers by Christopher Columbus when he discovered the islands in 1493, the multiplicity of islands reminding him of the numerous followers. The motto present on the flag reads &quot;Vigilate&quot;, which translated from Latin is &quot;be watchful&quot;. The flag was modified in 1999, when the shield was enlargened and outlined in white.

==Etiquette==

The flag of the British Virgin Islands must never been flown above another flag, indicating superiority, or vice versa, indicating inferiority, nor should it be allowed to drag along the ground. The flag must always be flown in good condition, to do otherwise would be to show disrespect to the nation. Due care must be taken to ensure the flag is being flown the correct way up. The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset and all government buildings are encouraged to fly it. When a flag is to be disposed of, it must be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning in private with respect.

==Related flags==
===Civil ensign===

The civil ensign is a red ensign with the coat of arms of the British Virgin Islands. The red ensign is to be flown on board vessels either registered in the British Virgin Islands or by vessels visiting the British Virgin Islands. The flag was authorised in 2001 and Section 70 of the British Virgin Islands Merchant Shipping Act, 2001 reads:

#The red ensign bearing the Virgin Islands’ coat of arms usually worn by merchant ships, or without the coat of arms, is hereby declared to be the proper national colours for all Virgin Islands ships, except in the case of His Majesty&#x27;s ships, or in the case of any other ship for the time being allowed to wear any other national colours in pursuance of a warrant from His Majesty or from the Admiralty.
#If any distinctive national colours, except the red ensign or the Union Jack with a white border or any colours usually worn by His Majesty&#x27;s ships or resembling those of His Majesty, or the pendant usually carried by His Majesty&#x27;s ships or any pendant resembling that pendant, are or is hoisted on board any Virgin Islands ship without warrant from His Majesty or from the Admiralty, the master of the ship, the owner if on board the ship, and every other person hoisting the colours or pendant, each commits an offence and for each such offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars. 

The blue ensign shall only be used on vessels which belong to or are in the service of the government.

===Gubernatorial flag===

The Governor of the British Virgin Islands has a separate flag (also seen below), a Union Flag defaced with the coat of arms. This design is similar to flags of the other Governors in British overseas territories. The gubernatorial flag is for use at Government House when the governor is in residence or within the territory. It is also on the bonnet of the motor-car in which the governor travels on official business. The current governor, in office since 29 January 2024, is Daniel Pruce.

<doc id="459365" wikidata="Q204666" url="?curid=459365" title="Flag of the United States Virgin Islands">
<text>The flag of the United States Virgin Islands was adopted on May 17, 1921. It consists of a simplified version of the coat of arms of the United States between the letters V and I (for &#x27;Virgin Islands&#x27;). The yellow-colored eagle holds a sprig of laurel in one talon, which symbolizes victory, and three blue arrows in the other (unlike the thirteen arrows in the US coat of arms), which represent the three major islands that make up the U.S. Virgin Islands: Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. When the Virgin Islands were owned by Denmark, the flag was a blue ensign with the Danish flag, or &quot;Dannebrog&quot; (&#x27;cloth of the Danes&#x27;), in the canton.

==History==

Prior to Transfer Day 1917, the Danish colonial administration used a simple flag modeled on the blue ensign with the flag of Denmark in its canton. The Danish flag is popularly said to have fallen from the sky during a 1219 battle of the Danish king Valdemar II during the Livonian Crusade against the Estonians. The Nordic Cross on the flag represents Christianity.
The idea of a U.S. Virgin Islands flag began with the administration of Rear Admiral Sumner Ely Wetmore Kittelle, who was sworn in as governor of the islands on April 26, 1921. He approached Mr. White, captain of the &quot;Grebe&quot;, and Percival Wilson Sparks, a cartoonist, and asked them for suggestions for a flag design. Sparks immediately drew a design on paper. Afterwards, Sparks transferred it on heavy cotton material, then asked his wife Grace and her sister Blanche Joseph to embroider the design. The later result was what became the United States Virgin Islands flag.

== Transfer Day ==
Transfer Day commemorates the transfer of sovereignty over the islands from Denmark to the United States, which was first marked at an official ceremony in 1917 by the lowering of the Danish flag and the raising of the American flag in Charlotte Amalie. The United States had bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark for $25 million, which eventually meant changing the flag to represent the United States.

<doc id="459366" wikidata="Q170814" url="?curid=459366" title="Flag of Zambia">
<text>The national flag of Zambia was adopted upon independence on 24 October 1964, by the first Republican President Dr. Kenneth David Kaunda. Before that, Zambia was the British protectorate of Northern Rhodesia and used a defaced Blue Ensign as its flag.

The current flag is used as both national flag and ensign. It is green with an orange-coloured African fish eagle in flight over a rectangular block of three vertical stripes, coloured, from left to right: red, black and orange. The placement of the eagle and block of stripes at the flag&#x27;s fly is notable as most emblems and devices on flags are placed at centre or at the hoist. Green stands for the nation&#x27;s agriculture and lush flora, red for the nation&#x27;s struggle for freedom, black for the Zambian people and all black Africans, and orange for the land&#x27;s copper, natural resources in general, and mineral wealth. Additionally, the eagle flying above the coloured stripes is intended to represent freedom and the people&#x27;s ability to rise above the nation&#x27;s problems.

The Zambian flag was slightly modified in 1996. The shade of green used in the 1964 flag was replaced with brighter and lighter green and the eagle was slightly altered so as to be more like the one used in the Zambian coat of arms.

==Design==
The design of the national flag of Zambia is described in National Flag and Armorial Ensigns Act of 4 June 1965.

Green with an orange coloured eagle in flight over a rectangular block of three vertical stripes coloured from left to right in red, black and orange; of overall dimensions 3:2; and to the following colour specifications:

*&quot;Spectrum Green&quot;, British Colour Council Shade reference 100.
*&quot;Union Jack Red&quot;, British Colour Council Shade reference 210.
*&quot;Jet Black&quot;, British Colour Council Shade reference 220=)
*&quot;Spectrum Orange&quot;, British Colour Council Shade reference 57:
===Colours===

The dark green was adjusted in 1996 to a lighter and brighter green. In 2012 the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games solicited advice from each participating nation in specifying the correct Pantone colours for its flag. Once confirmed, the results were published in a guide. The colours given were:


The colours&#x27; approximation in other colour spaces are listed below:

===Symbolism===

The flag&#x27;s colours and emblems are rich in symbolism. Each of the four colours represents an aspect of Zambia: green for the country&#x27;s natural resources and vegetation; red for its struggle for freedom; black for its people and orange for its mineral wealth (primarily copper). The eagle is an African fish eagle, which also appears in the national coat of arms and represents the people&#x27;s ability to rise above the nation&#x27;s problems.

==Flag protocol==

By law, the Zambian flag should be flown only between the hours of sunrise and sunset and may be flown:
*at buildings or premises owned or occupied by the Government;
*at buildings or premises owned or occupied by local government authorities;
*at buildings or premises owned or occupied by any statutory board or statutory corporation;
*at state-aided schools; 
*on any motor car, boat or ship in or by which a Minister of Government is for the time being travelling;
*on any ship registered as Zambian.

The flag is not allowed to be flown by any other individual or institution without express written permission from the Minister except on the following occasions:
*on the following public holidays, namely: Africa Freedom Day, Heroes Day, Unity Day, and Independence Day; 
*on such other days or occasions as the Minister may declare for this purpose.

<doc id="459370" wikidata="Q169966" url="?curid=459370" title="Deccan Plateau">
<text>The Deccan is a plateau extending over an area of and occupies the majority of the Indian peninsula. It stretches from the Satpura and Vindhya Ranges in the north to the northern fringes of Tamil Nadu in the south. It is bound by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats on the sides, which separate the region from the Western and Eastern Coastal Plains respectively. It covers most of the Indian States of Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh excluding the coastal regions, and minor portions of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

The plateau is marked by rocky terrain with an average of about . It is subdivided into Maharashtra Plateau, Karnataka Plateau, and Telangana Plateau. The Deccan Traps in the north west were formed by multiple layers of igneous rocks laid down by basaltic lava flows following a massive volcanic eruption that occurred during the end of the cretaceous period (66 mya). The underlying bed consists of granite and sedimentary rocks formed during the precambrian era and the formation of Gondwana.

The region forms one of the major watersheds of India, with many perennial river systems such as Godavari, Krishna, and Kaveri flowing through the region. The plateau slopes gently from the west to east, resulting in most of the principal rivers flowing eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal. As the Western Ghats blocks the rain bearing winds, the plateau region is drier than the coastal region and has a semi-arid climate.

The Deccan plateau region was ruled by several kingdoms in Indian history such as Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, Kadambas, Kakatiyas, and Western Gangas. In the later medieval era, the lower plateau was ruled by the Vijayanagara empire, and the upper portion by the Bahmani kingdom, and its successors, the Deccan sultanates. It later housed the Kingdom of Mysore, Maratha confederacy, and Nizam&#x27;s dominions. It was under the control of British Raj for nearly two centuries before the Indian Independence in 1947. The Reorganisation of Indian states in the 1950s resulted in the creation of states on linguistic lines.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Deccan&quot; is an anglicised version of the Prakrit word &quot;&quot;, which evolved from the Sanskrit word &quot;dakṣiṇa&quot;, meaning &quot;south&quot;.

Carbon dating shows that ash mounds associated with Neolithic cultures in region date back to 8000 BCE. Towards the beginning of 1000 BCE, iron technology spread through the region though geological evidence does not point to a fully developed Bronze Age in existence prior to the Iron Age. Since at least the 1st century BCE, the region was connected to the Silk Road and was involved in trade with the Mediterranean and East Asia.

Several dynasties such as the Pandyas of Madurai, the Cholas of Thanjavur, the Zamorins of Kozhikode, the Satavahanas of Amaravati, the Pallavas of Kanchi, the Kadambas of Banavasi, the Western Gangas of Kolar, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Hoysalas of Belur, and the Kakatiyas of Orugallu ruled over the region from the 6th century BCE to the 14th century CE. In the Late Middle Ages, Vijayanagara empire conquered most of the southern part of the pleateu region. The upper portion was ruled by the Bahmani kingdom, and later by its successors, the Deccan sultanates.

The Europeans arrived in the 15th century CE and by the middle of the 18th century, the French and the British were involved in a protracted struggle for military control over the region. The Maratha Empire founded by Chatrapati Shivaji, briefly captured the region in the early 18th century CE. After the defeat of Mysore Kingdom in the late 18th century CE and the Vellore Mutiny in 1806 CE, the British East India Company consolidated their power over much of the region. The British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857. 

During the British colonial rule, the region was divided between the Madras Presidency, Bombay Presidency, Hyderabad State, and Mysore. The region played a major role in the Indian independence movement. After Indian Independence in 1947, majority of the region was organised into four states Bombay State, Hyderabad State, Madras State, and Mysore State. The Reorganisation of Indian states on linguistic lines in the 1950s resulted in the creation of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Telangana was created in 2014 by bifurcating Andhra Pradesh.

== Geology ==


The Deccan Plateau is one of the oldest and most stable land formations in the Indian subcontinent. The plateau is marked by rocky terrain with an average of about 600 m (2,000 ft). The Deccan Traps consist of multiple layers of igneous rocks, which are more than in thickness. These rocks were laid down by basaltic lava flows which emerged from deep inside the Earth&#x27;s crust following a massive volcanic eruption. 

The eruption event occurred during the end of the cretaceous period (66 mya) and is the second largest volcanic eruption ever recorded on land. Scientists state that the volcanic event would have released large amounts of ash, dust and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The release would have blocked sunlight resulting in lower temperatures and caused major climatic changes on Earth. The eruption would have resulted in high levels of sulfur, chlorine and other toxic gases in the atmosphere. Researchers argue that the volcanic event would have contributed to the extinction of various species including some of the dinosaurs.
The volcanic deposits stretch more than encompassing neighbouring central highlands. The deposits consist of three subgroups based on the time and level of deposition. Underlying the lava deposits are granite and sedimentary rocks formed during the precambrian era and the formation of Gondwanaland. The Indo-Gangetic Plain rests on hard crystalline rocks which connect the Himalayan region with the plateau region. Apart from granite, parts of the region consists of metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, and schist.

The Deccan Plateau region is rich in mineral deposits like iron ore, coal, and mica. Precious and semi precious stones have also been mined from the region. Large uranium deposits have been discovered in the region in the 21st century. There are two major soil types, forming distinct sub-regions of the plateau. Most of the region with igneous basaltic rock consists of black soil. These soils have a high clay content, retain moisture and are resistant to erosion, but develop cracks during the dry season. The gneiss peneplain region in the low rainfall areas in the eastern vicinity of the Western Ghats consist of infertile red soil.

== Geography ==
Historians have used the term Deccan differently across various time periods. Firishta (16th century), R. G. Bhandarkar (1920), and Richard Eaton (2005) demarcate the region based on linguistic lines. K. M. Panikkar (1969) defines it as the entire Indian peninsula south of the Vindhyas. Stewart Gordon (1998) notes that Deccan is a &quot;relational term&quot; and historically the border of Deccan has varied from Tapti River to the Godavari River, depending on the southern boundary of the northern empires and is used to denote &quot;the area beyond the southern border of a northern-based kingdom&quot; of India.

Geographers have defined the extent of Deccan region using various physical features and indices such as rainfall, vegetation, or soil type. As per a broader geographical definition, the region consists of the peninsular tableland lying to the south of the Tropic of Cancer, marked by the Vindhya-Satpura ranges in the north. The Deccan is a plateau region extending over an area of and occupies the majority of the Indian peninsula. It is shaped like an inverted triangle with its upper boundary at the Narmada River basin near the Vindhya-Satpura ranges and the lower boundary at the northern fringes of Tamil Nadu in the south. 

The region is bound by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats on the sides, which separate the region from the Western and Eastern Coastal Plains respectively. It covers most of the Indian states of Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh excluding the coastal regions, and minor portions of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The western side of the plateau is elevated gently slopes towards the east. It is subdivided into Maharashtra Plateau, Karnataka Plateau, and Telangana Plateau.

=== Hydrography and climate ===
The Deccan forms one of the major watersheds of India, feeding many perennial rivers. The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats are the Godavari, Kaveri, and Krishna. Most rivers flow eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal owing to the steeper gradient moving from east to west, with only smaller streams flowing in the opposite direction. The streams and rivers give rise to numerous waterfalls in the region. The rivers have been dammed for hydroelectric and irrigation purposes, with major reservoirs spread across the region.

The region has largely semi-arid climate in the northern parts and tropical climate in most of the other areas. The summer months of AprilMay are dry and hot with maximum temperatures often rising more than . During the dry summer months of AprilMay, heat builds up on the interior of the Deccan Plaeau, which draws air from the sea. The air, which picks up moisture along the way and flows eastward from the Arabian Sea, is blocked by the Western Ghats. The rising air cools and brings about orographic precipitation along the western coast, which signifies the onset of the monsoon season in June. 

By the time the air rises above the mountains, it becomes dry, resulting in a rain shadow region with very little rainfall on the leeward side towards the interior of the Deccan plateau. The monsoon winds rounding up the peninsula and moving from the east from the Bay of Bengal pass over the Eastern Ghats and bring some rainfall to the eastern region of the plateau. The region receives most of the rainfall during the months of July to September and the rains feed the rivers that flow into basins and then into the Bay of Bengal.

=== Flora and fauna ===
There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in the region, resulting from its varied climates and geography. scrub lands are common in the low rainfall regions with dry deciduous forests found in the southern part of the plateau. The woodlands of the region are older than the Himalayas. The central part of the plateau is covered by woodlands formed by trees such as hardwickia, teak, siris, axlewood, boswellia, and acacia trees. The region hosts significant populations of endangered Bengal tigers and Indian elephants Other mammals found in the region include gaur, blackbuck, chinkara, four-horned antelope, wild buffalo, and Indian wild dog. 

== Demographics ==
The largest linguistic group in the region is the Dravidian family of languages, of approximately 73 languages. The Telugus and Kannadigas who speak Telugu and Kannada form the major demographic groups in the central region. Tamils and Malayalis form a part of the southern end of the plateau. Marathi people, who speak Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language, form the majority in the north-western part of the plateau. English is also widely spoken in urban areas of the region. Deccani Urdu a regional dialect of Urdu is spoken by the Muslims. Evidence of prehistoric religion in the region comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals, such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, at Stone Age sites. Hinduism is the major religion today in the region.

The total fertility rate in the region was less than the population replacement level and as a result, the proportion of the population of the region to India&#x27;s total population has declined in the last four decades. The economies of the states in the region registered a growth higher than the national average over the past three decades. While the states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, there is wide disparity within the region.

== Economy ==
Agriculture is often difficult in low rainfall areas, which require additional irrigation facilities while it is more feasible in the river valleys. Agriculture is still the primary occupation in the region. Rice is the staple food and major crop in the region. Others crops cultivated include sugarcane, banana, cotton, turmeric, millets,  pulses, and spices. The urban centres are significant contributors to the Indian and global Information Technology economy. The presence of these hubs has spurred economic growth and attracted foreign investments and job seekers from other parts of the country. Manufacturing and textiles are other major industries in the region.

== Culture ==
As defined by Ministry of Culture of the Government of India to promote and preserve the cultural heritage, the region falls under the purview of West and South Zone Cultural Centers. The women traditionally wear a &quot;sari&quot;, a garment that consists of a drape varying from to in length and to in breadth that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff, as according to Indian philosophy, the navel is considered as the source of life and creativity. The men wear a &quot;dhoti&quot;, a long, white rectangular piece of non-stitched cloth often bordered in brightly coloured stripes. It is usually wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist. A colourful &quot;lungi&quot; with typical batik patterns is the most common form of male attire in the countryside. People in urban areas generally wear tailored clothing, and western dress is popular. Western-style school uniforms are worn by both boys and girls in schools, even in rural areas.

The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes. The traditional way of eating a meal involves eating food served on a banana leaf using the right hand. Rice is the staple food in meals of the region. Bhakri made of millets and roti or chapathi made of wheat served with dal are popular in the north and western parts of the region. &quot;Idli&quot; and &quot;dosa&quot; served with sambar and chutney for breakfast and rice served with &quot;sambar&quot; and &quot;rasam&quot; for lunch are popular in the eastern and southern parts of the region. Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its &quot;biryani&quot;.

The region is home to various music and dance forms such as Kuchipudi, Lavani, Yakshagana, and Bharatanatyam. There are three distinct styles of rock architecture, the &quot;Dravidian&quot; style of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, the &quot;Vesara&quot; style of Karnataka, Telangana, and the &quot;Nagara&quot; style of Maharashtra. In Dravidian architecture, the temples considered of large gate-pyramids or &quot;Gopurams&quot; in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple with large pillared halls. &quot;Vimanam&quot; are similar structures built over the &quot;garbhagriha&quot; or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture. In the Nagara style, the temples had one or more &quot;shikharas&quot;, which are towers similar to the vimanas. The Vesara style is a hybrid of both these architectural styles.

== Transport ==
There is an extensive road network composed of National Highways, State Highways and other roads in the region. The Golden Quadrilateral connecting the major cities in the country traverses across the region. Public bus services are mostly provided by state-run transport corporations. 

The Madras Railway was established in 1845 and the Great Indian Peninsular Railway was incorporated in 1849. The construction on the first main line in the South between Royapuram in Madras and Arcot started in 1853, which became operational on 1 July 1856. In 1879, the Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway was established which built railway lines across the then Hyderabad State and the Mysore State Railway was established to build an extension of Madras Railway in Mysore State. In 1880, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway built a railway network radiating from Madras. The Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway was founded on 1 January 1908 by merging the Madras Railway and the Southern Mahratta Railway. In 1950, there were about 42 different railway companies across the countrym which were amalgamated in steps to form a single entity named as Indian Railways. On 14 April 1951, the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway, and the Mysore State Railway were merged to form the Southern Railway, the first zone of Indian Railways. The Western was established on 5 November 1951, the South Central zone on 2 October 1966, and the South Western zone on 1 April 2003. Most of the region is covered by these four zones, with small portions of the coasts covered by East Coast Railway and Konkan Railway. Metro and suburban systems are operational in major cities.

Air transport in the region started in the late 1910s with commercial services beginning in the 1930s. The region has multiple international and domestic airports. Chennai International Airport serves as the Southern Regional Headquarters of the Airports Authority of India, the Southern Region comprising the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, and Mumbai International Airport serves the state of Maharashtra. The southern region comes under the purview of the Southern Air Command of the Indian Air Force and the north western region comes under the South Western Air Command.

<text>Wallingford is an unincorporated community in Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1687, it is named for Wallingford, England. In 2007, Wallingford was named by &quot;Money Magazine&quot; as the ninth best place to live in the United States; two other towns in the area made the top 15. Most locations in Nether Providence use Wallingford&#x27;s ZIP code.

It is west of Interstate 476, known locally as the Blue Route, and east of S. Providence Road, PA 252. Crum Creek forms the township&#x27;s eastern border with the borough of Swarthmore. Wallingford lies north of Chester on the southwestern edge of the Philadelphia urban area. Wallingford is about 9 miles from Philadelphia.

There is a dry cleaning shop and a post office. Various doctors, dentists, and lawyers are also located in Wallingford.

About half a dozen churches and chapels of several denominations are located in Wallingford, including Wallingford Presbyterian Church, St. John Chrysostom Catholic Church on Providence Road and the Foundry Church, near Media Parkway. Wallingford is also home to Congregation Ohev Shalom, a conservative synagogue located at the corner of Rt. 252 and Rt. 320.

The local school district is the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District, which serves Wallingford, Swarthmore, Rutledge, Rose Valley, and the rest of Nether Providence township.

Wallingford is located along SEPTA&#x27;s Media/Wawa Line, and has a station whose design is attributed to the well-known Victorian architect Frank Furness. Wallingford is about 30 minutes from center city Philadelphia by rail.

The township&#x27;s municipal offices are located at 214 Sykes Lane.

The Thomas Leiper Estate, Westlawn and Wolley Stille are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
Wallingford-Swarthmore School District is the area school district. The first area school started in 1810 and was built on a portion of a 78-acre (32 ha) land grant of farmer and friend of William Penn. Nether Providence School District was formed in 1856; it merged with the Swarthmore School District to become the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District but retained both the Nether Providence and Swarthmore High Schools. In 1984, the middle and high schools merged to become Strath Haven Middle School and Strath Haven High School.

Mother of Providence Regional Catholic School is the area Catholic school. It formed in 2012 from a merger of St. John Chrysostom in Wallingford and Nativity BVM School in Media. Originally Nativity BVM was to be the location of the merged school, but St. John Chrystosom appealed and the archdiocese changed its decision.

Located in Wallingford is the Helen Kate Furness Free Library, founded in 1902 and renovated in 2006.

<text>Lithuanians () are a Baltic ethnic group. They are native to Lithuania, where they number around 2,378,118 people. Another two million make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Canada. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family along with Latvian. According to the census conducted in 2021, 84.6% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians. Most Lithuanians belong to the Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Lutherans.

==History==

The territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities (Sudovians, Lithuanians, Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians, Samogitians, Skalvians, Old Prussians (&quot;Nadruvians&quot;)), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding Teutonic Order and Eastern Slavs. The Lithuanian state was formed in the High Middle Ages, with different historians dating this variously between the 11th and mid-13th centuries. Mindaugas, Lithuania&#x27;s only crowned king and its first baptised ruler, is generally considered Lithuania&#x27;s founder. The Lithuanians are the only branch of Baltic people that managed to create a state entity before the modern era. During the Late Middle Ages, Lithuania was ravaged by the Lithuanian Crusade, which ended only by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. In fact, the crusade persisted after the definite Christianization of Lithuania in 1387, when Europe&#x27;s last pagan people were baptised. Simultaneously, the Lithuanian state reached its apogee under the rule of Vytautas the Great (1392–1430), when it ruled the lands between the Baltic and Black seas. Thereafter, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania continued existing until 1795, however, since the Union of Lublin in 1569, it maintained its independence in the bi-confederal Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 16th century the Lithuanian humanists based the national consciousness of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the idea of their national singularity or uniqueness and considered the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an independent country.

There is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, meaning that the number of Lithuanian language-speakers decreased with Polonization in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as a Germanisation of Prussia. The subsequent imperial Russian occupation from 1795 until 1915, with some interpositions such as the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Uprisings of 1831 and 1863, accelerated this process of Slavicization. While under Russian occupation, Lithuanians endured Russification, which included the 40-year-long ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian (see, e.g., Knygnešiai, the actions against the Catholic Church). In such a context, the Lithuanian National Revival began in the 19th century. Some believed at the time that the Lithuanian nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.

Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including Michał Pius Römer, Stanisław Narutowicz, Oscar Milosz and Tadas Ivanauskas

In February 1918, while World War I was ongoing, the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state was declared, 122 years after it was destroyed. In the aftermath of World War I, Lithuanians militarily defended their country&#x27;s independence from Poland, Whites and Soviet Russia during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. However, a third of Lithuania&#x27;s lands, namely the Vilnius Region, as well as its declared capital, fell under Polish occupation during the Interwar. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. In the lead-up to the World War II, the Klaipėda Region was occupied by Nazi Germany after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.

The territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now Lithuania, but also in northwestern Belarus, in large areas of the territory of the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, and in some parts of modern Latvia and Poland.

In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union, and forced to join it as the Lithuanian SSR. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941 to 1944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (&quot;Lithuania Minor&quot;) were almost destroyed as a result.

The Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, a few villages in northeastern Poland, southern Latvia and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their numbers are small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the European Union on May 1, 2004.

==Ethnic composition of Lithuania==
Among the Baltic states, Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, Tatars, Latvians, Romani, Estonians, Crimean Karaites etc.

Poles are mostly concentrated in the Vilnius County. Especially large Polish communities are located in the Vilnius District Municipality and the Šalčininkai District Municipality. 

Despite being the capital, Vilnius was not the largest city by number of Lithuanians until mid-2000s. According to the 2011 census Vilnius had 337,000 Lithuanians while Kaunas had 316,000.

Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered. The most prominent community lives in the Visaginas Municipality (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.

In the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern Jerusalem, was about 30% Jewish. Almost all its Jews were killed during the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 – 1942, while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are about 3,200 Jews living in Lithuania.

===Cultural subgroups===

Apart from the various religious and ethnic groups currently residing in Lithuania, Lithuanians themselves retain and differentiate between their regional identities; there are 5 historic regional groups: &quot;Žemaičiai&quot;, &quot;Suvalkiečiai&quot;, &quot;Aukštaičiai&quot;, &quot;Dzūkai&quot; and &quot;Prūsai&quot;, the last of which is virtually extinct. City dwellers are usually considered just Lithuanians, especially ones from large cities such as Vilnius or Kaunas.
The four groups are delineated according to certain region-specific traditions, dialects, and historical divisions. There are some stereotypes used in jokes about these subgroups, for example, Sudovians are supposedly frugal while Samogitians are stubborn.

==Genetics==
Since the late Neolithic period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements, although without being actually isolated from them. The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.

A 2004 analysis of mtDNA in a Lithuanian population revealed that Lithuanians are close to both Indo-European and Uralic-speaking populations of Northern Europe. Y-chromosome SNP haplogroup analysis showed Lithuanians to be closest to Latvians, Estonians, Belarusians and southern Finns. This is the result of Iron Age Europe. Autosomal SNP analysis situates Lithuanians most proximal to Latvians, followed by the westernmost East Slavs; furthermore, Germans and West Slavs (especially Poles) are situated more proximal to Lithuanians than Finns and northern Russians.

Lithuanian Ashkenazi Jews display a number of unique genetic characteristics; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate. One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of Ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by Vytautas the Great in 1388.

At the end of the 19th century, the average height of males was and the average height of females was . By the end of the 20th century, heights averaged for males and for females.

==Diaspora==

Lithuanian settlement extends into adjacent countries that are now outside the modern Lithuanian state. A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of Puńsk and Sejny in the Suwałki area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric Antanas Baranauskas.
Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of Lithuania Minor that formed part of East Prussia were expelled when the area was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Kaliningrad Oblast, small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens. Small groups of Lithuanians are still present in Belarus within the Grodno and Vitebsk regions.

Apart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

* Communities in the United States make up the largest part of this diaspora; as many as one million Americans can claim Lithuanian descent. Emigration to America began in the 19th century, with the generation calling itself the &quot;grynoriai&quot; (derived from &quot;&quot; meaning new and inexperienced). The migration flow was interrupted during the Soviet occupation, when travel and emigration were severely restricted. The largest concentrations of Lithuanian Americans are in the Great Lakes area and the Northeast; Chicago in particular is noted as the primary center of the diaspora. Nearly 33,000 Lithuanians have immigrated to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.
* Lithuanian communities in Canada are among the largest in the world along with the United States (See Lithuanian Canadian).
* Lithuanian communities in Mexico and South America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela) developed before World War II, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Currently, there is no longer a flow of emigrants to these destinations, since economic conditions in those countries are not better than those in Lithuania (see Lithuanians in Brazil).
* Lithuanian communities were formed in South Africa during the late 19th and 20th century, the majority being Jewish.
* Lithuanian communities in other regions of the former Soviet Union were formed during the Soviet occupation; the numbers of Lithuanians in Siberia and Central Asia increased dramatically when a large portion of Lithuanians were involuntarily deported into these areas. After de-Stalinization, however, most of them returned. Later, some Lithuanians were relocated to work in other areas of the Soviet Union; some of them did not return to Lithuania, after it became independent.
* The Lithuanian communities in United Kingdom and Ireland began to appear after the restoration of independence to Lithuania in 1990; this emigration intensified after Lithuania became part of the European Union in 2004. London and Glasgow (especially the Bellshill and Coatbridge areas of Greater Glasgow) have long had large Catholic and Jewish Lithuanian populations. The Republic of Ireland probably has the highest concentration of Lithuanians relative to its total population size in Western Europe; its estimated 45,000 Lithuanians (about half of whom are registered) form over 1% of Ireland&#x27;s total population. 
* The Lithuanian communities in other countries of Northwestern Europe (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Iceland) as well as in Spain are very new and began their growth spurts as Lithuanian was accepted into the EU. In Norway there are 45,415 Lithuanians living in the country and it has in a short time become the second largest ethnic minority in the country, making up 0.85% of Norway&#x27;s total population, and 4.81% of all foreign residents in Norway. There are around 3,500 Lithuanians in Iceland, making around 1% of the total population.
*Lithuanian communities in Germany began to appear after World War II. In 1950 they founded the Lithuanian High School in Diepholz, which was a private school for children of Lithuanian refugees. For decades the Lithuanian High School was the only full-time high school outside the Eastern Bloc offering courses in Lithuanian history, language, and culture. In 1954, the Lithuanian Community acquired Rennhof Manor House with its twelve-acre park in the town of Lampertheim-Hüttenfeld. The school was relocated there and still exists today.
* Lithuanian communities in Australia exist as well; due to its great distance from Europe, however, emigration there was minuscule. There are Lithuanian communities in Melbourne, Geelong, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart and Perth.

==Culture and traditions==

The Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be basketball (&quot;krepšinis&quot;), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the Lithuanian-American community in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics.

Joninės (also known as Rasos) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. Užgavėnės (Shrove Tuesday) takes place on the day before Ash Wednesday, and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas.

===Cuisine===
Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country&#x27;s rich history.

Since shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( &quot;koldūnai&quot;), doughnuts (&quot;spurgos&quot;), and crepes (&quot;lietiniai blynai&quot;). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis) and potato sausages (vėdarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as šakotis. Traditional dishes of Lithuanian Tatars and Lithuanian Karaites like Kibinai and čeburekai, that are similar to pasty, are popular in Lithuania.

For Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of virtinukai (cabbage and noodles) and balandėliai (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.

There are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional kastinys in Žemaitija, Western Lithuania, Skilandis in Western and Central Lithuania, Kindziukas in Eastern and Southern Lithuania (Dzūkija).
Cepelinai, a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark rye bread, cold beet soup (šaltibarščiai), and kugelis (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. Lithuanian cuisine is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.

Lithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world. In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.

Lithuania has been brewing midus, a type of Lithuanian mead for thousands of years.

Locally brewed beer (&quot;alus&quot;), vodka (&quot;degtinė&quot;), and kvass (&quot;gira&quot;) are popular drinks in Lithuania. Lithuanian traditional beer of Northern Lithuania, Biržai, Pasvalys regions is well appreciated in Lithuania and abroad. Starka is a part of the Lithuanian heritage, still produced in Lithuania.

===Language===

Among Indo-European languages, Lithuanian is conservative in its grammar and phonology, retaining archaic features otherwise found only in ancient languages such as Sanskrit (particularly its early form, Vedic Sanskrit) or Ancient Greek. Thus, it is an important source for the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language despite its late attestation (with the earliest texts dating only to , whereas Ancient Greek was first written down in ). There was fascination with the Lithuanian people and their language among the late 19th-century researchers, and the philologist Isaac Taylor wrote the following in his &quot;The Origin of the Aryans&quot; (1892):
&quot;Thus it would seem that the Lithuanians have the best claim to represent the primitive Aryan race, as their language exhibits fewer of those phonetic changes, and of those grammatical losses which are consequent on the acquirement of a foreign speech.&quot;

The Proto-Balto-Slavic language branched off directly from Proto-Indo-European, then sub-branched into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic. Proto-Baltic branched off into Proto-West Baltic and Proto-East Baltic. Baltic languages passed through a Proto-Balto-Slavic stage, from which Baltic languages retain numerous exclusive and non-exclusive lexical, morphological, phonological and accentual isoglosses in common with the Slavic languages, which represent their closest living Indo-European relatives. Moreover, with Lithuanian being so archaic in phonology, Slavic words can often be deduced from Lithuanian by regular sound laws; for example, Lith. &quot;&quot; and Polish ← PBSl. (cf. PSl. ) ← PIE , all meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.

===Literature===
When the ban against printing the Lithuanian language was lifted in 1904, various European literary movements such as Symbolism, impressionism, and expressionism each in turn influenced the work of Lithuanian writers. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918–1940) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, a novelist and dramatist. His many works include &quot;Dainavos šalies senų žmonių padavimai&quot; (Old Folks Tales of Dainava, 1912) and the historical dramas &quot;Šarūnas&quot; (1911), &quot;Skirgaila&quot; (1925), and &quot;Mindaugo mirtis&quot; (The Death of Mindaugas, 1935). Petras Vaičiūnas was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel &quot;Altorių šešėly&quot; (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.

&quot;Keturi vėjai&quot; movement started with publication of &quot;The Prophet of the Four Winds&quot; by talented poet Kazys Binkis (1893—1942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of &quot;Keturi vėjai&quot; initially was futurism which arrived through Russia from the West and later cubism, dadaism, surrealism, unanimism, and German expressionism. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky.

Oskaras Milašius (1877–1939) is a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon in Lithuanian culture. He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near Mogilev, Belarus) and graduated from Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries — Lithuania and Poland — he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, &quot;Lithuanian Tales and Stories&quot;; 1933, &quot;Lithuanian Tales&quot;; 1937, &quot;The origin of the Lithuanian Nation&quot;.

===Religion===
Since the Christianization of parts of Lithuania proper in 1387 and of Samogitia in 1413, the majority of Lithuanians have been members of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the 2021 census, 74% of Lithuanians are Roman Catholic. Under Article 26 of the Constitution of Lithuania, persons can freely practice a religion of their choosing.

Catholicism played a significant role in Lithuanian anti-communist resistance under the Soviet Union. Several Catholic priests were leaders of the anti-communist movements, and thousands of Latin crosses were placed on the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, despite its being bulldozed in 1961.

===Folk music===
Lithuanian folk music is based around songs (&quot;dainos&quot;), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartinės, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called the &quot;basetle&quot;) and a kind of whistle called the Lamzdeliai &quot;lumzdelis&quot;; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon. Sutartinė can be accompanied by &quot;skudučiai&quot;, a form of panpipes played by a group of people, as well as wooden trumpets (&quot;ragai&quot; and &quot;dandytės&quot;). Kanklės is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include &quot;švilpas&quot; whistle, drums and &quot;tabalas&quot; (a percussion instrument like a gong), &quot;sekminių ragelis&quot; (bagpipe) and the &quot;pūslinė&quot;, a musical bow made from a pig&#x27;s bladder filled with dried peas.

<text>&quot;Seek truth from facts&quot; is a historically established idiomatic expression (&quot;chengyu&quot;) in the Chinese language that first appeared in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. Originally, it described an attitude toward study and research. Popularized by Chinese leader Mao Zedong, it has become a major slogan of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the inspiration for its principal theoretical journal, &quot;Qiushi.&quot;

== Use in a political context ==
The slogan became a key slogan in Chinese Marxism and was first used by Mao Zedong in 1936. Mao had probably remembered it as being the inscription on his alma mater, Hunan&#x27;s First Teachers Training School. Mao&#x27;s usage of the slogan built on his themes in &quot;On Practice&quot;, which argues that people must apply their knowledge to practice in reality in order to test its truthfulness.

Beginning in 1978, it was further promoted by Deng Xiaoping as a central ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and applied to economic and political reforms thereafter.

== In contemporary Chinese politics ==

To &quot;seek truth from facts&quot; means that communists should test theory against reality rather than adhere dogmatically to theory. The slogan implies respect for facts and using facts to inform theory and policy.

On 11 May 1978 journalist Hu Fuming published an article in state run newspaper &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; entitled &quot;Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing the Truth&quot; (), directly contradicting then CCP general secretary Hua Guofeng&#x27;s line of the Two Whatevers () policy and thereby Mao Zedong&#x27;s policy of class struggle; in favour of economic reform championed by Deng Xiaoping. The title of the article is inspired by the ancient saying and is widely seen as a seminal document in the contemporary Chinese political landscape and marks the turning point to the era of Reform and Opening Up in 20th century China. In June 1978, Deng endorsed the perspective of the editorial at an All-Army Political Work Conference. Deng stated that Marxist theory should not be &quot;lifeless dogma&quot; and cited Mao&#x27;s method of seeking truth from facts, contrasting the &quot;Two Whatevers&quot; with the view that &quot;only through practice can the correctness of one&#x27;s ideas be proved, and there is no other way of testing truth.&quot;

&quot;Qiushi&quot; - &quot;Seeking Truth&quot; () is also the official name of the journal of political theory of the Chinese Communist Party, derived from the above slogan. The magazine has been published on a continuous bi-monthly basis since 1988 and contains articles and speeches authored by state and senior party leadership on policy and ideology.

<text>Farm Aid is an annual benefit concert held for American farmers.

==History==
On July 13, 1985, before performing &quot;When The Ship Comes In&quot; with Keith Richards and Ron Wood at the Live Aid benefit concert for the 1983–1985 Ethiopian famine, Bob Dylan remarked about family farmers within the United States in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt, saying to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people, &quot;I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it, say, to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks.&quot; He is often misquoted, as on Farm Aid&#x27;s official website, as saying &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we did something for our own farmers right here in America?&quot;

Although his comments were heavily criticised, they inspired fellow musicians Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and Neil Young to organize the Farm Aid benefit concert to raise money for and help family farmers in the United States. The first concert was held on September 22, 1985, at the Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois, before a crowd of 80,000 people. Performers included Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Loretta Lynn, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, among others, and raised over $9 million for U.S. family farmers.

Willie and the other founders had originally thought that they could have one concert and the problem would be solved, but they admit that the challenges facing family farmers were more complex than anyone realized. As a result, decades after the first show, Farm Aid, under the direction of Carolyn Mugar, is still working to increase awareness of the importance of family farms, and puts on an annual concert of country, blues and rock music with a variety of music artists. The board of directors includes Nelson, Mellencamp, Young, and Dave Matthews, as well as David Anderson, Joel Katz, Lana Nelson, Mark Rothbaum, and Evelyn Shriver. On 8 April 2021, it was announced that Annie Nelson and Margo Price have joined as board members. Board member Paul English, who was Willie Nelson&#x27;s longtime drummer, died in February 2020.

The organization operates an emergency hotline that offers farmers resources and advice about challenges they&#x27;re experiencing. Early on, Nelson and Mellencamp brought family farmers before Congress to testify about the state of family farming in America. Congress subsequently passed the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to help save family farms from foreclosure. Farm Aid also operates a disaster fund to help farmers who lose their belongings and crops through natural disasters, such as the victims of Hurricane Katrina and massive flooding in 2019. The funds raised are used to pay the farmer&#x27;s expenses and provide food, legal and financial help, and psychological assistance.

The 2005 concert, marking the 20th anniversary of Farm Aid, took place at the Tweeter Center in Tinley Park, Illinois, with events in downtown Chicago as well. The 2007 Concert took place at Randall&#x27;s Island in New York City (the first Farm Aid in New York) and was recorded in High Definition to be broadcast on HDNet as a 2 Hour Special highlighting many of the performances from the Allman Brothers and Counting Crows to John Mellencamp and Willie Nelson.

The September 2019 lineup includes Willie Nelson, Neil Young, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews and country music star Luke Combs. The concert at Alpine Valley Music Theatre was Combs&#x27; first show at Farm Aid.

In 2022, Farm Aid sought national recognition for the effort to encourage Americans to buy domestic beef.

<text>Lipka () is a village in Złotów County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in north-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Lipka. It lies approximately north-east of Złotów and north of the regional capital Poznań. It is situated in the ethnocultural region of Krajna in northern Greater Poland.

== History ==

The territory became a part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. Lipka was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Nakło County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. It was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772.

Since 1871, the village, known in German as &quot;Linde,&quot; belonged to Germany, within which it formed part of the Flatow district in the administrative regions of Posen-West Prussia and Pomerania. It grew as a result of the construction of the Prussian Eastern Railway, with the railway station located in the village serving as the main station for the town of Preussisch Friedland (Debrzno) and numerous other market towns.

In the 19th century, potato cultivation was an essential livelihood for the residents, whose products went as far as the Ruhr area and the Netherlands. A starch factory, building material works, a brickworks and a dairy were some other businesses in the village. At the end of the 19th century, the first electrically powered threshing machine in Prussia was used there. In 1939, the village had 1,613 residents. During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the village was the site of a temporary camp for arrested Poles from the region, including activists, teachers and priests, who were afterwards deported to concentration camps (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). Towards the end of war, the Red Army occupied the region in the spring of 1945. After the war, the village was restored to Poland under its historic Polish name &quot;Lipka&quot;.

From 1975 to 1998 the village belonged to Piła Voivodeship.

==Transport==
There is a train station in the village.

<doc id="459381" wikidata="Q337013" url="?curid=459381" title="Yuan Shao">
<text>Yuan Shao (, ; died 28 June 202), courtesy name Benchu (), was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He occupied the northern territories of China during the civil wars that occurred towards the end of the Han dynasty. He was also an elder half-brother of Yuan Shu, a warlord who controlled the Huai River region, though the two were not on good terms with each other.

One of the most powerful warlords of his time, Yuan Shao spearheaded a coalition of warlords against Dong Zhuo, who held Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Luoyang, but failed due to internal disunity. In 200, he launched a campaign against his rival Cao Cao but was defeated at the Battle of Guandu. He died of illness two years later in Ye. His eventual failure despite his illustrious family background and geographical advantages was commonly blamed on his indecisiveness and inability to heed the advice of his advisors.

== Family background ==
Yuan Shao was born in Ruyang County (), Runan Commandery, which is in present-day Shangshui County, Henan. His family had for over four generations been a prominent force in the Han civil service, having produced numerous members in high positions since the first century CE. Descended from Yuan An, who served during the reign of Emperor Zhang, Yuan Shao&#x27;s exact parentage was the source of some controversy, being one of the primary points of contention between himself and his half-brother, or cousin, Yuan Shu. Yuan Shao was a son of Yuan Feng () and the eldest sibling, supposedly to the ire of Yuan Shu. Both Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu are recognised as great-grandsons of Yuan An, as recorded in Wang Chen&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wei&quot; ().

Yuan Shao&#x27;s mother was originally a servant of Yuan Feng. Since Yuan Feng lacked male heirs, the birth of Yuan Shao elevated his mother to the status of a concubine. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; contend that Yuan Shao was in fact an older cousin of Yuan Shu, and was adopted by the elder brother of Yuan Feng, Yuan Cheng (袁成), who also lacked male heirs. The act of adopting Yuan Shao would have infuriated Yuan Shu, because his own mother, a concubine of Yuan Feng, held a higher status than that of Yuan Shao&#x27;s mother; however, by Yuan Cheng&#x27;s adoption of Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu was no longer the highest ranked male of his generation of the Yuan family. Yuan Shao enjoyed more privileges than Yuan Shu, despite the latter being a blood-related member of the clan.

When Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu became involved in disputes later, Yuan Shu used Yuan Shao&#x27;s mother as an excuse to claim that he was not a &quot;true son&quot; of the Yuan family. When compared to Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao had a more serious appearance and respected men of talent regardless of their background; as such, he was welcomed by many since his childhood, including Cao Cao and Zhang Miao.

== Service under the Han dynasty (169 –189) ==
During Yuan Shao&#x27;s early life, he participated in saving some of the &quot;partisans&quot; from death or other terrible fates during the second of the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions. One such &quot;partisan&quot; was He Yong, whom Yuan Shao befriended after he escaped to Runan and became close with. When the second of the Disasters of Partisan Prohibitions began, He Yong often secretly entered Luoyang, where he discussed plans with Yuan Shao on how to help the &quot;partisans&quot;. For the &quot;partisans&quot; who were destitute, the plans were to provide material help. For the &quot;partisans&quot; who were imprisoned, the plans were to work within the bureaucracy so that the partisans may escape. After he entered the civil service, Yuan Shao initially served as an aide to General-in-Chief He Jin, who deeply trusted him.

After the death of Emperor Ling in May 189, He Jin and Yuan Shao plotted to eliminate the eunuch faction, but Empress Dowager He was against their idea. He Jin then summoned Dong Zhuo to lead troops into the imperial capital, Luoyang, to pressure the empress dowager. The eunuchs became fearful and they forged an edict in the empress dowager&#x27;s name, summoning He Jin into the inner palace. Yuan Shao cautioned He Jin, reminding him that he should order an attack on the eunuchs instead of entering the palace. After He Jin refused to accept his advice thrice, Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu led 200 elite troops to wait outside. On 22 September 189, inside the palace, He Jin was ambushed and assassinated by the eunuchs, who tossed his severed head over the wall. He Jin&#x27;s angered followers set fire to the palace and charged in, slaughtering every person (except females) without facial hair; to the extreme that many young men without facial hair had to show their genitals to avoid being mistaken for eunuchs and killed. Over 2,000 people were killed in the massacre, while the young Emperor Shao and Prince of Chenliu (future Emperor Xian) escaped during the chaos. The resulting power vacuum provided Dong Zhuo, who found and rescued the emperor and prince, with an opportunity to seize control of the imperial capital when he arrived.

Dong Zhuo then discussed with Yuan Shao about his plan to depose Emperor Shao and replace him with the Prince of Chenliu, but Yuan Shao disagreed. Relations between the two deteriorated and Yuan Shao fled from Luoyang to Ji Province (present day southern Hebei). At the time, Yuan Shao just got out through the city gates of Luoyang, Dong Zhuo thought about sending men after him, but Zhou Bi, Wu Qiong and He Yong secretly helped Yuan Shao by convincing Dong Zhuo to let him go. As suggested by the three men, Dong Zhuo appointed Yuan Shao as the Administrator of Bohai Commandery in a bid to appease him.

== Coalition against Dong Zhuo (190–191) ==
=== Sun Jian&#x27;s advancement ===
By early 190, however, Yuan became openly hostile. A coalition of regional officials and commanders from the eastern provinces, including Cao Cao, Yuan Shu, Han Fu, Zhang Miao and Bao Xin, formed up behind him in a campaign to oust Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao declared himself General of Chariots and Cavalry () and camped at Henei (), near a fort on the Yellow River just north of Luoyang. On 10 May 190, Dong Zhuo ordered the execution of all members of the Yuan clan in Luoyang; he then sent out emissaries with imperial edicts ordering the regional officials to disband. However, members of the coalition listened to Yuan Shao, and had all the emissaries executed instead (except Han Rong). Dong Zhuo then sent Hu Zhen, Lü Bu and Hua Xiong to deter the coalition vanguard led by Sun Jian. Despite initial success, Sun was able to capitalise on the internal conflict between Hu Zhen and Lü Bu and defeated them at Yangren. After that loss, Dong Zhuo decided to move the imperial capital to Chang&#x27;an, where his home base of Liang Province was nearby. A year later, Dong Zhuo burnt Luoyang to the ground and withdrew to the west with the mass of refugees. Although lacking a logistical base, Sun Jian and Cao Cao requested to pursue Dong Zhuo&#x27;s retreating force, but Yuan Shao and other members largely disagreed with their opinion. Sun Jian was ordered to rendezvous with Yuan Shu, so Cao Cao led his own men to go on the pursuit alone, and was soundly defeated by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s subordinate, Xu Rong.

=== Dissolution ===
During this time, Yuan Shao and Han Fu had intended to establish the legitimacy of the coalition by declaring Liu Yu, the governor of You Province (present day northern Hebei), the new emperor to replace Emperor Xian. However, believing that it would be faithless to Emperor Xian for him to accept, Liu Yu declined the offer. When the scene of the ruined capital coming into their eyes, the disunited leaders of the coalition realised that the Han dynasty was coming to an end, and started planning on strengthening their position, and soon returned to their respective home bases.

== Unifying northern China (191–199) ==
=== Acquisition and consolidation of Ji Province (191) ===

As many volunteers from different provinces had flocked to join Yuan Shao, Bohai Commandery would be far from sufficient to supply his army. Thus, Pang Ji suggested to Yuan Shao to form a secret alliance with the warlord Gongsun Zan and incite the latter to attack Han Fu&#x27;s Ji Province. Facing an imminent attack from Gongsun Zan, Han Fu was terrified so he listened to Yuan Shao&#x27;s lobbyists, Gao Gan (Yuan Shao&#x27;s nephew) and Xun Chen, to give up the governorship of Ji Province to Yuan Shao in order to drive back Gongsun Zan. Yuan Shao then began to build a warlord state from Ye, the capital of Ji Province. In order to curtail Yuan Shu&#x27;s sphere of influence, Yuan Shao formed an alliance with Cao Cao and Zhang Miao, and named his follower, Zhou Yu () as the Inspector of Yu Province, a title to which Sun Jian had already been entitled, and sent him to attack Sun Jian&#x27;s territories in Yu Province while the latter was on his way back from Luoyang. In response, Yuan Shu allied with Gongsun Zan and Tao Qian, and ordered Sun Jian to fight his half-brother.

Although Zhou Yu managed to defeat the forces of Sun Jian in the Battle of Yangcheng, he lost to Sun Jian in the following battles. The first battles between the brothers ended in Yuan Shu&#x27;s favour: he had engaged and defeated Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces in both Yangcheng and Jiujiang, restored the position in Yingchuan Commandery under Sun Jian, and eliminated Zhou Yu as a threat once and for all although Jiujiang was not yet conquered. For Yuan Shao, on the other hand, the situation was extremely difficult: besides the failure in the south, he was also under threat from Gongsun Zan, who held Yuan Shao responsible for the death of his cousin Gongsun Yue () in battle and formally declared war against him, rejecting all of Yuan Shao&#x27;s protestations of goodwill. This led to the clash between Yuan Shao and Gongsun in the Battle of Jieqiao.

The Battle of Yangcheng, being the first move in the struggle between the two Yuans, marked the beginning of a new stage in the confusion of wars which brought about the end of the Han dynasty. This internecine struggle confirmed the undoing of the alliance against Dong Zhuo as the warlords of the North China Plain started to battle each other for the ultimate dominion of China.

In order to focus on the conflicts with Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shao entered into a general alliance with Liu Biao against Yuan Shu. In the winter of that year, Yuan Shao defeated Gongsun Zan&#x27;s elite cavalry at the Battle of Jieqiao with the use of massed crossbowmen. The Han imperial court issued an edict ordering Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan to cease fire. Yuan Shao then returned to Ye and started targeting the Heishan bandits, who had been causing trouble in Ji Province. With temporary aid from Lü Bu, Yuan Shao managed to defeat the Heishan bandits despite suffering heavy casualties. In any case, Yuan Shao succeeded in drastically reducing the threat posed by the Heishan bandits to his western flank.

=== Conquest of Qing Province (192–196) ===
Despite warnings from Ju Shou that the move could sow seeds for future trouble, Yuan Shao insisted on sending his first-born son, Yuan Tan, away to &quot;govern&quot; Qing Province.

In subsequent years, Yuan Shao achieved considerable success in consolidating his domain. At the same time, Yuan Tan also achieved exceptional success on expanding his territories in Qing Province, driving out Gongsun Zan&#x27;s general Tian Kai in 193 and defeating Beihai chancellor Kong Rong in 196.

=== Refusal to host the emperor (195–196) ===
In 195, Ju Shou suggested to Yuan Shao to welcome Emperor Xian to Ji Province so he could effectively control the Han central government and use the emperor as a figurehead to enhance his legitimacy. However, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed this move under the faulty logic that if Yuan Shao were to do so, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao, valuing his autonomy, listened to Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong and let the opportunity pass by. In contrast, his would-be rival, Cao Cao used the opportunity to welcome Emperor Xian to his base in Xuchang, where the new imperial capital was established.

In 196, the Han imperial court, under Cao Cao&#x27;s control, awarded Yuan Shao the appointment of Grand Commandant. However, Yuan Shao rejected the appointment because Grand Commandant ranked below General-in-Chief, the position held by Cao Cao. As a result, Cao Cao gave up his position and offered it to Yuan Shao, who readily accepted it. Yuan Shao was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Ye.

=== Annihilation of Gongsun Zan (198–199) ===
In 198, Yuan Shao advanced against Gongsun Zan and encircled his remaining force at Yijing (present-day Xiong County, Hebei). By early 199, Yuan Shao had completely defeated Gongsun Zan at the Battle of Yijing and held absolute power over the four provinces north of the Yellow River. Then, after establishing an alliance with the Wuhuan tribes on the northern frontier, Yuan Shao turned his attention to Cao Cao, who had consolidated his own power base to the south of the Yellow River.

== Guandu Campaign (199–201) ==

Both sides made preparations for a decisive battle. Towards the end of 199, both sides had already engaged in skirmishes at Liyang (northwest of present-day Xun County, Henan), a major crossing point of the Yellow River. Cao Cao prepared his defences around Guandu (northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan), slightly south of the river. When Liu Bei defected from Cao Cao in the first month of 200 and planted a foothold in Xu Province, Cao Cao left his northern front exposed to Yuan Shao and turned east to deal with Liu Bei. Tian Feng urged Yuan Shao to seize the opportunity to attack Cao Cao while he was away, but Yuan Shao refused to launch an all-out offensive. Instead, he sent small detachments to harass his enemy. Yu Jin, the general appointed by Cao Cao to defend Yan Ford, defeated Yuan Shao&#x27;s detachments.

Shortly after Cao Cao returned to Guandu, Yuan Shao had Chen Lin draft a document condemning Cao Cao in what was essentially a declaration of war. He then marched his main army towards the forward base of Liyang north of the Yellow River. At the time, Yuan Shao&#x27;s main veteran army boasted of numbers over 100,000, supplemented with hundreds of thousands of less skilled militia units. Heavily outnumbering Cao Cao and holding large cavalry force, Yuan Shao&#x27;s initial attacks almost overwhelmed his enemy&#x27;s positions. It is recorded in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; that Cao Cao on several occasions considered relinquishing his position, and consulted his chief strategist, Xun Yu on that decision, which Xun strongly opposed and further encouraged Cao to hold on. Following an unexpected defection of one of Yuan Shao&#x27;s strategists and personal friends, Xu You, Cao Cao received confidential information on the whereabouts of Yuan Shao&#x27;s food storage. In late 200, Cao Cao and Yue Jin led a strike force to attack Yuan Shao&#x27;s supply depot at Wuchao and burnt it down, inflicting severe damage on the morale of Yuan Shao&#x27;s army. Two of Yuan Shao&#x27;s officers, Zhang He and Gao Lan, immediately defected to Cao Cao&#x27;s side once they got wind of what happened in Wuchao, and many others followed suit. Yuan Shao was unable to stop the trend and fled north across the Yellow River with only hundreds of loyalists.

Yuan Shao&#x27;s first major defeat was also a decisive one. Thereafter, he lost the advantage over Cao Cao and never regained it. In 201, Cao Cao defeated him again at the Battle of Cangting and proceeded to capture several of Yuan Shao&#x27;s territories in Ji Province.

== Failure to turn the tide and eventual demise (201–202) ==
After the Battle of Cangting, Cao Cao&#x27;s exhausted troops returned to the south for a rest. Meanwhile, Yuan Shao was able to reorganise his defeated armies to settle the rebellions in his own domain, soon reestablishing order and restored the status quo ante bellum. Yuan Shao had three sons, and he favoured his third son, Yuan Shang, due to his good looks, and both Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang were his choice for succession. However, Yuan was never able to finalise his decision regarding who should succeed him before he died on 28 June 202, leaving his domain to be contested by his sons and Cao Cao.

Immediately after Yuan Shao&#x27;s death, Shen Pei and Pang Ji, two influential advisers, supported Yuan Shang and pushed for him to succeed Yuan Shao, despite opposition from Yuan Tan. Yuan Shao&#x27;s wife, Lady Liu, supported Yuan Shang, and Yuan Tan could not do anything to change the outcome when he rushed back from Qing Province. Then, Lady Liu, being in control of the Yuan household after her husband&#x27;s death, killed Yuan Shao&#x27;s other five consorts out of jealousy and disfigured them. True to Ju Shou&#x27;s previous warning, chaos ensued within Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces. Cao Cao exploited the internal turmoil within the Yuan family to his advantage and completely eliminated Yuan Shao&#x27;s heirs and remnants by 207.

Cao Cao paid his respects at Yuan Shao&#x27;s tomb after conquering Ye city in 204. He wept bitterly for his old friend in front of his followers and gave Yuan Shao&#x27;s family consolatory gifts and a government pension.

<text>Komárom (Hungarian: ; or ; , later ; ) is a city in Hungary on the south bank of the Danube in Komárom-Esztergom County. Komárom fortress played an important role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and many contemporary English sources refer to it as the Fortress of Comorn. On the south bank of the Danube, Komárom was formerly a separate village called Újszőny. On the northern bank of the Danube Komárom and Újszőny were connected with an iron bridge in 1892 and the two towns were united under the name city of Komárom in 1896. On 4 June 1920 the Treaty of Trianon split the city in two because the borders of Czechoslovakia were determined by the river Danube. This division separated the historical Komárom county of the Kingdom of Hungary and the city of Komárom. The bigger northern part of the city was attached to Czechoslovakia, renamed Komárno, its created a sizable Hungarian minority in present-day Slovakia. The southern part of the city, lying south of the Danube, remained in Hungary. On 2 November 1938 by the First Vienna Award, the northern part of the city was returned to Hungary and the divided Komárom reunified. At the end of World War II the city was again divided between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, Komárno is in today&#x27;s Slovakia on the northern bank of the Danube. 

== History ==

Following the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries, Prince Árpád gave Komárom and the Komárom county vicinity to tribal chieftain Ketel. Ketel was the first known ancestor of the famous Koppán (genus) clan. At the beginning of the 12th century, this tribe founded the town&#x27;s Benedictine Monastery in honor of the Blessed Virgin, mentioned in 1222 by the name of Monostorium de Koppán. The Turks destroyed much of the monastery and its surroundings in 1529, and the area was thus depopulated. Later references refer to it as the Pioneer Monastery (Pusztamonostor). Presently, it is called Koppánymonostor (Koppán&#x27;s Monastery) in honor of its founding family. Roman ruins (including a stone mile marker and watchtowers) still stand today.

The town was heavily damaged in the 1763 Komárom earthquake.

Between 1850 and 1871 the Fort Monostor (Monostori Erőd) was built nearby. 

On 10 January 1919 the Czechoslovak army occupied the northern part of the city. On 30 April an unsuccessful Hungarian attempt was made to recapture that part of the city. On 4 June 1920 Hungary was forced to sign the Treaty of Trianon recognizing the new imposed borders including the border with Czechoslovakia. The loss of Upper-Hungary created a sizable Hungarian minority in Slovakia. The Treaty of Trianon split the city in two, the state of Czechoslovakia was formed the borders of the country on the river Danube divided the historical Komárom county and the city of Komárom. The northern part of the city, which was the bigger part of the city, became part of Czechoslovakia, the town on the northern shore was renamed to Komárno. After setting up the Czechoslovak administration, the ethnic composition of Komárno partially changed, but the Hungarians still outnumbered the Slovak population. During the years of the First Czechoslovak Republic, Komárno became the cultural and social centre of the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia. The southern part of the city remained in Hungary, called Komárom-Újváros, was for a few years the seat of the truncated Komárom County. During the interwar period, it was possible to travel between Komárom and Komárno with a passport, the only restriction was that the bridge was closed at 23:00, and people had to get back by then. On 2 November 1938 by the First Vienna Award, Komárno was returned to Hungary and the divided Komárom reunified and became a county town once again. Regent of Kingdom of Hungary, Miklós Horthy receiving a tumultuous welcome from the citizens as he crossed the old bridge and entered the formerly dismembered part. During the World War II it was bombarded many times. At the end of war the city was again divided between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

After World War II the occupying Soviets built the country&#x27;s biggest ammunition storage in the Fortress of Monostor. Thousands of wagons of ammunition were forwarded from this strictly guarded area. One of a series of forts, the Monostor is today open to the public as a museum.

Komárom and Komárno are connected by two bridges: The older iron bridge, and a newer lifting bridge. Currently a third bridge is under construction with estimated completion by 2020/2021. The vast majority of its funding coming from the European Union&#x27;s Connecting Europe Facility.

The two towns used to be a border crossing between Czechoslovakia (today Slovakia) and Hungary, until both countries became part of the Schengen Area, resulting in all immigration and customs checks being lifted on 12 December 2007.

<doc id="459390" wikidata="Q808608" url="?curid=459390" title="Baron Dacre">
<text>Baron Dacre is a title that has been created three times in the Peerage of England, each time by writ.

==History==
The first creation came in 1321, when Ralph Dacre was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre. He married Margaret, 2nd Baroness Multon of Gilsland, heiress of a large estate in Cumbria centred on Naworth Castle and lands in North Yorkshire around what is now Castle Howard. However, the status of the Multon barony is uncertain after Margaret&#x27;s death in 1361. Lord Dacre&#x27;s younger son, the third Baron, was murdered in 1375. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. The latter&#x27;s grandson was Thomas Dacre, the sixth Baron.

The second creation was when the sixth Baron&#x27;s second son (Ralph Dacre) was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre (of Gilsland) in 1459 (see below). However, this new creation became extinct on his death in 1461, having been killed at the Battle of Towton and buried in the churchyard of nearby All Saints&#x27; Church, Saxton, Yorkshire, where survives his inscribed chest tomb. It&#x27;s alleged that he was buried with his horse and the vertebrae of a horse was found extending into Dacre’s grave during the 19th century. 

The third creation was when the sixth Baron&#x27;s third son (Humphrey Dacre) was summoned to Parliament as Lord Dacre (of Gilsland) in 1482 (for more information on this creation, see below).

The sixth Baron was succeeded by his granddaughter Joan, the seventh Baroness, the only surviving child of the sixth Baron&#x27;s eldest son Sir Thomas Dacre (1410–1448). She was the wife of Sir Richard Fiennes of Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex. Richard was summoned to Parliament in 1459 as Lord Dacre in right of his wife.

Thus after Thomas Dacre&#x27;s death in 1458, there were two lines of Barons Dacre simultaneously, confirmed by King Edward IV. One line descending from his deceased eldest son&#x27;s daughter which were known as his &quot;heirs general&quot; and were the Fiennes peers, seated in Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex. They were known as &quot;Baron Dacre of the South&quot;. As his first and second sons were deceased, the second line of Dacres descended from his third son, Humphrey, and were known as his &quot;heirs male&quot;. They were seated at Naworth Castle and Gilsland in Cumberland and were known as &quot;Baron Dacre of the North&quot;. This distinction came to an end in 1569, when the Gilsland title became abeyant due to George Dacre, 5th Baron Dacre dying in an accident as a child. His sisters inherited the Dacre properties in the north of England which then came under the control of the Duke of Norfolk following their marriages into the Howard family. From 1569 onwards, the title of Baron Dacre simply continued in the Sussex line until the 17th century when the title of Baron Dacre of Gilsland was recreated for Charles Howard (see further below for details). 

The great-great-grandson of the 7th Baroness, the ninth Baron, was a member of the jury at the trial of Anne Boleyn in 1536 and in 1537 attended the baptism of Prince Edward and bore the canopy at Queen Jane&#x27;s funeral. However in 1541 he went on an illegal night-time hunting party to kill deer with others. During this escapade, a gamekeeper saw them and in the ensuing melee the gamekeeper was killed. Despite initially pleading not guilty he and his companions were persuaded to plead gulity and, as they were royal favourites, throw themselves upon the king&#x27;s mercy in the hope of a reprieve. However this did not happen and Fiennes was convicted of murder and executed, whereupon his title was forfeited. However, his son Gregory was restored to the title in 1558. He was succeeded by his sister Margaret, the eleventh Baroness, the wife of Sampson Lennard. Their great-grandson, the fourteenth Baron, married Elizabeth Bayning, daughter of Paul Bayning, first Viscount Bayning of Sudbury, who in 1674 (after the title had become extinct) was created Viscountess Bayning for life.

Their son, Thomas Lennard, 15th Baron Dacre, was created Earl of Sussex in 1674. He married Anne Fitzroy eldest daughter of Barbara Villiers, mistress to King Charles II. However, his earldom became extinct on his death in 1715, while the barony of Dacre fell into abeyance between his two daughters, Barbara and Anne. When Barbara died childless in 1741, the abeyance was terminated the same year in favour of Anne, the 16th Baroness. She was married three times, firstly to Richard Barrett, secondly to Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham, and thirdly to the Hon. Robert Moore, son of Henry Hamilton-Moore, 3rd Earl of Drogheda (younger son of the first Earl of Drogheda).

The 16th Baroness was succeeded by Thomas Lennard, the 17th Baron, her son from her first marriage. He died without legitimate issue and was succeeded by his nephew, the 18th Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Roper, son of the late Lady Dacre&#x27;s second marriage to Lord Teynham (the barony of Teynham had been passed on to a son from an earlier marriage of Lord Teynham). On his death, the title passed to his sister Gertrude, the 19th Baroness. She was the wife of Thomas Brand.

The 19th Baroness was succeeded by her son, the 20th Baron. He notably represented Hertfordshire in the House of Commons. His younger brother, the 21st Baron, was a General in the Army. In 1824 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Trevor in lieu of Brand. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 22nd Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. When he died, the title passed to his younger brother, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden, who became the 23rd Baron Dacre as well.

The barony remained a subsidiary title of the viscountcy until the death of his great-grandson, the fourth Viscount and 26th Baron, in 1965. The fourth Viscount was succeeded in the viscountcy by his younger brother while, the barony fell into abeyance between his two surviving daughters, the Hon. Rachel Leila Douglas-Home and the Hon. Tessa Mary Thompson. The abeyance was terminated in 1970 in favour of the elder daughter, the 27th holder of the title. She married the Hon. William Douglas-Home, second son of Charles Cospatrick Archibald Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home, and younger brother of Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home. the title is held by her granddaughter, the 29th Baroness, who succeeded her father in 2014.

As mentioned above, the second creation of the barony came in 1459 in favour of Ralph Dacre, second son of the sixth Baron of the first creation, and became extinct on his death in 1461. The third creation came in 1482 in favour of Humphrey Dacre, third son of the sixth Baron of the first creation. This title fell into abeyance on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. In 1651 the title of Baron Dacre of Gilsland was recreated for Charles Howard, who was made Earl of Carlisle at the same time. He was the great-grandson of Elizabeth Dacre, daughter of the 4th Baron Dacre of the 1482 creation. For more information on this creation, see Earl of Carlisle.

The noted historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, was the great-great-great-grandson of the Rev. and Hon. Richard Henry Roper, second and youngest son of Anne, 16th Baroness Dacre, from her second marriage to Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham. For this reason, he chose Dacre of Glanton as the title of the life peerage which he was awarded in 1979.

Thomas Barrett-Lennard, illegitimate son of Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 17th Baron Dacre, was created a baronet in 1801 (see Barrett-Lennard baronets of Belhus for more information).

<text>Hazen Robert Argue (January 6, 1921 – October 2, 1991) was a Canadian politician who served in the House of Commons and the Senate. He was first elected as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) Member of Parliament (MP) in 1945 and was the last leader of the party, from 1960 to 1961. He crossed the floor to the Liberal Party in 1962 and was defeated in 1963. In 1966 he was appointed to the Senate. He entered the federal cabinet in 1980, as the only Saskatchewan representative, with responsibilities for the Canadian Wheat Board. He is well known for being a strong proponent of the proposed Canadian annexation of the Turks and Caicos Islands. He was the first senator ever to have been charged with fraud, in 1989. The charges were eventually dropped.

==CCF/NDP MP==
His family owned a farm, which he worked until he entered the House of Commons. He was first elected to Parliament in 1945 as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). At 24 years of age, he was the youngest MP at that time. After the Diefenbaker sweep of 1958, Argue was one of only eight CCFers remaining in Parliament and the only one from Saskatchewan. Party leader M. J. Coldwell lost his seat, and the CCF parliamentary caucus chose Argue as their House Leader. After Coldwell resigned as the national CCF leader in 1960, Argue was elected leader at the party&#x27;s last convention in the summer of 1960.

At the time, the CCF was engaged in a three-year plan to create a new party from the union between itself and organized labour forces as represented by the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). Both the CCF and CLC executives approved going down this route starting in April 1958. Argue, like many grassroot CCFers, was not convinced that this merger was necessarily the best route to revitalizing the party. As an organizing tool during this period, the organization was called the New Party. New Party clubs sprung up around the country between 1958 and 1961. On October 31, 1960, Walter Pitman won a stunning by-election victory in Peterborough under the banner of the New Party. This gave credibility to the forces organizing to remodel the CCF along the British Labour Party model. Argue became a candidate in the race to be the first leader of the newly formed NDP at their August 3, 1961 leadership convention. He was up against long-time Saskatchewan Premier, and CCF favourite-son, Tommy Douglas. Douglas had the support of the CLC, its president Claude Jodoin and CCF president David Lewis. Douglas easily defeated him 1,391 votes to 380 votes on a single ballot. In his concession speech, Argue declared, &quot;No matter what my role is in the years ahead, I shall speak for you. I shall work for you, I shall never let you down.&quot; He remained in the party&#x27;s caucus, in the House of Commons, for the rest of the year, having little contact with Douglas in that time.

==Liberal Party MP and Senator==

Six months later, Argue crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party; he argued that divisions were rife in the NDP and that farmers&#x27; interests were overwhelmed by those of labour. He was re-elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) in 1962 but was defeated in 1963 and again in 1965. In 1966, Argue was appointed to the Senate as a Liberal.

After the 1980 election, in which the Liberal Party failed to win any seats west of Winnipeg, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Argue to Cabinet as Minister of State (Canada Wheat Board).

In 1989, he became the first senator ever charged with misuse of public funds and fraud. The RCMP alleged that he used public funds to help his wife&#x27;s bid to obtain the Liberal Party nomination in their Ottawa-area riding for the 1988 Canadian federal election. The charges were dropped in 1991 by the crown prosecutor when it became apparent that Argue was near death, as he had been bedridden for most of the year with cancer. He died three months later in Regina, on October 2, 1991.

<text>Yan Liang () (died 200) was a military general serving under the warlord Yuan Shao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was slain by Guan Yu at the Battle of Boma.

==Life==

Little is known about Yan Liang&#x27;s life. The only historical records about him could be found in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in the biographies of Yuan Shao, Guan Yu, Xun Yu and Cao Cao. By the time he becomes focus of any attention in the records, he had made a name along with Wen Chou as a figure celebrated for his bravery.

In 200, the alliance between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had turned to war with Yuan Shao led a major army against Cao Cao for the campaign of Guandu. Some in Cao Cao&#x27;s camp where concerned about the war, the scholar and critic Kong Rong listing Yan Liang and Wen Chou&#x27;s bravery as reasons to worry but Xun Yu dismissed it as bravery of a common sort that could easily be dealt with. As Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces marched to Liyang, to ensure a safe crossing of the Yellow River, he intended to send forces across to the south bank to attack Boma (northeast of present-day Hua County, Henan), under Administrator of Dong Liu Yan, to set a foothold on the southern bank of the river. His adviser Ju Shou warned him that Yan Liang was valiant yet too narrow-minded to handle the responsibility alone while more senior commanders Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong were sent, possibly to supervise Yan Liang&#x27;s operation 

Early in the summer, Cao Cao took the advice of Xun You moved his main force westwards along the Yellow River to Yan Crossing, diverting Yuan Shao&#x27;s army in the same direction. Cao Cao led a light force to Boma in a forced march, catching Yan Liang by surprise. Yan Liang led his forces to meet Cao Cao over 10 li (over 4 km) from Boma and Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu as vanguard to fight. During the ensuing battle, Guan Yu identified Yan Liang in the enemy ranks, rode into the midst of Yan Liang&#x27;s army and killed him then fought his way back out. With Yan Liang dead, the army at Boma collapsed.

Cao Cao would withdraw from Boma, taking the resources off the area back to Guandu and would be pursued by the cavalry forces of Wen Chou and Liu Bei. The ambush and killing of Wen Chou in the resulting battle meant that in the first skirmishes, two of Yuan Shao&#x27;s famed officers were killed and it was noted to have a demoralizing impact on Yuan army morale.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Yuan Shao praises Yan Liang&#x27;s prowess in battle when he laments, as coalition forces see many champions killed by Hua Xiong, that &quot;If I had either Yan Liang or Wen Chou here, I would have nothing to fear.&quot; When Yuan Shao confronts Sun Jian over taking the imperial seal, Yan Liang and Wen Chou are there. When Han Fu surrenders Ji to Yuan Shao, loyalists Geng Wu and Min Chun attempted to assassinate Yuan Shao before he can arrive but the plot was foiled with Yan Liang and Wen Chou killing the plotters in the aftermath. When Lü Bu sought Yuan Shao&#x27;s support after failure to take Yan from Cao Cao, Yan Liang was sent with 50,000 men to attack Lu Bu who then fled to Xu.

The Hua Xiong comment (the novel does have Xun Yu&#x27;s dismissive comment and Ju Shou&#x27;s concerns) foreshadows Yan Liang&#x27;s first appearance in Chapter 25, where Yuan Shao deploys him as the commander of a vanguard force of 100,000 to take Boma in a conflict with rival warlord Cao Cao. Cao Cao quickly leads 50,000 and come to Boma&#x27;s defence. True to his lord&#x27;s compliments, Yan Liang slays two of Cao Cao&#x27;s recently acquired warriors from the victory over Lu Bu, Song Xian (宋憲) lasted three and Wei Xu (魏續) is killed in one bout, and defeats Xu Huang after twenty bounts, demoralizing Cao Cao&#x27;s forces.

Following Cheng Yu&#x27;s advice, Cao Cao then summoned Guan Yu to the frontline to deal with Yan Liang. The next day, as Yan Liang&#x27;s troops lined up on the battlefield, Guan Yu sat beside Cao Cao on a hilltop to observe the enemy, Guan Yu was dismissive of what he saw and tells a surprised Cao Cao he can easily take Yan Liang&#x27;s head. Riding Red Hare, Guan Yu charged right through the enemy ranks towards Yan Liang who was uncertain of who was approaching him, decapitates him in a swift stroke and returned to Cao Cao&#x27;s camp in triumph with Yan Liang&#x27;s head. Yan Liang&#x27;s army collapsed and were slaughtered by Cao Cao&#x27;s pursuing force. When news reached Yuan Shao, he nearly killed Liu Bei for what Guan Yu had done believing it to be a plot while Wen Chou sought command of the next army to avenge a man he saw as a brother.

Guan Yu&#x27;s killings of Yan Liang and Wen Chou would be mentioned in the novel as others like Zhou Yu looked in awe of the slayer of such champions but after Guan Yu&#x27;s death, his angry spirit is rebuked by a priest for the manner of the slaying of those two men and the guardian&#x27;s of the five passes who he had slain when returning to Liu Bei from Cao Cao&#x27;s service.

<text>Zakrzewo () () is a village in Złotów County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, in north-central Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Zakrzewo. It lies approximately north-east of Złotów and north of the regional capital Poznań.

A Blues Express festival is organized in Zakrzewo every July by the local culture centre.

== History ==

The territory became a part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. Zakrzewo was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Nakło County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. It was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. According to the census of 1900, Zakrzewo had a population of 1,124, of which 78.1% were Poles. Zakrzewo had a very strong and active Polish community, headed by the parson of a local parish, Bolesław Domański. A Polish elementary school, kindergarten and community center were located there. In 1909, the Polish &quot;Bank Ludowy&quot; was founded in the village.

In 1935, Nazi Germany changed the village&#x27;s name to &quot;Buschdorf&quot; in attempt to erase traces of Polish origin. In 1939, German persecution of Poles intensified. Local Polish activist Marcin Łangowski was expelled, and the local Polish community center was attacked by the Germans. The Polish school and Polish bank continued to resist German harassment, however, the Germans soon arrested local Polish teachers and the chairman of the local Polish bank&#x27;s governance board, who were afterwards deported to concentration camps. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, in 1945, the village became again part of Poland and its historic name was restored.

==Transport==
There is a train station in Zakrzewo, and the voivodeship road 188 runs through the village.

==Sports==
The local football club is Jedność Zakrzewo. It competes in the lower leagues.

==Notable residents==

<doc id="459396" wikidata="Q562930" url="?curid=459396" title="Ryokan">
<text>A is a type of traditional Japanese inn that typically features &quot;tatami&quot;-matted rooms, communal baths, and other public areas where visitors may wear nemaki and talk with the owner. Ryokan have existed since the eighth century A.D. during the Keiun period, which is when the oldest hotel in the world, Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, was created in 705 A.D. Another old ryokan called Hōshi Ryokan was founded in 718 A.D. and was also known as the world&#x27;s second-oldest hotel. Such inns also served travelers along Japan&#x27;s highways.

Ryokan are hard to find in Tokyo and other large cities because many are often much more expensive compared with modern hotels and hostels. Although hotels have become standard in Japanese urban tourism, some major cities do offer ryokan with competitive rates. Traditional ryokan are more commonly found in areas with natural hot springs, and in recent years, many ryokan have been redeveloped to their original style, particularly by resort chains Hoshino Resorts, whose first ryokan opened in Karuizawa in 1914.

==Features==
A typical ryokan has a relatively large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and doors are sliding doors. Even if the inn uses hinged doors for security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a sliding door. Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a sliding door.

Almost all ryokan feature common bathing areas or ofuro, usually segregated by gender, using the water from a hot spring (&quot;onsen&quot;) if any are nearby. Areas with natural hot springs tend to attract high concentrations of ryokan. High-end ryokan may provide private bathing facilities as well. Typically ryokan provide guests with a yukata to wear; they might also have games such as table tennis, and possibly geta that visitors can borrow for strolls outside.

Bedding is a futon spread out on the tatami floor. When guests first enter their room, they usually find a table and some supplies for making tea. The table is also used for meals when guests take them in their room. While guests are out, staff (usually called &quot;nakai&quot;) will move the table aside and set out the futon.

==Meals==

Most ryokan offer dinner and breakfast, which are often included in the price of the room. Most visitors take their meals at the ryokan, which usually promote themselves on the quality of their food. Meals typically consist of traditional Japanese cuisine known as &quot;kaiseki&quot;, which features seasonal and regional specialties. &quot;Kaiseki&quot; originally referred to light meals served during a tea ceremony, and today refers to a meal consisting of a number of small, varied dishes. Some ryokan instead serve local specialties such as &quot;basashi&quot; or food cooked in an &quot;irori&quot; hearth. So that each dish can be enjoyed at the proper temperature, ryokan stress that guests should be punctual for their meals. For this reason, most ryokan ask guests to confirm the time they want to take their meals.

Some ryokan have a communal dining area, but most serve meals in the guests&#x27; rooms. Ryokan that are likely to serve non-Japanese guests may also have a selection of Western food.

==&quot;Minshuku&quot;==
 are a low-budget version of ryokan, roughly equivalent to a British boarding house or a bed and breakfast. The facilities are similar to a hotel or may simply consist of spare rooms in a family home. Minshuku often serve as the only type of accommodation in towns or villages too small to warrant a dedicated hotel or ryokan. The overall experience is much the same, but the food is simpler, dining may be optional and is often communal, rooms usually lack a private toilet, and guests may have to lay out their own bedding.

<text>Xun Yu (163–212), courtesy name Wenruo, was a Chinese military official and politician who served as an adviser to the warlord Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==Early life==
Xun Yu was from Yingchuan Commandery (around present-day Xuchang, Henan), and was born into a family of government officials. He was described in historical records as a tall and handsome gentleman. His grandfather, Xun Shu, served as a local governor and had eight sons who were nicknamed the &quot;Eight Dragons of the Xun Family&quot;; an uncle of Xun Yu, Xun Shuang, served as one of the Three Ducal Ministers, while Xun Yu&#x27;s father Xun Gun was the chancellor of the principality of Jibei.

Xun Yu proved to be a talented youth and was evaluated by the scholar He Yong as &quot;someone capable of assisting kings&quot; (). In 189, he was nominated as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; (civil service candidate) and began his career in the civil service. When the warlord Dong Zhuo seized control of the capital Luoyang, Xun Yu feared for his safety and resigned, returning to Ji Province (present-day Hebei).

In the subsequent years, warlords quickly rose in each region; Xun Yu first served Yuan Shao, whose power base was in Ji Province, but later left him and went to serve Cao Cao in 191. Cao Cao recognised Xun Yu&#x27;s talent and he exclaimed, &quot;Here comes my Zifang!&quot; When Xun Yu arrived, he appointed Xun as an army commandant.

==Service under Cao Cao==
Xun Yu&#x27;s contributions to Cao Cao&#x27;s forces and administration are immense. On one hand he recommended many other men of calibre to Cao Cao, including Xun You (his second cousin-nephew), Chen Qun, Zhong Yao, Guo Jia and Sima Yi, creating a body of advisors around Cao; at the same time he participated in several battles and major events of the era, often giving timely advice to his lord. Cao Cao, in turn, respected Xun Yu greatly and placed a great store in his advice.

In 194, as Cao Cao led a campaign against Tao Qian in Xu Province, his home base at Yan Province was suddenly attacked by Lü Bu. Two of Cao&#x27;s officials, Chen Gong and Zhang Miao, chose to defect to Lü Bu. At that time Xun Yu was in charge of the defences of Juancheng (), and his firm actions saved the city from capture, allowing Cao Cao&#x27;s armies to return and drive away Lü Bu. Subsequently, on the death of Tao Qian, Cao Cao was tempted to turn around and move to Xu Province before returning to deal with Lü Bu; it was Xun Yu who dissuaded him from this, reminding him that Yan Province was his heartland and power base and should be secured first before launching campaigns abroad.

It was also at Xun Yu&#x27;s suggestion that Cao Cao chose to escort Emperor Xian, who was then living in the ruins of Luoyang, to his base at Xu (present-day Xuchang, Henan) in 196, taking on the role of protecting the emperor. Xun Yu&#x27;s plan was to &quot;control the insubordinate in the name of the emperor&quot; (); the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; subtly distorts this to &quot;hold the emperor hostage to control the nobles&quot; (). In the long run, this strategy would give Cao Cao a considerable political advantage over his rivals, allowing him to legitimise his actions by taking them in the emperor&#x27;s name.

In 200, Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate against Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu for months, eventually exhausting his food supply; while contemplating retreat he sent a letter to Xun Yu (who was then defending Xu) for advice. Xun Yu dissuaded Cao Cao with a letter, highlighting several advantages that his army held over Yuan Shao&#x27;s forces and urging him to stand fast; the eventual result was a decisive victory for Cao Cao, which was crucial to his domination of northern China.

==Death and posthumous honors==
In 212, Dong Zhao and a group of Cao Cao loyalists submitted a memorial to Emperor Xian proposing that Cao should be granted the title of a duke. This proposal was significant as it would allow Cao Cao to set up a self-contained feudal state within the Han dynasty. Up to this point, Cao Cao&#x27;s political legitimacy was only underpinned by his position as the chancellor. Xun Yu, whose ideals were for Cao Cao to continue being the protector of the Han dynasty, opposed Dong Zhao&#x27;s proposal.

Knowing that Dong Zhao was probably a conduit for Cao Cao when approached by the former for his support, Xun Yu told Dong that Cao&#x27;s personal mission was one of restoring the Han dynasty and would not approve of such a move – thus possibly hinting to Cao that he should abandon the idea. Xun Yu&#x27;s remarks greatly displeased Cao Cao.

Following this, Xun Yu was sent to Qiao to reward the soldiers who took part in a military campaign against Sun Quan in November 212. While there, Xun Yu was said to have fallen sick and was brought to Shouchun (寿春; present-day Shou County, Anhui) for treatment and recuperation. He died later that year (late 212 or early 213). The circumstances of his death aroused great suspicion and is a matter of debate as it came closely after his opposition towards Cao Cao&#x27;s ascension to duke.

Xun Yu was given the posthumous name &quot;Jing&quot; (敬). More than 50 years after his death, in 265, he was posthumously granted the title of Grand Commandant.

==In popular culture==

In Koei&#x27;s video game &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires&quot;, fans voted in the Facebook and Twitter poll for one of the new officers to have the name Xun Yu. Xun Yu became a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires&quot;.

In Koei&#x27;s &quot;Kessen II&quot;, Xun Yu plays a prominent role, although the character is portrayed as a woman who harbours a requited love for Cao Cao. In the visual novel and anime series &quot;Koihime Musō&quot;, Jun&#x27;iku (Xun Yu&#x27;s Japanese name) also serves as a strategist to Sōsō (Cao Cao) and has a huge crush on her.

In Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s Magic the Gathering Card Game, Xun Yu has a Magic Card &quot;Xun Yu, Wei Advisor&quot; from a set called Portal Three Kingdoms. He is shown opening a container in his artwork and wearing traditional clothing for an advisor from the Han dynasty. His quote says, &quot;A splendid talent, admired of all men! His folly lay in serving Cao Cao&#x27;s Power.&quot;

Xun Yu appeared in Total War: Three Kingdoms, serving under Han Fu before joining Cao Cao.

<doc id="459402" wikidata="Q227779" url="?curid=459402" title="Pinus lambertiana">
<text>Pinus lambertiana (commonly known as the sugar pine or sugar cone pine) is the tallest and most massive pine tree and has the longest cones of any conifer. It is native to coastal and inland mountain areas along the Pacific coast of North America, as far north as Oregon and as far south as Baja California in Mexico.

==Description==

=== Growth ===
The sugar pine is the tallest and largest &quot;Pinus&quot; species, commonly growing to tall, exceptionally to tall, with a trunk diameter of , exceptionally . The tallest recorded specimen is tall, is located in Yosemite National Park, and was discovered in 2015. The second tallest recorded was &quot;Yosemite Giant&quot;, an tall specimen in Yosemite National Park, which died from a bark beetle attack in 2007. Yosemite National Park also has the third tallest, measured to tall as of June 2013; the Rim Fire affected this specimen, but it survived. The next tallest known living specimens grow in southern Oregon: one in Umpqua National Forest is tall and another in Siskiyou National Forest is tall. 
The bark of &quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot; ranges from brown to purple in color and is thick. The upper branches can reach out over . Like all members of the white pine group (&quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;), the leaves (&quot;needles&quot;) grow in fascicles (&quot;bundles&quot;) of five with a deciduous sheath. They are long. Sugar pine is notable for having the longest cones of any conifer, mostly long, exceptionally to long (although the cones of the Coulter pine are more massive); their unripe weight of makes them perilous projectiles when chewed off by squirrels. The seeds are long, with a long wing that aids their dispersal by wind. Sugar pine never grows in pure stands, always in a mixed forest, and is shade tolerant in its youth.

=== Distribution ===
The sugar pine occurs in Oregon and California in the Western United States southward to Baja California, specifically in the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, and Sierra San Pedro Martir. It is generally more abundant towards the south and can be found between above sea level.

===Genome===
The massive 31 gigabase mega-genome of sugar pine has been sequenced in 2016 by the large PineRefSeq consortium. This makes the genome one of the largest sequenced and assembled so far.

The transposable elements that make up the megagenome are linked to the evolutionary change of the sugar pine. The sugar pine contains extended regions of non-coding DNA, most of which is derived from transposable elements. The genome of the sugar pine represents one extreme in all plants, with a stable diploid genome that is expanded by the proliferation of transposable elements, in contrast to the frequent polyploidization events in angiosperms.

=== Embryonal growth ===
In late stage of embryonal development, the sugar pine embryo changes from a smooth and narrow paraboloid to a less symmetric structure. This configuration is caused by a transverse orientation of division planes in the upper portion of the embryo axis. The root initial zone is established, and the epicotyl develops as an anlage flanked by regions of that define the cotyledonary buttresses. At this stage, the embryo is composed of the suspensor, root initials and root cap region, hypocotyl-shoot axis, and the epicotyl. The upper (distal) portion of the embryo, which gives rise to the cotyledons and the epicotyl, is considered to be the shoot apex.

=== Shoot apex ===
The shoot apex has the following four zones:
#The apical initials produce all cells of the shoot apex through cell division. It is located at the top of the meristem and the cells are larger in size compared to other cells on the surface layer.
#The central mother cell generates the rib meristem and the inner layers of the peripheral tissue zone through cell division. It presents a typical gymnosperm appearance and is characterized by cell expansion and unusual mitosis that occurs in the central region. The rate of mitosis increases on its outer edge. 
#The peripheral tissue zone consists of two layers of cells that are characterized by dense cytoplasm and mitosis of high frequency.
#Lastly, the rib meristem is a regular arrangement of vertical files of cells which mature into the pith of the axis.

==Etymology==
Naturalist John Muir considered sugar pine to be the &quot;king of the conifers&quot;. The common name comes from the sweet resin, which Native Americans used as a sweetener. John Muir found it preferable to maple sugar. It is also known as the great sugar pine. The scientific name was assigned by David Douglas in 1826, in honor of his friend, a botanist friend from London: Aylmer Bourke Lambert.

==Ecology==
=== Wildlife ===
The large size and high nutritional value of the sugar pine seeds are appealing to many species. Yellow pine chipmunks (&quot;Neotamias amoenus&quot;) and Steller&#x27;s jays (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;) gather and hoard sugar pine seeds. Chipmunks gather wind-dispersed seeds from the ground and store them in large amounts. Jays collect seeds by pecking the cones with their beaks and catching the seeds as they fall out. Although wind is a main dispersal agent of sugar pine seeds, animals tend to collect and store them before the wind can blow them far.

Black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) feed on sugar pine seeds in the fall months within the Sierra Nevada. Both sugar pine and oak species are currently in decline, directly affecting black bear food sources within the Sierra Nevada.

=== Threats ===
Sugar pine trees have been impacted by the mountain pine beetle (&quot;Dendroctonus ponderosae&quot;), which is native to western North America. The beetles lay their eggs inside of the tree and inhibit the tree&#x27;s ability to defend itself against invading species. Beetle infestation can also cause nutrient deficiencies that slowly weaken the tree&#x27;s overall health, making pines more susceptible to other threats such as fires and white pine blister rust. Blister rust can weaken the tree and enable further infestation by mountain pine beetles.

The sugar pine has been severely affected by the white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;), a fungal pathogen accidentally introduced from Europe in 1909. A high proportion of sugar pines have been killed by the blister rust, particularly in the northern part of the species&#x27; range where blister rust has been present longer. The rust has also destroyed much of the Western white pine and whitebark pine throughout their ranges. The U.S. Forest Service has a program for developing rust-resistant varieties of sugar pine and western white pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild. The Sugar Pine Foundation in the Lake Tahoe Basin has been successful in finding resistant sugar pine seed trees. Blister rust is much less common in California, where sugar, Western white and whitebark pines still survive in great numbers.

The species is generally resistant to fire because of its thick bark and because it clears away competing species. However, its mortality has been directly linked to drier conditions and higher temperatures. Climate change presents a threat to species health: higher temperatures can decrease resin levels within the trees, weakening defenses against pathogens. At the same time, warmer winters increase survival of pests and pathogens. The weakened or dying trees then provide fuel for forest fires, which may become more frequent and more intense with rising summer temperatures, particularly if coupled with drier conditions and stronger winds.

=== Protective efforts ===
Sugar pine trees are in slow decline due to several threats: white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetles, and climate change. Efforts to restore sugar pines and other white pine trees that have been impacted by invasive species, climate change, and fires have been undertaken by governmental and non-governmental entities. One nonprofit, the Sugar Pine Foundation, was created in 2004 to plant sugar pine seeds in the Sierra Nevada along the border of California and Nevada. They plant seedlings grown from seeds collected from tree strains resistant to blister rust. The foundation&#x27;s aim is to build a wild a sugar pine population that is resistant to white pine rust.

==Uses==
According to David Douglas, who was guided to the (exceptionally thick) tree specimen he was looking for by a Native American, some tribes ate the sweetish seeds. These were eaten raw and roasted, and also used to make flour or pulverized into a spread. Native Americans also ate the inner bark. The sweet sap or pitch was consumed, in small quantities due to its laxative properties, but could also be chewed as gum. Its flavor is thought largely to be derived from the pinitol it contains.

In the mid-19th century, the trees were used liberally as lumber during the California Gold Rush. In modern times they are used in much lower quantities, being spared for high-end products as with Western white pine.

The odorless wood is also preferred for packing fruit, as well as storing drugs and other goods. Its straight grain also makes it a useful organ pipe material. The wood was also long used for piano keys; in 1907 or 1908 the Connection piano-action maker Pratt, Read &amp; Co. purchased &quot;950,000 feet of clear sugar pine&quot; for that use in &amp; around Placerville, CA.

==Folklore==
In the Achomawi creation myth, Annikadel, the creator, makes one of the &#x27;First People&#x27; by intentionally dropping a sugar pine seed in a place where it can grow. One of the descendants in this ancestry is Sugarpine-Cone man, who has a handsome son named Ahsoballache.

After Ahsoballache marries the daughter of To&#x27;kis the Chipmunk-woman, his grandfather insists that the new couple have a child. To this end, the grandfather breaks open a scale from a sugar pine cone, and secretly instructs Ahsoballache to immerse the scale&#x27;s contents in spring water, then hide them inside a covered basket. Ahsoballache performs the tasks that night; at the next dawn, he and his wife discover the infant Edechewe near their bed.

The Washo language has a word for sugar pine, , and also a word for &quot;sugar pine sugar&quot;, .

<text>Edward Charles Pickering (July 19, 1846 – February 3, 1919) was an American astronomer and physicist and the older brother of William Henry Pickering. Along with Carl Vogel, Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary stars. He wrote &quot;Elements of Physical Manipulations&quot; (2 vol., 1873–76).

== Personal life ==
Pickering was born at 43 Bowdoin Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 19, 1846, to a distinguished, cultivated family consisting of his brother, William Henry Pickering, father, Edward Pickering, and his mother, Charlotte Hammond. Edward&#x27;s brother, William, was a graduate of MIT and professor of physics and astronomy. Edward was interested in the stars as a boy and constructed his own telescope by the age of 12. Pickering enjoyed his work at the observatory, but he also enjoyed mountain climbing and bicycling in earlier days and later he was an interested spectator of football games. He was co-founder and first president of the Appalachian Mountain Club. He was also a lover of classic music. During the first world war he was busy trying to devise useful applications to win the war. The Pickering Polaris Attachment was a device used to determine the range of guns. In 1874, Pickering married Lizzie Wadsworth Sparks, whose father was formerly the President of Harvard. Mrs. Pickering died in 1906, and Edward died in 1919.

==Education==
Pickering was educated at Boston Latin School, and then studied at the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard (now known as the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences), where he received his Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in 1865.

==Career and research==

Immediately upon graduating from Harvard he was hired as an instructor of mathematics there, and a year later he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to be an assistant professor of physics. In 1868, he was made Thayer Professor of Physics, succeeding William Barton Rogers. During the 10 years he was there, he created the first physics lab in America that was designed for students to publish their own findings and research. Pickering named this lab the Rogers Laboratory of Physics and pronounced himself Director of the Laboratory. He resigned as Thayer Professor of Physics in 1877, and was succeeded by Charles R. Cross. Later, Pickering served as director of Harvard College Observatory (HCO) from 1877 to his death in 1919, where he made great leaps forward in the gathering of stellar spectra through the use of photography.

Shortly after the death of college doctor and amateur astronomer Henry Draper, an opportunity presented itself for Pickering. Draper&#x27;s death left the incompletion of his work studying astronomy using photography. Draper had no children to carry on and finish his legacy, so his wife, Mary Anna Draper, planned on finishing his work. Pickering wrote a letter to Mrs. Draper &quot;...pray recollect that if I can in any way advise or aid you, I shall be doing but little to repay Dr. Draper for a friendship which I shall always value, but which can never be replaced.&quot; Mrs. Draper urgently responded and soon dropped off her husband&#x27;s work to Pickering. Pickering concluded that Draper&#x27;s use of photography in astronomy was very promising compared to the traditional method of observation and recording using one&#x27;s eye through instruments. In 1884, a paper on such observations was published with the author &quot;the late Henry Draper&quot;. After receiving criticism from Dr. William Huggins, a friend of Dr. Draper, Pickering began to hire more assistants to strengthen Draper&#x27;s findings. This consequently also strengthened and contributed to Harvard Computers. 

In 1882, he started his appeals for international variable star observations. This was met with opposition, but eventually such a cooperation was realized in the Variable Star Section of the British Astronomical Association and the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). Pickering had a good relationship with the AAVSO and received a gold paper knife with precious stones.

In 1882, Pickering developed a method to photograph the spectra of multiple stars simultaneously by putting a large prism in front of the photographic plate. Using this method, Pickering and his team captured images of over 220,000 stars. This immense amount of photographic research has provided scientists for decades with a seemingly endless library containing the history of every visible star&#x27;s movements. It is said that this research weighs 120 tons due to the size of photographic plates.

He also, along with Williamina Fleming and Annie Jump Cannon, designed a stellar classification system based on an alphabetic system for spectral classes that was first known as the Harvard Stellar Classification and became the basis for the Henry Draper Catalog.

In 1896, Pickering published observations of previously unknown lines in the spectra of the star ζ-Puppis. These lines became known as the Pickering series (or the Pickering–Fowler series) and Pickering attributed them to hydrogen in 1897. Alfred Fowler gave the same attribution to similar lines that he observed in a hydrogen-helium mixture in 1912. Analysis by Niels Bohr included in his &#x27;trilogy&#x27; on atomic structure argued that the spectral lines arose from ionized helium, He+, and not from hydrogen. Fowler was initially-skeptical but was ultimately convinced that Bohr was correct, and by 1915 &quot;spectroscopists had transferred [the Pickering series] definitively [from hydrogen] to helium.&quot; Bohr&#x27;s theoretical work on the Pickering series had demonstrated the need for &quot;a re-examination of problems that seemed already to have been solved within classical theories&quot; and provided important confirmation for his atomic theory.

Pickering is credited with making the Harvard College Observatory known and respected around the world. It continues today to be a well-respected observatory and program.

=== Harvard Computers ===
The Harvard College Observatory was becoming a premiere observatory in the world and with it came the demand for more assistants. These assistants were critical for taking notes, running calculations and performing analytics. College educated women from around the country offered to work for the Harvard Observatory unpaid to gain experience or until proving their value to be paid. During this time, Pickering recruited over 80 women to work for him, including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Antonia Maury, and Florence Cushman. It was very unusual for such an accomplished scientist to work with this many women, but it has been said that he &quot;became so exasperated with his male assistant&#x27;s inefficiency, that even his maid could do a better job of copying and computing&quot;. These women, the Harvard Computers (also described as &quot;Pickering&#x27;s Harem&quot; by the male scientific community at the time), made several important discoveries at HCO. Leavitt&#x27;s discovery of the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids, published by Pickering, would prove the foundation for the modern understanding of cosmological distances.

Pickering&#x27;s treatment of women, during his time, was considered better than most. It is true that they were underpaid compared to their male counterparts and were not given credit nearly as often, but his willingness to include them in the world of astronomy paved the way for many great female scientists and leaders. This added to the observatory&#x27;s funding through fellowships and the procurement of women including alumnus and professors aiding in the creation of Harvard Computers.

==Death and legacy==
Pickering was the fourth and longest-running director of HCO, serving for 42 years. On February 3, 1919, Pickering unexpectedly died at age 72, from pneumonia and heart complications after being ill for around ten days. He died while holding the position of director of the University Observatory continuing an odd 42-year tradition of HCO Directors dying in office. He is interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Solon Bailey served as interim director. Pickering&#x27;s friends and colleges would remember him for his great ability, originality, initiative, and warm-heartedness. Pickering would be remembered by the world for his contribution to astronomical photography, advancement of astronomical discoveries, and his progressive view of women.

Although today his treatment of women is associated with a negative connotation, he was known during the time to give women more equal treatment than most. Doing so paved the way for many more women to become interested and involved in astronomy. Pickering&#x27;s work with glass plates to photograph the sky was the start of major technological advances for astronomical photography. Although glass plates are no longer used, his work led to modern uses of charged coupled devices in the 1970s.

<text>Wen Chou () (died 200) was a military general serving under the warlord Yuan Shao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. His force was defeated by that of rival warlord Cao Cao in the Battle of Yan Ford and he was killed in the midst of battle.

==Life==
Historical records pertaining to Wen Chou are scarce. References to him could be found in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; in the biographies of Yuan Shao, Cao Cao, Xun Yu and Xun You, from where it could be gathered that Wen Chou was a fierce warrior whose prowess in battle matched that of his counterpart, Yan Liang.

In 200, after Yan Liang was killed in the Battle of Boma, Yuan Shao brought his main army south of the Yellow River and launched a full-fledged attack on Cao Cao. Wen Chou and Liu Bei were sent forth with a vanguard force of more than 5,000 riders to pursue Cao Cao&#x27;s retreating forces. Making a stand atop a knoll, Cao Cao retained less than 600 cavalry and let loose the remaining horses.

As Wen Chou&#x27;s troops arrived, many broke ranks to loot the horses and other supplies. Cao Cao then gave order for a counterattack. The small but elite cavalry force scored a brilliant victory over the disorganised enemy and killed Wen Chou in battle.
In the official records, Wen Chou died in battle to unknown assailants, but secondary sources written after the period attribute Guan Yu as the one who slayed Wen Chou.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Wen Chou is said to have a face like that of the &quot;xiezhi&quot;. In Chapter 5, Yuan Shao praises Wen Chou&#x27;s prowess in battle when he laments, while under attack by Hua Xiong, that &quot;If I had either Yan Liang or Wen Chou here, I would have nothing to fear.&quot;

This comment foreshadows the appearance of Wen Chou in chapter 26, where he volunteers to avenge his close friend Yan Liang, who is killed in the Battle of Boma by Guan Yu. Given 70,000 troops, Wen Chou crosses the Yellow River and heads straight towards Cao Cao&#x27;s camp. In an unusual move, Cao Cao turns his entire formation around, placing the supplies in front. While Wen Chou&#x27;s soldiers are busy looting the supplies, Cao Cao directs his men south onto a knoll, from where they allow their horses to graze. Wen Chou&#x27;s soldiers pounce upon the horses as they approach the knoll and become disorganised. Cao Cao then gives the order for a counterattack, forcing the enemy to retreat.

Zhang Liao and Xu Huang, two of Cao Cao&#x27;s best generals, give chase. Wen Chou fires two arrows from atop his horse, one of which slices off the feather on Zhang Liao&#x27;s helmet and the other hits his horse in the face. Brandishing his poleaxe, Xu Huang charges towards Wen Chou but has to retreat when a band of enemy soldiers come to their commander&#x27;s rescue.

Leading a dozen riders, Guan Yu then cuts off Wen Chou&#x27;s escape and engaged him in a duel. Within three bouts, Wen Chou withdraws and attempts to evade. However, Guan Yu&#x27;s horse, the Red Hare, is of a superior breed and soon catches up with him. Guan Yu then kills Wen Chou from behind.

<text>Chunyu Qiong (died 200), courtesy name Zhongjian, was a military officer serving under the warlord Yuan Shao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He played a significant part in the Battle of Guandu in 200.

==Life==
Little is known about Chunyu&#x27;s background other than that in 188, he was the Right Colonel (右校尉) in the newly created Army of the Western Garden along with Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. He may have left the capital at around the same time as Yuan Shao and joined the coalition against Dong Zhuo in 190. It is clear that by the end of the decade, Chunyu Qiong had become one of Yuan Shao&#x27;s leading and most trusted military officers. In a later memorial submitted by Cao Cao, he is referred to as &quot;a great officer under Yuan Shao&quot;.

In 195, Yuan Shao&#x27;s strategist Ju Shou suggested that he welcome Emperor Xian to his province so that he could effectively be in control of the imperial government. However, Chunyu Qiong opposed this suggestion based on the faulty logic that if he did, he would have to yield to Emperor Xian on key decisions. Yuan Shao listened to Chunyu Qiong thus giving Cao Cao the opportunity.

In 200, Cao Cao had become Yuan Shao&#x27;s main rival for domination of northern China. In the preparations for the clash, Chunyu Qiong sided with Guo Tu against Ju Shou, calling for a more aggressive strategy against Cao Cao. As a result, he was given command of a third of Yuan Shao&#x27;s army along with Guo. In the spring of 200, he joined Guo Tu and Yan Liang in an attack on Boma, held by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Liu Yan.

In the latter stages of the Battle of Guandu, Chunyu Qiong led more than 10,000 troops to Wuchao (烏巢), about 40 &quot;li&quot; north of Yuan Shao&#x27;s main camp, to receive a new shipment of grain supplies. In early dawn, he was surprised by a raid led by Cao Cao himself. Yuan Shao&#x27;s cavalry were routed, Wuchao was captured, and Chunyu Qiong was beheaded after the battle.

According to the &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot;, during the battle, his nose was cut off, and he was brought to Cao Cao, who asked him, &quot;What do you have to say for yourself?&quot; Chunyu Qiong replied: &quot;Heaven decides the victor, what need have you to ask?&quot; Impressed by the answer, Cao Cao wanted to spare his life, but Xu You urged Cao Cao to kill Chunyu Qiong, saying that Chunyu Qiong would take revenge later on him for cutting off his nose. Cao Cao then ordered Chunyu Qiong to be executed.

With the fall of Wuchao, Yuan Shao&#x27;s positions collapsed and a number of his commanders, such as Gao Lan (高覽) and Zhang He, defected to Cao Cao. Chunyu Qiong&#x27;s defeat at Wuchao has earned him a reputation in Chinese folklore as a commander without any real ability.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Chunyu Qiong was described as a heavy drinker and often seen with a bottle of wine. During the Battle of Guandu, Yuan Shao left Chunyu Qiong as the overseer of the important supply depot in Wuchao. When Cao Cao, who listened to Xu You&#x27;s advice, found the depot, Chunyu Qiong was drunk at the time and failed to put up any significant defence. This resulted in Cao Cao succeeding in burning down the supply depot. Afterwards, Cao Cao mutilated Chunyu Qiong&#x27;s face and sent him back to Yuan Shao. The furious Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu Qiong&#x27;s execution.

<text>In mathematics, a ternary operation is an &quot;n&quot;-ary operation with &quot;n&quot; = 3. A ternary operation on a set &quot;A&quot; takes any given three elements of &quot;A&quot; and combines them to form a single element of &quot;A&quot;.

In computer science, a ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments as input and returns one output.

==Examples==
The function formula_1 is an example of a ternary operation on the integers (or on any structure where formula_2 and formula_3 are both defined). Properties of this ternary operation have been used to define planar ternary rings in the foundations of projective geometry.

In the Euclidean plane with points &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; referred to an origin, the ternary operation formula_4 has been used to define free vectors. Since (&quot;abc&quot;) = &quot;d&quot; implies &quot;b&quot; – &quot;a&quot; = &quot;c&quot; – &quot;d&quot;, the directed line segments &quot;b&quot; – &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; – &quot;d&quot; are equipollent and are associated with the same free vector. Any three points in the plane &quot;a, b, c&quot; thus determine a parallelogram with &quot;d&quot; at the fourth vertex.

In projective geometry, the process of finding a projective harmonic conjugate is a ternary operation on three points. In the diagram, points &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;P&quot; determine point &quot;V&quot;, the harmonic conjugate of &quot;P&quot; with respect to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Point &quot;R&quot; and the line through &quot;P&quot; can be selected arbitrarily, determining &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. Drawing &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;BD&quot; produces the intersection &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;RQ&quot; then yields &quot;V&quot;.

Suppose &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are given sets and formula_5 is the collection of binary relations between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Composition of relations is always defined when &quot;A&quot; = &quot;B&quot;, but otherwise a ternary composition can be defined by formula_6 where formula_7 is the converse relation of &quot;q&quot;. Properties of this ternary relation have been used to set the axioms for a heap.

In Boolean algebra, formula_8 defines the formula formula_9.

==Computer science==

In computer science, a ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments (or operands). The arguments and result can be of different types. Many programming languages that use C-like syntax feature a ternary operator, codice_1, which defines a conditional expression. In some languages, this operator is referred to as the &quot;conditional operator&quot;.

In Python, the ternary conditional operator reads codice_2. Python also supports ternary operations called array slicing, e.g. codice_3 return an array where the first element is codice_4 and last element is codice_5. OCaml expressions provide ternary operations against records, arrays, and strings: codice_6 would mean the string codice_7 where index codice_8 has value codice_9.

The multiply–accumulate operation is another ternary operator.

Another example of a ternary operator is &quot;between&quot;, as used in SQL.

The Icon programming language has a &quot;to-by&quot; ternary operator: the expression codice_10 generates the odd integers from 1 through 9.

In Excel formulae, the form is =if(C, x, y).

<text>A head-up display, or heads-up display, also known as a HUD () or head-up guidance system (HGS), is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned &quot;up&quot; and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments. A HUD also has the advantage that the pilot&#x27;s eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside after looking at the optically nearer instruments.

Although they were initially developed for military aviation, HUDs are now used in commercial aircraft, automobiles, and other (mostly professional) applications.

Head-up displays were a precursor technology to augmented reality (AR), incorporating a subset of the features needed for the full AR experience, but lacking the necessary registration and tracking between the virtual content and the user&#x27;s real-world environment.

== Overview ==

A typical HUD contains three primary components: a &quot;projector unit&quot;, a &quot;combiner&quot;, and a &quot;video generation computer&quot;.

The projection unit in a typical HUD is an optical collimator setup: a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode-ray tube, light emitting diode display, or liquid crystal display at its focus. This setup (a design that has been around since the invention of the reflector sight in 1900) produces an image where the light is collimated, i.e. the focal point is perceived to be at infinity.

The combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass (a beam splitter) located directly in front of the viewer, that redirects the projected image from projector in such a way as to see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same time. Combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through. In some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector.

The computer provides the interface between the HUD (i.e. the projection unit) and the systems/data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit.

=== Types ===
Other than fixed mounted HUD, there are also head-mounted displays (HMDs.) These include helmet-mounted displays (both abbreviated HMD), forms of HUD that feature a display element that moves with the orientation of the user&#x27;s head.

Many modern fighters (such as the F/A-18, F-16, and Eurofighter) use both a HUD and HMD concurrently. The F-35 Lightning II was designed without a HUD, relying solely on the HMD, making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed HUD.

=== Generations ===
HUDs are split into four generations reflecting the technology used to generate the images.
* First Generation—Use a CRT to generate an image on a phosphor screen, having the disadvantage of the phosphor screen coating degrading over time. The majority of HUDs in operation today are of this type.
* Second Generation—Use a solid state light source, for example LED, which is modulated by an LCD screen to display an image. These systems do not fade or require the high voltages of first generation systems. These systems are on commercial aircraft.
* Third Generation—Use optical waveguides to produce images directly in the combiner rather than use a projection system.
* Fourth Generation—Use a scanning laser to display images and even video imagery on a clear transparent medium.
Newer micro-display imaging technologies are being introduced, including liquid crystal display (LCD), liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS), digital micro-mirrors (DMD), and organic light-emitting diode (OLED).

== History ==

HUDs evolved from the reflector sight, a pre-World War II parallax-free optical sight technology for military fighter aircraft. The gyro gunsight added a reticle that moved based on the speed and turn rate to solve for the amount of lead needed to hit a target while maneuvering.

During the early 1940s, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), in charge of UK radar development, found that Royal Air Force (RAF) night fighter pilots were having a hard time reacting to the verbal instruction of the radar operator as they approached their targets. They experimented with the addition of a second radar display for the pilot, but found they had trouble looking up from the lit screen into the dark sky in order to find the target. In October 1942 they had successfully combined the image from the radar tube with a projection from their standard GGS Mk. II gyro gunsight on a flat area of the windscreen, and later in the gunsight itself. A key upgrade was the move from the original AI Mk. IV radar to the microwave-frequency AI Mk. VIII radar found on the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. This set produced an artificial horizon that further eased head-up flying.

In 1955 the US Navy&#x27;s Office of Naval Research and Development did some research with a mockup HUD concept unit along with a sidestick controller in an attempt to ease the pilot&#x27;s burden flying modern jet aircraft and make the instrumentation less complicated during flight. While their research was never incorporated in any aircraft of that time, the crude HUD mockup they built had all the features of today&#x27;s modern HUD units.

HUD technology was next advanced by the Royal Navy in the Buccaneer, the prototype of which first flew on 1958. The aircraft was designed to fly at very low altitudes at very high speeds and drop bombs in engagements lasting seconds. As such, there was no time for the pilot to look up from the instruments to a bombsight. This led to the concept of a &quot;Strike Sight&quot; that would combine altitude, airspeed and the gun/bombsight into a single gunsight-like display. There was fierce competition between supporters of the new HUD design and supporters of the old electro-mechanical gunsight, with the HUD being described as a radical, even foolhardy option.

The Air Arm branch of the UK Ministry of Defence sponsored the development of a Strike Sight. The Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) designed the equipment and the earliest usage of the term &quot;head-up-display&quot; can be traced to this time. Production units were built by Rank Cintel, and the system was first integrated in 1958. The Cintel HUD business was taken over by Elliott Flight Automation and the Buccaneer HUD was manufactured and further developed, continuing up to a Mark III version with a total of 375 systems made; it was given a &#x27;fit and forget&#x27; title by the Royal Navy and it was still in service nearly 25 years later. BAE Systems, as the successor to Elliotts via GEC-Marconi Avionics, thus has a claim to the world&#x27;s first head-up display in operational service. A similar version that replaced the bombing modes with missile-attack modes was part of the AIRPASS HUD fitted to the English Electric Lightning from 1959.

In the United Kingdom, it was soon noted that pilots flying with the new gunsights were becoming better at piloting their aircraft. At this point, the HUD expanded its purpose beyond weapon aiming to general piloting. In the 1960s, French test-pilot Gilbert Klopfstein created the first modern HUD and a standardized system of HUD symbols so that pilots would only have to learn one system and could more easily transition between aircraft. The modern HUD used in instrument flight rules approaches to landing was developed in 1975. Klopfstein pioneered HUD technology in military fighter jets and helicopters, aiming to centralize critical flight data within the pilot&#x27;s field of vision. This approach sought to increase the pilot&#x27;s scan efficiency and reduce &quot;task saturation&quot; and information overload.

Use of HUDs then expanded beyond military aircraft. In the 1970s, the HUD was introduced to commercial aviation, and in 1988, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme became the first production car with a head-up display.

Until a few years ago, the Embraer 190, Saab 2000, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 Classic (737-300/400/500) and Next Generation aircraft (737-600/700/800/900 series) were the only commercial passenger aircraft available with HUDs. However, the technology is becoming more common with aircraft such as the Canadair RJ, Airbus A318 and several business jets featuring the displays. HUDs have become standard equipment on the Boeing 787. Furthermore, the Airbus A320, A330, A340 and A380 families are currently undergoing the certification process for a HUD. HUDs were also added to the Space Shuttle orbiter.

== Design factors ==

There are several factors that interplay in the design of a HUD:
* Field of View – also &quot;FOV&quot;, indicates the angle(s), vertically as well as horizontally, subtended at the pilot&#x27;s eye, at which the combiner displays symbology in relation to the outside view. A narrow FOV means that the view (of a runway, for example) through the combiner might include little additional information beyond the perimeters of the runway environment; whereas a wide FOV would allow a &#x27;broader&#x27; view. For aviation applications, the major benefit of a wide FOV is that an aircraft approaching the runway in a crosswind might still have the runway in view through the combiner, even though the aircraft is pointed well away from the runway threshold; whereas with a narrow FOV the runway would be &#x27;off the edge&#x27; of the combiner, out of the HUD&#x27;s view. Because human eyes are separated, each eye receives a different image. The HUD image is viewable by one or both eyes, depending on technical and budget limitations in the design process. Modern expectations are that both eyes view the same image, in other words a &quot;binocular Field of View (FOV)&quot;.
* Collimation – The projected image is collimated which makes the light rays parallel. Because the light rays are parallel the lens of the human eye focuses on infinity to get a clear image. Collimated images on the HUD combiner are perceived as existing at or near optical infinity. This means that the pilot&#x27;s eyes do not need to refocus to view the outside world and the HUD display – the image appears to be &quot;out there&quot;, overlaying the outside world. This feature is critical for effective HUDs: not having to refocus between HUD-displayed symbolic information and the outside world onto which that information is overlaid is one of the main advantages of collimated HUDs. It gives HUDs special consideration in safety-critical and time-critical manoeuvres, when the few seconds a pilot needs in order to re-focus inside the cockpit, and then back outside, are very critical: for example, in the final stages of landing. Collimation is therefore a primary distinguishing feature of high-performance HUDs and differentiates them from consumer-quality systems that, for example, simply reflect uncollimated information off a car&#x27;s windshield (causing drivers to refocus and shift attention from the road ahead.)
* Eyebox – The optical collimator produces a cylinder of parallel light so the display can only be viewed while the viewer&#x27;s eyes are somewhere within that cylinder, a three-dimensional area called the &quot;head motion box&quot; or &quot;eyebox&quot;. Modern HUD eyeboxes are usually about 5 lateral by 3 vertical by 6 longitudinal inches (13x8x15 cm.) This allows the viewer some freedom of head movement but movement too far up/down or left/right will cause the display to vanish off the edge of the collimator and movement too far back will cause it to crop off around the edge (vignette.) The pilot is able to view the entire display as long as one eye is inside the eyebox.
* Luminance/contrast – Displays have adjustments in luminance and contrast to account for ambient lighting, which can vary widely (e.g. from the glare of bright clouds to moonless night approaches to minimally lit fields.)
* Boresight – Aircraft HUD components are very accurately aligned with the aircraft&#x27;s three axes – a process called &quot;boresighting&quot; – so that displayed data conforms to reality typically with an accuracy of ±7.0 milliradians (±24 minutes of arc), and may vary across the HUD&#x27;s FOV. In this case the word &quot;conform&quot; means, &quot;when an object is projected on the combiner and the actual object is visible, they will be aligned&quot;. This allows the display to show the pilot exactly where the artificial horizon is, as well as the aircraft&#x27;s projected path with great accuracy. When Enhanced Vision is used, for example, the display of runway lights is aligned with the actual runway lights when the real lights become visible. Boresighting is done during the aircraft&#x27;s building process and can also be performed in the field on many aircraft.
* Scaling – The displayed image (flight path, pitch and yaw scaling, etc.), is scaled to present to the pilot a picture that overlays the outside world in an exact 1:1 relationship. For example, objects (such as a runway threshold) that are 3 degrees below the horizon as viewed from the cockpit must appear at the −3 degree index on the HUD display.
* Compatibility – HUD components are designed to be compatible with other avionics, displays, etc.

== Aircraft ==

On aircraft avionics systems, HUDs typically operate from dual independent redundant computer systems. They receive input directly from the sensors (pitot-static, gyroscopic, navigation, etc.) aboard the aircraft and perform their own computations rather than receiving previously computed data from the flight computers. On other aircraft (the Boeing 787, for example) the HUD guidance computation for Low Visibility Take-off (LVTO) and low visibility approach comes from the same flight guidance computer that drives the autopilot. Computers are integrated with the aircraft&#x27;s systems and allow connectivity onto several different data buses such as the ARINC 429, ARINC 629, and MIL-STD-1553.

=== Displayed data ===

Typical aircraft HUDs display airspeed, altitude, a horizon line, heading, turn/bank and slip/skid indicators. These instruments are the minimum required by 14 CFR Part 91.

Other symbols and data are also available in some HUDs:
* &quot;boresight&quot; or &quot;waterline&quot; symbol — is fixed on the display and shows where the nose of the aircraft is actually pointing.
* &quot;flight path vector (FPV)&quot; or &quot;velocity vector&quot; symbol — shows where the aircraft is actually going, as opposed to merely where it is pointed as with the boresight. For example, if the aircraft is pitched up but descending as may occur in high angle of attack flight or in flight through descending air, then the FPV symbol will be below the horizon even though the boresight symbol is above the horizon. During approach and landing, a pilot can fly the approach by keeping the FPV symbol at the desired descent angle and touchdown point on the runway.
* &quot;acceleration indicator&quot; or &quot;energy cue&quot; — typically to the left of the FPV symbol, it is above it if the aircraft is accelerating, and below the FPV symbol if decelerating.
* &quot;angle of attack indicator&quot; — shows the wing&#x27;s angle relative to the airflow, often displayed as &quot;α&quot;.
* navigation data and symbols — for approaches and landings, the flight guidance systems can provide visual cues based on navigation aids such as an Instrument Landing System or augmented Global Positioning System such as the Wide Area Augmentation System. Typically this is a circle which fits inside the flight path vector symbol. Pilots can fly along the correct flight path by &quot;flying to&quot; the guidance cue.

Since being introduced on HUDs, both the FPV and acceleration symbols are becoming standard on head-down displays (HDD.) The actual form of the FPV symbol on an HDD is not standardized but is usually a simple aircraft drawing, such as a circle with two short angled lines, (180 ± 30 degrees) and &quot;wings&quot; on the ends of the descending line. Keeping the FPV on the horizon allows the pilot to fly level turns in various angles of bank.

=== Military aircraft specific applications ===
In addition to the generic information described above, military applications include weapons system and sensor data such as:
* &quot;target designation (TD)&quot; indicator — places a cue over an air or ground target (which is typically derived from radar or inertial navigation system data.)
* &quot;Vc&quot; — closing velocity with target.
* &quot;Range&quot; — to target, waypoint, etc.
* &quot;weapon seeker&quot; or sensor line of sight — shows where a seeker or sensor is pointing.
* &quot;weapon status&quot; — includes type and number of weapons selected, available, arming, etc.

=== VTOL/STOL approaches and landings ===
During the 1980s, the United States military tested the use of HUDs in vertical take off and landing (VTOL) and short take off and landing (STOL) aircraft. A HUD format was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to provide pilots of VTOL and STOL aircraft with complete flight guidance and control information for Category III C terminal-area flight operations. This includes a large variety of flight operations, from STOL flights on land-based runways to VTOL operations on aircraft carriers. The principal features of this display format are the integration of the flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view, easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance, and the superposition of vertical and horizontal situation information. The display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft.

=== Civil aircraft specific applications ===

The use of head-up displays allows commercial aircraft substantial flexibility in their operations. Systems have been approved which allow reduced-visibility takeoffs, and landings, as well as full manual Category III A landings and roll-outs. Initially expensive and physically large, these systems were only installed on larger aircraft able to support them. These tended to be the same aircraft that as standard supported autoland (with the exception of certain turbo-prop types that had HUD as an option) making the head-up display unnecessary for Cat III landings. This delayed the adoption of HUD in commercial aircraft. At the same time, studies have shown that the use of a HUD during landings decreases the lateral deviation from centerline in all landing conditions, although the touchdown point along the centerline is not changed.

For general aviation, MyGoFlight expects to receive a STC and to retail its SkyDisplay HUD for $25,000 without installation for a single piston-engine as the Cirrus SR22s and more for Cessna Caravans or Pilatus PC-12s single-engine turboprops: 5 to 10% of a traditional HUD cost albeit it is non-conformal, not matching exactly the outside terrain.
Flight data from a tablet computer can be projected on the $1,800 Epic Optix Eagle 1 HUD.

=== Enhanced flight vision systems ===

In more advanced systems, such as the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-labeled &#x27;Enhanced Flight Vision System&#x27;, a real-world visual image can be overlaid onto the combiner. Typically an infrared camera (either single or multi-band) is installed in the nose of the aircraft to display a conformed image to the pilot. &quot;EVS Enhanced Vision System&quot; is an industry-accepted term which the FAA decided not to use because &quot;the FAA believes [it] could be confused with the system definition and operational concept found in 91.175(l) and (m)&quot; In one EVS installation, the camera is actually installed at the top of the vertical stabilizer rather than &quot;as close as practical to the pilots eye position&quot;. When used with a HUD however, the camera must be mounted as close as possible to the pilots eye point as the image is expected to &quot;overlay&quot; the real world as the pilot looks through the combiner.

&quot;Registration&quot;, or the accurate overlay of the EVS image with the real world image, is one feature closely examined by authorities prior to approval of a HUD based EVS. This is because of the importance of the HUD matching the real world and therefore being able to provide accurate data rather than misleading information.

While the EVS display can greatly help, the FAA has only relaxed operating regulations so an aircraft with EVS can perform a CATEGORY I approach to CATEGORY II minimums. In all other cases the flight crew must comply with all &quot;unaided&quot; visual restrictions. (For example, if the runway visibility is restricted because of fog, even though EVS may provide a clear visual image it is not appropriate (or legal) to maneuver the aircraft using only the EVS below 100 feet above ground level.)

=== Synthetic vision systems ===


HUD systems are also being designed to display a synthetic vision system (SVS) graphic image, which uses high precision navigation, attitude, altitude and terrain databases to create realistic and intuitive views of the outside world.

In the 1st SVS head down image shown on the right, immediately visible indicators include the airspeed tape on the left, altitude tape on the right, and turn/bank/slip/skid displays at the top center. The boresight symbol (-v-) is in the center and directly below that is the flight path vector (FPV) symbol (the circle with short wings and a vertical stabilizer.) The horizon line is visible running across the display with a break at the center, and directly to the left are numbers at ±10 degrees with a short line at ±5 degrees (the +5 degree line is easier to see) which, along with the horizon line, show the pitch of the aircraft. Unlike this color depiction of SVS on a head down primary flight display, the SVS displayed on a HUD is monochrome – that is, typically, in shades of green.

The image indicates a wings level aircraft (i.e. the flight path vector symbol is flat relative to the horizon line and there is zero roll on the turn/bank indicator.) Airspeed is 140 knots, altitude is 9,450 feet, heading is 343 degrees (the number below the turn/bank indicator.) Close inspection of the image shows a small purple circle which is displaced from the flight path vector slightly to the lower right. This is the guidance cue coming from the Flight Guidance System. When stabilized on the approach, this purple symbol should be centered &quot;within&quot; the FPV.

The terrain is entirely computer generated from a high resolution terrain database.

In some systems, the SVS will calculate the aircraft&#x27;s current flight path, or possible flight path (based on an aircraft performance model, the aircraft&#x27;s current energy, and surrounding terrain) and then turn any obstructions red to alert the flight crew. Such a system might have helped prevent the crash of American Airlines Flight 965 into a mountain in December 1995.

On the left side of the display is an SVS-unique symbol, with the appearance of a purple, diminishing sideways ladder, and which continues on the right of the display. The two lines define a &quot;tunnel in the sky&quot;. This symbol defines the desired trajectory of the aircraft in three dimensions. For example, if the pilot had selected an airport to the left, then this symbol would curve off to the left and down. If the pilot keeps the flight path vector alongside the trajectory symbol, the craft will fly the optimum path. This path would be based on information stored in the Flight Management System&#x27;s database and would show the FAA-approved approach for that airport.

The tunnel in the sky can also greatly assist the pilot when more precise four-dimensional flying is required, such as the decreased vertical or horizontal clearance requirements of Required Navigation Performance (RNP.) Under such conditions the pilot is given a graphical depiction of where the aircraft should be and where it should be going rather than the pilot having to mentally integrate altitude, airspeed, heading, energy and longitude and latitude to correctly fly the aircraft.

== Tanks ==

In mid-2017, the Israel Defense Forces will begin trials of Elbit&#x27;s Iron Vision, the world&#x27;s first helmet-mounted head-up display for tanks. Israel&#x27;s Elbit, which developed the helmet-mounted display system for the F-35, plans Iron Vision to use a number of externally mounted cameras to project the 360° view of a tank&#x27;s surroundings onto the helmet-mounted visors of its crew members. This allows the crew members to stay inside the tank, without having to open the hatches to see outside.

== Automobiles ==


These displays are becoming increasingly available in production cars, and usually offer speedometer, tachometer, and navigation system displays. Night vision information is also displayed via HUD on certain automobiles. In contrast to most HUDs found in aircraft, automotive head-up displays are not parallax-free. The display may not be visible to a driver wearing sunglasses with polarised lenses.

Add-on HUD systems also exist, projecting the display onto a glass combiner mounted above or below the windshield, or using the windshield itself as the combiner.

The first in-car HUD was developed by General Motors Corporation in 1999 with the function of displaying the navigation service in front of the driver&#x27;s line of sight. Moving into 2010, AR technology was introduced and combined with the existing in-car HUD. Based on this technology, the navigation service began to be displayed on the windshield of the vehicle.

In 2012, Pioneer Corporation introduced a HUD navigation system that replaces the driver-side sun visor and visually overlays animations of conditions ahead, a form of augmented reality (AR.) Developed by Pioneer Corporation, AR-HUD became the first aftermarket automotive Head-Up Display to use a direct-to-eye laser beam scanning method, also known as virtual retinal display (VRD.) AR-HUD&#x27;s core technology involves a miniature laser beam scanning display developed by MicroVision, Inc.

Motorcycle helmet HUDs are also commercially available.

In recent years, it has been argued that conventional HUDs will be replaced by holographic AR technologies, such as the ones developed by WayRay that use holographic optical elements (HOE.) The HOE allows for a wider field of view while reducing the size of the device and making the solution customizable for any car model. Mercedes Benz introduced an Augmented Reality-based Head Up Display while Faurecia invested in an eye gaze and finger controlled head up display.

== Further development and experimental uses ==
HUDs have been proposed or are being experimentally developed for a number of other applications. In military settings, a HUD can be used to overlay tactical information such as the output of a laser rangefinder or squadmate locations to infantrymen. A prototype HUD has also been developed that displays information on the inside of a swimmer&#x27;s goggles or of a scuba diver&#x27;s mask. HUD systems that project information directly onto the wearer&#x27;s retina with a low-powered laser (virtual retinal display) are also being tested.

A HUD product developed in 2012 could perform real-time language translation. In an implementation of an Optical head-mounted display, the EyeTap product allows superimposed computer-generated graphic files to be displayed on a lens. The Google Glass was another early product.

<text>Bolesław Domański (January 14, 1872 – April 21, 1939) was a famous Polish Catholic Priest, and was the President of the Union of Poles in Germany from 1931 to 1939. He served as the Parson of the Zakrzewo Parish from 1903 to 1939. Domański was a fighter for the rights of the Polish minority in Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia, at the time a Prussian province on the border of Germany and Poland, as well as for the rights of Polish emigrants in the Ruhr area.

== Life ==
Bolesław Domański was born on January 14, 1872 in Przytarnia, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire.

<text>The Rossby number (Ro), named for Carl-Gustav Arvid Rossby, is a dimensionless number used in describing fluid flow. The Rossby number is the ratio of inertial force to Coriolis force, terms formula_1 and formula_2 in the Navier–Stokes equations respectively. It is commonly used in geophysical phenomena in the oceans and atmosphere, where it characterizes the importance of Coriolis accelerations arising from planetary rotation. It is also known as the Kibel number.

The Rossby number (Ro, not Ro) is defined as

: formula_3

where &quot;U&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are respectively characteristic velocity and length scales of the phenomenon, and formula_4 is the Coriolis frequency, with formula_5 being the angular frequency of planetary rotation, and formula_6 the latitude.

A small Rossby number signifies a system strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number signifies a system in which inertial and centrifugal forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large (≈ 103), in low-pressure systems it is low (≈ 0.1–1), and in oceanic systems it is of the order of unity, but depending on the phenomena can range over several orders of magnitude (≈ 10−2–102). As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces (called &quot;cyclostrophic balance&quot;). Cyclostrophic balance also commonly occurs in the inner core of a tropical cyclone. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible, and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces (called &quot;geostrophic balance&quot;). In the oceans all three forces are comparable (called &quot;cyclogeostrophic balance&quot;). For a figure showing spatial and temporal scales of motions in the atmosphere and oceans, see Kantha and Clayson. 

When the Rossby number is large (either because &quot;f&quot; is small, such as in the tropics and at lower latitudes; or because &quot;L&quot; is small, that is, for small-scale motions such as flow in a bathtub; or for large speeds), the effects of planetary rotation are unimportant and can be neglected. When the Rossby number is small, then the effects of planetary rotation are large, and the net acceleration is comparably small, allowing the use of the geostrophic approximation.

<text>Baron Dudley is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created circa 1440 for John Sutton, a soldier who served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The title descended in the Sutton family until the 17th century when Frances Sutton, the heir apparent to the title, married Humble Ward who was granted the title Baron Ward in 1644. Their heirs inherited both titles until 1740 when the differing rules of inheritance meant that the Barony of Dudley descended on Ferdinando Dudley Lea, who became the 11th Baron whilst the Barony of Ward went to John Ward, who later became 1st Viscount Dudley and Ward. On Ferdinando&#x27;s death in 1757, the title fell into abeyance. The title was revived in 1916.

According to &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Peerage and Baronetage&quot; he was actually summoned to Parliament as &quot;Johanni de Sutton de Duddeley militi&quot;, whereby he is held to have become Baron Dudley. The title is sometimes referred to as &quot;Baron Sutton of Dudley&quot;. The peerage was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines.

It is in fact arguable that the title arose even earlier, as his ancestor John Sutton (died 1359) had a writ of summons to the Council on 25 February 1342, but neither he nor his son (died ), grandson (died 10 March 1396) or great grandson (all called John Sutton of Dudley) were summoned, so that they can probably not be regarded as peers.

Lord Dudley&#x27;s great-grandson, the third Baron, managed to get himself severely into debt and lost the family seat of Dudley Castle to his cousin John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. He became known as &quot;Lord Quondam&quot; (&quot;Lord Has-been&quot; or &quot;Lord Formerly&quot;). However, Dudley Castle and the other family estates were restored to his son, the fourth Baron. He was succeeded by his son, Edward the fifth Baron, who like his grandfather came heavily into debt. To clear his debts his granddaughter and heir, Frances, was married to Sir Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy jeweller. Frances became the sixth holder of the title. In 1644 her husband Humble Ward was created Baron Ward, of Birmingham in the County of Warwick, by letters patent.

They were both succeeded by their son, the seventh and second Baron respectively. On the death in 1740 of the latter&#x27;s grandson, the tenth Baron Dudley and fifth Baron Ward, the two titles separated. The barony of Ward, which could only be inherited by males, was passed on to the late Baron&#x27;s kinsman, the sixth Baron (see the Earl of Dudley for the later history of this title). The barony of Dudley was inherited by the Baron&#x27;s nephew, Ferdinando Dudley Lea, 11th Baron Dudley. He was the son of Frances, sister of the tenth Baron, and her husband William Lea. However, on Ferdinando&#x27;s death in 1757 the peerage fell into abeyance between his sisters. The title remained in abeyance for 159 years. In 1869, Bernard Burke, who researched some of the co-heirs of the title during the period of abeyance, wrote of the Barony: &quot;where can we find a more striking contrast than this mournful tale of the Barony of Dudley? The history of that famous title would, in its first chapter, speak of chivalry, warlike achievement, and magnificent hospitality in the ancient castle from which the Barony took its name. The last chapter would tell the story of the Halesowen farmer, the custom-house clerk, and the toll-bar-keeper, all resident within range of that very castle.&quot;
In 1916 the abeyance was terminated in favour of Ferdinando Dudley William Lea Smith, who became the twelfth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of Anne, sister of the eleventh Baron, and her husband William Smith. the title is held by his grandson, the fifteenth Baron, who succeeded his mother in 2002 (who in her turn had succeeded her younger brother).

The holders of the title (until 1740) were the owners of Dudley Castle and an extensive estate around it, including the manors of Dudley, Sedgley, Kingswinford and Rowley Somery in Rowley Regis. By the 16th century, their main home was Himley Hall. On the death of the tenth Baron in 1740, the barony of Dudley passed to a female-line heir (see above), whereas the main estates were entailed to follow the barony of Ward and passed to a cousin. However, certain estates that had recently been purchased passed with the title Lord Dudley to the aforementioned Ferdinando Dudley Lea, the eleventh Baron Dudley.

The family surname of the first five barons was formally &#x27;Sutton&#x27;, but in practice, they seem always to have been called &#x27;Dudley&#x27;. In title deeds and other formal documents, the surname often appears as &#x27;Sutton otherwise Dudley&#x27;.

<doc id="459436" wikidata="Q1378594" url="?curid=459436" title="Xu Shu">
<text>Xu Shu (180 – 230s), courtesy name Yuanzhi, originally named Xu Fu, was a Chinese politician of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty and used to be a vigilante swordsman in his early life. However, after running into trouble with the authorities, he renounced his old ways and took up scholarly pursuits. He lived a reclusive life from the 190s to mid-200s in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan provinces), where he met and befriended Zhuge Liang. In late 207, he became an adviser to the warlord Liu Bei and served under Liu for about a year. He also recommended Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei during this period of time. In late 208, Liu Bei was defeated at the Battle of Changban by his rival Cao Cao. Xu Shu&#x27;s mother was captured by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces during the battle. Feeling lost and without a sense of direction, Xu Shu eventually left Liu Bei and joined Cao Cao. He continued serving in the state of Cao Wei – founded by Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, Cao Pi, who ended the Eastern Han dynasty – and died of illness in office.

Xu Shu&#x27;s defection from Liu Bei to Cao Cao was fictionalised in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. In the novel, he was Liu Bei&#x27;s chief strategist before Zhuge Liang came along, and he once helped Liu Bei repel two attacks from Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren. He was eventually tricked into leaving Liu Bei and joining Cao Cao, but he recommended Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei before leaving and swore never to give advice to Cao Cao.

==Early life==
Xu Shu was from Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), Yu Province, which is in present-day central Henan. His original given name was Fu (福), and he was born into a poor family. He was a swordsman in his early life; during the latter part of the &quot;Zhong&#x27;ping&quot; era (184-189) of Emperor Ling&#x27;s reign, he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, but he did not reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu&#x27;s fellows rescued him later. He was so grateful to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.

When Xu Shu first attended school, his mates ostracised him because of his background, but he remained humble and hardworking. He woke up early, cleaned the school alone, and paid great attention to his studies. He met Shi Tao (石韜; also known as Shi Guangyuan 石廣元) and became close friends with him. In the early 190s, when wars broke out in central China, Xu Shu and Shi Tao moved south to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), where they met Zhuge Liang and befriended him. During his time in Jing Province from the late 190s to the early 200s (about a decade), Xu Shu maintained close friendships with Zhuge Liang, Shi Tao and Meng Gongwei (孟公威). They travelled and studied together.

==Serving Liu Bei==
When the warlord Liu Bei was stationed at Xinye County, Xu Shu visited him and received a warm reception. Xu Shu recommended Zhuge Liang as an adviser to Liu Bei and told him that he must visit Zhuge Liang in person (i.e., he cannot invite Zhuge Liang to visit him). Zhuge Liang later came to serve Liu Bei after the latter visited him thrice and consulted him on the affairs of their time.

In 208, Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province, died and was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong. Later that year, when the warlord Cao Cao invaded Jing Province, Liu Cong surrendered and much of northern Jing Province came under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Liu Bei led his forces and a large number of civilians south to Xiakou (夏口; in present-day Wuhan, Hubei), which was independent of Cao Cao&#x27;s control and where Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son, Liu Qi, was based. Xu Shu accompanied Liu Bei on his journey towards Xiakou. Cao Cao sent 5,000 riders to pursue Liu Bei. They caught up with him and defeated him at the Battle of Changban. Cao Cao&#x27;s men captured Xu Shu&#x27;s mother during the battle, so Xu Shu decided to leave Liu Bei to reunite with his mother. Before leaving, he pointed at his heart and told Liu Bei, &quot;I wanted to join you, General, in making great achievements. This is my purpose in life. Now that I&#x27;ve lost my mother, I&#x27;ve also lost my sense of direction. This isn&#x27;t going to be helpful. Now I bid farewell to you.&quot; He went to join Cao Cao. Shi Tao also followed him and both of them came to serve Cao Cao.

==Service in Cao Wei==
Xu Shu continued serving in the state of Cao Wei – founded by Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor, Cao Pi – after the fall of the Han dynasty and the start of the Three Kingdoms period. During Cao Pi&#x27;s reign from December 220 to June 226, Xu Shu served as a Right General of the Household (右中郎將) and a Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk (御史中丞).

During the &quot;Taihe&quot; era (227-233) of Cao Rui&#x27;s (Cao Pi&#x27;s successor) reign, Zhuge Liang – who was then the chancellor-regent of the state of Shu Han, which Liu Bei founded in 221 – led a series of campaigns to attack the state of Cao Wei. When Zhuge Liang heard about the ranks of Xu Shu and Shi Tao in Wei, he remarked, &quot;Are there so many talents in Wei? Why aren&#x27;t the talents of these two men put to good use?&quot; Xu Shu died of illness in Wei several years later. A tombstone with his name on it was found in Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu).

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Xu Shu is featured as a fairly prominent character in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He appeared mainly in chapters 35–36, in which he served as Liu Bei&#x27;s strategist before Zhuge Liang came along. In the novel, his original name was Shan Fu (單福), perhaps due to a misreading of the phrase &quot;本單家子&quot; in the &quot;Weilue&quot;. The phrase could be read as him being a son of the Shan family, but in this context, it actually meant that he was a son of a poor family.

Xu Shu was singing on the streets of Xinye when Liu Bei noticed him and asked him if he was either the &quot;Sleeping Dragon&quot; or the &quot;Fledgling Phoenix&quot; that Sima Hui spoke of. However, Xu Shu told Liu Bei that he was neither of them. He agreed to become Liu Bei&#x27;s strategist and helped Liu counter an invading army led by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren. Cao Ren deployed his troops in an &quot;Eight Gates Golden Locks Formation&quot; (八門金鎖陣) outside Xinye, but Xu Shu pointed out the weaknesses in the formation and instructed Liu&#x27;s general Zhao Yun on how to break it. Zhao Yun led his men to attack the formation and succeeded in breaking it and defeating Cao Ren. Xu Shu also accurately predicted that Cao Ren would launch a surprise attack that night after his defeat. Liu Bei defeated Cao Ren again in the night battle and forced Cao Ren to retreat.

Cao Cao was impressed when he heard about Xu Shu and was eager to recruit Xu as an adviser. He invited Xu Shu&#x27;s mother to meet him and asked her to write a letter to her son, requesting that her son come to join him. Xu Shu&#x27;s mother refused, denounced Cao Cao as a treacherous villain, and threw an ink stone at him. The furious Cao Cao ordered Xu Shu&#x27;s mother to be executed but changed his mind when Cheng Yu reminded him that Xu Shu would be more determined to help Liu Bei oppose him if he killed his mother. Cao Cao then had Xu Shu&#x27;s mother detained and asked Cheng Yu to pretend to be Xu Shu&#x27;s sworn brother to win the trust of Xu&#x27;s mother. After some time, Cheng Yu got close to Xu Shu&#x27;s mother and learnt to mimic her handwriting. He wrote a letter to Xu Shu in the handwriting of Xu&#x27;s mother, telling Xu that she was in trouble and urging him to come to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) quickly. Xu Shu was a filial son so he immediately left for Xu after reading the letter.

Xu Shu was in a hurry when he sped off on horseback. On the way, he suddenly remembered something and immediately turned back to meet Liu Bei and recommend Zhuge Liang to him. He then resumed his journey to Xu. When he arrived at his destination, he was shocked to discover that he had been tricked. His mother was furious with her son&#x27;s failure to discern between truth and deception, and ashamed by the fact that her son joined Cao Cao instead of Liu Bei. She committed suicide. Xu Shu remained with Cao Cao, but he swore never to give advice to Cao.

The Chinese saying &quot;His body is in (Cao) Cao&#x27;s camp, but his heart is actually with the Han (dynasty)&quot; () is derived from this story about Xu Shu and another story about Guan Yu in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. It is used to describe a situation where a person who ostensibly works for a &quot;bad&quot; organisation is actually loyal towards another &quot;good&quot; organisation.

==In popular culture==

Xu Shu is first introduced as a playable character in &quot;Dynasty Warriors 7: Empires&quot; of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series.

<text>Alan Yentob, (born 11 March 1947) is a retired British television executive and presenter. He has held senior roles at the BBC including head of music and arts, controller of BBC1 and controller of BBC2. He stepped down as the BBC&#x27;s creative director in December 2015, and was chairman of the board of trustees of the charity Kids Company from 2003 until its collapse in 2015.

==Early life==
Alan Yentob was born into an Iraqi Jewish family in Stepney, London. Soon after he was born, his family moved to Manchester where his father was in business with his wife&#x27;s family, the Khazams. One example of this collaboration were dealings in &quot;Haighton Holdings&quot;, published 1951, that shows involvement of his mother Flora, father Isaac and uncle Nadji Khazam. Together they were involved in the UK with various other textile manufacturers plus wholesalers such as &quot;Spencer, Turner &amp; Boldero&quot; and &quot;Jeremiah Rotherham &amp; Co&quot;. The families also had dealings in South Africa with their holding company Anglo-African Investments. The public companies were eventually shed and a few consolidated into Dewhurst Dent, in which Alan Yentob still owns a 10% share.

He grew up in Didsbury, a suburb of Manchester, and returned to London with his family when he was 12 to live in a flat on Park Lane. He was a boarder at the independent school King&#x27;s Ely in Cambridgeshire. He passed his A Levels and studied at the Sorbonne in Paris and spent a year at Grenoble University. He went on to study law at University of Leeds, where he got involved in student drama. He graduated with a lower second class degree (2:2) in 1968.

==Career==
Yentob joined the BBC as a trainee in the BBC World Service in 1968 as its only non-Oxbridge graduate of that year. Nine months later he moved into TV to become an assistant director on arts programmes.

In 1973, he became a producer and director, working on the high-profile documentary series &quot;Omnibus&quot;, for which, in 1975, he made a film called &quot;Cracked Actor&quot; about the musician David Bowie. In 1975, he helped initiate another BBC documentary series, &quot;Arena,&quot; of which he was to remain the editor until 1985. The series still returns for semi-regular editions .

He left &quot;Arena&quot; to become the BBC&#x27;s head of music and arts, a position he occupied until 1987, when he was promoted to controller of BBC2, one of the youngest channel controllers in the BBC&#x27;s history. Under Yentob&#x27;s five-year stewardship BBC2 was revitalised and he introduced many innovations in programming such as &quot;The Late Show&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot;″s &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot;.

In 1993 he was promoted to controller of BBC1, responsible for the output of the BBC&#x27;s premier channel. He remained in the post for three years until 1996, when he was promoted again to become BBC Television&#x27;s overall director of programmes. This appointment was only a brief one, before a re-organisation of the BBC&#x27;s executive committee led to the creation of a new post, filled by Yentob, of director of drama, entertainment and children&#x27;s. This placed Yentob in overall supervision of the BBC&#x27;s output in these three genres across all media – radio, television and Internet. He occupied this post until June 2004, when new BBC director-general Mark Thompson re-organised the BBC&#x27;s executive committee and promoted Yentob to the new post of BBC creative director, responsible for overseeing BBC creative output across television, radio and interactive services.

He also began to present BBC programmes. These included a series on the life of Leonardo da Vinci and, from 2003, a new regular arts series, &quot;Imagine&quot;. One episode of &quot;Imagine&quot; had Yentob explore the World Wide Web, blogging, user-created content, and even the use of English Wikipedia, exploring people&#x27;s motives and satisfaction that can be had from sharing information on such a large scale. His own blog, created during the making of the episode, was subsequently deleted and purged. In 2007, Yentob appeared as the &#x27;host&#x27; of the satirical &quot;Imagine a Mildly Amusing Panel Show&quot;, a spoof &quot;Imagine...&quot; episode focused on the comedy panel game &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;.

According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Yentob&#x27;s reputation was affected when it was revealed that his participation in some of the interviews for &quot;Imagine&quot; had been faked. Yentob was warned not to do this again, but otherwise not disciplined, much to the disgruntlement of some who had seen more junior staff lose their jobs for lesser misdemeanours.

In 2005, Yentob was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from De Montfort University, Leicester.

On 17 March 2010, Yentob and Nigella Lawson opened the Jewish Museum London in Camden Town.

In July 2009 he was revealed to have accumulated a pension worth £6.3m, giving an annual retirement income of £216,667 for the rest of his life. This is one of the biggest pensions in the public sector. He earned £200,000 – £249,999 as a BBC contributor and presenter. He was paid a declared salary of £183,000 by the BBC, but additional income from the BBC for presenting and other roles was reputed to earn him an extra £150,000, bringing his BBC income to an estimated £330,000.

He has been on the board of trustees of the Architecture Foundation. He has been involved with several charities, including the posts of chairman and trustee of Kids Company.

Yentob resigned as the BBC&#x27;s creative director on 3 December 2015 in the wake of allegations that he had sought to influence the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Kids Company scandal.

==Kids Company==

Yentob&#x27;s role as chairman of the board of trustees for Kids Company, as well as the founder Camila Batmanghelidjh, came under close scrutiny following the collapse of the charity in early August 2015. He was accused of multiple shortcomings in oversight and financial management, and of failing to ensure that he avoided a conflict of interest with his position at the BBC. It was alleged that he intervened there in an attempt to deflect criticism of Kids Company and its founder Batmanghelidjh. Yentob vigorously defended his actions and stated in August 2015 that he was &quot;not remotely considering&quot; resigning over his behaviour. However, he resigned on 3 December 2015.

===Interventions at the BBC===

Yentob has acknowledged that he stood in the studio of the &quot;Today&quot; programme while Batmanghelidjih was being interviewed in July, later saying that he wished to hear what she had to say and was not attempting to intimidate staff. He also telephoned a senior member of staff at &quot;Newsnight&quot;, asking the programme to &quot;delay a report critical of financial management at Kids Company&quot;, and telephoned the Radio 4 presenter Edward Stourton before a report in &quot;The World at One&quot;. The BBC Trust, under chairwoman Rona Fairhead, investigated these interventions, although senior BBC management were reported to have reassured the Trust that they did not compromise editorial independence at the BBC.

===&quot;Descent into savagery&quot;===

Yentob has acknowledged signing an email from Kids Company to the government which sought millions in further funding by suggesting certain communities in London might &quot;descend into savagery&quot; if Kids Company ceased its operations. The email, which was subsequently leaked to &quot;BuzzFeed News&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme, spoke of &quot;looting, rioting and arson attacks on government buildings&quot; and warned of possible sharp spikes in &quot;starvation and modern-day slavery&quot;. It said that these concerns were &quot;not hypothetical, but based on a deep understanding of the socio-psychological background that these children operate within&quot;. Yentob said this email &quot;was not intended in any way as a threat.&quot;

===Appearance before Select Committee===

On 15 October 2015 Yentob and Batmanghelidjh made a joint appearance before a parliamentary Select Committee investigating the charity&#x27;s collapse. Their performance was widely described as disastrous. In the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the political commentator Anoosh Chakelian said they were a &quot;duo of epically proportioned egos&quot; who made &quot;as little sense – and as many accusations – as possible&quot; before the panel of MPs. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the parliamentary sketch writer Michael Deacon called their appearance the &quot;single weirdest event in recent parliamentary history&quot; and wrote of &quot;three solid hours of bewildering excuses, recriminations and non-sequiturs&quot;.

===Criticism from PACAC===
The Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee report heavily criticised Yentob. He was described as someone who condoned excessive spending and lacked proper attention to his duties. The BBC is also accused of poor leadership for failing to take action against him when he tried to make suggestions about the BBC&#x27;s reporting of Kids Company.

==Personal life==
Yentob is married to Philippa Walker, a television producer. He has two children.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 Birthday Honours for services to the arts and media.
