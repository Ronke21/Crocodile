<text>Lieutenant General Sir Aylmer Gould Hunter-Weston, (23 September 1864 – 18 March 1940) was a British Army officer who served in the First World War at Gallipoli in 1915 and in the very early stages of the Somme Offensive in 1916. He was also a Scottish Unionist MP.

Nicknamed &quot;Hunter-Bunter&quot;, Hunter-Weston has been seen as a classic example of a &quot;donkey&quot; general; he was described by his superior, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, as a &quot;rank amateur&quot;, and has been referred to by one modern writer as &quot;one of the Great War&#x27;s spectacular incompetents&quot;. However, another historian writes that although his poor performance at the battles of Krithia earned his reputation &quot;as one of the most brutal and incompetent commanders of the First World War&quot; &quot;in his later battles (at Gallipoli) he seemed to hit upon a formula for success ...(but) these small achievements were largely forgotten&quot;.

==Early life==
Hunter-Weston was born at Hunterston, West Kilbride, on 23 September 1864, the son of Lieutenant Colonel John Gould Read Hunter-Weston (1823–1904) and his second wife, who was the daughter and heir of the 25th Laird of Hunterston. He was educated at Wellington College 1875–82 and Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1882, then was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Engineers in February 1884.

==Early military career==
He was promoted captain in May 1892. He served on the Indian North West Frontier and took part in the Miranzai Expedition of 1891 and was wounded during the Waziristan Expedition of 1894–95. He was promoted to brevet major in 1895.

==Egypt and Boer War==
He was on Major General Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener&#x27;s staff on the Nile Expedition of 1896. He attended the Staff College, Camberley (where he was master of the Staff College hounds) 1898–99.

He later took part in the Second Boer War in South Africa between 1899 and 1902 as a staff officer, then as commander of the mounted engineers, then of the Royal Engineer Cavalry Division. He then became deputy assistant adjutant general (DAAG), then chief of staff, to Major General Sir John French&#x27;s Cavalry Division, before going on to command a cavalry column. His mounted engineers cut Boer-controlled roads and railways, and cut the railway near Bloemfontein to prevent the Boers from reinforcing it. In 1900 he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He was described as having &quot;reckless courage combined with technical skill and great coolness in emergency&quot;, was mentioned in dispatches (including 31 March 1900) and received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal.

After returning to Britain, Hunter-Weston served on the Royal Engineers staff in London in late 1902, when he was appointed for duty at Shorncliffe Army Camp. He was a general staff officer (GSO) with Eastern Command from 1904 to 1908. He married Grace Strang-Steel in 1905. He was promoted to brevet colonel in November 1906, and to full colonel in June 1908, and served as a general staff officer, grade 1 (GSO1) with Scottish Command from then until 1911.

In 1911 he succeeded his mother as the 27th Laird of Hunterston and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1911 Coronation Honours. He was assistant director of military training 1908–11 and his motto was &quot;teach the trainers how to teach before they try to teach the Tommies&quot;.

In March 1911 he succeeded Colonel John Du Cane as a GSO1 at the War Office in London. He held this position until February 1914 when he was promoted to temporary brigadier general and made general officer commanding (GOC) of the 11th Infantry Brigade at Colchester, taking over from Major General Henry Heath.

==First World War==
A few weeks after the outbreak of the war in 1914, he led his brigade to France as part of 4th Division on the Western Front, including at the battles of Le Cateau and the Aisne, where he supervised his command from a motorbike (at a time when senior generals used cars and most other officers used horses). He &quot;often appeared in the most surprising places&quot; and his handling of the brigade was &quot;skilful&quot;. His was the first British unit to cross the Aisne, on a damaged bridge. His bravery and determination marked him out for promotion. Hunter-Weston was one of the senior officers commanded to write regularly to the King to keep His Majesty informed of military developments. In October 1914, &quot;for distinguished conduct in the Field&quot;, he was promoted to the rank of major-general.

==Gallipoli campaign==
===Planning===
When the Gallipoli campaign commenced in March 1915, Hunter-Weston was promoted to the command of the 29th Division, which was to make the landing at Cape Helles near the entrance to the Dardanelles.

When asked for his advice before the landings, Hunter-Weston cautioned General Sir Ian Hamilton that the Turks had had ample time to turn the peninsula into &quot;an entrenched camp&quot;, that Helles was less vulnerable to Turkish attack than Suvla Bay but conversely offered little room for manoeuvre and given Britain&#x27;s lack of high explosive shells needed to cover attacks risked an Allied bridgehead being tied up in front of Kilitbahir Plateau and becoming &quot;a second Crimea&quot; which would damage Britain&#x27;s standing with neutral Greece and Romania. He suggested that given the loss of surprise (because of the unsuccessful naval attack on 18 March) it might be better to call off the expedition.

Hunter-Weston wrote to his wife (7 April) &quot;the odds against us are heavy. However, nothing is impossible&quot;. Major General William Birdwood also privately wrote the same, and Travers suggests that, as British officers of the era were expected to remain cheerful and optimistic in public, this may have been &quot;a safety outlet&quot; to be pointed to if the operation went wrong.

Hunter-Weston, supported by Admiral de Robeck, preferred a daylight landing at Helles (Hamilton and Birdwood preferred an attack just before first light – this was used for the ANZAC landing further north, which had been intended to land on the beach at Gaba Tepe).

===Landings===

Hunter-Weston concentrated on V, W and X Beaches at the tip on the peninsula, less on S and Y beaches (on the right and left flanks respectively), which were intended merely to threaten the Turkish retreat. No contingency plan had been made for S or Y beach forces to push ahead if the main forces at V, W and X were held up. Admiral Wemyss and Hunter-Weston spent 25 April, the day of the landings, on board HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot;, the attendant ship at W beach, so were unable to inspect elsewhere – Hunter-Weston and his chief of staff Brigadier-General H. E. Street were on the bridge, where their papers were scattered every five minutes when the ship&#x27;s 9.2-inch gun was fired. An angry Roger Keyes recorded that they &quot;were in complete ignorance of what was going on anywhere except at W and possibly at X Beach&quot; and was furious at Hamilton for adhering to Staff College doctrine by not interfering with &quot;the man on the spot&quot; (Hamilton claimed he was dissuaded by Braithwaite, even though he could see that V Beach was in trouble).

He diverted the Essex Regiment (part of 88th Brigade) from V to W Beach at 0830 hrs. Hunter-Weston&#x27;s diary records that &quot;V Beach is still hung up&quot;, suggesting that he thought the problems there temporary, although he was dissuaded from landing to take personal command at that beach.

For ten hours on 25 April Lt-Col Godfrey Matthews signalled to Hunter-Weston, demanding reinforcements of men and ammunition at Y Beach, but received no reply. Hunter-Weston did not reply to Hamilton&#x27;s first offer (9.21am) to make more trawlers available to land more troops at Y Beach, where they had surprise and lack of opposition. After being ordered to reply to the second message (10:00 am) he only did so at 10.35 am after consulting Admiral Wemyss. He was still awaiting reports from V Beach at the time. At 6:00 pm Marshall, the commander at X Beach, asked permission to advance to assist Y Beach, but after a delay of two hours Hunter-Weston ordered him to stay put and advance the following day.

On the evening of 25 April Hunter-Weston boarded HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to confer with Hamilton, who recorded that he was &quot;cheery, stout-hearted, quite a good tonic and – on the whole – his news is good&quot;.
After 25 April landings Hunter-Weston thought the bravery of the men at W Beach &quot;a most marvellous feat&quot;.

Hunter-Weston appears to have little interest in Y Beach during the night of 25–26 April. He did not mention Y Beach in his diary, and later concealed the evidence about it from Hamilton until July 1915. When the force at Y Beach had to be evacuated on the morning of 26 April – a decision taken at the local level – Hamilton assumed that Hunter-Weston had ordered this without consulting him.

Robin Prior writes that Hunter-Weston &quot;remained anchored off W beach.. He was out of contact with S and Y, neglected X and seemed determined to avoid any knowledge of V... (he) took no steps to gather information for himself. His one positive move (to shift troops from V to W beach) had nothing to do with the situation at V and only succeeded because the Turkish defence was stretched too thinly.&quot; Gordon Corrigan claims – without giving further detail – that his command of the division was &quot;one of the more competent aspects&quot; of the Helles landings and that &quot;his handling of the division, once ashore, was thoroughly competent&quot;.

===First Krithia===

Because the French were taking time to get ashore, on 27 April Hunter-Weston postponed his advance until 4pm, with a view to taking the hill of Achi Baba the following day. The complex wheeling plan had neglected the effect of gullies and ravines on troop movements. Hunter-Weston, in response to a request for information at 3.30pm, reported that there was nothing to justify &quot;alarmist&quot; reports, but that his troops were exhausted, short of ammunition, had suffered too many casualties and were at risk from Turkish counter-attack. He declined Hamilton&#x27;s request to attack that day.

Hunter-Weston wrote to his wife (27 April) &quot;my men have effected the impossible … we have managed it, we have achieved the impossible!&quot; Having believed that the landing had only a one in four chance of success, he now believed that getting ashore had solved half the problem, and that capturing the hill of Achi Baba would solve three-quarters, although he added that this would take some time. There was no time for conferences before the First Battle of Krithia, and the French commander, d&#x27;Amade, was confused as to what was expected of him.

Progress up from the bridgehead at Helles was severely hampered by lack of artillery: at First Krithia (28 April 1915) only 18 guns were available—a comparable division-sized assault on the Western Front at the time might have had 200—and there was a shortage of mules to pull them forward, and nobody was sure where the Turkish front line actually was.

The Turks attacked the French on the nights of 1–2 May and 3–4 May. On 2 May, seeking to exploit the repulse of a Turkish attack the previous night, he launched an attack across the line, despite his troops being tired and short of ammunition – the 86th Brigade, too tired even to attack, stayed completely stationary – Robin Prior writes &quot;no ground was gained by this lamentable episode&quot;. Hunter-Weston lent the French, the morale of whose African troops was in difficulties, the Anson Battalion of the Royal Naval Division and some Worcesters. Milward, a British officer, wrote that Hunter-Weston was cheerful and firm with the French. By this time the 29th Division had suffered 4,500 casualties, leaving 6,000 effectives, although the French attacking on the right flank had suffered in similar proportion.

===Second Krithia===
The Second Battle of Krithia (6–8 May 1915) was probably the last chance to break through at Helles. 105 guns were available, of which probably 75 were used but this was still far fewer than would have been used on the Western Front and there was still a lack of H.E. shells (many guns were 18-pounders firing only shrapnel), mules and knowledge of the Turkish positions, whilst Hunter-Weston&#x27;s plans were excessively detailed and complex, full of map references and complex wheeling manoeuvres. Hunter-Weston had around 25,000 troops, few of them fresh. Intelligence estimated Turkish numbers at around 15,000–20,000 which was broadly accurate.

Hunter-Weston planned a three-pronged assault: 125th Brigade (territorials), part of the newly-arriving 42nd Division, on the left, a composite 88th Brigade in the centre, and the French on the right. Hamilton would have preferred an attack just before dawn, but Hunter-Weston, citing the loss of company officers, did not, and it is unclear that he was wrong. D&#x27;Amade agreed and Hamilton deferred to their Western front experience, which he lacked.

Hunter-Weston persisted in his attacks on 7 and 8 May. Hunter-Weston issued a warning order to brigadiers at 23.35 on 7 May, but formal orders were not issued on the morning of 8 May until two hours before the attack was due to begin, giving brigadiers little time to locate and confer with battalion commanders.

Colonel Wolley Dod, a staff officer of 29th Division, later called Krithia &quot;a mad adventure without the necessary artillery support&quot; and &quot;had some difference of opinion with Hunter-Weston&quot; about using the 125th Brigade again after their initial defeat. In a letter to his wife, Hunter-Weston noted of 125th Brigade that &quot;it was blooded today. It did fairly well, and will do better still as it gets more experience&quot; and that the rattle of musketry &quot;lull(ed) him to sleep&quot;. He also informed his wife that Hamilton thought him a great commander, worth a brigade of troops, which he explained to her was 4,000 men (Hamilton indeed thought he had &quot;truly great qualities as a commander&quot; but also that he was tiresome, grasping and talkative). Hunter-Weston also wrote to the King&#x27;s adviser Clive Wigram about how detachment was a necessary quality in a commander. On 15 May he commented that 29th Division, whose severe casualties he had just listed, were &quot;glorious fellows&quot;.

Hunter-Weston (15 May) proposed to break the stalemate by landing six New Army divisions at Enos on the west coast of Thrace. Hunter-Weston was advising Hamilton that another attack could deliver Achi Baba, with no need to wait for 52nd Division, due on 7 June. Aubrey Herbert wrote in his private diary that Hunter-Weston was &quot;more hated than most of the generals&quot;.

As the campaign proceeded and more reinforcements were dispatched to Helles, on 24 May he was promoted to temporary lieutenant-general and placed in command of VIII Corps (29th Division, the Royal Naval Division, 42nd Division and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade).

===Third Krithia===
Hunter-Weston thought the sinking of the battleship HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; (27 May) &quot;a marvellous sight&quot; and later thought the sinking of a French transport &quot;a wonderful sight&quot;.

After Second Krithia Hunter-Weston still believed that the capture of Achi Baba was a realistic aspiration, as did Henri Gouraud, who had replaced d&#x27;Amade in command of the French troops on 15 May. Hamilton, who would have preferred to wait for more troops and munitions, deferred to their judgement, and planning for Third Krithia began at a conference on 31 May.

Brigadier-General William Marshall recorded how Hunter-Weston insisted that the 127th Manchester Brigade sap forward during a full moon on the night of 2 June, despite his protests that they were advancing into a re-entrant. Visiting the troops afterwards to congratulate them, Hunter-Weston commented that it would have been worth doing even for 500 casualties (there had in fact been fifty).

At the Third Battle of Krithia (4 June), Hunter-Weston planned with more caution and realism, gaining better intelligence of Turkish positions (including aerial photography), ordering night digging to get the start-off point within of the Turkish positions (it had been the previous time) and ordering a lull in the bombardment in the hope that the Turkish guns might give away their positions by retaliating, thus enabling counter-battery fire.

A breakthrough towards Krithia was almost attained by the British infantry (88th brigade) in the centre – where the artillery fire had been concentrated – Hunter-Weston was concerned about an advance in the centre being trapped in a salient and so committed nine of his 18 reserve battalions (12 British, 6 French) not to the centre but to the unsuccessful attacks on the flanks (Indians on the left flank and the Royal Naval Division and the French on the right). This error of reinforcing failure rather than success made the battle, in Robin Prior&#x27;s view, &quot;not one of (his) finer moments&quot;. However, Steel &amp; Hart to some extent defend this decision, taken after consultation with the French, on the grounds that he had very limited reserves and the weaker parts of the line had to be shored up (in the event the renewed attack was cancelled as the French were in no state to attack again). Afterwards he blamed wire, machine-gun fire and the French, lack of training stopping the Royal Naval Division holding onto captured trenches, and loss of officers.

He still thought that more men, guns and ammunition might enable him to win a &quot;glorious victory&quot; on 11 June, and after the event thought it had been &quot;glorious in execution&quot;. Travers comments on Hunter-Weston&#x27;s &quot;mental and physical detachment&quot; at this time, and on the romantic view of war and self-praise in his letters.
Hunter-Weston&#x27;s dugout, dug in June 1915 as protection from Turkish guns firing from near Troy (on the east bank of the Dardanelles) was called &quot;Baronial Hall&quot;.

===Improved artillery concentration===
In Prior&#x27;s view &quot;there is strong evidence that (Hunter-Weston) took to heart the lessons&quot; that concentrated High Explosive bombardment by heavy howitzers was needed for success and held meetings with the French General Gouraud at which they agreed to cooperate with their artillery and adopt this method. Progress was made in some attacks in late June and early July, with one French attack using a density of shelling up to 20 times that of the early attacks. In some cases these inflicted greater casualties on the Turkish defenders than the attackers, as lack of space, reserves and guns did not allow the Turks to adopt the defensive tactics used by the Germans later in the war: holding the front line thinly, counter-attacking and counter-battery fire on Allied artillery. Travers attributes &quot;bite and hold&quot; to Hamilton, who proposed it, on Birdwood&#x27;s suggestion on 10 May.

Having been discovered by the Allies, these &quot;bite and hold&quot; tactics were then abandoned and their discovery in Gallipoli largely forgotten by historians. This may be because Hunter-Weston and Gouraud were both soon invalided out of the peninsula or because the Allies had never intended Gallipoli to be about trench warfare and so were not interested in learning tactical land warfare lessons from it or because the development of artillery tactics throughout the war was not a clear-cut process, as is shown by the fact that similar tactics almost worked at Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 but were then not used for over a year afterwards.

Kereves Spur and Gully Spur, which had held up the advance on 4 June, were taken on 21 June and 28 June by limited advances under heavy artillery fire, whilst Hunter-Weston and Gouraud agreed that an attack on Fir Tree Spur on 28 June had failed because of lack of artillery there. Even in this period, attacks did not always turn out as hoped: during the Battle of Gully Ravine in late June he attacked with the inexperienced Scottish 52nd (Lowland) Division – the attack succeeded on the left, where artillery fire was concentrated (as the Indians had been thrown back there earlier in June) but the attack was over too wide a distance and half the 156th Brigade, attacking on the right with insufficient artillery support became casualties, of which over a third were killed (this was the attack of which Hunter-Weston claimed he was &quot;blooding the pups&quot;).

On 3 July 1915 John Churchill reported &quot;The 29th Div is down to small numbers now … These continual frontal attacks are terrible, and I fear the generals will be called butchers by the troops. HW already has that name with the 29th.&quot;

===Departure===
The next attack was scheduled for 12 July as the superior French artillery would not be available until then. Hunter-Weston aimed to use the relatively fresh 52nd Division as his main offensive force, as the other three divisions of IX Corps were too worn out for much more than line-holding operations. Hamilton had wanted to deploy 52nd Division to ANZAC Cove, but concurred as he accepted that the Turks at Helles needed to be pressed after their losses on 5 July.

The attack was renewed on 12–13 July, with 155th and 157th Brigade (both part of 52nd Division) committed for the first time. Maj-Gen Egerton, GOC 52nd division, later (in 1929) wrote that Hunter-Weston &quot;simply enunciated&quot; his &quot;positively wicked&quot; plan, but that there was little discussion. Colonel McNeile of the 4th KOSBs appears to have had a heated discussion with Hunter-Weston over the objectives: he was subsequently killed in the attack.
On 13 July, in an attempt to forestall a Turkish counterattack (there had been an incident of panic amongst the 7th Highland Light Infantry), Hunter-Weston ordered the Royal Marine Brigade to attack at 16.30. Owing to confusion, only two of the three battalions (Portsmouth, and Nelson but not Chatham) attacked, and incurred over 500 casualties advancing over open ground (although communication trenches had been dug) from the &quot;original&quot; British front line to a line already held by the 157th Brigade.

The journalist Ashmead-Bartlett wrote of how &quot;a great number of the Brigadier-Generals openly refused to take any further orders from Hunter-Weston, who was responsible for the muddle … they all said that … he had been affected by the sun a little, and was incapable of giving orders&quot;. Hunter-Weston relieved Egerton of command of 52nd Division on 13 July, sending him to his ship for a night&#x27;s rest. Orlo Williams, a cipher officer, wrote in his diary (21 July) of how Hamilton, the nominal commander-in-chief of the campaign, had little direct involvement and how Hunter-Weston and a few staff officers were running the show.

Hunter-Weston was himself relieved on 23 July, officially for enteric or sunstroke, and returned to England. Les Carlyon wrote &quot;What was wrong with (Hunter-Weston) has never become clear. The explanations run from sunstroke and exhaustion to enteric fever and dysentery to a collapse and a breakdown. Hamilton ... saw him &#x27;staggering&#x27; off to a hospital ship.&quot; Hamilton recorded &quot;He is suffering very much from his head&quot;. Next day he recorded &quot;Hunter-Weston has to go home&quot; and a few days later he referred to &quot;Hunter-Weston&#x27;s breakdown&quot;. Hamilton later wrote to Aspinall of the Dardanelles Commission (July 1916) that Lady Hunter-Weston had been told that her husband was being &quot;sent home&quot;, normally a euphemism for sacking. Travers argues that his illness was used as an excuse to relieve him of command. He was knighted after being invalided home.

Godley wrote (23 July) &quot;with all his faults Hunter-Weston was a gallant soul … At the same time, one is rather thankful to think he will not be (as he calls it) &quot;blooding&quot; Freddie Stopford&#x27;s reinforcements (IX Corps) against Achi Baba&quot;. Political leaders in London had agreed to commit a further five divisions to Gallipoli in July, but had decided instead that further attacks from the Helles bridgehead were too slow and costly and that a fresh landing at Suvla Bay offered a better chance of swift victory. Hunter-Weston wrote to Hamilton (11 August – after criticism had been made of Stopford&#x27;s lack of initiative at Suvla) urging that he appoint commanders who would &quot;push unrelentingly, push without ceasing, push without mercy&quot;, without regard to the &quot;yelping&quot; of subordinate commanders.

==Seaborne Landing on Belgian Coast==
At a meeting at Dover, Hunter-Weston was asked to lend his experience to discussions with Admiral Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol, about Operation Hush a planned amphibious assault on the Belgian Coast (Haig diary 25 February 1916). After Haig had to abandon his plans for a Flanders Offensive in 1916, this landing was eventually scheduled to take place in the late summer or early autumn of 1917, to coincide with the Third Ypres Offensive, but in the end never took place.

==The Somme==
===Planning===

In March 1916 Hunter-Weston was again promoted to acting lieutenant-general and again placed in command of VIII Corps, which was re-established in France; he commanded it in the early months of the Somme Offensive. At a Fourth Army Conference 30 March 1916 Hunter-Weston told Rawlinson that he was &quot;strongly opposed to a wild rush … for an objective 4,000 yards away&quot; and that &quot;to lose the substance by grasping at the shadow is a mistake that has been made too often in this war&quot;. Haig—who had recently rejected Rawlinson&#x27;s initial proposal to concentrate on capturing the German First Line on the first day of the offensive, before bringing guns forward and attacking the Second Line several days later—was critical that Hunter-Weston &quot;was only going to take the enemy first system to begin with, and proceed slowly stage by stage&quot; which would give the Germans a chance to bring up reserves, like the French at Verdun (Haig Diary 7 and 8 April 1916) He urged Hunter-Weston that his men should push on as far as possible without consolidating, as far as artillery cover allowed (Haig Diary 10 May 1916).

VIII Corps consisted (from north to south) of 31st, 4th and 29th Divisions. The German front line was overlooked by their second line, and by the fortified villages of Serre and Beaucourt.

VIII Corps &quot;were saturated with optimism over-emphasising the effect of the preliminary bombardment&quot;. Hunter-Weston &quot;was extremely optimistic, telling everybody that the wire had been blown away&quot; although &quot;they could see it standing strong and well&quot; and that the enemy front line &quot;would be blown to pieces&quot; and that the attackers would &quot;walk into Serre&quot; (testimony of various officers to Edmonds, 1929).

VIII Corps took an exceptionally prescriptive approach to planning the Somme attack. Conferences were held on 21 and 23 June for brigadiers to share ideas. A 70-page report was issued, whose 28 headings included orders for the formation to be adopted down to company level for the advance on the second and third objectives, details and map references for strong points to be constructed, artillery plans, water supply plans and plans for the handling of prisoners. A section entitled &quot;all units must push on resolutely&quot; was followed by detailed plans for the digging of burial pits. Andy Simpson comments that the plan &quot;seems to have been constructed on the basis that nothing could or would go wrong&quot;. Hunter-Weston wrote to his wife that he and his &quot;excellent staff (had) done all possible to ensure success … I have nothing more to do now but to rest until well after the attack has taken place&quot;.

Brigadier-General Hubert Rees, commander of 94th Brigade (part of the raw 31st Division) which was to attack at Serre, thought Hunter-Weston&#x27;s plan &quot;a terrible document&quot; of 76 pages, to which division HQ added a further 365 pages of supplementary instructions. Rees spent three days condensing this to a summary of eight pages and five maps, before having &quot;a severe argument&quot; with Hunter-Weston to have the plan amended to allow his brigade an extra ten minutes to take an orchard just east of Serre.

===Patrols===
Prior to the main attack VIII Corps was the only corps of Fourth Army to produce far more negative than positive reports from patrols. Ten raids were conducted, and it was reported that the German wire was intact on 31 Division sector, well cut on 4th Division sector, and variably cut on 29 Division sector. Rawlinson was particularly concerned with the situation, to the point of discussing it with Haig (Haig Diary 28 June 1916).

Haig claimed (Diary 28 June) that VIII Corps had not carried out any successful raids, apparently forgetting 29th Division&#x27;s raid on the night of 4/5 June, which had discovered the existence of deep enemy dugouts. Two days before the offensive began Haig had little confidence in VIII Corps trench raiding or counter-battery fire, and after talking to a VIII Corps artillery officer thought they were &quot;amateurs in hard fighting&quot; who thought they knew it all because of Gallipoli, unlike those who had learned from &quot;adversity, shortage of ammunition, and fighting under difficulties against a superior European enemy&quot;.
One patrol—by a unit of Royal Dublin Fusiliers from 29th Division—managed to fight its way through the wire, and observed (report of 29 June) that the German front trench had been destroyed by the bombardment, but could not reach even that far as the area was swept by fire from the German second position. On the eve of battle Rawlinson noted (Rawlinson Diary 30 June) that &quot;VIII Corps front … is somewhat behind-hand&quot; at wire-cutting.

Rawlinson also noted that counter-battery fire had not worked well on VIII Corps sector, although in fact, largely owing to shortage of artillery, the problem was more widespread across other sectors than Rawlinson realised.

===1 July 1916===
Across the entire British front, 19 mines had been dug by Royal Engineer tunnelling companies to weaken enemy defences. The northernmost mine of of explosives was under the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, a front-line fortification west of the village of Beaumont Hamel in the VIII Corps sector. Hunter-Weston wished to detonate the mine four hours early, but this was vetoed by the Inspector of Mines at BEF GHQ, who pointed out that the British had a poor record of seizing craters before the Germans got there. As a compromise Hunter-Weston was allowed to detonate at 07:20. The explosion was filmed by British cinematographer Geoffrey Malins, who was recording the 29th Division attack. The other mines were detonated at 7:28 am, two minutes before Zero hour when the infantry advance would begin. In many cases, including Hawthorne Ridge, the Germans were able to seize the craters before the British troops crossed No Man&#x27;s Land.

The Hawthorne Crater was to be seized by two companies. Artillery fire was lifted ten minutes before zero hour so as not to hit them, and field artillery two minutes before. In a blunder this was applied across the whole of VIII Corps sector, allowing the Germans ample time to man their parapets. Gallipoli veteran Major J.H.Gibbon of 460th Battery wrote to Hunter-Weston to protest that this was unwise, but received no reply.

On 1 July 1916 it was Hunter-Weston&#x27;s divisions, attacking in the northern sector between the Ancre and the Serre, that suffered the worst casualties and failed to capture any of their objectives. Artillery fire was weaker here and the Germans had the advantage of high ground, whereas in the southern sector the opposite was true, but the decision had been made by senior generals (Haig and Rawlinson) to launch the attack over a wide front. His corps suffered 14,581 casualties on the first day. Only a few small sections of enemy line were gained, and these had to be abandoned within a day or two. Of the three corps which tried a creeping barrage on the day of the attack, only VIII Corps was completely unsuccessful.

===Under Gough===
Haig commented in his diary (1 July) that given their lack of progress VIII Corps men could not have left their trenches, and placed VIII and X Corps under Gough&#x27;s command, commenting that &quot;The VIII Corps seems to need looking after!&quot; Reports of the slaughter in that sector had not yet reached him. After 1 July it was impossible to renew the attack in this sector as the trenches were clogged with dead and dying men. Andy Simpson compares Hunter-Weston&#x27;s command style at this time to that of &quot;a sleepwalker&quot;. Hunter-Weston&#x27;s own writings show that he regarded this as the modern managerial approach to fighting larger battles, and Simpson also points out that in practice he did direct his divisions actively on 1 July and he was &quot;very busy&quot; on 2 and 3 July as he tried to salvage the disaster which had befallen his corps.

After the event, Hunter-Weston (to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Robertson, 2 July) blamed the failure on the ineffective artillery bombardment, including lack of howitzer shells. Much later (in 1929) he blamed the premature detonation of the mine and claimed that failure had been inevitable and foreseen at the time because of the poor artillery preparation. However, at the time he had refused to alter the artillery scheme. Replying to Robertson&#x27;s inquiries, Hunter Weston wrote (2 July) &quot;It is inadvisable to give currency to such unpleasant and dangerous facts&quot;. In the following weeks he visited every battalion that had attacked, thanking the soldiers and telling them that they had made a necessary sacrifice so that advances could be made elsewhere on the front. On one of these occasions he narrowly escaped death from a German shell.

With the BEF having recently expanded tenfold in size, able officers were in short supply and were often poached by units higher up the chain of command. Hunter-Weston&#x27;s senior artillery officer Brig-Gen Tancred was removed to Reserve Army while Hunter-Weston was away visiting his dentist in Boulogne (Gough was keen to centralise control of artillery at army rather than corps level). A letter to his wife (3 August 1916) expresses his dissatisfaction at staffwork in Gough&#x27;s Reserve Army and his gladness that VIII Corps was moving to the Ypres Salient. Hunter-Weston protested that he had not been &quot;Stellenbosched&quot; (a Boer War term for moving generals to unimportant duties back at the base). He may well have been saved from the sack because, owing to the shortage of competent senior generals, British corps commanders were seldom sacked at this stage of the war.

==1917==
In an October 1916 by-election, he was elected to the House of Commons as the Unionist member for North Ayrshire, defeating a pro-peace clergyman, Reverend Chelmers, by 7,419 votes to 1,300. Hunter-Weston, who was the first Member of Parliament to simultaneously command an army corps on the field, continued to command VIII Corps but was not involved in another offensive. He had the permission of General Sir Herbert Plumer, commander of the Second Army, to attend the Irish Home Rule debate in March 1917.

At the Battle of Messines (in which VIII Corps did not directly participate), he suggested that he launch a feint attack on his front five minutes before the main attack. This was vetoed by Plumer. Hunter-Weston&#x27;s VIII Corps was moved again, this time out of the Ypres salient, as he had not been selected to command in the upcoming Third Ypres offensive. He handed over his sector to Maxse, GOC XVIII Corps, Cavan, GOC XIV Corps, Watts, GOC XIX Corps, and Jacob, GOC II Corps, in May 1917 (three corps—Jacob took over only a small part of VIII Corps sector—replacing one, due to the greater density of troops needed for a major offensive). VIII Corps returned to the Ypres Salient after the main offensive ended and took part in a local operation on the night of Hunter-Weston was deeply concerned at the problem of defending the ground which had been gained and wrote claiming that he would resign for the good of the Empire if Haig attempted to renew the offensive (7 December 1917).

Hunter-Weston unjustifiably (in Simon Robbins&#x27; view) sacked two divisional commanders, Philip Wood (33rd Division, in November 1917) and P. S. Wilkinson (50th Division, in February 1918) for lack of aggression. Hunter-Weston spoke to subordinate generals &quot;as if he was teaching a class of NCOs&quot; (according to Major-General Sir Reginald Pinney, 24 December 1917).

==1918==
After three weeks&#x27; home leave for preparation, he delivered his House of Commons maiden speech on the Manpower Bill on 24 January 1918 (at a time of much dispute over the manpower requirements of the army relative to agriculture, munitions, shipbuilding and ship-crewing and open warfare in the press between allies of the Prime Minister and of the CIGS William Robertson over the deployment of troops between fronts). It was praised by his army commander, and the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; described it as the &quot;Greatest Speech of the War&quot;. Hunter-Weston warned Haig (Haig Diary 25 February 1918) that some of his men had asked some visiting MPs if they were &quot;Labour MPs&quot; and had complained to them about the horrors of war and asked what they were fighting for.

In May 1918, during the reshuffling of Allied units, now under the Supreme Command of General Ferdinand Foch, to meet the German spring offensives, VIII Corps was at one point on the verge of being sent to join French Fourth Army. Hunter-Weston held a horseshow in August 1918, whilst the Battle of Amiens was in progress. Although he has been ridiculed for this, it has also been pointed out that VIII Corps was not involved in fighting at the time and that such events boosted morale and encouraged care of horses, which were still extensively used for transport and hauling equipment. He played an active role leading his corps in the Hundred Days Offensive, revisiting the battlefield of Le Cateau (11 October) and recollecting his successful handling of his brigade there.

==Command style==
Hunter-Weston was a regular inspector of trenches and machine gun positions. He reconnoitred positions personally and on one occasion (1 November 1918) climbed into a fort on a rope ladder. Aged in his early fifties, he took great pride in his physical fitness and was proud of reducing more junior officers, including on one occasion a battalion commander in his mid-thirties, to breathlessness whilst out walking. In his autobiography Bonham-Carter recorded that Hunter-Weston devoted too much time to minor details which should have been left to junior staff officers. He thought him &quot;a mountebank&quot; and self-important, with the brain of an inexperienced boy and with a penchant for heroics. He was also notorious for his interest in inspecting latrines.

Hunter-Weston seems to have been regarded by his superiors as a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; for receiving visiting dignitaries. He frequently visited Belgian divisional and corps HQ, as well as, on occasion, Belgian GCQ, the Belgian Prime Minister, and once took the King of the Belgians on a tour of the British lines. He received the Apostolic Delegate and Doyen of Ypres to dinner. He laid on a lavish lunch for the Portuguese President Machado in October 1917, taking his party on a tour of the Messines battlefield, where the ground had been carefully seeded with interesting souvenirs for them to &quot;find&quot;. He had French President Poincaré to lunch twice and in late 1918 accompanied him on a visit to recently liberated towns and villages. At other times he received the Siamese, Italian and Romanian military attaches. He also used to take visiting British politicians to a vantage point on Hill 63 to see the Ypres Battlefield.

==Post-military life==
Hunter-Weston married Grace Strang Steel on 5 December 1905 at Selkirk; they had no children.

Hunter-Weston continued in politics after the war, being elected again for Bute and Northern Ayrshire in 1918. He resigned from the army in 1919. He was promoted to permanent lieutenant-general in January 1919.

After the war his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry filled an entire column. He retired from parliament in 1935 and died, aged seventy-five, on 18 March 1940 following a fall from a turret at his ancestral home in Hunterston; he was survived by his wife. His wealth at death was £41,658 11s (around £2m at 2016 prices) as of 23 August 1940.

His diaries, typed up and accompanied by letters and newspaper cuttings, were deposited in the British Museum after his death. Andy Simpson writes of these documents that &quot;self-congratulation was one of his favourite activities&quot;.

==Assessments==
Hunter-Weston acquired a reputation as an eccentric man, prone to laughter.

Hamilton called him &quot;an acute theorist&quot;. Compton Mackenzie, author of &quot;Gallipoli Memories&quot;, comments on the way in which he was regarded as a &quot;butcher&quot; but wrote that &quot;Actually no man I have met brimmed over more richly with human sympathy. He was a logican (sic) of war and as a logican he believed and was always ready to contend in open debate that, provided the objective was gained, casualties were of no importance&quot;.

W. B. Wood, one of the Official History writing team, wrote (in 1944) &quot;my own blood had boiled as I read of the … results of Hunter-Weston&#x27;s pig-headed tactics at Gallipoli&quot;.

Les Carlyon comments that he &quot;threw away men the way other men tossed away socks&quot; and writes &quot;One cannot condemn (him) for failing to understand the new warfare of the twentieth century; few generals did in 1915. One can, however, condemn (him) for faults that are timeless. (He was) careless and arrogant and not very good&quot;.

Travers comments that VIII Corps staff work was poor, Hunter-Weston had too much freedom at Krithia and attacks became &quot;ritualistic&quot;. He comments on his time as a Western Front commander that he was &quot;an officer of intelligence, but lacking mental balance, given to extravagant and flamboyant gestures, and far too interested in irrelevant detail&quot;.

Gordon Corrigan claims that Hunter-Weston&#x27;s performance at Gallipoli was &quot;competent&quot; but that he is unfairly vilified for his premature blowing of the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt on 1 July 1916.

<text>Wendigo () is a mythological creature or evil spirit originating from Algonquian folklore. The concept of the wendigo has been widely used in literature and other works of art, such as social commentary and horror fiction.

The wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is said to cause its victims a feeling of insatiable hunger, the desire to eat other humans, and the propensity to commit murder. In some representations, the wendigo is described as a giant humanoid with a heart of ice, whose approach is signaled by a foul stench or sudden unseasonable chill. 

In modern psychiatry, the disorder known as &quot;Wendigo psychosis&quot; is characterized by symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and fear of becoming a cannibal. Wendigo psychosis is described as a culture-bound syndrome. In some First Nations communities, symptoms such as insatiable greed and destruction of the environment are also thought to be symptoms of wendigo psychosis.

The wechuge is a similar being that appears in the legends of the Athabaskan people of the Northwest Pacific Coast. It too is cannibalistic; however, it is characterized as enlightened with ancestral insights.

==Etymology==
The word appears in many Native American languages, and has many alternative translations. The source of the English word is the Ojibwe word . In the Cree language it is , also transliterated . Other transliterations include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

A plural form is also spelled , , or .

The Proto-Algonquian term has been reconstructed as , which may have meant &quot;owl&quot;.

==Folklore==
The wendigo is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples, including the Ojibwe, the Saulteaux, the Cree, the Naskapi, and the Innu. Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being. They were strongly associated with the north, winter, cold, famine, and starvation.

Basil H. Johnston, an Ojibwe teacher and scholar from Ontario, describes a wendigo:

In Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu lore, wendigos are often described as giants that are many times larger than human beings, a characteristic absent from myths in other Algonquian cultures. Whenever a wendigo ate another person, it would grow in proportion to the meal it had just eaten, so it could never be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and extremely thin due to starvation.

The wendigo is seen as the embodiment of gluttony, greed, and excess: never satisfied after killing and consuming one person, they are constantly searching for new victims.

A wendigo need not lose the human&#x27;s powers of cognition or speech and in some depictions may clearly communicate with its prospective victims or even threaten or taunt them. A specimen of folk story collected in the early 20th century by Lottie Chicogquaw Marsden, an ethnographer of the Chippewas of Rama First Nation, in which a wendigo also exhibits tool use, an ability to survive partial dismemberment, and autocannibalism, reads:

===Human cannibalism===
In some traditions, humans overpowered by greed could turn into wendigos; the myth thus served as a method of encouraging cooperation and moderation. Other sources say wendigos were created when a human resorted to cannibalism to survive. Humans could also turn into wendigos by being in contact with them for too long.

===Taboo reinforcement ceremony===
Among the Assiniboine, the Cree, and the Ojibwe, a satirical ceremonial dance is sometimes performed during times of famine to reinforce the seriousness of the wendigo taboo. The ceremony, known as &quot;wiindigookaanzhimowin&quot;, was performed during times of famine, and involved wearing masks and dancing backward around a drum. The last known wendigo ceremony conducted in the United States was at Lake Windigo of Star Island of Cass Lake, within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota.

==Psychosis==
In historical accounts of retroactively diagnosed wendigo psychosis, it has been reported that humans became possessed by the wendigo spirit, after being in a situation of needing food and having no other choice besides cannibalism. In 1661, &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot; reported:

Although in many recorded cases of wendigo psychosis the individual has been killed to prevent cannibalism from resulting, some Cree folklore recommends treatment by ingestion of fatty animal meats or drinking animal grease; those treated may sometimes vomit ice as part of the curing process.

One of the more famous cases of wendigo psychosis reported involved a Plains Cree trapper from Alberta, named Swift Runner. During the winter of 1878, Swift Runner and his family were starving, and his eldest son died. Twenty-five miles away from emergency food supplies at a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post, Swift Runner butchered and ate his wife and five remaining children. Given that he resorted to cannibalism so near to food supplies, and that he killed and consumed the remains of all those present, it was revealed that Swift Runner&#x27;s was not a case of pure cannibalism as a last resort to avoid starvation, but rather of a man with wendigo psychosis. He eventually confessed and was executed by authorities at Fort Saskatchewan.

Another well-known case involving wendigo psychosis was that of Jack Fiddler, an Oji-Cree chief and medicine man known for his powers at defeating wendigos. In some cases, this entailed killing people with wendigo psychosis. As a result, in 1907, Fiddler and his brother Joseph were arrested by the Canadian authorities for homicide. Jack committed suicide, but Joseph was tried and sentenced to life in prison. He ultimately was granted a pardon but died three days later in jail before receiving the news of this pardon.

Fascination with wendigo psychosis among Western ethnographers, psychologists, and anthropologists led to a hotly debated controversy in the 1980s over the historicity of this phenomenon. Some researchers argued that, essentially, Wendigo psychosis was a fabrication, the result of naïve anthropologists taking stories related to them at face value without observation. Others have pointed to a number of credible eyewitness accounts, both by Algonquians and others, as evidence that wendigo psychosis was a factual historical phenomenon.

The frequency of wendigo psychosis cases decreased sharply in the 20th century as Boreal Algonquian people came into greater and greater contact with European ideologies and more sedentary, less rural, lifestyles.

In his 2004 treatise &quot;Revenge of the Windigo&quot; on disorders and treatments of the behavioral health industry in the United States and Canada that are peculiar to indigenous people, James B. Waldram wrote,

The 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) classifies &quot;Windigo&quot; as a culture-specific disorder, describing it as &quot;Rare, historic accounts of cannibalistic obsession... Symptoms included depression, homicidal or suicidal thoughts, and a delusional, compulsive wish to eat human flesh... Some controversial new studies question the syndrome&#x27;s legitimacy, claiming cases were actually a product of hostile accusations invented to justify the victim&#x27;s ostracism or execution.&quot;

Some metal, vitamin, and oligoelements deficiencies are linked to psychosis-like conditions, Wendigo could be a folk elaboration of some near-starvation mental disorders.

==As a concept or metaphor==

In addition to denoting a cannibalistic monster from certain traditional folklore, some Native Americans also understand the wendigo conceptually. As a concept, the wendigo can apply to any person, idea, or movement infected by a corrosive drive toward self-aggrandizing greed and excessive consumption, traits that sow disharmony and destruction if left unchecked. Ojibwe scholar Brady DeSanti asserts that the wendigo &quot;can be understood as a marker indicating... a person... imbalanced both internally and toward the larger community of human and spiritual beings around them.&quot; Out of equilibrium and estranged by their communities, individuals thought to be afflicted by the wendigo spirit unravel and destroy the ecological balance around them. Chippewa author Louise Erdrich&#x27;s novel &quot;The Round House&quot;, winner of the National Book Award, depicts a situation where an individual person becomes a wendigo. The novel describes its primary antagonist, a rapist whose violent crimes desecrate a sacred site, as a wendigo who must be killed because he threatens the reservation&#x27;s safety.

In addition to characterizing individual people who exhibit destructive tendencies, the wendigo can also describe movements and events with similarly negative effects. According to Professor Chris Schedler, the figure of the wendigo represents &quot;consuming forms of exclusion and assimilation&quot; through which groups dominate other groups.&quot; This application allows Native Americans to describe colonialism and its agents as wendigos since the process of colonialism ejected natives from their land and threw the natural world out of balance. DeSanti points to the 1999 horror film &quot;Ravenous&quot; as an illustration of this argument equating &quot;the cannibal monster&quot; to &quot;American colonialism and manifest destiny&quot;. This movie features a character who articulates that expansion brings displacement and destruction as side effects, explaining that &quot;manifest destiny&quot; and &quot;western expansion&quot; will bring &quot;thousands of gold-hungry Americans... over the mountains in search of new lives... This country is seeking to be whole... Stretching out its arms... and consuming all it can. And we merely follow&quot;.

As a concept, wendigo can apply to situations other than some Native American-European relations. It can serve as a metaphor explaining any pattern of domination by which groups subjugate and dominate or violently destroy and displace. Joe Lockhard, English professor at Arizona State University, argues that wendigos are agents of &quot;social cannibalism&quot; who know &quot;no provincial or national borders; all human cultures have been visited by shape-shifting wendigos. Their visitations speak to the inseparability of human experience... National identity is irrelevant to this borderless horror.&quot; Lockhard&#x27;s ideas explain that wendigos are an expression of a dark aspect of human nature: the drive toward greed, consumption, and disregard for other life in the pursuit of self-aggrandizement.

Romantic scholar and documentarian , also a professor at Arizona State University, observes that two commonalities among the indigenous cultures of Algonquian language family speakers are that they are situated in climes where harsh winters are frequent and may be accompanied by starvation. She states that the wendigo symbolically represents three major concepts: it is the incarnation of winter, the embodiment of hunger, and the personification of selfishness.

==In popular culture==

Although distinct from how it appears in the traditional lore, one of the first appearances of a character inspired by, or named after, a wendigo in non-Indigenous literature is Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s 1910 novella &quot;The Wendigo&quot;. wrote that Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;subtly-demonizing rhetoric transforms the Wendigo from a native myth into a descriptive template for the Indian savage.&quot;

Blackwood&#x27;s work has influenced many of the subsequent portrayals in mainstream horror fiction, such as August Derleth&#x27;s &quot;The Thing that Walked on the Wind&quot; and &quot;Ithaqua&quot; (1933 and 1941), which in turn inspired the character in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, where it is a personification of evil, an ugly grinning creature with yellow-grey eyes, ears replaced by ram&#x27;s horns, white vapor coming from its nostrils, and a pointed, decaying yellow tongue. These works set the template for later portrayals in popular culture, at times even replacing the Native American lore. In an early short story by Thomas Pynchon, &quot;Mortality and Mercy in Vienna&quot; (first published in 1959), the plot centers around a character developing Wendigo syndrome and going on a killing spree.

In 1973 a character inspired by the wendigo appeared in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by the writer Steve Englehart and artist Herb Trimpe, the monster is the result of a curse that afflicts those who commit acts of cannibalism. The Marvel Comics version does not resemble a traditional wendigo as portrayed by popular culture, but rather a silver-haired Bigfoot-like being. It first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #162 (April 1973), and again in the October 1974 issue.

Contemporary Indigenous works that explore the legend include the 1995 novel , by author and poet Linda K. Hogan (Chickasaw), which explores the stories of the wendigo and incorporates the creatures as a device to interrogate issues of independence, spirituality, politics, an individual&#x27;s relationship to the family, and as a metaphor for corporate voracity, exploitation, and power - all viewed as a form of cannibalism. &quot;Wrist&quot;, the 2016 debut novel by First Nations horror fiction writer Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler (Lac Des Milles Lacs Anishinaabe), combines the traditional Ojibwe legend with the author&#x27;s ideas inspired by non-Indigenous writers like Anne Rice and Tim Powers.

Other creatures based on the legend, or named for it, appear in various films and television shows, including &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;, &quot;Ravenous&quot; (1999), &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; (2013), and the 2021 film &quot;Antlers&quot; by Scott Cooper, where the wendigo is portrayed as a deer-like creature with a glowing heart that moves from person to person with a never ending hunger. Guillermo del Toro, producer of the film, developed the wendigo on the basis that the more the creature eats, the more it gets hungry and the more it gets hungry, the weaker it becomes. In the 2021 film &quot;The Inhuman (L&#x27;Inhumain)&quot; the arrival of a wendigo symbolizes inner turmoil after a character turns his back on his Indigenous heritage in the pursuit of material success.

Various characters inspired by the legend, or named for it, appear in role-playing video games. The interactive horror video game &quot;Until Dawn&quot; (2015) features a Wendigo as a central antagonist, as the game is set primarily in a former Native American territory. In 2018&#x27;s &quot;Fallout 76&quot; by Bethesda Game Studios, wendigos are featured as one of the cryptid enemies found in the area of Appalachia, mutated from people who consumed human flesh in isolation. In the 2018 first-person shooter video game &quot;Dusk&quot;, wendigos are enemies that remain invisible until they receive damage. Several of these creatures also appear in the game&#x27;s cover art.

=== Criticism ===
Scholar Francesca Amee Johnson criticized the use of the Wendigo as an antagonist horror character in popular culture in &quot;Reinvention: an International Journal of Undergraduate Research&quot;. She noted that many popular depictions, like &quot;Until Dawn&quot; (2015), &quot;The Retreat&quot; (2020), and &quot;Supernatural&quot; (2005–2020) are created by mostly non-native writers. The use of the Wendigo as an antagonist has become a common trope, &quot;as it easily creates a villain for white protagonists to defeat repeatedly.&quot; Johnson writes, This construction is problematic in the horror genre as it presents an Indigenous antagonist that poses a threat to white culture for its otherness and indigeneity – while at the same time, misappropriating, discarding and demonising the Indigenous culture the myth comes from, at whim.

<text>Martha Bedell Alexander (born August 30, 1939) is a former Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly. She represented the state&#x27;s one hundred sixth House district that included constituents in Mecklenburg county. A homemaker from Charlotte, North Carolina, Alexander served ten terms in the NC House from 1993 to 2013. After redistricting, she lost re-election to her seat in 2012.

==Early life and education==
Alexander was born in Jacksonville, Florida. Her parents were Chester Bedell and the former Edmonia Hair. She graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in Jacksonville and from there went on to receive a B.S. in Education from Florida State University in 1961. She was a member of the school&#x27;s chapter of Alpha Delta Pi. Later, in 1979, Alexander attained her Masters of Human Development and Learning from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

==Personal life==
Alexander was married to James Frost Alexander. They have two children. An Episcopalian, Alexander is a lay deputy from North Carolina of The General Convention of the Episcopal Church. She is a trustee of the Church Pension Fund and, in 2012, sought election to the presidency of the House of Deputies.

Prior to being elected to office, Alexander was a Chaplain&#x27;s assistant at Presbyterian Hospital in Charlotte as well as the executive director of the Charlotte Council on Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency. Earlier in her career, she was also an assistant librarian at a high school in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

==Electoral history==
Alexander was first elected to the 56th district of the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1992. In 1996, she only faced Natural Law Party candidate Marguerite King in the general election. Alexander won 92.56%–7.44%. In 1998 and 2000, she faced no primary or general election opposition. After the 2002 redistricting, her seat became the 106th district, but she again faced no opposition in either the primary or general elections between 2002 and 2008.

In 2010, Alexander faced her first challenger in over a decade when Republican sales manager Michael Cavallo ran against her. She defeated Cavallo in the general election 59.50% to 40.50%.

After redistricting in 2012, Alexander&#x27;s district was made more heavily Republican and changed to become the 88th NC House district. She did not face any primary challengers, but the race was heavily targeted by conservative groups and her opponent in the general election, Republican lawyer and county party chairman Rob Bryan out-raised $287,000 to $35,000. Bryan defeated Alexander in the general election, 54.95%–45.05%.

==Legislative history==
While in office, Alexander served as chairperson of the Appropriations Committee in the state House and was vice-chair of the Mental Health Reform Committee.

==Awards and honors==
In 1993, Alexander was chosen the Woman of the Year by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;. Ten years later, in 2003, she was awarded the Mary Harriman Community Leadership Award by The Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc. Also, the American Psychological Association Practice Organization honored her with their State Legislator of the Year Award for 2009.

<doc id="451646" wikidata="Q2057809" url="?curid=451646" title="Patrick McHenry">
<text>Patrick Timothy McHenry (born October 22, 1975) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2025, which includes the communities of Hickory and Mooresville. He also chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2023 to 2025. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for one term before being elected to Congress.

McHenry served as a House Republican chief deputy whip from 2014 to 2019 and ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee from 2019 to 2023, of which he is now chair. McHenry acted as Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the House for 22 days following the removal of Kevin McCarthy via a motion to vacate.

McHenry was the dean of the North Carolina&#x27;s congressional delegation shared with fellow Representative Virginia Foxx.

==Early life, education, and career==
McHenry was born in Gastonia, North Carolina. He grew up in suburban Gastonia, the son of the owner of the Dixie Lawn Care Company, and attended Ashbrook High School. A Roman Catholic, he was the youngest of five children.

McHenry attended North Carolina State University before transferring to Belmont Abbey College. At Belmont, he founded the school&#x27;s College Republican chapter, then became chair of the North Carolina Federation of College Republicans and treasurer of the College Republican National Committee.

In 1998, while a junior in college, McHenry ran for the North Carolina House of Representatives. He won the Republican primary but lost the general election.

After earning a B.A. in history in 1999, McHenry worked for the media consulting firm DCI/New Media in Washington, D.C. He was involved in Rick Lazio&#x27;s campaign in the 2000 United States Senate election in New York; his main project was running a Web site, NotHillary.com. In 2012, he received an honorary M.B.A. in entrepreneurship from the now-closed Yorktown University.

==Early political career==
In mid-2000, Karl Rove hired McHenry to be the national coalition director for George W. Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. In late 2000 and early 2001, he was a volunteer coordinator for Bush&#x27;s inaugural committee. After working for six months in 2001 as a special assistant to Elaine Chao, the United States secretary of labor, McHenry returned to North Carolina and ran again for the North Carolina General Assembly, winning in the 2002 election.
A resident of Denver, North Carolina, McHenry represented the state&#x27;s 109th House district, including constituents in Gaston County, for the 2003–04 session. He sat on the House Appropriations Committee.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Tenure===

At age 29, McHenry was the youngest member of the 109th United States Congress; 27-year-old Aaron Schock of Illinois took office in the 111th United States Congress in January 2009. He is a deputy whip and vice chair of finance for the National Republican Congressional Committee&#x27;s executive committee. McHenry is known on Capitol Hill for his preference for bow ties.

====Baghdad video====
McHenry was the subject of discussion in April 2008, regarding a video posted on his congressional campaign website that featured him in the Green Zone in Baghdad, pointing out landmarks and destruction after missile attacks. Veterans&#x27; affairs blog &quot;VetVoice&quot; posted a scathing attack, claiming the video violated operations security. McHenry later removed the video after discussing the information with the Pentagon, which requested he not place the video back online. Lance Sigmon, McHenry&#x27;s opponent, later called a press conference to demand an investigation of the video&#x27;s effect on Green Zone troops.

====Use of PAC funds====
On April 16, 2008, &quot;Roll Call&quot; reported that McHenry used funds from his political action committee, &quot;More Conservatives&quot;, to fund the defense of former aide Michael Aaron Lay&#x27;s voter fraud charges incurred during McHenry&#x27;s 2004 race. McHenry gave Lay $20,000 to pay legal bills on charges brought while Lay worked for him. These expenses were labeled a &quot;Legal Expense Donation&quot;, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Lay agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement, which stipulated he complete 100 hours of community service and pay $240.50 in court fees and $250 in community service fees to have the charges dismissed. An employee of the 2004 campaign, Lay lived in McHenry&#x27;s home in Cherryville, which also served as the campaign headquarters during the 2004 election, and was indicted for voter fraud in McHenry&#x27;s election, allegedly voting illegally in two separate instances. In response, McHenry claimed the case was part of a &quot;three-year smear campaign&quot; by District Attorney Locke Bell, despite Bell fund-raising for McHenry in previous elections.

====Elizabeth Warren====
On May 24, 2011, Elizabeth Warren, appointed by President Obama to oversee the development of the new U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), attended a House subcommittee meeting chaired by McHenry, who invited her because he felt she had given misleading testimony during another hearing. Earlier that day, McHenry had appeared on CNBC and accused Warren of lying to Congress about her involvement in government inquiries into mortgage servicing.

The meeting had several late and last-minute changes, so Warren altered her schedule to accommodate his request. Around 2:15 p.m., McHenry called for a temporary recess to partake in a floor vote. In response, Warren indicated that McHenry&#x27;s staff had agreed to the 2:15 p.m. closing time to allow her ample time to attend another meeting. McHenry replied, &quot;You had no agreement. You&#x27;re making this up, Ms. Warren. This is not the case.&quot; As Warren and some in the audience reacted with surprise, Representative Elijah Cummings interjected, &quot;Mr. Chairman, I&#x27;m trying to be cordial here, but you just accused the lady of lying. I think you need to clear this up with your staff.&quot;

The CFPB confirmed the agreement, but McHenry refused to apologize for his remarks to Warren.

The &quot;Hickory Daily Record&quot;, the largest paper in McHenry&#x27;s district, called for McHenry to apologize, saying that it was &quot;unacceptable for any member of Congress, especially a subcommittee chairman&quot;, to treat a witness in the manner in which he treated Warren.

==== Payday lenders ====
McHenry supported a 2020 rule change by the Trump administration whereby payday lenders would no longer have to check whether prospective borrowers can afford to repay high-interest loans.

==== 2020 presidential election ====
McHenry did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who sided with the Trump campaign&#x27;s attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election. He voted to certify Arizona&#x27;s and Pennsylvania&#x27;s votes in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.

====Speaker pro tempore====
On October 3, 2023, McHenry was appointed as Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the United States House of Representatives, after a successful motion to vacate led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy from the speakership. Subsequently, he ordered that former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi vacate one of her offices in the U.S. Capitol building. On October 4, the former majority leader, Steny Hoyer, was also ordered to vacate his Capitol Hill hideaway office. McHenry served as Speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; until October 25, when Mike Johnson was elected as Speaker.

On December 5, 2023, McHenry announced that he would not seek reelection in 2024. McHenry had previously announced running for reelection for an 11th term in October following the elections for a new Speaker in the House.

==Political campaigns==

===2004===
In 2004, after one term in the North Carolina General Assembly, McHenry ran for Congress in the 10th congressional district when nine-term incumbent Cass Ballenger retired. McHenry faced a heavily contested primary and bested his closest opponent, Catawba County sheriff David Huffman, in a runoff by only 85 votes.

In the general election, McHenry won 64% of the popular vote, defeating Democrat Anne Fischer. It was generally thought McHenry&#x27;s victory in the primary runoff was tantamount to election in November: his district is considered North Carolina&#x27;s most Republican district, having sent Republicans to represent it since 1963.

===2006===

In the 2006 election, McHenry defeated Democrat Richard Carsner with almost 62% of the vote.

===2008===

In 2008, McHenry defeated Lance Sigmon in the Republican primary with 67% of the vote and faced Democrat Daniel Johnson in the general election. Johnson was considered the strongest and best-funded Democrat to run in the district in over 20 years. In part because of this, the Cook Political Report moved the race from &quot;Safe Republican&quot; to &quot;Likely Republican.&quot; This meant that in Charlie Cook&#x27;s opinion, while McHenry still had a considerable advantage, a victory by Johnson could not be ruled out. Shortly after the Cook Political Report&#x27;s update, Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, also a nonpartisan analysis of American politics and elections, addressed the race and indicated his opinion that an upset was unlikely. McHenry defeated Johnson, 58% to 42%.

===2010===

McHenry defeated Republicans Vance Patterson, Scott Keadle, and David Michael Boldon with 63.09% of the vote to win the primary. He defeated Democrat Jeff Gregory with 71.18% of the vote in the general election.

===2012===

McHenry defeated Ken Fortenberry and Don Peterson with 72.54% of the vote in the primary. He defeated Democrat Patsy Keever in the general election with 56.99% of the vote.

===2014===

McHenry defeated Richard Lynch in the primary with 78.04% of the vote. He defeated Democrat Tate MacQueen with 61.02% of the vote in the general election.

===2016===

McHenry defeated Jeff Gregory, Jeffrey Baker, and Albert Lee Wiley Jr. with 78.42% of the vote in the primary. He defeated Democrat Andy Millard with 63.14% of the vote in the general election.

===2018===

McHenry defeated a host of fellow Republicans in the primary with 70.72% of the vote. He defeated Democrat David Wilson Brown with 59.29% percent of the vote in the general election.

===2020===

McHenry defeated David Johnson and Ralf Walters in the primary with 71.67% of the vote. He defeated Democrat David Parker with 68.91% of the vote in the general election.

===2022===

McHenry defeated five opponents in the primary with 68.1% of the vote. He defeated Democrat Pam Genant with 72.6% of the vote in the general election.

== Personal life ==
McHenry has been married to Giulia Cangiano since 2010. They live in Denver, North Carolina, and have three children.

<doc id="451647" wikidata="Q1817891" url="?curid=451647" title="Beautiful Garbage">
<text>Beautiful Garbage (stylized as beautifulgarbage) is the third studio album by American rock band Garbage. It was released on October 1, 2001, by Mushroom Records worldwide, with the North American release by Interscope Records the following day. Marking a departure from the sound the band had established on their first two releases, the album was written and recorded over the course of a year, when lead singer Shirley Manson chronicled their efforts weekly online, becoming one of the first high-profile musicians to keep an Internet blog. The album expanded on the band&#x27;s musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds mixing rock with electronica, new wave, hip hop, and girl groups.

The album suffered from lack of promotion and the failure of its lead single &quot;Androgyny&quot; to achieve high chart positions. &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while topping the albums chart in Australia and peaking within the top 10 in multiple European countries, and was named one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Top 10 Albums of the Year&quot;.

A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on November 5, 2021, to mark its 20th anniversary. The triple CD set featured two bonus CDs, consisting of b-sides, alternate versions, previously unreleased recordings and remixes.

==Background==
The origins of &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; came from a three-day recording session in September 1999 during Garbage&#x27;s world tour in support of their second album, &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. The sessions resulted in &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot; and &quot;Til the Day I Die&quot;, which were written for a proposed B-sides album. Both songs were loose and organic, contrasting with the very densely layered production featured on &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot; in particular was written with an odd metric structure for a Garbage song: a 6/8 shuffle that progresses to a straight 4/4 beat.

The sale of the band&#x27;s North American independent record label Almo Sounds to Universal Music Group in early 2000 put the B-sides album on hold; Garbage decided to simply start work on recording their third album instead. Garbage began writing and recording the album at their own Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April of that year. &quot;The only vision we had was that we wanted it to sound different,&quot; recalled guitarist Duke Erikson about the influence that the two new tracks had cast, adding that the band wished to evolve the chemistry that the band had developed from touring the previous two years.

==Composition==
More diverse than their first two studio albums, musically more melodic and lyrically more direct, &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; featured electronica fused with contemporary hip hop, with influences coming from 1980s new wave to 1960s girl groups. Garbage acknowledged the broad span of sounds and styles, which included Prince, The Rolling Stones, Blondie, and Phil Spector. Regarding the melancholic lyrics, Manson stated they happened because after two years touring &quot;we were very isolated and removed from our lives&quot;, so when writing the lyrics, &quot;I felt an overwhelming sense that I need to reinvest in my &#x27;relations&#x27;&quot;.

Drummer Butch Vig stated that the album is a &quot;much simpler record than &quot;Version 2.0&quot;&quot;: &quot;All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [in Smart Studios] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only conscious decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there&#x27;re about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it&#x27;s basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing.&quot; Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. &quot;A lot of songs took shape in just a few hours as opposed to a few months with the last record...Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn&#x27;t have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. &#x27;Silence Is Golden&#x27; we recorded basically in three days and it was done. &#x27;So Like a Rose,&#x27; for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think we spent a lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [the new album]. Because that was our tendency on the other two records.&quot; On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that &quot;[Manson&#x27;s lyrics] aren&#x27;t specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, &#x27;Shut Your Mouth&#x27; is about all the bullshit that&#x27;s out there, but it&#x27;s also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she&#x27;s the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels.&quot;

Garbage decided the best way to start writing the album was to set up their recording equipment, guitars, keyboards, drum kit and a sampler and &quot;jam&quot; as a group. Their improvisation led the inspiration of a few songs such as &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;, where the band played for three hours while Manson spontaneously composed melody and lyrics, while &quot;Breaking Up the Girl&quot; came from both Erikson and Vig strumming acoustic guitars in the studio lounge. The band felt that it was foremost that the new songs worked on an emotional level with Manson&#x27;s vocals and lyrics. The initial sessions ultimately led to around 32 song ideas to develop further.

==Recording==

Smart Studios had upgraded their mixing console to a Trident A-Range model, which the band used extensively. The band tracked directly onto analogue tape using a Studer tape machine, which was then dumped into Pro Tools digital audio workstation. Overdubs and mixing were carried out in Pro Tools.

Vig kept the drums and percussion simpler than before. Percussive tracks were recorded through a 30-year-old Roger Meyer compressor to color the sound (Vig: &quot;It&#x27;s really saturated and distorted, but in a very musical way&quot;). Some tracks however were fairly scrutinized: an instrumental break in &quot;Til the Day I Die&quot; incorporated reverse tape effects. Vig was not satisfied with his &quot;swing&quot; on a 6/8 groove written for a falsetto vocal Manson had recorded on &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry These Tears&quot;, so he recruited Matt Chamberlain to play the part. The recorded sequence incorporated Chamberlain&#x27;s contribution, some of Vig&#x27;s performance and some light programming. Chamberlain also performed a &quot;chopped-up&quot; drum pattern for &quot;Cup of Coffee&quot; and a &quot;bitchin&#x27; funk groove&quot; on &quot;Confidence&quot;.

Much of the recorded guitar work was heavily processed, the band using a Line 6 Pod for melodic parts and embellishments: for example, for the middle eight of &quot;So Like a Rose&quot;, Erikson played a Les Paul with an E-bow through the Pod, while the synth-like intro to &quot;Parade&quot; was created by layering an acoustic guitar part with a clean electric guitar. A tremolo effect on &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry These Tears&quot; was inspired by 1960s production techniques. The amp modelers were used to pre-effect the recording prior to Pro Tools, in order to prevent phasing. For electric guitar recording, the band utilized cabinet miking – four microphones recorded the output of a Marshall amplifier. Acoustics were recorded using a single Blue Bottle microphone. Daniel Shulman, who had performed bass guitar on &quot;Version 2.0&quot; and the band&#x27;s two world tours, spent two separate weeks laying down bass parts. Shulman was given freedom by the band to come up with parts and be creative, creating new basslines on the verses of &quot;Androgyny&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves You&quot;. Shulman revisited &quot;Silence Is Golden&quot;, breaking up the straight eighths of the coda to make it more interesting.

Due to Manson&#x27;s growing confidence and technical skill, the band decided that her vocals did not require much treatment; &quot;Shirley was singing so much better, and she was coming up with melodies that were longer and had more range to them...there wasn&#x27;t any point in doing a lot with it. On something like &#x27;Nobody Loves You&#x27; she sings really low on the verse, almost at the bottom of her range, and then and the end she&#x27;s singing three and a half octaves higher, almost in falsetto, as the song turns into a big wall of sound&quot;, Vig remarked. Manson&#x27;s original guide vocals were used in the final mixes of several songs; the vocal on &quot;So Like a Rose&quot; was recorded on the first take. On some songs, however, Manson&#x27;s vocal was subject to Pro Tools plug-ins and post effects. &quot;Til the Day Die&quot; featured a digital &quot;scratch&quot;-effect, created by printing her vocal to DAT and using whatever edited passes sounded good. On &quot;Can&#x27;t Cry These Tears&quot;, the four vocal parts were triple-tracked using different mikes, while a guitar riff was matched to her voice for a section of &quot;Breaking Up the Girl&quot;. On &quot;Cherry Lips&quot;, her entire vocal was sped up and heavily EQ&#x27;d. On slower songs such as &quot;Drive You Home&quot;, Garbage were not overly concerned with phrasing and pitch, giving it &quot;a rawer quality&quot;. Manson improved on her guitar skills and played more guitar in the studio and live on stage for the eventual tour.

Garbage finished recording &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; at the end of April 2001, and spent a month completing the final mix (some songs had gone through as many as 40 rough mixes). Final EQ, compressing and sequencing on the album was handled by Scott Hull of Classic Sound in New York. Despite running a competition on their website to name the album, Manson&#x27;s own working title, inspired by a lyric in Hole&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, won out. Shirley explained: &quot;We took the title from &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; because when I heard Courtney singing &quot;beautiful garbage&quot;, it&#x27;s like a great dichotomy and we nicked it. Yes, she knows, and we have her blessing&quot;. The album artwork came from Garbage&#x27;s wish for it to be &quot;something organic&quot;; The band came up with the fractured rose idea, thinking that it worked well with the album title. Garbage contracted London-based designers Me Company to create the visuals. The artwork for &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; cost $75,000.

==Release==
Preceding the worldwide release, on September 27, 2001, &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; was released early in Japan through Sony Music, featuring two exclusive bonus tracks: &quot;Begging Bone&quot;, the B-side of &quot;Androgyny&quot;, and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, their &quot;James Bond&quot; theme from the film of the same name. In Australia and New Zealand, the album was released by their label FMR.

On October 1, 2001, &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; was released worldwide, with the North American release the following day. Mushroom Records issued the album on five formats within the United Kingdom: a standard edition CD, a limited edition specially packaged CD (in a fold-out rose shaped holder and plastic slipcase), double LP, cassette and MiniDisc. Mushroom licensed the album to PIAS Recordings for release in Western Europe and through their distributor Playground Music in Scandinavia; PIAS pressed their own standard CD, &quot;rose-pack&quot; CD and double LP formats for the continent. In the United States, Almo Sounds and Interscope Records released &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; on CD, double LP and cassette. Interscope&#x27;s parent company Universal Music Group released the album in Canada.

The CD formats of &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; contained an enhanced element which users could access and remix four tracks from the album: &quot;Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;Androgyny&quot;, &quot;Breaking Up the Girl&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot;. Created in conjunction with Sonic Foundry, using a customized version of their drag-and-drop ACID Pro music sequencer software, the remixes utilized samples and loops taken directly from the album masters. programmed and designed by design company DDW. The enhanced section could be accessed when the user was online; a simplified version of the software featuring only &quot;Androgyny&quot; loops was accessible when the user was offline.

Interscope Records and Sonic Foundry launched a competition in November 2001, in which fans were invited to remix &quot;Androgyny&quot; by downloading free &quot;ACID Xpress&quot; software. Entrants could then upload their work to a specially created website (www.acidgarbage.com) to stream their mixes online. The winner received copies of Sonic Foundry&#x27;s audio software – ACID Pro, Sound Forge, and Vegas Audio – and five loop libraries.

==Tour==
Garbage marked the release of &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; by performing an in-store set in Chicago&#x27;s Virgin Megastore on October 2, 2001. Garbage began touring the album as the opening act on the third leg of U2&#x27;s Elevation Tour from October 12 in Notre Dame, Indiana, into Canada and through to October 24 in New York City. Before last show, Vig collapsed from the effects of food poisoning and contracting hepatitis A. Rather than cancelling the scheduled shows, Garbage recruited Matt Chamberlain to replace Vig for the remainder of the year. Garbage performed a series of underplayed headlining shows in Europe during November, beginning in Trondheim, Norway and ending in London, England, on November 14. Garbage then returned to North America for the final Elevation Tour Southern State shows, from Kansas City, Missouri, on November 27 through to the last show in Miami on December 2. At the last show, U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr. played drums on &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;. Garbage wrapped up 2001 by performing at the Not So Silent Night radio festival in Los Angeles.

The Beautiful Garbage tour started in earnest in January 2002 in New Zealand and Australia, when Garbage joined the Big Day Out festival. In between the festival shows, Garbage headlined two concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. Garbage then spent 10 days in Japan, performing four headline shows in Osaka and Tokyo.

Garbage launched a headline UK tour on April 1, 2002, in Portsmouth, a run that included an acoustic performance in Edinburgh and headlining MTV&#x27;s &quot;5 Night Stand&quot;. The band were supported on the UK dates by Kelli Ali. Beyond the UK, the run extended to a number of shows in Cologne, Amsterdam and Bourges. On April 19, Garbage returned to play a six-week itinerary of North American dates. Beginning in Toronto, the tour was routed down the Eastern Coast of America, over to the Midwest and then onto the West Coast. The jaunt ended with two night stint in Los Angeles. Garbage were supported by Abandoned Pools and on some shows, by White Stripes; during the tour, Vig was taken ill (later diagnosed as Bell&#x27;s Palsy) and was replaced again by Matt Chamberlain. Garbage wrapped the North American tour dates on June 6 in Mexico City.

A month-long European trek began June 10 in Madrid, covering major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Matt Walker stood in for Vig for the rest of the summer. Garbage performed two shows in Nice and Lyon supporting Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a further two headlining French shows in Lille and Paris with Mercury Rev as support. The European leg ended at Espárrago Rock in Spain on July 12. Throughout the run, Manson was dogged by vocal problems, leading to the cancellation of a few festival appearances. After a six-week break, Garbage returned to the United Kingdom to perform their last European shows of the year – two intimate club gigs in London.

With Vig rejoining the ranks following his recovery period, Garbage headed to Australia to perform at the four date M-One festival across the country at the beginning of October. They then joined No Doubt, who were promoting their &quot;Rock Steady&quot; album, to co-headline a trek around the United States; support came from The Distillers. Kicking off on October 15 in West Kingston, Rhode Island, the tour was routed down the Eastern Seaboard, and into Southern States before heading to the Pacific Northwest region and onto the American Southwest. The tour ended on November 27 in Long Beach, California. Garbage went on to perform one further show, in Hell, Grand Cayman.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69, based on 17 reviews. Both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s US and Australian editions named &quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; as one of their critics &quot;Top 10 Albums of the Year&quot;.

Tom Laskin of &quot;Isthmus&quot; wrote that the significant &quot;sonic tweaking and abundant sampling&quot; of &quot;Version 2.0&quot; is discarded as the songs are supported primarily by &quot;bass, drum, and guitar configurations&quot;. Observing a musical theme, it is &quot;the band&#x27;s abandonment of digitally manipulated perfection in favor of rawer guitars and more immediate vocal performances.&quot; He added that, overall, the album is &quot;far less commercially accommodating than any of the band&#x27;s previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that&#x27;s characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days.&quot; Peter Robinson of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the album was a &quot;departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records&quot;; It is &quot;marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds that mix rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups.&quot; &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; described the band&#x27;s approach to recording guitars as &quot;distinctive&quot;, observing the &quot;distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable.&quot; Michael Paoletta of &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that audiences expecting &quot;more of the same [&quot;Version 2.0&quot;] are in for a wonderful surprise.&quot; The band eschews &quot;disco-infused electronica foundations for more straight-up rock&#x27;n&#x27;pop&quot;. &quot;Modern tales for modern times, sung by the vocally versatile Manson, make for one of the year&#x27;s best.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; described it as &quot;sharp, seductive music from a band at their peak.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; called it &quot;their most accomplished and convincing album yet.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented that Garbage&#x27;s penchant for absorbing elements from various genres, skillfully crafting them together is more evident in this album, in how they &quot;approximate contemporary R&amp;B with the sultry &#x27;Androgyny&#x27;, or the Minneapolis new wave bubblegum funk of &#x27;Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!),&#x27; or the bluesy PJ Harvey strut of &#x27;Silence Is Golden.&#x27;&quot; This penchant is enhanced by an &quot;unabashedly pop coating, an element that Garbage clearly revel in, as well as should the listener.&quot; He described it &quot;every bit as enticingly postmodern as their other albums, and it sounds distinctly Garbage&quot; and although the fusion elements are perceptible, &quot;they seem less like magpies, more themselves, which means Beautiful Garbage is a more consistent record.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; observed Manson&#x27;s continued &quot;aggressive bite&quot; complemented by &quot;throbbing tracks like &#x27;Till the Day I Die&#x27; and &#x27;Shut Your Mouth&#x27;&quot;, as well as exposing &quot;tender aspects&quot; in &quot;heartfelt&quot; and &quot;subdued&quot; songs like &#x27;Cup of Coffee&#x27; and &#x27;So Like a Rose&#x27;. He noted however that the band&#x27;s &quot;experiments with sonic expansion yield more mixed results&quot;; &quot;They thaw their sound by adding elements of trip-hop, which works for &#x27;Cup of Coffee&#x27; and the first single, &#x27;Androgyny&#x27;...But on a record that&#x27;s more self-consciously varied than 1998&#x27;s &quot;Version 2.0&quot; other attempts are gimmicky and less successful. &quot;Still, there&#x27;s just enough to salvage from &quot;beautifulgarbage&quot;.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Beautiful Garbage&quot; debuted at number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 73,000 copies.

<doc id="451649" wikidata="Q7804002" url="?curid=451649" title="Tim Moore (North Carolina politician)">
<text>Timothy Keith Moore (born October 2, 1970) is an American attorney and politician who has been the U.S. representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 14th congressional district since 2025. He previously served as speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 2015 to 2025. A Republican, Moore represented the 111th State House District, which includes Cleveland County. Moore was first elected to the state House in 2002.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born on October 2, 1970, in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, in the western part of the state. He attended Kings Mountain High School, and as a teenager, Moore worked at the state General Assembly as a page, later interning for a state senator.

Moore first attended Campbell College, where he joined the College Republicans. After two years he transferred to University of North Carolina, where he completed a B.A. in 1992. He was active in the student government at both colleges. He took a fight to the UNC student Supreme Court in an effort to add more members to the Student Congress. In 1995, Moore graduated with a from the Oklahoma City University School of Law.

==Legal and business career==
In 1995, Moore joined a law firm in the Cleveland County town of Shelby. He opened his own law practice in Kings Mountain in 2009, representing business and individual clients.

In 2015, Moore was hired by the Cleveland County Commission as an attorney for the county, serving in this role simultaneously with his position as speaker of the state House.

Moore co-owns 67 Motors, a Forsyth County metal recycling business.

==Early political career==
When Moore was 26, he was elected chair of the Cleveland County Republican Party in 1997. That same year, he was also appointed to the UNC Board of Governors; he was the youngest person to be appointed to that position.

==North Carolina House of Representatives==
Moore was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 2002, after defeating the incumbent House Majority Whip, Democratic Representative Andy Dedmon. A staunch conservative Republican, Moore spent his first four terms in office in the minority party, as Democrats then controlled the House. In 2010, the Republicans won control of the House, and Speaker Thom Tillis appointed Moore to the powerful post of chairman of the Rules Committee, where he became known for abruptly cutting off many floor debates.

As part of the Republican leadership team in the House, Moore helped pass &quot;sweeping legislation to lower taxes on business, tighten rules on abortion and voting, and decline to extend Medicaid coverage to 500,000 uninsured North Carolinians.&quot; Moore opposes same-sex marriage, supported a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in 2012, and joined legal efforts to defend the ban. However, in 2017, when a group of the state House&#x27;s most conservative Republicans proposed legislation that would declare &quot;null and void&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015) (which held that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage), Moore blocked the bill from advancing in the state House.

In 2014 Moore was one of the state House&#x27;s biggest campaign fundraisers. His skill at fundraising for the Republican Party contributed to his election as speaker of the North Carolina House in 2015.

Moore and State Senator Harry Brown were the top two North Carolina lawmakers to gain substantial earmarked funding for their districts in the 2015 state budget, securing a collective total of $19 million. Moore defended his use of earmarks for projects in his district.

===Speaker of the House===

Moore was a sponsor in 2016 of House Bill 2, a controversial &quot;bathroom bill&quot; barring transgender individuals from using bathrooms that conform to their gender identity. After the U.S. Department of Justice said that the legislation violated federal anti-discrimination law and demanded that the state cease implementation, Moore rejected the DOJ&#x27;s position and accused the Obama administration of &quot;bullying&quot;, saying, &quot;The deadline will come and go. We will take no action.&quot;

Moore has opposed curbs on gerrymandering in North Carolina. In a legal suit against partisan gerrymandering in the state, Moore and his state Senate counterpart (Republican Phil Berger) urged the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court&#x27;s ruling that the partisan gerrymandering of North Carolina&#x27;s congressional districts was unconstitutional.

In 2018, Moore won a third term as speaker of the House.

In 2018, following a mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Moore established a North Carolina House Select Committee on School Safety. Moore rejected Democratic proposals to discuss changes to gun laws, and the committee never took up gun control proposals. Moore instead proposed the use of volunteer officers to guard schools.

In 2019, a controversy took place after emails came to light, showing that in 2016, a high-ranking aide to Moore had corresponded with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) about a Siler City chicken processing plant co-owned by Moore that was being offered for sale. At the aide&#x27;s request, DEQ approved the plant&#x27;s participation in a state subsidy program that provided $22,000 for the repair of a leaking underground storage tank at the factory, which may have aided in the sale of the plant. The revelation prompted the Campaign for Accountability to file a complaint with the North Carolina State Ethics Commission. Moore denied knowledge of the emails. A previous complaint against Moore regarding the Siler City chicken plant was dismissed in 2018. The North Carolina State Board of Elections and Ethics reviewed the complaint and information resulting from the staff&#x27;s investigation. The investigating panel from the State Elections and Ethics Board unanimously voted to dismiss the complaint upon conclusion of their inquiry.

In 2019, Democratic Governor Roy Cooper vetoed the state budget. On the morning of September 11, 2019, during a calendared legislative session Moore called a vote to override the veto of the state budget. The override passed on a vote of 55–9. Nearly half of members were absent during the vote, most of the absent members were Democrats. Democrats in the state House were greatly angered by the Republicans&#x27; move, saying that Moore and other House Republican leaders had made assurances that no votes would be called during the morning session. Moore defended the vote and said that he had made no pledges that no vote would take place.

In 2021, a new 14th congressional district was created that included Moore&#x27;s home of Cleveland County. While Moore was expected to run for the seat, he said he would not after Madison Cawthorn announced his candidacy. Moore said he would run for another House term.

== U.S. Congressional Campaign ==
Tim Moore announced his Candidacy for Congress in late 2023 to represent the newly-drawn NC-14. Tim Moore won his race against Democrat Pam Genant, becoming Representative-Elect for NC-14. Moore was sworn in on January 3rd, 2025.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==
Tim Moore was sworn in on January 3, 2025. Moore succeeded Jeff Jackson, who did not seek reelection and instead ran successfully for North Carolina Attorney General after the redrawing made his district significantly more Republican leaning. 

In January 2025, President Donald Trump appointed Moore to serve on a board investigating FEMA&#x27;s disaster response following Hurricane Helene. 

==Controversies==
While a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Moore directed state funding toward projects in his home county of Cleveland. In 2016, Cleveland County received a $1.5 million grant-funded water and sewer upgrades for an area where several individuals with close connections to Moore&#x27;s campaign resided. In 2018, the county received $500,000 in the state budget to host the American Legion Baseball World Series, which it had hosted since 2011 with no state funds.

In 2012, Moore&#x27;s private law practice in Kings Mountain received a $62,000 development grant, during a year which was noted for steep state budget cuts. Moore was advised by a member of the state&#x27;s ethics commission to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest after this.

In 2015, an article written by a local journalist prompted an FBI inquiry into Moore&#x27;s campaign reports. The FBI declined to comment on the inquiry, and there were never any charges filed regarding the allegations of wrongdoing.

In 2019, Moore&#x27;s legislative aides engaged with the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in regards to a property Moore owned. Moore and his business partners sold that property to Mountaire Farms, an Arkansas-based poultry conglomerate that is a donor to North Carolina Republicans, for a 650% profit. 

In 2022, Holly Grange, a former state representative and member of the UNC-Wilmington Board of Trustees, alleged that she was removed from the board because Moore was upset she did not support his preferred candidate for the next Chancellor of UNC-Wilmington. 

In June 2023, a suit was brought by Scott Lassiter, a Wake Soil and Water Conservation District and former Apex Town Council member, alleging that Moore had enticed Lassiter&#x27;s wife into an affair. Moore said the lawsuit was baseless. The suit was resolved in July 2023.

==Personal life==
Moore has two sons. He is a member of First Baptist Church of Kings Mountain, which is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention.

<text>Rebecca Ann &quot;Becky&quot; Carney (born December 25, 1944) is a Democratic member of the North Carolina House of Representatives representing the 102nd district since 2003. Her district includes constituents in Mecklenburg county. Carney is a homemaker from Charlotte, North Carolina.

In 2002, Carney defeated Libertarian Daniel Elmaleh in the general election. She had previously been elected in 1996 to the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners and served three terms, serving as vice chairman several times. Carney had an unsuccessful run for school board in 1995.

During a late night House session on July 2, 2012, Carney mistakenly cast the deciding vote to override Governor Bev Perdue&#x27;s veto of Senate Bill 820, granting authority to make hydraulic fracturing legal in North Carolina. A longstanding House rule that disallows changing of a vote if the vote changes the outcome of the bill prevented Carney from correcting her electronic vote to reflect her intended position.

<doc id="451655" wikidata="Q6776263" url="?curid=451655" title="Martin Nesbitt (politician)">
<text>Martin Luther Nesbitt Jr. (September 25, 1946 – March 6, 2014) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate. He represented the 49th district (Buncombe County). An attorney from Asheville, North Carolina, Nesbitt was elected to eleven terms in the state House before moving to the state senate in 2004.

==Political career==
Nesbitt was first appointed to the House in 1979 to fill out the remainder of the term of his mother, Mary Cordell Nesbitt, who held the House seat until her death. Groomed by one of North Carolina&#x27;s most famous and influential politicians, Liston Ramsey, Nesbitt rose to become an appropriations chairman and top budget writer in the 1990s. Former Speaker of the House Jim Black (who was later incarcerated) found disfavor with Nesbitt after Nesbitt challenged his power in the early 2000s.

In February 2004, Martin Nesbitt was appointed to the North Carolina Senate by Governor Mike Easley to fill the vacant seat left by the resignation of Steve Metcalf. 
After moving to the Senate, Nesbitt rose to become chairman of the powerful Judiciary I Civil Committee.

Nesbitt was unanimously elected majority leader on November 17, 2009, replacing Tony Rand. Prior to his election, he received an endorsement from Senate President Pro Tempore Marc Basnight, a powerful nod in North Carolina politics. After Democrats lost their Senate majority in the 2010 elections, Nesbitt was unanimously elected minority leader for the next legislature. He stepped down as minority leader in 2014 for health reasons, and was succeeded by Sen. Daniel T. Blue Jr. Within two days of resigning from the leadership, Nesbitt died.

===Committees===
Nesbitt was in several senate committees:
*Appropriations/Base Budget
*Commerce
*Finance
*Judiciary I
*Mental Health &amp; Youth Services
*Redistricting
*Rules and Operations of the Senate
*State and Local Government

==Education and personal life==
Nesbitt earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1970 and his law degree from UNC in 1973. He was married with two grown children and two grandchildren at the time of his death.

He died on March 6, 2014, one week after being diagnosed with stomach cancer. He was 67.

<text>Carolyn King Justus (born September 15, 1945) is an American politician, a former Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly.

Justus graduated from Brevard High School and studied at Gaston Memorial Hospital School of Nursing.

She represented North Carolina&#x27;s 117th House district, including constituents in Henderson and Transylvania counties, from late 2002 until 2010, when she declined to run for a fifth term and was succeeded by Chuck McGrady. She is the widow of Larry T. Justus, and served as his clerk during his nine terms in the seat; after he died shortly before the 2002 legislative elections, his name was not removed from the ballot and he received a majority of votes cast, so the local Republican party appointed Carolyn Justus to the empty seat for the new term.

Since retiring from the Assembly, she has served as chair of the Henderson County Heritage Museum.

<text>Marc Basnight (May 13, 1947 – December 28, 2020) was an American politician who served as a Democratic member of the North Carolina State Senate, representing the 1st district, from 1984 through his resignation just before the start of what would have been his 14th term in 2011. His district included constituents in Beaufort, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, Pasquotank, Tyrrell, and Washington counties.

==Career==
A small business owner, Basnight held the position of President &quot;pro tempore&quot; from 1993 until Democrats lost their Senate majority in the November 2010 elections. In December 2006, Senate Democrats officially backed him for a record eighth term in that post, and in January 2009, Senate Democrats and two Republicans backed him for a ninth term. Such bipartisan support is rare when electing presiding officers in the North Carolina legislature. In the wake of the 2010 elections, Basnight said he would not seek any leadership post in the minority Democratic caucus when the legislature reconvened in January 2011. Then, he announced he would resign just before the opening of the new legislature, due to health issues. In an Associated Press interview February 13, 2012, asked if he had Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease (ALS), Basnight said, &quot;I may have it, may not.&quot; Benjamin Brooks of Carolinas Medical Center said Basnight had progressive bulbar palsy and that, while someone could die from the condition, it was also possible to live a long time. Brooks said medication was slowing the disease&#x27;s progress, and that it was uncertain whether Basnight had ALS.

On March 7, 2019, the North Carolina State Board of Transportation voted to name the 2.8-mile Oregon Inlet bridge opened three days earlier for Basnight.

==Personal life and business==
Basnight was born in Manteo, North Carolina, and graduated from Manteo High School in 1966. He married the late Sandy Tillett on March 23, 1968; they parented two children together, Caroline and Vicki. Basnight chaired the Dare County tourist bureau from 1974 to 1976, and was a member of the North Carolina Board of Transportation from 1977 to 1983. Though Basnight never attended college, he received an honorary bachelor&#x27;s degree from East Carolina University in 1996. Basnight was a member of the Masons.

Basnight owned a restaurant, the Lone Cedar Cafe, between Manteo and Nags Head on the Outer Banks. It burned to the ground May 1, 2007, in what was determined to be a fire caused by arson. It has since been rebuilt.

Basnight died on December 28, 2020. He was 73 years old.

<text>Thomas Roger West (born November 1, 1948) is a former Republican member of the North Carolina House of Representatives representing the state&#x27;s 120th district, including constituents in Cherokee, Clay, Graham and Macon counties. A contractor from Marble, North Carolina, West served 8.5 term in the state House.

== Possum drop law ==
Representative West represented Brasstown, North Carolina, which held an annual &quot;Possum Drop&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which involved capturing a wild opossum, enclosing it in a clear plastic box, suspending it high in the air, and lowering it to the ground with the countdown to midnight. During the suspension and lowering, fireworks are set off, muskets are fired, crowds of people scream, and loud music is played. The possum is later released. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals filed a lawsuit in October 2013 attempting to outlaw the practice, claiming it makes it likely that the possum will die from stress-related ailments within days or weeks.

West was the sponsor of a law in the North Carolina House that exempts opossums from state wildlife laws from Dec. 26, 2014 to Jan. 2, 2015 in Clay County, where the drop is held. West jokingly noted when asked by another committee member that the marsupial community was in support of the bill. Its consideration was met with some joking by committee members and passed easily.

<text>Patrick J. Ballantine (born March 17, 1965) is an American attorney and politician who was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly, rising to become the Senate Minority Leader and the Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for governor in 2004.

== Early life and education ==
Ballantine was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and moved to North Carolina as a child. He graduated from Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington in 1983 and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1987. Ballantine earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Dayton in 1990.

== Career ==
In 1994, Ballantine became a member of the North Carolina Senate; starting in 1999, he served as the Republican minority leader. He originally represented the state&#x27;s fourth Senate district, focused on New Hanover County, where he resides in Wilmington. In the redistricting that followed the 2000 census, his district became the ninth.

Ballantine emerged as one of the leading candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election, although he faced heated competition for the nomination from former Charlotte mayor Richard Vinroot and former Congressman Bill Cobey. In July, both Ballantine and Vinroot received 30% of the vote in a six-way Republican primary, with Ballantine edging out Vinroot by only 1,500 votes statewide. Under North Carolina law, Vinroot could have chosen to seek a runoff; however, he elected not to exercise that option, leaving Ballantine the Republican nominee.

Ballantine stepped down from his General Assembly seat in April in order to focus on his run for governor. His law partner Woody White was appointed to fill his Senate seat, but was defeated in the general election by Democrat Julia Boseman.

Ballantine&#x27;s campaign focused on his youth, optimism, and vision, offering what he referred to as &quot;A New Generation of Conservative Leadership&quot; for North Carolina; however, Easley&#x27;s campaign focused on Ballatine&#x27;s Senate voting record. Ballantine was bested by Easley, the incumbent, by a thirteen-point margin in the November 2004 general election.

== Personal life ==
He married Lisa Beard on August 10, 1991. They have two children.

<doc id="451674" wikidata="Q7273527" url="?curid=451674" title="R. C. Soles Jr.">
<text>Robert Charles Soles Jr. (December 17, 1934 – February 5, 2021) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate, representing the 8th district from 1977 to 2011. His district included Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties. From 1969 to 1976, Soles served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. Republican Bill Rabon now holds the seat that Soles held for over three decades; it had not been held by a Republican since 1869.

Soles was the chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.

==Biography==
He was the son of Robert C. (Rob) Soles, a local hardware store owner. He attended the Tabor City school system before leaving briefly to attend university. 
Soles was a lifelong bachelor with a close endearing friendship to his lifelong law partner, William(Bill) W. Phipps. They built adjacent houses in a private neighborhood on Lake Tabor.

==Career==
Soles graduated with a B.A. from Wake Forest University and received his J.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He was a practicing attorney at Soles, Phipps, Ray, and Prince Law Firm in Tabor City, North Carolina. Sherry Dew Prince broke ties with Soles when she pursued an elected position as a District Judge and she opened a solo practice in Whiteville, North Carolina. In 2006, the N.C. Bar Association inducted him into the General Practice Hall of Fame. At one point, the North Carolina Center for Public Policy Research named him the 8th most effective member of the legislature.

Soles was the founding president of the Southeastern Community College Foundation, a former member of the Governor&#x27;s Crime Commission, and former board member of the Columbus County Community Foundation and Opera Company of North Carolina.

==1980s criminal investigations==
Soles was indicted in 1983 for conspiracy, vote buying, perjury, and aiding and abetting bribery. A judge dismissed three of the charges and Soles was acquitted of aiding and abetting Columbus County Commissioner Edward Walton Williamson in obtaining payoffs from undercover FBI agents.

==Allegations and Assault conviction==
In 2009 allegations from several men were published, claiming that Soles sexually abused them when they were minors. In another incident, he allegedly pepper sprayed a young man. Soles has denied having sexual relations with any of the young men. In an August, 2009 incident, he shot a young man and former legal client in the leg while he was allegedly trying to kick in Soles&#x27; front door. Soles&#x27; lawyer, Joseph Cheshire, said the shooting was self-defense. Cheshire and Soles both stated that Soles has been generous to former clients in hoping to ease them back to a law-abiding life.

On December 30, 2009, Soles (at the time, the longest-serving legislator in the state) announced he would not seek re-election in 2010.

On 7 January 2010, Soles was indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. Soles pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was fined $1,000.

The allegations resurfaced in June 2011, with three men having publicly accused Soles of sexual abuse.

<text>Fred Smith (born March 27, 1942) is a North Carolina politician who served in the North Carolina Senate and ran for Governor of North Carolina in 2008.

==Early life and education==
Smith was raised in Raleigh, North Carolina. His father was a teacher and coach at an orphanage, and his mother was a homemaker. While attending Raleigh&#x27;s Needham B. Broughton High School, Smith earned a football scholarship to attend Wake Forest University. Subsequently, he attended Wake Forest University School of Law, where he graduated with honors in 1966.

Smith is married to Virginia Reid Smith, is father to five children, and is grandfather to seven children. The Smith family is active in the First Baptist Church of Clayton, where he has been a Sunday school teacher.

==Military and business career==
Smith served as a captain in the U.S. Army JAG Corps for four years after law school. In the years that followed, Smith became a lawyer and homebuilder. Smith&#x27;s businesses employ more than 600 people in Wake and Johnston counties. The largest of those companies is paving company CC Mangum, of which he is the CEO. Smith also created the Fred Smith Company, which builds homes and constructs golf courses and athletic clubs. Smith touts himself as a CEO, not a politician, who deals with &quot;straight talk and a clear vision.&quot;

==Political career==
Smith was elected in 2000 as a Johnston County commissioner. In 2002, he was elected to the first of 3 terms in the state Senate, representing the Johnston and Wayne counties.

Smith argued for a critical east–west transportation corridor. He was a primary sponsor of North Carolina Amendment 1, an amendment to the Constitution of North Carolina which would define marriage as between one man and one woman.

Smith was heavily criticized by the Democratic Party, including criticisms from then-state party chairman Jerry Meek, as being an absentee Senator, because Smith missed over 300 votes in 2007, which was over a quarter of all possible voting opportunities.

In 2007, Smith became a candidate for Governor. The office was coming open as a result of the departure of term-limited incumbent, Mike Easley. During his gubernatorial campaign, Smith physically visited all 100 North Carolina counties in nine months and 18 days, holding a barbecue dinner in each county. Barbecue dinners, known as the &quot;Fred Smith for Governor BBQ Statewide Tour&quot;, started in Haywood County on Thursday, August 2, 2007, and ended on Tuesday, March 18, 2008, in Pasquotank County.

Smith lost the 2008 Republican primary to Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory. Official primary election results show Smith won 66 counties but out of a total of 504,973 votes, Smith lost the popular vote to Pat McCrory by 45,975 votes.

On May 6, 2008, Smith endorsed Pat McCrory, saying, &quot;I have pledged my full support to Pat McCrory to do whatever is in my power to help elect a Republican governor in November to change the culture in Raleigh and fix our broken government.&quot; McCrory was not elected in 2008, but was elected in 2012. After taking office in 2013, McCrory appointed Smith to the North Carolina Economic Development Board.

<text>David Franklin Weinstein (born June 17, 1936) was a politician in North Carolina. He served as Democratic member of the General Assembly who represented the state&#x27;s thirteenth Senate district, including Hoke and Robeson counties.

==Early life==
He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Career==
He worked as a merchant from Lumberton, North Carolina. After retiring he served as Mayor of Lumberton, NC from 1988–1992. Weinstein joined the Board of Trustees for University of North Carolina at Pembroke in 1992 and served two years as chairman. He served until his election to the General Assembly in 1997.

He served in the Senate from 1997 through 2009, when Governor Beverly Perdue appointed him to head the Governor&#x27;s Highway Safety Program. He was replaced in the Senate by Michael P. Walters.

During his 13 years as a senator, Weinstein guided some $92 million to UNC Pembroke for building projects, including $29 million for the Health Sciences Building. In May 2018, the building was named the David F. Weinstein Health Sciences Building. Senator Weinstein was instrumental in a 6.9 million special appropriation to build the first new residence hall at the university in 25 years. From a successful $2 billion bond referendum, he carved out $57 million for the university.

Weinstein was instrumental in changing the name of the university, which helped boost enrollment. At the naming ceremony, Weinstein stated that the building was his greatest accomplishment as legislator. &quot;I continue to believe that UNCP is the jewel in the crown of southeastern North Carolina,&quot; he said. UNCP Chancellor Robin Gary Cummings stated that &quot;Senator Weinstein has been a monumental game changer for this university. David Weinstein recognized the need for trained health care and professionals in the region. When he went to Raleigh, he went to work for us,&quot; Cummings said, &quot;the result is this building which is the largest construction project in university history.&quot;

<doc id="451687" wikidata="Q891302" url="?curid=451687" title="Ski lift">
<text>A ski lift is a mechanism for transporting skiers up a hill. Ski lifts are typically a paid service at ski resorts. The first ski lift was built in 1908 by German Robert Winterhalder in Schollach/Eisenbach, Hochschwarzwald.

== Types ==

* Aerial lifts transport skiers while suspended off the ground. Aerial lifts are often bicable ropeways, the &quot;bi-&quot; prefix meaning that the cables have two different functions (carrying and pulling).
**Aerial tramways
** Chairlifts and detachable chairlifts
** Funifors
** Funitels
** Gondola lifts
** Hybrid lifts
* Surface lifts, including T-bars, magic carpets, and rope tows.
* Cable railways, including funiculars
* Helicopters are used for heliskiing and snowcats for snowcat skiing. This is backcountry skiing or boarding accessed by a snowcat or helicopter instead of a lift, or by hiking. Cat skiing is less than half the cost of heliskiing, more expensive than a lift ticket but is easier than ski touring. Cat skiing is guided. Skiing at select, extreme resorts, like Silverton Mountain, is also guided, even when skiing just off the lift.

==Locations==
Ski lifts are built in many parts of the world. 
Extreme locations of outdoor ski lifts:
* The northernmost is near Tromsø, Norway
* The southernmost is near Ushuaia, Argentina
* The closest to the equator in the northern hemisphere is near Liang, China
* The closest to the equator in the southern hemisphere is near Mahlasela, Lesotho

<text>Jeanne Hopkins Lucas (December 25, 1935 - March 9, 2007) was the first African-American woman elected to serve in North Carolina&#x27;s state Senate.

Lucas was born in Durham, North Carolina to Robert Hopkins and Bertha Holman Hopkins. She attended East End Elementary School, Whitted Junior High School, and Hillside High School, where she graduated in 1953. She completed a Bachelor of Arts in Foreign Languages at North Carolina Central University, where she was a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Lucas returned to Hillside to teach French and Spanish between 1957 and 1975. From 1975 to 1976 she served as President of the North Carolina Association of Classroom Teachers. She gained her Master of Arts in School Administration from NCCU in 1977, and until 1993 worked in administrative positions for Durham Public Schools.

In 1993, Lucas was appointed to the state&#x27;s twentieth Senatorial district to complete the term of former Senator Ralph Hunt, and was subsequently re-elected six times. Lucas, known as &quot;Queen Jeanne&quot; by some of her fellow Senators, served on various Senate committees including in a number of leadership positions such as Majority Whip and Senior Chair of the Appropriations on Education/Higher Education Committee, Cochair of the Education/Higher Education Committee, and Vice-Chair of Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources Committee.

She was a member and Trustee of Mount Gilead Baptist Church, and was active in a variety of other civic groups in Durham including the local branch of the NAACP.

In 2003, she was diagnosed with a breast cancer tumor and underwent vigorous treatment to remove it. On her death the son of late civil rights leader Floyd McKissick, Floyd McKissick, Jr., was appointed to fill the remainder of her term in the North Carolina Senate.

<doc id="451693" wikidata="Q1325732" url="?curid=451693" title="Eleanor Kinnaird">
<text>Eleanor Gates &#x27;Ellie&#x27; Kinnaird (born November 14, 1931) is a North Carolina politician who served as a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s 23rd Senate district from January 1997 until her resignation in 2013. Her district included constituents in Orange and Chatham counties.

==Career==
Kinnaird was mayor of Carrboro, North Carolina from 1987 to 1996; during that time, she also earned a law degree from North Carolina Central University (1992) and entered private practice. In 1996, she ran for and was elected to the North Carolina State Senate.

At one point, Kinnaird served as Chair of the Appropriations Committee on Justice and Public Safety, as Chair of the Mental Health and Youth Services committee and as Vice-Chair of the Agriculture/Environment/Natural Resources committee. In addition to these leadership positions and her other standing committee assignments on Appropriations/Base Budget, Finance, Health Care and Judiciary I (Civil), she was also a member of the NC Energy Policy Council and the Environmental Review Commission.

Senator Kinnaird is an advocate for electoral reform and lobby reform. For example, in 2005 she sponsored a bill to require that voting machine source code and election results in North Carolina can be audited; the bill passed the Senate 48-0 and was signed into law in August 2005.

Senator Kinnaird is also an advocate for environmental protection. She received a 100% rating from the Conservation Council of North Carolina.

A vocal opponent of the death penalty, in 2003 Senator Kinnaird sponsored a bill to initiate a moratorium on the death penalty in North Carolina; the bill passed the Senate 28-22, making the North Carolina Senate the first legislative body in the U.S. South to support a halt to executions.

===Elections===
In 2007, Kinnaird announced that she was contemplating whether or not to run in the next election, noting that she would like a woman to replace her in the Senate. She said that due to recent retirements and a dearth of female Senators, the Senate could be left with only three women if she retired, while there were seven women serving as Senators when she first took office.

As of October 2007 only three men (Moses Carey, John Herrera, and Mike Nelson) had announced their intentions to run for the Senate seat possibly being vacated by Kinnaird. Kinnaird announced she would seek re-election in 2008. Both Herrera and Nelson dropped out of the race after Kinnaird&#x27;s announcement. Carey, however, stayed in and lost to Kinnaird by 64% to 36%.

Kinnaird won re-election in 2010 and in 2012.

In 1995, Webster became a North Carolina state senator after defeating George Daniel, an eight-year incumbent Democrat. He was the first Republican from Caswell County since John W. Stephens in 1868 to be elected to the state senate. (Stephens&#x27; assassination in 1870 provoked the Kirk–Holden War). Webster served six terms as a state senator until he narrowly lost his re-election bid by 460 votes to Democrat Tony Foriest on November 7, 2006.

During his 12 years in the North Carolina General Assembly, Webster served on various committees, including finance and appropriations, environment and natural resources, and agriculture. He worked on several bills affecting state taxes.

Webster notably sponsored a bill called &quot;The Baby Greer Act,&quot; which would have allowed prosecutors to charge those accused of murdering pregnant women with double homicide. A similar bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act or Ethen&#x27;s Law was later passed by the state legislature in 2011.

In 2008, Webster challenged U.S. Rep. Brad Miller to represent North Carolina&#x27;s 13th congressional district. His campaign issues included immigration, reducing federal spending, and protecting constitutional rights such as free speech and gun ownership. He was defeated by Miller, with the incumbent receiving nearly 66 percent of the district vote.

In November 2008, Webster was indicted on a felony embezzlement charge. He was acquitted by a jury in 2009.

In 2011, Webster was appointed register of deeds for Alamance County, North Carolina and was re-elected twice until stepping down in 2021.

Webster had two children with his wife Patricia: LeGrand and Noel. In 2021, he and his wife separated. Webster was a resident of Burlington, North Carolina.

<doc id="451696" wikidata="Q7183483" url="?curid=451696" title="Phil Berger (politician)">
<text>Philip Edward Berger (born August 8, 1952) is a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s thirtieth Senate district, which includes Caswell, Rockingham, Stokes, and Surry counties.

Born in New York, Berger was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2000. He became minority leader in 2004, and in 2010, he was selected by his fellow Republicans as their choice for the next Senate President Pro Tem. Berger was officially elected president Pro Tem when the legislature opened on January 26, 2011.

== Early life and education ==
Berger was born in New Rochelle, New York. He graduated from George Washington High School in Danville, Virginia, in 1970 and studied briefly at Danville Community College. Berger earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from Averett College in 1980 and a J.D. degree from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1982, after which he entered law practice.

== North Carolina Senate ==
Berger was first elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2000. He was Senate Minority Leader from 2005 to 2011. In 2011, he became Senate President pro tempore.

=== Voting rights ===
In 2016, Berger supported voter ID legislation. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals deemed the laws to &quot;target African Americans with almost surgical precision in an opinion written by Diana Motz, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. Berger criticized the ruling as a &quot;decision by three partisan Democrats.&quot; Democratic Presidents appointed the three judges working on the case; however, only two have been directly associated with the Democratic party.

In 2017, the Supreme Court chose not to take up the case, allowing the lower court&#x27;s decision to stand.

In 2018, a referendum for a Constitutional amendment was approved by a majority of voters. Berger voted to pass legislation that would enroll the amendment later in the year during a lame-duck session.

In 2019, a North Carolina judge offered an opinion that the General Assembly was illegally constituted and unable to make law. However, the Governor enrolled the amendment, which remains a portion of the Constitution. Further court proceedings are underway.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Berger led Republican opposition to North Carolina Board of Elections recommendations to make voting by mail easier.

=== Stripping powers from incoming Democratic administration ===
After the 2024 elections when Democratic candidates won the races for Governor and Attorney General and Republicans lost their supermajority in the North Carolina legislature, North Carolina Republicans in the legislature passed a sweeping bill to strip the state’s incoming Democratic governor and attorney general of key powers. The bill also gave the power to appoint members to the state&#x27;s election board to the state auditor, a position won by a Republican candidate. Governor Roy Cooper criticized the bill as a &quot;power grab&quot;. Berger, however, defended the bill, saying it is &quot;all within the rules that we have&quot;. 

== Personal life ==
He is married to Patricia Hays; they have three children, Philip Jr., Kevin, and Ashley, as well as four grandchildren.

<doc id="451697" wikidata="Q261003" url="?curid=451697" title="Kay Hagan">
<text>Janet Kay Hagan (née Ruthven; May 26, 1953 – October 28, 2019) was an American lawyer, banking executive, and politician who served as a United States Senator from North Carolina from 2009 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served in the North Carolina Senate from 1999 to 2009. By defeating Republican Elizabeth Dole in the 2008 election, she became the first woman to defeat an incumbent woman in a U.S. Senate election. She ran for reelection in 2014 but lost to Republican Thom Tillis, Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, in a close race.

As of 2025, she was the last Democrat to represent North Carolina in the U.S Senate.

==Early life and education==
Hagan was born Janet Kay Ruthven in Shelby, North Carolina, the daughter of Jeanette (née Chiles), a homemaker, and Josie Perry &quot;Joe&quot; Ruthven, a tire salesman. Her uncle (mother&#x27;s brother) was the Lakeland native and U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), who later became Florida Governor following his service in the U.S. Senate. Both Hagan&#x27;s father and her brother served in the U.S. Navy. She spent most of her childhood in Lakeland, Florida, and graduated from Lakeland Senior High School in 1971.

Leaving the tire business, her father branched out into real estate development, primarily focused on industrial warehouses and warehouse-centered business parks in the Lakeland and Polk County, Florida area. Her father later became mayor of Lakeland.

Hagan also spent summers on her grandparents&#x27; farm in Chesterfield, South Carolina, where she helped string tobacco and harvest watermelons. In the 1970s, she was an intern at the Capitol, operating an elevator that carried senators, including her uncle Lawton, to and from the Chamber.

She earned a B.A. degree from Florida State University in 1975 and a J.D. degree from the Wake Forest University School of Law in 1978, later pursuing a career as both an attorney and banker. While a student at Florida State, Hagan became a member of the Chi Omega sorority, though she later resigned her membership.

Prior to beginning her political career, Hagan worked in the financial industry. During this time she became a vice president of North Carolina&#x27;s largest bank, NCNB (North Carolina National Bank), which is now a part of Bank of America. Hagan became a county campaign manager for Governor Jim Hunt&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign.

==North Carolina legislature==
Hagan was first elected to the North Carolina General Assembly as state Senator for the 32nd district in 1998 (due to redistricting, her constituency later became the 27th district). During the 1998 campaign, her uncle Lawton Chiles walked the district with her. For five terms, she represented Guilford County, including Greensboro.

==U.S. Senate==

===2008 election===

After Hagan first decided not to run against Elizabeth Dole, the Swing State Project announced on October 26, 2007, that two independent sources had reported that Hagan would, in fact, run. Hagan made her candidacy official on October 30, 2007. She defeated investment banker Jim Neal of Chapel Hill, podiatrist Howard Staley of Chatham County, Lexington truck driver Duskin Lassiter, and Lumberton attorney Marcus Williams in the May 2008 Democratic primary.
She was recruited to the race only after more prominent North Carolina Democrats such as Governor Mike Easley, former Governor Jim Hunt and Congressman Brad Miller all declined to compete against Dole. However, most polling from September onward showed Hagan slightly ahead of Dole, although Hagan had previously fallen behind by as many as 17 points at one point. Hagan was helped by Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama&#x27;s aggressive push for North Carolina&#x27;s 15 electoral votes and by 527 groups lobbying on her behalf. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee expended more money in North Carolina than in any other state during the 2008 election season.
In late October, the Dole campaign released a television ad that stated the leader of the Godless Americans PAC had held &quot;a secret fundraiser in Kay Hagan&#x27;s honor.&quot; The ad showed sound bites of group members espousing their views, then stated Kay Hagan &quot;hid from cameras, took Godless money... what did Hagan promise in return?&quot; It ended with a photo of Hagan and a female voice saying, &quot;There is no God.&quot; The ad aired across North Carolina.
Hagan, a member of First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro and a former Sunday school teacher, condemned the ad as &quot;fabricated and pathetic,&quot; and filed a lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court accusing Dole of defamation and libel. The ad was roundly criticized in local and several national media outlets, including by CNN&#x27;s Campbell Brown, who said about the ad: &quot;[A]mid all the attack ads on the airwaves competing to out-ugly one another, we think we&#x27;ve found a winner.&quot; Following Hagan&#x27;s victory, the lawsuit was dropped.

In the November election, Hagan won with 53% of the vote to Dole&#x27;s 44%. The &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that campaign ads on both sides were negative. Hagan&#x27;s victory was partially attributed to anger over the &quot;Godless&quot; ad. Her victory returned the seat that had once been held by Jesse Helms to the Democrats. Helms had won the seat in 1972, and was succeeded by Dole in 2003.

===2014 election===

Hagan ran for re-election in 2014. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; considered her seat shaky. The &quot;Fiscal Times&quot; reported that Hagan benefitted from a presidential election, with its higher voter turnout, in 2008 and that without one in 2014 the race appeared to be a toss-up. Hagan declined to attend ceremonies for President Barack Obama&#x27;s January 2014 visit to North Carolina, deciding instead to remain in Washington for Senate votes. Pundits questioned whether Hagan was attempting to distance herself from the President, whose popularity in North Carolina had waned significantly after he won narrowly the state in his 2008 presidential bid.

Hagan had been the target of numerous negative ads paid for by Americans for Prosperity, which had spent over $7 million on the race by the end of March 2014. As part of a $3 million offensive effort against those efforts in early 2014, the Senate Majority PAC released ads supporting Hagan. In July 2014, Hagan had the largest cash-on-hand advantage of any vulnerable Democratic senator. She was endorsed by Vice President Joe Biden. In September 2014, Bill Clinton announced plans to campaign for Hagan. Hagan faced Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis and Libertarian Sean Haugh in the general election on Tuesday, November 4. Hagan declined to participate in a scheduled October 21 debate. She was a speaker at the state AFL–CIO convention. After a close race, Kay Hagan lost her bid for re-election by roughly 45,000 votes, or by 1.5%.

===2016 U.S. Senate race===

Hagan was called on by national Democrats to launch another Senate bid. In an interview in Boston, Hagan said she was seriously considering it. She was said to be the strongest potential challenger against incumbent senator Richard Burr. On June 24, 2015, Hagan announced on Facebook that she would not run for the Senate in 2016.

===Committee assignments===

==Political positions==

===Economic issues===
On February 13, 2009, Hagan voted to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

In December 2010, Hagan voted against a bill extending both the Bush tax cuts and unemployment benefits. The bill passed the Senate 81–19, with opposition from both conservatives and progressives.

On March 23, 2013, Hagan was one of only four Democratic Senators to vote against the Senate&#x27;s first approved budget in four years.

In May 2013, Hagan voted in favor of the Marketplace Fairness Act, which requires online stores to collect state sales tax in the same fashion as brick-and-mortar stores.

===Outdoor Recreation===
On May 20, 2014, Hagan introduced the Bipartisan Sportsmen&#x27;s Act of 2014 (S. 2363; 113th Congress), a bill related to hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation in the United States, aimed at improving &quot;the public&#x27;s ability to enjoy the outdoors.&quot;

===Gun rights===
On April 17, 2013, Hagan voted to expand background checks for gun purchasers. She also voted not to reinstate the Feinstein ban on &quot;assault weapons&quot;, nor to ban &quot;large capacity ammunition feeding devices&quot;.

===Healthcare===
In December 2009, Hagan voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and she later voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

On September 27, 2013, Hagan voted to restore funding for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as part of an amendment to legislation funding government operations for 45 days, and which also omitted House-passed language prioritizing debt payments if Congress fails to increase the nation&#x27;s borrowing limits.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Dana Milbank argued at the time that Hagan was destabilizing her own Senate political career due to her difficulty communicating the reasons for her support of Obamacare to her own constituents.

In 2009, Hagan voted for the Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009, a successful $32.8 billion measure which funded increased health coverage for children while raising the cigarette tax by 62 cents a pack. Hagan opposed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was signed into law in 2009.

===Immigration===
On December 18, 2010, Hagan was one of only five Democrats to vote against the DREAM Act. The bill failed in the Senate.

In June 2013, Hagan voted against an amendment to require the completion of 350 miles of fence described in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 before registered provisional immigrant status may be granted. It would also require 700 miles of fence be completed before the status of registered provisional immigrants may be changed to permanent resident status.

===Privacy issues===
Hagan co-sponsored PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), a proposed law with the stated goal of giving the US government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to &quot;rogue websites dedicated to the sale of infringing or counterfeit goods&quot;, especially those registered outside the U.S. In the wake of online protests, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tabled the bill in January 2012.

===Abortion===
Hagan supported abortion rights for women
and voted against a congressional plan to defund Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood quotes Hagan as saying &quot;I am a strong supporter of a woman&#x27;s right to choose ... I would like to see abortions be safe, legal, and rare. These decisions are best made privately by a woman in consultation with her doctor.&quot; Hagan also voted against a congressional plan to defund Planned Parenthood, who according to the &quot;News Observer&quot; plans to spend 3.3 million dollars on her reelection campaign. Hagan was endorsed by EMILY&#x27;s List, an organization dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women to office. Hagan opposed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 weeks. In August 2014, a protest occurred outside her offices in support of the bill.

===LGBT rights===
On December 18, 2010, Hagan voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

Hagan opposed North Carolina&#x27;s Amendment 1, a measure that defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman in North Carolina&#x27;s Constitution. On March 27, 2013, Hagan announced her support of same-sex marriage.

==Lobbying career==
In January 2016, Hagan joined the lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, Washington D.C.&#x27;s largest lobbying group by revenue.

==Personal life and death==

Hagan&#x27;s widower, Charles Tilden &quot;Chip&quot; Hagan III, is a transaction lawyer. The Hagans had three children: Jeanette, Tilden, and Carrie. Kay Hagan had a 2012 net worth of approximately $24 million.

After the end of her U.S. Senate term, Hagan became a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics.

While in Washington, D.C., in December 2016, Hagan became ill with a type of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and was admitted to a hospital. The inflammation was due to Powassan virus, which Hagan&#x27;s husband thought she received from a tick while hiking in 2016. In June 2019, Hagan&#x27;s husband reported that &quot;Kay&#x27;s ability to speak is limited, but her comprehension is very good. She can speak, but it&#x27;s slow and labored.&quot;

Hagan died on October 28, 2019, from complications of Powassan virus, at the age of 66. Her stepmother also died that day, shortly before her. Hagan&#x27;s funeral was held on November 3, 2019, at the First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro. Among those in attendance at Hagan&#x27;s funeral were former Democratic Senate colleagues Claire McCaskill, Amy Klobuchar, Mary Landrieu, and Blanche Lincoln, fellow North Carolina Senator and Republican Richard Burr, and incumbent North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper.

Following her death, John Edwards became the only surviving former Democratic senator from North Carolina.

<text>Katie Grays Dorsett (July 8, 1932 – July 6, 2020) was a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s twenty-eighth Senate district from 2003 to 2010. Her district included constituents in Guilford County, North Carolina. In the 2009–10 session, Dorsett served as the Majority Whip in the Senate.

==Education and career==
Dorsett was born in Shaw, Mississippi. She attended local public schools up to the eighth grade and then a private boarding school. Dorsett attended Alcorn State University for her undergraduate work and then earned her master&#x27;s from Indiana University Bloomington. After attending several schools in pursuit of her doctorate, she eventually finished at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1975. Dorsett taught business at North Carolina State A&amp;T University in Greensboro, North Carolina, from 1955 until 1987.

==Political career==
After retiring from A&amp;T after 32 years of service, she served two terms on the Greensboro City Council from 1983 to 1986, the first African American woman ever elected. She then served as a Democratic Guilford County Commissioner starting in 1990. Dorsett represented District 9 until 1992, when she was appointed Secretary of the Department of Administration by North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt. This position made her the first African American woman to hold a North Carolina Cabinet post. She was elected to the state Senate in 2002.

Just before filing ended in 2010, she announced that she would not seek re-election. She was inducted into the North Carolina Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2010. She died on July 6, 2020, two days before her 88th birthday.

<text>Fern H. Shubert (born August 30, 1947) is a former Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s thirty-fifth Senate district, including constituents in Mecklenburg and Union counties. An accountant from Marshville, North Carolina, Shubert served in the State House from 1994 to 1998 and again from 2000 to 2002. She served in the State Senate from 2002 to 2004, where she was the Republican whip.

Before it folded, she wrote a column in the &quot;County Edge&quot;, a weekly publication in Union County, and still weighs in on local political issues including a fight against a half-cent prepared food and beverage tax that would have helped build a civic center in Monroe.

Shubert was one of the candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election. The sole woman in a field of six contenders for the GOP nomination, Shubert campaigned as an outsider to the party establishment, but placed fifth in the primary, gathering only 4% of votes cast.

Shubert ran to return to her old Senate seat in 2010. She lost the Republican primary on May 4 to Tommy Tucker. In 2012, Shubert filed to run for North Carolina State Auditor.

On March 11, 2019, Shubert filed to run in the Republican primary to select a candidate for the 9th Congressional district 2019 special election, ordered by the North Carolina State Board of Elections after the Board declined to certify the race&#x27;s November 6, 2018 outcome due to allegations of election fraud.

Hartsell faced no primary challenger and went on to defeat Democrat Mike Helms in the general election.

===2007 Complaint===
An ethics complaint was filed against Hartsell with the North Carolina Senate Ethics Committee alleging conflict-of-interest based on his past legal representation of a developer and the Water and Sewer Authority of Cabarrus County. The complaint was dismissed by the North Carolina State Ethics Committee due to lack of probable cause.

This complaint was filed after a small group of residents in the Western part of Cabarrus County failed to get the appropriate legislative support for their incorporation efforts.

In its February 2008 report dismissing the matter, the Ethics Commission found &quot;serious problems&quot; with the charges in the complaints and concluded after an investigation that included input from various parties that allegations in the complaint were &quot;without any legitimate factual or legal basis and thus lack merit&quot; 

===2013 Campaign finance audit===
In January 2013, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; reported that Hartsell spent nearly $100,000 of his campaign&#x27;s money in 2011 and 2012 paying off debts on at least 10 personal credit cards. In an interview with the newspaper, Hartsell could not promise that campaign contribution money did not cover some personal expenses, which would be prohibited under state law. In a subsequent interview with his local paper, &quot;Independent Tribune&quot;, Hartsell stated that he was working to rectify the reporting errors by hiring a professional treasurer. &quot;I&#x27;ve come to the realization that I have tried to do too much by handling the accounting side of my campaign finance reporting&quot;, Hartsell said in the January 15, 2013, article.

==Conviction==
In 2017, Hartsell pleaded guilty to three felony counts in Federal court. Hartsell misused more than $200,000 in campaign funds by spending campaign donations on dinners with his family, haircuts, shoe repairs, speeding tickets, and part of his driver&#x27;s license renewal fee. Hartsell was sentenced to eight months in prison.

Hartsell was also convicted of State charges related to filing fraudulent campaign finance reports on three separate occasions. He was sentenced to serve 18 months of unsupervised probation.

==Personal life==
He has been married to Tana Honeycutt Hartsell since 1972. They have 3 children and 7 grandchildren. His son, F. Lee Hartsell III practices medicine in the Duke University Healthcare System as a neurologist.

<text>Robert Anthony Rucho (born December 8, 1948), a dentist from Matthews, North Carolina, is a former Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s thirty-ninth Senate district, including parts of Mecklenburg County.

==Career==
Rucho served as co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee until his abrupt resignation in June 2013 in a dispute with Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger over tax reform policy. Berger never accepted the resignation and the next month, Rucho resumed his chairmanship.

===Views on the Affordable Care Act===
Rucho gained much criticism, including from within his own party, after he tweeted &quot;Justice Robert&#x27;s pen &amp; Obamacare has done more damage to the USA then [sic] the swords of the Nazis, Soviets &amp; terrorists combined&quot; on December 15, 2013.

===&quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;===
Rucho notably was named as the defendant in the 2019 Supreme Court case &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;, which involved redistricting and partisan gerrymandering. Though Rucho had already departed the state legislature by the time the case made its way up to the Supreme Court, he had previously been the chair of the committee in the state senate responsible for redrawing North Carolina&#x27;s congressional districts, which drew a map heavily favoring Republicans under his leadership.

<doc id="451711" wikidata="Q3956848" url="?curid=451711" title="Robert Pittenger">
<text>Robert Miller Pittenger (; born August 15, 1948) is a businessman and American politician who was the U.S. representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district from 2013 to 2019. The district included several outer portions of Charlotte as well as many of that city&#x27;s southern and eastern suburbs. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Pittenger was born in Texas and attended the University of Texas. After graduating he worked for Campus Crusade for Christ before moving to Charlotte in 1985 and becoming a real estate investor.

==North Carolina Senate (2003–2007)==

===Elections===
After redistricting, Pittenger decided to run for the 40th senate district of the North Carolina General Assembly in 2002. He defeated Democratic State Senator Fountain Odom 55%–43%. In 2004 he ran for the 39th senate district and defeated Libertarian nominee Andy Grum 89%–11%. In 2006, he won reelection to a third term unopposed.

===Tenure===
Pittenger represented the state&#x27;s 39th Senate district, which included portions of southeastern Mecklenburg County. He was a lead sponsor of Right To Life legislation and supported the North Carolina marriage amendment, although he was not in office when the amendment passed out of committee and was finally voted on by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011.

In May 2004, he proposed cutting the state&#x27;s corporate tax from 6.9% to 4.9% and the income tax rate for the state&#x27;s top earners from 8.25% to 7.5%. He also proposed over $1.5 billion in spending cuts, with a focus on reducing Medicaid access for persons above the age of Medicare eligibility. 
In February 2005, he proposed a medical malpractice bill that would cap non-economic damages at $250,000 for physicians, hospitals, and long-term care facilities.

===Committee assignments===
* Appropriations/Base Budget
* Commerce
* Finance
* Insurance and Civil Justice Reform
* Pensions &amp; Retirement and Aging
* Rules and Operation

==2008 lieutenant gubernatorial bid==

Pittenger defeated three other candidates in the Republican primary on May 6, 2008, becoming his party&#x27;s nominee for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina with 59% of the vote. On May 27, 2008, he resigned from the Senate to focus on his campaign. He lost the general election to fellow State Senator, Democrat Walter H. Dalton, 51%–46%.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2019)==
===Elections===
;2012

After Sue Myrick announced her retirement as the Representative of North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district in early 2012, Pittenger announced that he would run to replace her. He failed to win the primary outright on May 8, 2012, but finished first with 32% of the vote in the 11-candidate field. In the primary runoff election held on July 17, he defeated former Mecklenburg County Sheriff Jim Pendergraph, 53%–47%.

Pittenger won the general election on November 6, defeating Democratic Mecklenburg County Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Roberts, 52%–47%. He lost the district&#x27;s share of Mecklenburg County (47%), but ran up huge margins in the Union (63%) and Iredell (64%) portions of the district. It was the closest a Republican had come to losing the district since 1986. He took office in January 2013.

On December 2, 2013, Pittenger introduced the Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013, which became . The law broadens the coverage of current laws that address domestic assaults by certain repeat offenders. It also requires the United States Department of Justice to write a report on child abuse prevention laws in all U.S. states and territories, &quot;with a particular focus on penalties for cases of severe child abuse.&quot;

;2014

Pittenger considered running for the U.S. Senate but instead ran for reelection to the House. In the Republican primary, he defeated Michael Steinberg, a candidate for the seat in 2012. No Democrat filed to run for the seat, making this district the only one in the state not contested by both major parties in 2014. There was an unsuccessful write-in campaign for candidate Shawn Eckles of Iredell County.

;2016

The 9th was significantly redrawn after a federal court threw out the previous map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. It was pushed well to the east, stretching from southeast Charlotte all the way to Fayetteville and the Sandhills.

Baptist pastor Mark Harris challenged Pittenger in the 2016 Republican congressional primary, losing that contest by 134 votes. Pittenger defeated Christian Cano in the general election.

;2018

Pittenger faced Mark Harris in a rematch of the 2016 Republican primary. On May 8, 2018, Harris defeated Pittenger with 48.5 percent of the vote to Pittenger&#x27;s 46.2 percent, although allegations were later raised about illegal activities by the Harris campaign. Pittenger was the first congressional incumbent to lose his primary election in 2018; the second was Mark Sanford.

Harris was the apparent winner in the November 2018 general election, but the result was not certified due to credible allegations of electoral fraud and he was never seated in Congress. As a result, a new special election was called. Pittenger (and also Harris) declined to run in the special election.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
** Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade
* Republican Study Committee

===Caucus memberships===
* United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus
*U.S.-Japan Caucus

==Political positions==

The American Conservative Union gave him a lifetime Congressional evaluation of 90%.

=== Environment ===
Pittenger rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2006, he sent a book called &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;, published in 1998, to his colleagues in the North Carolina Senate.

=== Health care ===
Pittenger supported the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), which would repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. On May 2, 2017, Pittenger defended a provision of AHCA that allowed states to end requirements that insurers cannot discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions. Pittenger said that Americans who have or develop pre-existing conditions &quot;should just move&quot; to a state without the waiver.

===National defense===
Pittenger voted for the two-year budget plan that became law on February 9, 2018, citing the lack of options to increase military spending to provide for required training and maintenance.

==Controversies==
===Conflict of interest===
Pittenger has been accused of using his position as a state senator to benefit himself in a series of land deals.

===Racist remarks===
On September 22, 2016, in the wake of protests over the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, Pittenger said that the violence in Charlotte stemmed from protesters who &quot;hate white people because white people are successful and they&#x27;re not.&quot; The remark drew immediate international condemnation as racist. Fellow North Carolina congressman G. K. Butterfield called the remark &quot;devastatingly ignorant and divisive.&quot; Pittenger apologized, saying that his &quot;intent was to discuss the lack of economic mobility for African Americans because of failed policies.&quot;

==Electoral history==






















==Personal life==
Pittenger lives in South Charlotte. He is married to Suzanne Pittenger. He has four children.

<text>James Summers Forrester (January 8, 1937 – October 31, 2011) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s forty-first senate district, including constituents in the Iredell, Gaston and Lincoln counties. A physician from Stanley, North Carolina, Forrester died while serving his eleventh term in the state senate, in which he also served as Deputy President Pro Tempore.

==Personal life==
Forrester was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the son of Jim Forrester, a professional golfer. His father died in 1938 when his son was 18 months old. Forrester graduated from New Hanover High School in 1954. Forrester earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in science from Wake Forest University in 1958 and his medical degree from the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in 1962 and a Master&#x27;s in Public Health from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1978. On March 12, 1960, he married Mary Frances All; together they had four children. Forrester also served in the North Carolina Air National Guard, and participated in the Vietnam War as a flight physician. Forrester also ran a private practice for family medicine in Gaston County, North Carolina. Forrester died on October 31, 2011, at age of 74.

==Political career==
Forrester was elected as Gaston County commissioner in 1982. In 1990, he was elected into the North Carolina State Senate.

He gained notoriety when he became the chief sponsor of Senate Bill 514 which would amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages in North Carolina in 2011. He had introduced this amendment at every session since 2004. After the Republicans won control of the General Assembly, Forrester&#x27;s amendment eventually passed both houses. The proposed amendment to the constitution will appear on the state&#x27;s 2012 primary ballot.

Forrester came under fire for allegedly misrepresenting his medical credentials. He claimed to be a member of the American Medical Association, a fellow of the American College of Preventive Medicine and an associate fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association. The ACPM revealed that Forrester was not a member of the ACPM, let alone a fellow. Later that day, Laura Leslie of WRAL-TV in Raleigh learned that Forrester was not an associate fellow of the Aerospace Medical Association either. The next day, Leslie reported that Forrester was not a member of the American Medical Association. Senator Forrester&#x27;s response to this was, &quot;If there&#x27;s anything falsified on my records it was inadvertently done.&quot; He added, &quot;The gay and lesbian community is looking for anything they can to discredit me.&quot;

<text>David W. Hoyle (February 4, 1939 – March 29, 2023) was an American politician from North Carolina. He was a Democratic member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s forty-third Senate district from 1993 to 2010, and the state&#x27;s secretary of revenue from 2010 to 2013. A real estate developer from Dallas, North Carolina, he served as the mayor of the town and was a graduate of Lenoir–Rhyne College.

Hoyle announced in 2009 that he would retire at the end of the 2009–10 session of the legislature, in what was his ninth term in the state Senate. Shortly before the expiration of his term in 2010, Gov. Beverly Perdue appointed him Secretary of Revenue, a Cabinet post. He served until Perdue left office in 2013.

Hoyle and his wife, Linda, had four children. He died at his home in Dallas, North Carolina, on March 29, 2023, at the age of 84, from complications of a stroke he had several years prior.

<text>Virginia Ann Foxx ( Palmieri; born June 29, 1943) is an American educator, businesswoman, and politician serving as the U.S. representative from since 2005. A member of the Republican Party, Foxx has served as chair of the House Rules Committee since 2025 and is the only woman leading a committee in the 119th Congress. She also served as Secretary of the House Republican Conference from 2013 to 2017. She was the ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor from 2019 to 2023 and served as the committee&#x27;s chair from 2017 to 2019 and from 2023 to 2025. Foxx&#x27;s district encompasses much of the northwestern portion of the state, including most of the city of Greensboro. Since January 2025, Foxx has been the dean of North Carolina&#x27;s congressional delegation.

==Early life and career==
Foxx was born in the Bronx borough of New York City, to Dollie (née Garrison) and Nunzio John Palmieri. She was raised in a rural area of Avery County, North Carolina. Foxx grew up in a poor family and didn&#x27;t live in a home with running water and electricity until age 14.

While attending Crossnore High School in Crossnore, North Carolina, Foxx worked as a janitor at the school and was the first in her family to graduate from high school. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1968 and later earned both a Master of Arts in college teaching (1972) and an Ed.D (1985) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Foxx and her husband owned and operated a nursery and landscaping business.

Foxx worked as a research assistant and then an English instructor at Caldwell Community College &amp; Technical Institute and Appalachian State University before moving into university administration. From 1987 until her 1994 entry into politics, she was president of Mayland Community College. Under North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, Foxx served as Deputy Secretary for Management. From 1994 to 2004, she served in the North Carolina Senate.

==United States House of Representatives==

===Political campaigns===

Foxx was first elected to the U.S. House in 2004, defeating Jim Harrell, Jr. with 59% of the vote.

Foxx was briefly targeted in the 2006 elections, but the Democrats&#x27; top choice, Winston-Salem mayor Allen Joines, decided not to run. Joines later said he lacked the stomach for the kind of race he felt it would take to defeat Foxx. Her 2006 opponent was Roger Sharpe, whom she defeated.

Roy Carter of Ashe County was Foxx&#x27;s opponent in the 2008 election; she won by a substantial margin.

In 2010, Foxx was reelected with about 65% of the vote.

In 2014, Foxx was reelected with about 60% of the vote, defeating software developer Josh Brannon.

In 2016, Foxx was reelected with about 59% of the vote, again over Brannon.

In 2018, Foxx was reelected with 57% of the vote, defeating DD Adams, a council member for the North Ward of Winston-Salem.

In the 2020 general election, Foxx won over 66% of the vote, defeating Democrat David Brown.

In 2022, Foxx sought re-election in the redrawn 5th congressional district, which favored Republicans. Foxx was endorsed by former President Donald Trump in 2021. She defeated Democrat Kyle Parrish, 63.2–36.8%.

===Tenure===
====Hurricane Katrina====
In September 2005, Foxx was one of 11 members of Congress to vote against the $51 billion aid package to victims of Hurricane Katrina.

====Opposition to birthright citizenship====
In January 2013, Foxx co-sponsored legislation that would stop children born in the United States to undocumented parents from gaining citizenship.

====First Trump impeachment====

On December 18, 2019, Foxx voted against both articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress) of President Donald Trump.

====House security====

In May 2021, Foxx became the fifth Republican representative to be fined for evading metal detectors put in place outside the chamber after the January 2021 storming of the Capitol. Foxx ran through the magnetometer, setting it off, and ignored officers attempting to prevent her entering the House floor.

====Behavior with the news media====

Foxx has been known for frequently scolding reporters and staff for being on or near members-only elevators in Capitol buildings. In October 2023 while among Republicans gathered for a press conference for then-House speaker nominee Mike Johnson, she was scrutinized for telling a reporter to &quot;go away&quot; and &quot;shut up&quot; when he was asked to speak about his efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

===Committee assignments===
* House Rules Committee (Chair)
* Committee on Education and Labor
* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

===Caucus memberships===
* Republican Study Committee
* Congressional Constitution Caucus
* Congressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans
* United States–China Working Group

==Political positions==
===Abortion===
Foxx opposes legal access to abortion. She voted for a bill to repeal a rule requiring state and local governments to distribute federal funds to qualified health centers, even if they perform abortions. In 2014 Foxx was asked whether there were any conditions under which she considered abortion acceptable. She replied that, even in the case of rape, incest, or the health of the mother, no exception should be made to justify abortion.

===Economy===
In a 2007 interview, Foxx said, &quot;We have the best economy we have had in 50 years.&quot;

Foxx, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

===Health care===
An opponent of the Affordable Care Act, she has said, &quot;we have more to fear from the potential of the Affordable Health Care for America Act passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country.&quot; When commenting on the House version of the reform bill that funds counseling for end-of-life issues, Foxx said, &quot;Republicans have a better solution that won&#x27;t put the government in charge of people&#x27;s health care&quot; and &quot;[The plan] is pro-life because it will not put seniors in a position of being put to death by their government.&quot;

===LGBT rights===
In April 2009, Foxx expressed opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, claiming that Matthew Shepard&#x27;s murder was not a hate crime. While debating the act in the House, she called the murder a &quot;very unfortunate incident&quot; but claimed &quot;we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn&#x27;t because he was gay.&quot; She ultimately called that allegation &quot;a hoax that continues to be used as an excuse for passing hate crimes bills&quot;. Some media outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, criticized her statements, as did Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Democratic sources claimed that Matthew Shepard&#x27;s mother was present during Foxx&#x27;s statements.

Foxx later retracted her comments, suggesting her use of the word &quot;hoax&quot; was in bad taste. She suggested that Shepard&#x27;s murder was a tragedy and that his killers had received appropriate justice.

In 2010, Foxx voted against the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act.

In 2015, Foxx condemned the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, which held that same-sex marriage bans violated the constitution.

In 2019, Foxx strongly opposed the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and urged Congress members to vote against it.

In December 2022, Foxx voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, which codified same-sex and interracial marriage rights into federal law.

===Privacy rights===
She introduced the &#x27;Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act&#x27; (H.R. 1313; 115th Congress) in 2017. The bill would eliminate the genetic privacy protections of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–233); allow companies to require employees to undergo genetic testing or risk paying a penalty of thousands of dollars; and let employers see that genetic and other health information.

===&quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;===
In December 2020, Foxx was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump.

===2021 Electoral College vote certification===
On January 6, 2021, Foxx was one of 147 Republican lawmakers who objected to the certification of electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election.

=== Marijuana ===
In December 2020, Foxx voted against the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE). According to financial disclosure reports, she has made at least six investments in Altria, one of the world&#x27;s largest tobacco companies and a leader in the burgeoning U.S. cannabis industry, since September 2020. In all, records show she has purchased somewhere between $79,000 and $210,000 in Altria stock.

==Personal life==
Foxx is Catholic. Her former son-in-law, Mustafa Özdemir, is a Turkish businessman.

<text>Walter H. Dalton (born May 21, 1949) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 33rd Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, he served six terms in the state senate before his election to the office of lieutenant governor in 2008.

Dalton was the Democratic nominee for Governor of North Carolina in 2012. He lost the general election to former Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory.

In 2013, he was named president of Isothermal Community College located in Rutherford County, North Carolina. He served as the college&#x27;s president until his retirement in 2021.

==Early life, education, and law career==
Dalton was born in Rutherfordton, Rutherford County, North Carolina to Charles Dalton, a former state senator, and Amanda Dalton, a schoolteacher. He earned a B.S. in Business Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1971, and earned a J.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law in 1975.

Dalton worked in the Audit Department of Union Trust Company between 1971 and 1972. He clerked for Woodrow W. Jones, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, between 1975 and 1977. He worked for many years as an attorney based in Rutherfordton, North Carolina. He joined the law firm of Hamrick, Bowen, Nanney &amp; Dalton, LLP in 1977 and left in 2000.

==North Carolina Senate (1997–2009)==
===Elections===
Dalton represented constituents in Cleveland and Rutherford counties in the North Carolina General Assembly. His district was originally the 37th Senate district, but it was renumbered as the 46th in the redistricting following the 2000 United States Census.

Dalton&#x27;s legislative career began in 1996 when he challenged freshman incumbent Republican state senator Dennis Davis. The general election was close, with Dalton being declared the winner by a margin of 50.38%–49.62%, after a recount. Davis tried to win back the seat in 1998, but Dalton won by a larger margin, 54.86%–45.14%. In 2000, he defeated Scott Neisler, 55%–45%. In 2002, he defeated Republican nominee John Weatherly, 52%–45%. In 2004, he defeated Republican nominee Jim Testa, 53%–47%. In 2006, he defeated Republican nominee Wes Westmoreland, 54%–46%.

===Tenure===
In the State Senate, Dalton served as co-chair of the Senate Education Committee and co-chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

During his time as a state senator, Dalton focused on improving education. Dalton worked to increase teacher pay while also reducing class sizes. In 2003, Dalton sponsored the Innovative Education Initiatives Act, establishing North Carolina’s award-winning network of Early College High Schools. The Early Colleges are a system of high schools partnered with institutions of higher learning that allow students to graduate with both a high school diploma and either an associate degree or college credit in five years. He also supported increasing funding for the state’s public university and community college systems during his tenure.

As a state senator, Dalton developed a reputation as a pro-business Democrat. He promoted incentives to help attract new businesses to North Carolina and relief to small business owners.

In 2006, Dalton helped establish Chimney Rock State Park.

===Committee assignments===
*Senate Education Committee (Co-Chairman)
*Senate Appropriations Committee (Co-Chairman)

==Lieutenant Governor (2009–2013)==

===Election===

In 2007, Dalton announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina in 2008. He won the Democratic primary on May 6, 2008, defeating Hampton Dellinger, Patrick Smathers, and Dan Besse. He won the general election on November 4, 2008 against the Republican nominee, former state senator Robert Pittenger.

===Tenure===
Dalton was sworn in on January 10, 2009. He served as the chairman of the Joining Our Businesses and Schools (JOBS) Commission. The commission included 20 business and education leaders. Through his work on the JOBS Commission, Dalton led a bipartisan effort to strengthen the relationship between private businesses and schools to help improve job training.

Dalton was appointed Chairman of the North Carolina Logistics Task Force in December 2009.

Dalton helped establish a small business assistance fund to help businesses across the state secure the credit necessary to expand and create jobs.

==2012 gubernatorial election==

After first-term Governor Beverly Perdue announced that she would not seek a second term in 2012, Dalton announced that he would be a candidate for governor. Ahead of the May 8 Democratic primary, Dalton was endorsed by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, which described him as &quot;well-versed in both the legislative and executive branches and in the crucial issues facing the state&quot; and as &quot;battle-tested,&quot; making him the strongest general election candidate. The &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; also endorsed Dalton, writing that he had &quot;considerable success as a legislator and played a major role in launching North Carolina&#x27;s successful Early College program.&quot; Dalton won the May 8 primary, defeating former U.S. Congressman Bob Etheridge and State Representative Bill Faison 46%–38%–6%.

During the general election, polls gave McCrory anywhere from a two to 14-point advantage.
Rasmussen Reports released a poll August 4 showing Dalton trailing McCrory by 5 points. In first quarter campaign finance reports, Dalton reported raising about $1 million less than McCrory&#x27;s campaign. Dalton also reported having $670,356.14 cash on hand at the end of the reporting period on April 21. McCrory reported having $3.1 million.

In October 2012, the (Raleigh) News and Observer endorsed Dalton for the general election, writing that &quot;on the merits of experience, knowledge, vision and judgment, [Dalton] is extraordinarily well equipped to give North Carolina the executive leadership it needs.&quot; In 2008, the newspaper had endorsed McCrory.

===Results===




==Career after politics==
Following the end of his term as lieutenant governor, Dalton was hired by Gardner-Webb University to teach a class on Southern politics and to serve as a special counsel to the university&#x27;s president. Several months later, he was selected as president of Isothermal Community College, where he had once served as board of trustees chairman.

==Personal life==
Dalton&#x27;s father, Charles, was also a North Carolina state senator, who died when Walter was 8 years old. His elder sister, Laura, helped their mother, Amanda, raise young Walter. She later became active in Republican politics and married Charles Neely, a Republican who served in the state legislature and unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2000.

Dalton&#x27;s wife, Lucille, is a former teacher and former local school board member. Walter and Lucille Dalton are the parents of two children, Brian and Elizabeth.

<doc id="451721" wikidata="Q7814791" url="?curid=451721" title="Tom Apodaca">
<text>Thomas Michael Apodaca (born November 8, 1957) is a lobbyist and former Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state&#x27;s forty-eighth Senate district, including constituents in Buncombe, Henderson, and Transylvania counties.

==North Carolina Senate==
Apodaca was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 2002 during his first campaign for public office; he was re-elected by his Western North Carolina constituents until his retirement in July 2016. In addition to chairing the Senate Rules Committee, he co-chaired the Committee on Insurance, the Committee on Pensions &amp; Retirement and Aging, and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education &amp; Higher Education. He retired before the end of his term in 2016 and was succeeded by Chuck Edwards.

==Controversies==
In the 2013 legislative session, Apodaca introduced and voted for a bill, Senate Bill 10, to reorganize the Environmental Management Commission and the N.C. Utilities Commission and replace the members with new appointees. This bill included the elimination of dozens of obsolete and rarely convened boards and commissions. Senate Bill 10 was not signed into law in 2013. Sen. Tom Apodaca said his main complaint to the House version was that it strikes language that would fire 12 special superior court judges.

In May 2013, after receiving the maximum $8000 contribution from North Carolina Automobile Dealers Association, Apodaca sponsored legislation that would make it illegal for any car maker to bypass dealerships and sell directly to consumers in North Carolina. Apodaca&#x27;s proposal was widely criticized as anti-competitive and aimed at insulating automobile dealers from Tesla Motors&#x27; business model.

In response to public outcry after a coal ash spill into the Dan River in northern North Carolina from a facility owned by Duke Energy Inc., Apodaca said he planned to draft legislation in May 2014 to require Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash ponds, including the one in Buncombe County. He told the &quot;Hendersonville Times-News&quot; on February 10, 2014: &quot;I don&#x27;t want a containment plan, I want a plan to get rid of it. ... We need a five- to 10-year plan to get rid of them because we don&#x27;t need it sitting there next to the river.&quot; Over the course of his time in politics, Apodaca accepted over $65,000 from organizations representing Duke Energy and Progress Energy.

In March 2016, Apodaca led a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly that passed the controversial Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act commonly known as HB2. After this session of congress, Apodaca called on the city of Charlotte to pay the $42,000 cost of the emergency legislative session which led to the bill&#x27;s passage. After the controversial bill passed, companies such as PayPal withdrew their plans to expand in North Carolina, resulting in the loss of at least four hundred potential jobs for North Carolinians.

==Personal life==
His wife Lisa is a former public school teacher; they have been married for over 30 years and have two sons. All four Apodacas are graduates of Western Carolina University, where Tom served as a member of the board of trustees.

<text>Robert C. Carpenter (June 18, 1924 – August 6, 2011) was a Republican member of the North Carolina General Assembly. He represented the state&#x27;s 29th, 42nd, and 50th Senate districts, including constituents in Cherokee, Clay, Graham, Haywood, Jackson, Macon, Swain and Transylvania counties. A retired bank executive from Franklin, North Carolina, Carpenter was elected to the state senate in 1988. He served eight terms, finally losing his seat in 2004 by fewer than 300 votes.

Carpenter was born in Franklin, North Carolina and graduated from Franklin High School in 1942. He briefly attended Western Carolina University before undergoing flight training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and flying with the United States Navy during World War II (from 1943 to 1945). After the war, he graduated from the University of Virginia School of Consumer Banking and served as a bank executive in Franklin until his retirement.

Carpenter married twice. His first wife, Ruth, died of cancer on September 15, 1985. Carpenter then married T. Helen Edwards Bryant on January 18, 1986. He had eight children with his first wife. He is the father-in-law of former North Carolina Representative Marge Carpenter (R). He was a member of the Franklin Rotary Club for 50 years. He died in 2011.

After Carpenter&#x27;s death in 2011, county commissioners unanimously approved a resolution Tuesday, March 18, 2014, to memorialize his life, with the county&#x27;s community building located on the Georgia Road to be known as the Robert C. Carpenter Community Facilities Building. Carpenter&#x27;s wife attended the meeting and was herself recognized for her service to the community.

Carpenter worked in politics for much of his life, working on the local level as a county commissioner, and on a national level during eight terms as a North Carolina State Senator. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. Locally, he served as President of the Franklin Chamber of Commerce and as Honorary Chairman for the Relay for Life. He worked on behalf of community colleges, serving 20 years on the Southwestern Community College Board of Trustees as well as President of the North Carolina Association of Community Colleges. Carpenter received many awards and recognitions including the State of North Carolina Distinguished Service Award, the NC Knights of Columbus Knight of the Year Award and Macon County Citizen of the Year recognition. He was a recipient of the Order of Long Leaf Pine Award, awarded by the governor of North Carolina. Carpenter spent many hours volunteering his time to baseball; he started Franklin&#x27;s Little League Baseball, coached Little League Baseball for 30 years, and was the first coach to recruit African Americans to play Little League Baseball in Asheville. For his work with baseball he received the Coach of the Year award and the Franklin Little League award. Carpenter was involved in many local organizations including the Optimist Club, Rotary Club, Jaycees and Knights of Columbus. He was on the Smokey Mountain Mental Health Board and served on the Governor&#x27;s NC Council on Developmental Disabilities. Carpenter was instrumental in establishing the county&#x27;s Highway 441 Welcome Center and the Veteran&#x27;s Clinic in Franklin, and in getting a natural gas line to western North Carolina.

<text>Jews for Israeli–Palestinian Peace (), abbreviated as JIPF, is a Stockholm-based association, founded by Swedish Jews in 1982, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.

== Activities and advocacy ==
JIPF states that they want to work for a &quot;fair and lasting peace&quot; in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, based on national self-determination and independence for both peoples. Its political programme include demands for a creation of a Palestinian state, Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from all territories occupied in 1967, the dismantlement of Israeli settlements and that the Palestinian refugee question must be based on the principle of the right of return or economic compensation.

With a grant from the &quot;Helena Berings Minnesfond (English: Helena Berings Memorial Fund)&quot; the group co-ran a school program in partnership with the Palestinian Association of Sweden. The program facilitated dialogues between Palestinians and Jews in approximately fifty schools over three years.

== Notable members ==
Dror Feiler is the chairman of the organization. Other members include Izzy Young, the journalist Annika Thor and the pediatrician Henry Ascher.

<doc id="451731" wikidata="Q334183" url="?curid=451731" title="Black-headed bunting">
<text>The black-headed bunting (Emberiza melanocephala) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae. It breeds in south-east Europe east to Iran and migrates in winter mainly to India, with some individuals moving further into south-east Asia. Like others in its family, it is found in open grassland habitats where they fly in flocks in search of grains and seed. Adult males are well marked with yellow underparts, chestnut back and a black head. Adult females in breeding plumage look like duller males. In other plumages, they can be hard to separate from the closely related red-headed bunting and natural hybridization occurs between the two species in the zone of overlap of their breeding ranges in northern Iran.

==Taxonomy==
The black-headed bunting was formally described in 1769 by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli under the binomial name &quot;Emberiza melanocephala&quot;. The type locality is Carniola in Slovenia. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting, and the specific &quot;melanocephala&quot; combines the Ancient Greek &quot;melas&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot; meaning &quot;head&quot;.

==Description==
This bird is long, larger than a reed bunting, and with a long-tail. The breeding male has bright yellow underparts, chestnut upperparts and a black hood. The female is a washed-out version of the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a greyish head. The juvenile is similar but the vent is yellow, and both can be difficult to separate from the corresponding plumages of the closely related red-headed bunting although the black-headed tends to have the cheeks darker than the throat. First year males have a grey crown and the back has patches of chestnut and grey. First year females can be difficult to separate from female red-headed buntings although having more streaking on the crown than on the lower back. The vent is yellow.

The black- and red-headed buntings represent sister species which forms a clade along with the crested bunting.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-headed bunting breeds in open scrubby areas including agricultural land. In winter they move to Asia and large flocks are found in agricultural fields and grasslands. The longest migration noted from a ringed individual is about 7,000 km. Another ringed bird was determined to have flown 1,000 km in seven days. Males form pure flocks during migration and arrive in the winter quarters well before the females. The winter range within India is mainly in western and northern India extending south to northern Karnataka. In winter they form large communal roosts in thorny acacia trees, often joining other species such as the yellow-throated sparrow.

The main breeding zone extends from south-eastern Europe to central Asia. The wintering grounds are mainly in India although vagrants have been found wintering as far east as Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, South Korea and Malaysia. Summer vagrants may occur as far north in Europe as Norway.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The black-headed bunting is found in flocks as it forages on grasslands for seeds. They breed in summer, building a nest in a low bush or on the ground. The nest is a cup made of dry grass and lined with hair. The clutch consists of four to six eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and the chicks fledge after about 10 days. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. In Bulgaria, the collapse of the drying cotton thistle (&quot;Onopordum acanthium&quot;) stems on which the birds build their nests has caused high mortality; this is thought to be an example of an ecological trap. In northern Iran, there is a region of range overlap with the red-headed bunting and natural hybrids are common although molecular data indicates that there is considerable genetic divergence between the two species.

Like the red-headed bunting but unlike many other &quot;Emberiza&quot; buntings, it has two moults in a year. It undergoes one moult in the winter quarters prior to migrating back to the breeding region, and another after breeding. Young birds fledge with a soft plumage and then moult into a juvenile plumage before migrating and then assume an adult plumage after moulting in their winter quarters.

In winter their call is a single note tweet or soft . The song consists of a loud series of strophes each made up a high harsh notes that accelerate into a jangling mix with some clear slurred notes interspersed before stopping abruptly.

== Status ==
The species has a large range and a large population with unknown trend. Based on these criteria, the IUCN categorizes the species as &quot;Least Concern&quot;. The global population is estimated to be between 7.6 and 27.5 million adult individuals.

<doc id="451733" wikidata="Q3099714" url="?curid=451733" title="Justin Trudeau">
<text>Justin Pierre James Trudeau (born December 25, 1971) is a Canadian politician who has been the 23rd and current prime minister of Canada since 2015 and the leader of the Liberal Party since 2013. A member of the Liberal Party, he was also the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Youth from 2015 to 2018.

Trudeau was born in Ottawa, Ontario, as the eldest son of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and attended Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from McGill University and a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of British Columbia. After graduating, he taught at the secondary school level in Vancouver, before returning to Montreal in 2002 to further his studies. He was chair for the youth charity Katimavik and director of the not-for-profit Canadian Avalanche Association. In 2006, he was appointed as chair of the Liberal Party&#x27;s Task Force on Youth Renewal. In the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of Papineau in the House of Commons. He was the Liberal Party&#x27;s Official Opposition critic for youth and multiculturalism in 2009; in 2010, he became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as a critic for secondary education and sport. In 2013, Trudeau was elected leader of the Liberal Party, and led the party to a majority government in the 2015 federal election. He became the second-youngest prime minister in Canadian history and the first to be the child of a previous prime minister. 

Major government initiatives Trudeau undertook during his first term included establishing the Canada Child Benefit, legalizing medical assistance in dying, legalizing recreational marijuana through the &quot;Cannabis Act&quot;, attempting Senate appointment reform by establishing the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments, and establishing the federal carbon tax. In foreign policy, Trudeau&#x27;s government negotiated trade deals such as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and signed the Paris Agreement on climate change. He was sanctioned by Canada&#x27;s ethics commissioner for violating conflict of interest law regarding the Aga Khan affair, and again with the SNC-Lavalin affair.

Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party was reduced to a minority government in the 2019 federal election. His government responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, announced an &quot;assault-style&quot; weapons ban in response to the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks, and launched a national $10-a-day child care program. He was investigated for a third time by the ethics commissioner for his part in the WE Charity scandal, but was cleared of wrongdoing. In the 2021 federal election, he led the Liberals to another minority government. In 2022, he invoked the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; in response to the Freedom Convoy protests and responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing military aid to Ukraine. His party signed a confidence and supply agreement with the New Democratic Party (NDP) in early 2022, which resulted in the enactment of the Canadian Dental Care Plan for residents that meet a certain income threshold and a framework for national pharmacare; in late 2024, the NDP opted to terminate the agreement.

Following the sudden resignation of deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland in December 2024 and an ensuing political crisis, Trudeau announced on January 6, 2025, that he would resign as both the prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party. He advised the governor general to prorogue parliament until March 24, while the party holds a leadership contest; Trudeau will remain leader until a new leader is chosen, after which he will resign as prime minister. He will also retire as an MP when the 44th Canadian Parliament is dissolved.

==Early life==
===Ancestry and birth===
On June 23, 1971, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO) announced that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s wife of four months, Margaret Trudeau (née Sinclair), was pregnant and due in December. Justin Trudeau was born on December 25, 1971, at 9:27 pm EST at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. He is the second child in Canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was John A. Macdonald&#x27;s daughter Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald (February 8, 1869 – January 28, 1933). Trudeau&#x27;s younger brothers Alexandre (Sacha) (born December 25, 1973) and Michel (October 2, 1975 – November 13, 1998) were the third and fourth.

Trudeau is predominantly of Scottish and French Canadian descent. His grandfathers were businessman Charles-Émile Trudeau and Scottish-born James Sinclair, who was minister of fisheries in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. Trudeau&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather Thomas Bernard was born in Makassar, Indonesia and immigrated to Penticton, British Columbia, in 1906 at age 15 with his family. Through the Bernard family, kinsmen of the Earls of Bandon, Trudeau is the fifth great-grandson of Major-General William Farquhar, a leader in the founding of modern Singapore; Trudeau also has remote ethnic Malaccan and Nias ancestry.

Trudeau was baptized with his father&#x27;s niece Anne Rouleau-Danis as godmother and his mother&#x27;s brother-in-law Thomas Walker as godfather, at Ottawa&#x27;s Notre Dame Basilica on the afternoon of January 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance. and given the names &quot;Justin Pierre James&quot;. On April 14, 1972, Trudeau&#x27;s father and mother hosted a gala at the National Arts Centre, at which visiting U.S. president Richard Nixon said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to toast the future prime minister of Canada, to Justin Pierre Trudeau&quot; to which Pierre Trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have &quot;the grace and skill of the president&quot;. Earlier that day, first lady Pat Nixon had visited him in his nursery and gifted him a stuffed toy Snoopy.

===Childhood===
Trudeau&#x27;s parents announced their separation in 1977, when he was five years old; his father was given primary custody. There were repeated rumours of a reconciliation for many years afterwards. However his mother eventually filed for a no-fault divorce which the Supreme Court of Ontario granted in 1984; his father had announced his intention to retire as prime minister a month earlier. Eventually his parents came to an amicable joint-custody arrangement and learned to get along quite well. Interviewed in October 1979, his nanny Dianne Lavergne was quoted, &quot;Justin is a mommy&#x27;s boy, so it&#x27;s not easy, but children&#x27;s hurts mend very quickly. And they&#x27;re lucky kids, anyway.&quot; Of his mother and father&#x27;s marriage, Trudeau said in 2009, &quot;They loved each other incredibly, passionately, completely. But there was 30 years between them, and my mom never was an equal partner in what encompassed my father&#x27;s life, his duty, his country.&quot; Trudeau has three half-siblings, Kyle and Alicia, from his mother&#x27;s remarriage to Fried Kemper, and Sarah, from his father&#x27;s relationship with Deborah Coyne.

Trudeau lived at 24 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, the official residence of Canada&#x27;s prime minister, from his birth until his father&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1979 federal election. The Trudeaus were expected to move into Stornoway, the residence of the leader of the Official Opposition, but because of flooding in the basement, Prime Minister Joe Clark offered them Harrington Lake, the prime minister&#x27;s official country retreat in Gatineau Park, with the expectation they would move into Stornoway at the start of July. However, the repairs were not complete, so Pierre Trudeau took a prolonged vacation with his sons to the Nova Scotia summer home of his friend, Member of Parliament Don Johnston, and later sent his sons to stay with their maternal grandparents in North Vancouver for the rest of the summer while he slept at his friend&#x27;s Ottawa apartment. Trudeau and his brothers returned to Ottawa for the start of the school year but lived only on the top floor of Stornoway while repairs continued on the bottom floor. His mother purchased and moved into a new home nearby at 95 Victoria Street in Ottawa&#x27;s New Edinburgh neighbourhood in September 1979. Pierre Trudeau and his sons returned to the prime minister&#x27;s official residence after the February 1980 election that returned him to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

His father had intended Trudeau to begin his formal education at a French-language lycée, but Trudeau&#x27;s mother convinced his father of the importance of sending their sons to a public school. In the end, Trudeau was enrolled in 1976 in the French immersion program at Rockcliffe Park Public School. It was the same school his mother had attended for two years while her father was a member of Parliament. He could have been dropped off by limousine, but his parents elected he take the school bus albeit with a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) car following. This was followed by one year at the private Lycée Claudel d&#x27;Ottawa.

After his father&#x27;s retirement in June 1984, his mother remained at her New Edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father&#x27;s home at 1418 Pine Avenue, Montreal known as Cormier House; the following autumn, he began attending the private Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, his father&#x27;s alma mater. The school had begun as a Jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time Justin matriculated. In 2008, Trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most, because &quot;that was where our father got to be just our father – a dad in the woods&quot;. During the summers his father would send him and his brothers to Camp Ahmek, on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park, where he would later work in his first paid job as a camp counsellor.

Trudeau and his brothers were given shares in two numbered companies by their father: the first containing a portfolio of securities, from which they receive regular dividends, up to $20,000 per year; and the second which receives royalties from their father&#x27;s autobiography and other sources, about $10,000 a year. As of August 2011, the first numbered company had assets of $1.2 million. The Trudeau brothers were also given a country estate of about 50 hectares in the Laurentians with a home designed by the esteemed Canadian architect Arthur Erickson, and the Cormier House in Montreal. The country estate land was estimated to be worth $2.7 million in 2016.

===University and early career===
Trudeau has a bachelor of arts degree in literature from McGill University and a bachelor of education degree from the University of British Columbia. In his first year at McGill, Trudeau became acquainted with his future principal secretary, Gerald Butts, through their mutual friend, Jonathan Ablett. Butts invited Trudeau to join the McGill Debating Union. They bonded while driving back to Montreal after a debate tournament at Princeton University. After graduation, Trudeau stayed in Vancouver where he became a substitute teacher at local schools such as Killarney Secondary and worked permanently as a French and math teacher at the private West Point Grey Academy. He became a roommate at the Douglas Lodge with fellow West Point Grey Academy faculty member and friend Christopher Ingvaldson. From 2002 to 2004, he studied engineering at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, affiliated with Université de Montréal, but did not graduate. He started a master&#x27;s degree in environmental geography at McGill but withdrew from the program to seek public office.

In August 2000, Trudeau attended the Kokanee Summit in Creston, British Columbia, to raise funds in honour of his brother Michel Trudeau and other avalanche victims. After the event, an unsigned editorial in the &quot;Creston Valley Advance&quot; (a local newspaper) accused Trudeau of having groped an unnamed female reporter while at the music festival. The editorial stated Trudeau provided a &quot;day-late&quot; apology to the reporter, saying, &quot;If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward&quot;. In 2018, Trudeau was questioned about the groping incident but said he did not remember any negative incidents from that time. His apology and later statement about the event have been described as hypocritical, while responses to the story have been described as a witch hunt or non-story.

In October 2000, Trudeau, then 28, emerged as a prominent figure after delivering a eulogy at his father&#x27;s state funeral. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) received numerous calls to rebroadcast the speech after its initial transmission, and leading Quebec politician Claude Ryan described it as &quot;perhaps ... the first manifestation of a dynasty&quot;. A book issued by the CBC in 2003 included the speech in its list of significant Canadian events from the past fifty years.

In 2007, Trudeau starred in the two-part CBC Television miniseries &quot;The Great War&quot;, which gave an account of Canada&#x27;s participation in the First World War. He portrayed his fifth cousin, twice removed, Major Talbot Mercer Papineau, who was killed on October 30, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele. Trudeau is one of several children of former prime ministers who have become Canadian media personalities. The others are Ben Mulroney (son of Brian Mulroney), Catherine Clark (daughter of Joe Clark), and Trudeau&#x27;s younger brother, Alexandre. Ben Mulroney was a guest at Trudeau&#x27;s wedding.

===Advocacy===

Trudeau and his family started the Kokanee Glacier Alpine Campaign for winter sports safety in 2000, two years after his brother Michel died in an avalanche during a ski trip. In 2002, Trudeau criticized the Government of British Columbia&#x27;s decision to stop its funding for a public avalanche warning system.

From 2002 to 2006, Trudeau chaired the Katimavik youth program, a project started by longtime family friend Jacques Hébert.

In 2002–03, Trudeau was a panelist on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; series, where he championed &quot;The Colony of Unrequited Dreams&quot; by Wayne Johnston. Trudeau and his brother Alexandre inaugurated the Trudeau Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Toronto in April 2004; the centre later became a part of the Munk School of Global Affairs. In 2006, he hosted the presentation ceremony for the Giller Prize for literature.

In 2005, Trudeau fought against a proposed $100-million zinc mine that he argued would poison the Nahanni River, a United Nations World Heritage Site located in the Northwest Territories. He was quoted as saying, &quot;The river is an absolutely magnificent, magical place. I&#x27;m not saying mining is wrong ... but that is not the place for it. It&#x27;s just the wrong thing to be doing.&quot;

On September 17, 2006, Trudeau was the master of ceremonies at a Toronto rally organized by Roméo Dallaire that called for Canadian participation in resolving the Darfur crisis.

==Political beginnings==
Trudeau supported the Liberal Party from a young age, offering his support to party leader John Turner in the 1988 federal election. Two years later, he defended Canadian federalism at a student event at the Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, which he attended.

Following his father&#x27;s death, Trudeau became more involved with the Liberal Party throughout the 2000s. Along with Olympian Charmaine Crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister Jean Chrétien at the party&#x27;s 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party&#x27;s defeat in the 2006 federal election.

In October 2006, Trudeau criticized Quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an &quot;old idea from the 19th century&quot;, &quot;based on a smallness of thought&quot; and not relevant to modern Quebec. This comment was seen as a criticism of Michael Ignatieff, then a candidate in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership election, who was promoting recognition of Quebec as a nation. Trudeau later wrote a public letter on the subject, describing the idea of Quebec nationhood as &quot;against everything my father ever believed&quot;.

Trudeau announced his support for leadership candidate Gerard Kennedy shortly before the 2006 convention and introduced Kennedy during the candidates&#x27; final speeches. When Kennedy dropped off after the second ballot, Trudeau joined him in supporting the ultimate winner, Stéphane Dion.

Rumours circulated in early 2007 that Trudeau would run in an upcoming by-election in the Montreal riding of Outremont. The Montreal newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; reported despite Trudeau&#x27;s keenness, Liberal leader Stéphane Dion wanted Outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the Liberal Party. Instead, Trudeau announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in the nearby riding of Papineau for the next general election. The riding, which had been held for 26 years by André Ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in Liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the Bloc Québécois in 2006.

On April 29, 2007, Trudeau won the Liberal party&#x27;s nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for Deros and 220 for Giordano against Mary Deros, a Montreal city councillor and Basilio Giordano, the publisher of a local Italian-language newspaper.

==Opposition (2008–2015)==

Prime Minister Stephen Harper called an election for October 14, 2008, by which time Trudeau had been campaigning for a year in Papineau. On election day, Trudeau narrowly defeated Bloc Québécois incumbent Vivian Barbot. Following his election win, Edward Greenspon, editor-in-chief of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, noted that Trudeau would &quot;be viewed as few other rookie MPs are—as a potential future Prime Minister—and scrutinized through that lens&quot;.

The Conservative Party won a minority government in the 2008 election, and Trudeau entered parliament as a member of the Official Opposition. Trudeau&#x27;s first legislative act was a motion that called for the creation of a &quot;national voluntary service policy for young people&quot;. He later co-chaired the Liberal Party&#x27;s April 2009 national convention in Vancouver, and in October of the same year he was appointed as the party&#x27;s critic for multiculturalism and youth.

In September 2010, he was reassigned as critic for youth, citizenship, and immigration. During that time, he criticized the government&#x27;s legislation targeting human smuggling, which he argued would penalize the victims of smuggling.

Trudeau sparked controversy when it was revealed that he earned $1.3 million in public speaking fees from charities and school boards across Canada, $277,000 of which Trudeau received after becoming an MP.

He encouraged an increase of Canada&#x27;s relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and sought more accessible immigration procedures for Haitians moving to Canada in the time of crisis. His own riding includes a significant Haitian community.

Trudeau was re-elected in Papineau in the 2011 federal election, as the Liberal Party fell to third-party standing in the House of Commons with only thirty-four seats. Ignatieff resigned as party leader immediately after the election, and rumours again circulated that Trudeau could run to become his successor. On this occasion, Trudeau said, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I should be closing off any options ... because of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way that ... to be blunt, concerns me.&quot; Weeks after the election, Toronto MP Bob Rae was selected as the interim leader until the party&#x27;s leadership convention, which was later decided to be held in April 2013. Rae appointed Trudeau as the party&#x27;s critic for post-secondary education, youth and amateur sport. After his re-election, he travelled the country hosting fundraisers for charities and the Liberal Party.

Trudeau wanted to take part in a charity boxing match on behalf of the cancer research fundraising event Fight for the Cure, but was having difficulty finding a Conservative opponent until Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau agreed when asked on Trudeau&#x27;s behalf by their mutual hairdresser Stefania Capovilla. The fight took place on March 31, 2012, at the Hampton Inn in Ottawa, and it was broadcast live on Sun News with commentary by Ezra Levant and Brian Lilley. Trudeau won in the third round; the result was considered an upset.

===Leader of the Liberal Party===
====Earlier speculation====
After Dion&#x27;s resignation as Liberal leader in 2008, Trudeau&#x27;s name was mentioned as a potential candidate with polls showing him as a favourite among Canadians for the position.

However, Trudeau did not enter the race and Michael Ignatieff was named leader in December 2008. After the party&#x27;s poor showing in the 2011 election, Ignatieff resigned from the leadership and Trudeau was again seen as a potential candidate to lead the party.

Following the election, Trudeau said he was undecided about seeking the leadership; months later on October 12 at Wilfrid Laurier University, he announced he would not seek the post because he had a young family. When interim leader Bob Rae, who was also seen as a frontrunner, announced he would not be entering the race in June 2012, Trudeau was hit with a &quot;tsunami&quot; of calls from supporters to reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership.

Opinion polling conducted by several pollsters showed that if Trudeau were to become leader the Liberal Party would surge in support, from a distant third place to either being competitive with the Conservative Party or leading them. In July 2012, Trudeau stated that he would reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership and would announce his final decision at the end of the summer.

====2013 leadership election====

On September 26, 2012, multiple media outlets started reporting that Trudeau would launch his leadership bid the following week. While Trudeau was seen as a frontrunner for the leadership of the Liberal Party, he was criticized for his perceived lack of substance. During his time as a member of Parliament, he spoke little on policy matters and it was not known where he stood on many issues such as the economy and foreign affairs. Some strategists and pundits believed the leadership would be the time for Trudeau to be tested on these issues; however, there was also fear within the party that his celebrity status and large lead might deter other strong candidates from entering the leadership race.

On October 2, 2012, Trudeau held a rally in Montreal to launch his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party. The core people on his campaign team were considered longtime friends, and all in their 30s and 40s. His senior advisor was Gerald Butts, the former president of WWF-Canada who had previously been principal secretary to former Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Other senior aides included campaign manager Katie Telford, and policy advisors Mike McNeir and Robert Asselin, who had all worked for recent Liberal Party leaders. His brother Alexandre also took a break from his documentary work to be a senior advisor on Trudeau&#x27;s campaign.

During the leadership campaign, three by-elections were held on November 26, 2012. The riding Calgary Centre was expected to be a three-way race between the Conservatives, Liberals and Green Party. A week before by-election day Sun Media reported on comments Trudeau had made in a 2010 interview with Télé-Québec, in which he said, &quot;Canada isn&#x27;t doing well right now because it&#x27;s Albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda.&quot; Trudeau&#x27;s campaign advisor said that the comments were being brought up now because of the close race in Calgary Centre. The following day, Trudeau apologized, saying he was wrong to use &quot;Alberta&quot; as &quot;shorthand&quot; in referring to Stephen Harper&#x27;s government. The Conservatives held onto Calgary Centre in the by-election by less than 1,200 votes. Liberal candidate Harvey Locke said he lost the by-election on his own and that comments made by Trudeau did not influence the outcome.

Fellow leadership candidate Marc Garneau, seen as Trudeau&#x27;s main challenger in the race, criticized Trudeau for not releasing enough substantial policy positions. Garneau called on him to release more detailed policies before members and supporters begin to vote. Garneau later challenged Trudeau to a one-on-one debate, and said that if Trudeau could not defend his ideas in a debate against him, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to do so against Prime Minister Harper. Trudeau clashed in debates with challenger Joyce Murray, who was the only Liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the House of Commons with a system of proportional representation. She challenged Trudeau over his support for a preferential ballot voting system.

On March 13, 2013, Garneau dropped out of the leadership race, saying that polling conducted by his campaign showed he would be unable to defeat Trudeau.

With Joyce Murray, the last challenger, receiving significant press time, more Liberal politicians and public figures declared themselves for Trudeau. Trudeau was declared the winner of the leadership election on April 14, 2013, garnering 80.1% of 30,800 votes. Joyce Murray finished in second place with 10.2%, ahead of Martha Hall Findlay&#x27;s 5.7%. Trudeau had lost only five ridings, all to Murray and all in BC.

=====Early leadership (2013–2015)=====

In the days following his victory in the leadership race, snapshot polls recorded a surge in support for the Liberal party.

In 2013, Trudeau chose to give up his seat at the funeral of Nelson Mandela, in deference to Irwin Cotler as representative of the Liberal Party of Canada, because of Cotler&#x27;s work for and with Nelson Mandela in fighting apartheid.

During the leadership campaign, Trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a blind trust which is atypical for opposition MPs, including leaders. According to documents obtained by the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, he fulfilled the pledge in July 2013 when the blind trust was set up by BMO Private Banking.

Trudeau launched an internet video the week before the 2014 Liberal party convention titled &quot;An economy that benefits us all&quot; in which he narrates his economic platform. He said that Canada&#x27;s debt to GDP ratios have come down in recent years and now it&#x27;s time for Ottawa to &quot;step up&quot;.

====2015 federal election====
On October 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, Trudeau led the Liberals to a decisive victory in the federal election. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government; a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.

This was the second-best performance in the party&#x27;s history. The Liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. In addition to taking all of Atlantic Canada and Toronto, they won 40 seats in Quebec—the most that the Liberals had won in that province since Trudeau&#x27;s father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the Liberals won a majority of Quebec&#x27;s seats in an election. The 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since Confederation and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the Commons to a majority government.

In addition to the appeal of his party&#x27;s platform, Trudeau&#x27;s success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised leaders&#x27; debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.
Trudeau declared victory shortly after CBC News projected that he had won a majority government. He began his speech with a reference to former Liberal prime minister Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s &quot;sunny ways&quot; () approach to bringing Canadians together despite their differences. According to Trudeau, Laurier &quot;knew that politics can be a positive force, and that&#x27;s the message Canadians have sent today&quot;. Harper announced his resignation as the leader of the Conservative Party that night.

==Prime Minister of Canada (2015–present)==

===Swearing-in===

Trudeau and the rest of the Cabinet were sworn in by Governor General David Johnston on November 4, 2015. He said that his first legislative priority was to lower taxes for middle-income Canadians and raise taxes for the top 1% of income earners after parliament was reconvened on December 3, 2015. Trudeau also issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with Indigenous peoples in Canada and run an open, ethical and transparent government. On November 5, 2015, during the first Liberal caucus meeting since forming a majority government, the party announced that it would reinstate the mandatory long-form census that had been scrapped in 2010, effective with the 2016 census.

===Domestic policy===
The Trudeau government&#x27;s economic policy initially relied on increased tax revenues to pay for increased government spending. While the government has not balanced the budget, it reduced Canada&#x27;s debt-to-GDP ratio every year until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Trudeau&#x27;s self-described progressive and feminist social policy has included strong advocacy for abortion rights. His government introduced the bill that made conversion therapies illegal in Canada.

Before winning the 2015 election, Trudeau promised to accept 50,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq by the end of 2016. In 2016, Trudeau&#x27;s advisors recommended drastically increasing immigration levels to stimulate the economy. Despite warnings about the impact of rapid population growth on housing and services, Trudeau&#x27;s government increased targets each year, reaching almost 1 million newcomers (permanent and temporary residents) in both 2022 and 2023. Trudeau initiated measures to combat housing inflation such as banning foreign buyers and creating the Housing Accelerator fund but asserted in a May 2024 interview that &quot;housing needs to retain its value.&quot; In October 2024, as Canadians endured a cost of living and housing crisis, and Trudeau&#x27;s unpopularity grew, he announced cuts to immigration targets in a video message. This had little effect on Trudeau&#x27;s approval rating, which had plummeted from 65% in 2016 to 22% in December 2024. Reports released in early 2025, suggested population growth would not be significantly slowed even with the Trudeau government&#x27;s proposed cuts.

In 2021, Trudeau touted his Child Benefit Program, claiming it had lifted 400,000 children out of poverty. In 2024, food bank usage was at an all-time high and more working people than ever were using food banks. This occurred amidst global food crises at the time. 

Canada introduced the right to medically-assisted dying in 2016. and legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2018. In 2021, Trudeau announced the creation of a national child care plan with the intention of reducing day care fees for parents down to $10 a day per child within five years. In November 2022, the Trudeau government announced that Canada would admit 500,000 immigrants per year by 2025.

His environmental policy included introducing new commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% before 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. His main tool for reaching this target is a federal carbon pricing policy. Trudeau&#x27;s parliament also adopted legislation for marine conservation, banning six common single-use plastic products, and strengthening environmental impact assessments. Trudeau pledged to ban single use plastic in 2019. In 2022 his government announced a ban on producing and importing single use plastic from December 2022. The sale of those items will be banned from December 2023 and the export from 2025. However, Trudeau is in favour of oil and gas pipelines to bring Canadian fossil fuel resources to foreign markets.
As prime minister, Trudeau launched three major independent investigations: the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIWG), the Joint Federal/Provincial Commission into the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks (in partnership with the Government of Nova Scotia), and the Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions. The latter was called in response to allegations of Chinese government interference in the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, but also deals with interference from other states deemed hostile to Canada. The MMIWG investigation found that Canada&#x27;s response to this issue amounts to genocide, a finding Trudeau said he accepted.

On September 22, 2023, Yaroslav Hunka, a Ukrainian Canadian who fought in the SS Division Galicia of the military wing of the Nazi Party, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, was invited to the House of Commons of Canada to be recognized by Speaker Anthony Rota, the Member of Parliament for Hunka&#x27;s district. Hunka received two standing ovations from all house members, including Justin Trudeau, other party leaders, and visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The incident, seen as a political blunder and a scandal, such that it drew comparisons to the most embarrassing moments in Canada&#x27;s history, was leveraged by the Russian establishment to further its justifications for waging war in Ukraine. Trudeau said, &quot;This is a mistake that deeply embarrassed parliament and Canada&quot; and apologized to President Zelenskyy.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

Trudeau was prime minister during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. His government&#x27;s response to the pandemic included funds for provinces and territories to adapt to the new situation, funds for coronavirus research, travel restrictions, screening of international flights, self-isolation orders under the &quot;Quarantine Act&quot;, an industrial strategy, and a public health awareness campaign. Initially, Canada faced a shortage of personal protective equipment, as the Trudeau government had cut PPE stockpile funding in the previous years.

To deal with the economic impact of the pandemic in 2020, Trudeau waived student loan payments, increased the Canada Child Benefit, doubled the annual Goods and Services Tax payment, and introduced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) as part of a first package in March. In April 2020, Trudeau introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, the Canada Emergency Business Account, and the Canada Emergency Student Benefit. Trudeau also deployed the Canadian Forces in long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario as part of Operation LASER.

Throughout the pandemic, the federal government was also responsible for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines. On May 12, 2020, the Trudeau government announced it had reached an exclusive deal with CanSino Biologics. However, due to deteriorating Canadian-Chinese relations, the Cansino deal fell through. On August 5, 2020, the Trudeau government created a plan to secure doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Starting in December 2020, Trudeau oversaw the implementation of Canada&#x27;s mass-vaccination program.
The spread of COVID-19 in Canada continued beyond the initial outbreak, with a strong second wave in the fall of 2020 and an even more serious third wave in the spring of 2021. Throughout the crisis, Trudeau periodically extended the scope and duration of the federal aid programs. The 2021 Canadian federal budget planned to phase them out by the end of September 2021, and projected a $354.2-billion deficit in the 2020–21 fiscal year. While CERB was indeed phased out on September 26, the Canada Recovery Benefit (CBR) continued to provide support until October 23. The Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit was introduced that month to replace the CBR, and expanded during the spread of the Omicron variant in December 2021.

==== Freedom Convoy and &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; invocation ====
The Canada convoy protest, called the Freedom Convoy, was a protest in Canada against COVID-19 vaccine requirements for truckers to re-enter the country by land introduced by the Government of Canada on January 15, 2022. Originally composed of several routes traversing all of the Canadian provinces, the truck convoys converged on Ottawa.

On January 29, the first day of protest at Parliament Hill, Trudeau moved to an undisclosed location. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the demonstration developed to express a number of &quot;antigovernment grievances&quot;, particularly against Trudeau. On January 31, Trudeau called the protests an &quot;insult to truth&quot;. On February 3, he said that a military response was &quot;not in the cards right now&quot;. On February 11, &quot;Reuters&quot; reported that Trudeau promised the US &quot;quick action&quot; regarding protesters who have forcefully blocked the Ambassador Bridge on the US-Canada border, the continent&#x27;s &quot;busiest land border crossing&quot;. Trudeau subsequently indicated that there would be &quot;robust police intervention&quot; and called for all protesters to &quot;go home&quot;.

Trudeau invoked the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; on February 14, 2022, for the first time since it was enacted in 1988, as a result of the public order emergency caused by the demonstrations in Ottawa. On February 23, 2022, Trudeau announced that the federal government would revoke the emergency declaration. Later that day, the governor general signed a proclamation revoking it. A year later, on February 17, 2023, a judicial inquiry into the use of the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; concluded that the Trudeau government met the legal threshold required to invoke the act. In early 2024, Federal Court judge Richard Mosley ruled that the federal government&#x27;s invocation of the Emergencies Act to end the 2022 convoy protest was &quot;not justified&quot; and infringed on Charter rights. , the federal government planned to appeal the ruling.

====2019 federal election====

On September 11, 2019, Trudeau visited Governor General Julie Payette, to request the dissolution of Parliament, and formally triggering an election. Prior to the formal start of the campaign, Trudeau announced his intention to only participate in the three leaders&#x27; debates, two organized by the Leaders&#x27; Debates Commission, and one organized by TVA. Other leader&#x27;s debates were either cancelled or took place with an empty podium left on stage for Trudeau.

In September 2019, controversial pictures and video were published showing Trudeau in brownface and blackface. On September 18, 2019, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published a photograph of Trudeau wearing brownface makeup in the spring of 2001, at an &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;-themed gala, while Trudeau was a teacher at West Point Grey Academy. Trudeau publicly apologized, agreeing the photo was racist and saying: &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t have done that. I should have known better and I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m really sorry.&quot; He further went on to say &quot;It was something that I didn&#x27;t think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do&quot;. Trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface makeup in high school while singing &quot;Day-O&quot; at a talent show that was subsequently published by Global News. A third instance, a video, of Trudeau in racist dress was also published. After this video was published, Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup. In the days following the scandal, pollsters pointed out that many Canadians either were not bothered by the scandal or had accepted Trudeau&#x27;s apology. Additionally, some minority community groups, racialized commentators and some of Trudeau&#x27;s opponents came to his defence. Others were more critical, including members of his own party.

While Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal Party lost 20 seats in the House of Commons (lowering its total from 177 to 157) from the time of dissolution, they still won the most seats of any party—enough to allow Trudeau to form a minority government. For the first time since 1979, the party that garnered the largest share of the national popular vote did not win the most seats; the Liberals under Trudeau had 33.1% of the popular vote, while the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer had 34.4%.

==== 2021 federal election ====

On August 15, 2021, Trudeau advised Governor General Mary Simon to dissolve parliament, scheduling an election for September 20. The election was called on the same day as the Fall of Kabul. In the first two weeks of the campaign, Trudeau received criticism for not acting fast enough in the face of the 2021 Taliban offensive to evacuate Canadian citizens and Afghans who supported Canada&#x27;s military and diplomatic efforts during the War in Afghanistan. The Liberals called the election to win a majority government and govern alone.

In the 2021 federal election, Trudeau secured a third mandate and his second minority government after winning 160 seats. However, the Liberals came in second in the national popular vote, behind the Conservatives. They received 32.6% of the popular vote, the lowest percentage of the national popular vote for a governing party in Canadian history. The results were mostly unchanged from the 2019 federal election. 

===== Confidence and supply agreement =====
On March 22, 2022, the Liberals and the NDP entered a confidence and supply agreement, in which the NDP committed to supporting the Liberals in all votes of confidence for the duration of the 44th Parliament. In exchange, the Liberal Party would back key NDP priorities, including national dental care for low-income Canadians, national pharmacare, labour reforms for federally-regulated workers, and new taxes on financial institutions.

In September 2024, the NDP pulled their support and ended the confidence and supply agreement. The Conservative Party made three failed no-confidence motions in September, October, and December, all of which did not receive NDP support. On December 20, 2024, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pledged to put forward another no-confidence motion and vote out Trudeau&#x27;s government.

===Foreign policy===
In 2015, Trudeau told the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; that Canada could be the &quot;first postnational state&quot;.

In 2016, Trudeau lifted visa requirements for Mexican citizens. Asylum claims by Mexicans grew from 110 in 2015 to 24,000 in 2023. Visas and some restrictions were reinstated in 2024.

In January 2017, Trudeau wrote, &quot;To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,&quot; on Twitter. As a result, irregular border crossing increased, mainly at Roxham Road. Increased strain on services in Quebec and Ontario, and criticism over the unsustainable influx of claimants, appeared to influence the decision to close Roxham Road in March 2023; however, the new terms of the Canada–United States Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) had been arranged the previous year. After irregular border crossings were shut down, asylum claims surged at airports.
Trudeau enjoyed good relations with the &quot;like-minded&quot; United States president Barack Obama, despite Trudeau&#x27;s support for the Keystone Pipeline, which was rejected by the Democratic president. Trudeau&#x27;s first foreign policy challenges included follow-through on his campaign promise to withdraw Canadian air support from the Syrian civil war&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraq/Syria trainers, aid&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and to welcome 25,000 Syrian war refugees.
When Donald Trump became president, Canada-US relations deteriorated. The Trump administration forced the renegotiation of NAFTA to create the CUSMA, in which Canada made significant concessions in allowing increased imports of American milk, weakening Canada&#x27;s dairy supply management system. Donald Trump also implemented tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, to which Trudeau retaliated by imposing tariffs on American steel, aluminum and a variety of other American products.

Canada&#x27;s relationship with China also deteriorated during Trudeau&#x27;s time as prime minister. The turmoil led to the arrest of Meng Wanzhou at the Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 at the behest of the United States, and the arrest of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China 12 days later. Trudeau appointed Liberal advisor, Dominic Barton (McKinsey &amp; Company, Century Initiative) ambassador to China in 2019. While Barton negotiated the release of Spavor and Kovrig, Canada-China trade reached historic highs. Barton resigned in December 2021, &quot;amidst growing pressure from...President Joe Biden for Ottawa to take a tougher stance with Beijing.&quot; As Wanzhou, Spavor and Kovrig were released at the exact same time in September 2021, many observers speculated they were exchanged as part of a deal between the United States and China. Trudeau greeted Spavor and Kovrig at the airport upon their repatriation. In 2024, Spavor was awarded $7 million in compensation for his arrest and detainment. Although Trudeau repeatedly claimed the two were arbitrarily targeted, it was later reported Spavor had unwittingly participated in espionage by sharing information on North Korea with Kovrig who then passed it onto the Canadian government.

In a similar fashion, Canada&#x27;s relationship with Saudi Arabia was also put under strain, as human rights groups called on Trudeau to stop selling military equipment to that country under a deal struck by the Harper government. In 2018, Saudi Arabia recalled its Canadian ambassador and froze trade with the country in response to Canada&#x27;s call for the Saudis to release opposition blogger Raif Badawi. However, in 2019, Canada doubled its weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, despite a &quot;moratorium on export permits following the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and mounting civilian deaths from the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.&quot;

In 2020, Canada lost its bid to join the United Nations Security Council. This was the second time Canada had failed an attempt to join the Security Council, the first time being in 2009 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

In September 2023, Trudeau said that the government of Canada had &quot;credible intelligence&quot; that the government of India was involved in the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, outside a Sikh temple in Surrey. This episode caused a rapid deterioration of Canada–India relations.

In October 7, 2023, Trudeau condemned Hamas&#x27; actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defence. On October 24, he rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported &quot;humanitarian pauses&quot; to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip. On December 12, in a joint statement with the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Trudeau called for a &quot;sustainable ceasefire&quot; in the war. Trudeau neither endorsed nor rejected South Africa&#x27;s genocide case against Israel.

====Foreign interference====
In 2022 and 2023, Canadian media reported that the People&#x27;s Republic of China had made attempts to interfere in the 2019 Canadian federal election and 2021 Canadian federal election.

Canadian opposition parties demanded a public inquiry into election interference. Rejecting a full public inquiry, Trudeau nominated former Governor General of Canada David Johnston to investigate the allegations. Johnston delivered a report in May 2023, which described China&#x27;s interference as a danger to Canadian democracy, stated that some of the media reports were partially incorrect, and that the Canadian intelligence services and Canadian government needed to make several improvements to counter the threat and protect members of Parliament.

Following Johnston&#x27;s resignation on June 9, Justin Trudeau commissioned Québec justice Marie-Josée Hogue to preside over the &quot;Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions&quot;. In May 2024, the inquiry issued its preliminary report, finding that China engaged in foreign interference in both elections, but the interference did not affect the ultimate result of either election.

=== Ethics ===
Trudeau was criticized by opposition members in November 2016 for his fundraising tactics, which they saw as &quot;cash for access&quot; schemes. Trudeau attended fundraisers where attendees paid upwards of $1500 for access to him and other cabinet members. In some instances, the events were attended by foreign businessmen who needed government approval for their businesses. Trudeau defended his fundraising tactics, saying that they were not in breach of any ethics rules. He also stated that he was lobbied at the fundraisers but not influenced. In 2017, Trudeau introduced legislation that would eliminate such exclusive events by requiring increased transparency for political fundraisers.

In January 2017, the ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, began an investigation into Trudeau for a vacation he and his family took to Aga Khan IV&#x27;s private island in the Bahamas. The ethics commissioner&#x27;s report, released in December 2017, found that Trudeau had violated four provisions of the &quot;Conflict of Interest Act&quot;. He became the first sitting prime minister to break federal conflict of interest law. In 2022, it was reported that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had considered bringing criminal charges against Trudeau over the affair.

In February 2018, Trudeau was criticized when his government invited Khalistani nationalist Jaspal Atwal to the Canadian High Commission&#x27;s dinner party in Delhi. Atwal had previously been convicted for the shooting and attempted murder of Indian Cabinet minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986, as well as the assault on former BC premier Ujjal Dosanjh in 1985. Following the dinner, the PMO rescinded the invitation, and apologized for the incident.

====SNC-Lavalin affair====
On February 8, 2019, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that sources close to the government said that the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office had allegedly attempted to influence Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of SNC-Lavalin. The charges allege that between 2001 and 2011, SNC-Lavalin paid CA$48 million in bribes in Libya to officials in the government of Muammar Gaddafi. When asked about the allegations, Trudeau said that the story in the &quot;Globe&quot; was false and that he had never &quot;directed&quot; Wilson-Raybould concerning the case. Wilson-Raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege. Soon after, Trudeau voluntarily waived privilege and cabinet confidences, permitting her to speak. On February 11, the ethics commissioner announced the opening of an investigation into the allegations. Trudeau said he &quot;welcomed the investigation&quot;. The Justice Committee of the House of Commons has conducted a series of hearings on the alleged interference. The investigation heard from several witnesses, including Jody Wilson-Raybould, who submitted as evidence a telephone call she secretly recorded between herself and Privy Council Clerk Michael Wernick, which was subsequently released to the public. On the recording, Wernick is heard asking to understand why the &quot;DPA route&quot; is not being used, stating that people were &quot;talking past each other&quot;, and suggesting Trudeau obtain independent legal advice from former Supreme Court chief justice Beverly McLachlin. Wilson-Raybould is heard suggesting that Trudeau would be &quot;breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence&quot;. On March 19, 2019, the Liberal committee members voted as a bloc to shut down the Justice Committee&#x27;s investigation.

Trudeau was the subject of an investigation by the ethics commissioner, pursuant to the &quot;Conflict of Interest Act&quot;, in regards to criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin in the SNC-Lavalin affair. The commission&#x27;s final report, issued August 14, 2019, concluded &quot;Mr. Trudeau contravened section 9 of the Act&quot;.

====WE Charity investigation====
Following complaints by opposition parties that the Trudeau family had ties to WE Charity, the ethics commissioner on July 3, 2020, announced an investigation into Trudeau&#x27;s and the government&#x27;s decision to have the charity administer a summer, student-grant program which could assist students financially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trudeau responded by saying WE was the charity that had the capability to administer such a program. WE and the federal government decided to &quot;part ways&quot; leaving administration of the grant program to the federal government.

WE Charity was criticized for its close ties to the Trudeau family; the investigation came after revelations that Trudeau&#x27;s mother, brother, and wife were paid nearly $300,000 in total to speak at WE Charity events.
On July 16, 2020, the ethics commissioner also announced the investigation was being expanded to include Finance Minister Bill Morneau. Trudeau was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by the ethics commissioner though Morneau was found to have broken the conflict of interest law.

===Resignation===
Since the 2021 federal election, the Liberals have faced declining poll numbers and disappointing results in by-elections, including losses in safe seats such as Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s in Toronto and LaSalle—Émard—Verdun in Montreal. The months following these losses saw frequent media stories about internal frustration and discontent with Trudeau&#x27;s leadership. This appeared to culminate in a caucus meeting where multiple members called on Trudeau to resign. Trudeau emerged from this meeting stating that the party remained &quot;strong and united&quot;.

The closing months of 2024 later saw a wave of resignations in Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet. On September 19, 2024, Minister of Transport Pablo Rodriguez resigned to run for leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party. On November 20, 2024, Alberta MP Randy Boissonnault resigned following allegations that he ran a business seeking federal contracts and falsely claimed to be Indigenous. On December 15, 2024, Housing Minister Sean Fraser announced his intention to leave the federal cabinet in the next shuffle, citing family reasons.

On December 16, 2024, Chrystia Freeland resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, hours before she was due to release the government&#x27;s fall economic statement. Freeland was often nicknamed the &quot;minister of everything&quot;, and widely seen as a potential successor to Trudeau for the leadership of the Liberal Party. In her resignation letter, Freeland reported Trudeau had asked her to resign as finance minister and that she would be offered another Cabinet position. She instead decided to resign altogether from his Cabinet, saying that &quot;to be effective, a Minister must speak on behalf of the Prime Minister and with his full confidence. In making your decision, you made clear that I no longer credibly enjoy that confidence.&quot;

Freeland&#x27;s resignation came amid threats from the incoming Trump administration to impose 25% tariffs upon Canada, as well as Freeland&#x27;s reported opposition to Trudeau&#x27;s promise of $250 cheques to working Canadians who earned $150,000 or less in 2023. The resignation raised speculation as to the future of Trudeau&#x27;s leadership, with renewed calls for his resignation emerging from Liberal MPs. The government&#x27;s economic statement, released later that day, showed a deficit of $61.9 billion for 2023–24, exceeding the previous target of $40.1 billion or less, and left Trump&#x27;s tariff threats largely unaddressed.

On January 6, 2025, citing that Canada &quot;[deserved] a real choice in the next election&quot;, and that he was facing &quot;internal battles&quot; he felt would be a distraction, Trudeau announced during a news conference at Rideau Cottage that he would tender his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party, and as prime minister of Canada. He also announced that Governor General Mary Simon would prorogue Parliament until March 24, 2025, while the party organizes and holds its next leadership election. Trudeau will continue to serve as prime minister and party leader until the Liberal Party elects its new leader, after which he will resign in favour of his successor. On January 15, 2025, Trudeau subsequently confirmed he will not seek re-election in his riding of Papineau.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Trudeau first met Sophie Grégoire when they were both children growing up in Montreal; Grégoire was a classmate and childhood friend of Trudeau&#x27;s youngest brother, Michel. They reconnected as adults in June 2003, when Grégoire, by then a Quebec television personality, was assigned as Trudeau&#x27;s co-host for a charity ball; they began dating several months later. Trudeau and Grégoire became engaged in October 2004 and married on May 28, 2005, in a ceremony at Montreal&#x27;s Sainte-Madeleine d&#x27;Outremont Church. They have three children: a son, Xavier, a daughter, Ella-Grace, and a second son, Hadrien.

In June 2013, two months after Trudeau became the leader of the Liberal Party, the couple sold their home in the Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal. They began living in a rented home in Ottawa&#x27;s Rockcliffe Park, the neighbourhood near where Trudeau resided as a child during his father&#x27;s time as prime minister.

On August 18, 2014, an intruder broke into the house while Grégoire and the couple&#x27;s three children were sleeping and left a threatening note; however, nothing was stolen and there was no damage to the property. Following the incident, Trudeau, who was in Winnipeg at the time of the break-in, stated his intention to inquire with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about his home security. After his 2015 electoral victory, Trudeau opted to live at Rideau Cottage, on the grounds of Rideau Hall.

On August 2, 2023, Trudeau announced he and Grégoire had separated. On August 21, Trudeau said he was focusing on his children and the future.

===Religion===
Trudeau&#x27;s father was a devout Catholic and his mother converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism just before their wedding. Trudeau himself became a lapsed Catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality and structure of the church. Trudeau described his faith during this period as &quot;like so many Catholics across this country, I said, &#x27;OK, I&#x27;m Catholic, I&#x27;m of faith, but I&#x27;m just not really going to go to church. Maybe on Easter, maybe midnight Mass at Christmas. After the death of his brother Michel in 1998, Trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an Alpha course, during which he regained his faith. In 2011, Trudeau stated, &quot;My own personal faith is an extremely important part of who I am and the values that I try to lead with.&quot;

<text>Defective interfering particles (DIPs), also known as defective interfering viruses, are spontaneously generated virus mutants in which a critical portion of the particle&#x27;s genome has been lost due to defective replication or non-homologous recombination. The mechanism of their formation is presumed to be as a result of template-switching during replication of the viral genome, although non-replicative mechanisms involving direct ligation of genomic RNA fragments have also been proposed. DIPs are derived from and associated with their parent virus, and particles are classed as DIPs if they are rendered non-infectious due to at least one essential gene of the virus being lost or severely damaged as a result of the defection. A DIP can usually still penetrate host cells, but requires another fully functional virus particle (the &#x27;helper&#x27; virus) to co-infect a cell with it, in order to provide the lost factors.

DIPs were first observed as early as the 1950s by Von Magnus and Schlesinger, both working with influenza viruses. However, direct evidence for DIPs was only found in the 1960s by Hackett who noticed presence of ‘stumpy’ particles of vesicular stomatitis virus in electron micrographs and the formalization of DIPs terminology was in 1970 by Huang and Baltimore. DIPs can occur within nearly every class of both DNA and RNA viruses both in clinical and laboratory settings including poliovirus, SARS coronavirus, measles, alphaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus.

==Defection==
DIPs are a naturally occurring phenomenon that can be recreated under experimental conditions in the lab and can also be synthesized for experimental use. They are spontaneously produced by error-prone viral replication, something particularly prevalent in RNA viruses over DNA viruses due to the enzyme used (replicase, or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.) DI genomes typically retain the termini sequences needed for recognition by viral polymerases, and sequences for packaging of their genome into new particles, but little else. The size of the genomic deletion event can vary greatly, with one such example in a DIP derived from rabies virus exhibiting a 6.1 kb deletion. In another example, the size of several DI-DNA plant virus genomes varied from one tenth of the size of the original genome to one half.

==Interference==
The particles are considered interfering when they affect the function of the parent virus through competitive inhibition during coinfection. In other words, defective and non-defective viruses replicate simultaneously, but when defective particles increase, the amount of replicated non-defective virus is decreased. The extent of interference depends on the type and size of defection in the genome; large deletions of genomic data allow rapid replication of the defective genome. In SARS-CoV-2, synthetic DIPs made by removing 90% of the genome replicate three times faster than the virus. During the coinfection of a host cell, a critical ratio will eventually be reached in which more viral factors are being used to produce the non-infectious DIPs than infectious particles. Defective particles and defective genomes have also been demonstrated to stimulate the host innate immune responses and their presence during a viral infection correlates with the strength of the antiviral response. However, in some viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the effect of competitive inhibition by interfering particles reduces viral-mediated innate immune responses and inflammation producing a therapeutic effect.

This interfering nature is becoming more and more important for research on virus therapies. It is thought that because of their specificity, DIPs will be targeted to sites of infection. In one example, scientists have used DIPs to create &quot;protecting viruses&quot;, which attenuated the pathogenicity of an influenza A infection in mice, through inducing an interferon response, to a point that it was no longer lethal. For SARS-CoV-2, the first synthetic DIPs were made in 2020 and the interference effect was used to generate therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs) that reduced pathogenesis and protected hamsters from serious disease.

==Pathogenesis==
DIPs have been shown to play a role in pathogenesis of certain viruses. One study demonstrates the relationship between a pathogen and its defective variant, showing how regulation of DI production allowed the virus to attenuate its own infectious replication, decreasing viral load and thus enhance its parasitic efficiency by preventing the host from dying too fast. This also provides the virus with more time to spread and infect new hosts. DIP generation is regulated within viruses: the Coronavirus SL-III cis-acting replication element (shown in the image) is a higher-order genomic structure implicated in the mediation of DIP production in bovine coronavirus, with apparent homologs detected in other coronavirus groups. A more in-depth introduction can be found in Alice Huang and David Baltimore&#x27;s work from 1970.

==Types of defective RNA genomes==

# Deletions defections are when a fragment of the template is skipped. Examples of this type of defection can be found in tomato spotted wilt virus and Flock House virus.
# Snapbacks defections are when replicase transcribes part of one strand then uses this new strand as a template. The result of this can produce a hairpin. Snapback defections have been observed in vesicular stomatitis virus.
# Panhandle defections are when the polymerase carries a partially made strand and then switches back to transcribe the 5&#x27; end, forming the panhandle shape. Panhandle defections are found in influenza viruses.
# Compound defections are when both a deletion and snapback defection happens together.
# Mosaic or complex DI genome, in which the various regions may come from the same helper virus genome but in the wrong order; from different helper genome segments, or could include segments of host RNA. Duplications may also occur.

==Research==
Research has been conducted by virologists to learn more about the interference in infection of host cells and how DI genomes could potentially work as immunostimulatory antiviral agents. Another branch of research has pursued the concept of engineering DIPs into antiviral therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs), a purely theoretical concept until recently. A 2014 article describes the pre-clinical work to test the immunostimulatory effectiveness of a DIP against influenza viruses by inducing the innate antiviral immune responses (i.e., interferon). Subsequent work tested the pre-clinical efficacy of TIPs against HIV and SARS-CoV-2. DI-RNAs have also been found to aid in the infection of fungi via viruses of the family &quot;Partitiviridae&quot; for the first time, which makes room for more interdisciplinary work.

Several tools as ViReMa and DI-tector have been developed to help to detect defective viral genomes in next-generation sequencing data and high-throughput approaches, such as random-deletion library sequencing (RanDeL-Seq), allow rational mapping of the viral genetic elements that are required for DI-particle propagation.

<text>The red-chested swallow (Hirundo lucida) is a small non-migratory passerine bird found in West Africa, the Congo Basin and Ethiopia. It has a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the closely resembling barn swallow. However, the adult red-chested swallow differs in being slightly smaller than its migratory relative, in addition to having a narrower blue breast band and shorter tail streamers. Juveniles are more comparable to barn swallow chicks.

<text>Tyco International was a security systems company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland, with operational headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey, United States (Tyco International (US) Inc.). Tyco International was composed of two major business segments: security solutions and fire protection.

On January 25, 2016, Johnson Controls announced it would merge with Tyco, and all businesses of Tyco and Johnson Controls would be combined under Tyco International plc, to be renamed as Johnson Controls International plc. The merger was completed on September 9, 2016.

==Timeline==

===1960s===

Founded by Arthur J. Rosenberg in 1960, Tyco, Inc. was formed as an investment and holding company with two segments: Tyco Semiconductors and The Materials Research Laboratory. In the first two years of operation, the company focused primarily on governmental research and military experiments in the private sector.

In 1962, the business was incorporated in Massachusetts and refocused on high-tech materials science and energy conservation products. Two years later in 1964, the company went public and began to fill gaps in its development and distribution network by acquiring Mule Battery Products, the first of Tyco&#x27;s 16 acquisitions in the next four years.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, Tyco boomed, beginning the decade with consolidated sales and stockholder equity reaching $34 million and $15 million, respectively.

In 1974, Tyco was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

By the end of the decade, Tyco had a larger and more diverse corporation with sales topping $500 million and a net worth of nearly $140 million. Tyco&#x27;s success was largely attributed to ambitious acquisitions of Simplex Technology, Grinnell Fire Protection Systems, Armin Plastics and the Ludlow Corporation.

===1980s===

Following aggressive acquisition period through the 1970s, Tyco management focused the early 1980s on organizing its newly acquired subsidiaries. Tyco divided the company into three business segments, Fire Protection, Electronics, and Packaging, and implemented strategies to achieve significant market share in each of Tyco&#x27;s product lines.

Once organized, Tyco returned to the strategy of growth by acquisition in the later part of the decade acquiring Grinnell Corporation, Allied Tube and Conduit, and the Mueller Company. Tyco then again reorganized its subsidiaries into four segments: Electrical and Electronic Components, Healthcare and Specialty Products, Fire and Security Services and Flow Control. This reorganization remained in place until 2007 when current CEO Ed Breen spun off the Electrical and Healthcare segments to create three publicly independent companies.

===1990s===

In 1992, Dennis Kozlowski became CEO of Tyco International, and, for the next several years, the company again adopted an aggressive acquisition strategy, eventually acquiring (by some accounts) over 3,000 other companies between 1991 and 2001.

Major acquisitions in the 1990s included: Wormald International Limited, Neotecha, Hindle/Winn, Classic Medical, Uni-Patch, Promeon, Preferred Pipe, Kendall International Co., Tectron Tube, Unistrut, Earth Technology Corporation, Professional Medical Products, Inc., Thorn Security, Carlisle, Watts Waterworks Businesses, Sempell, ElectroStar, American Pipe &amp; Tube, Submarine Systems Inc., Keystone, INBRAND, Sherwood Davis &amp; Geck, United States Surgical, Wells Fargo Alarm, AMP, Raychem, Glynwed, Temasa and Central Sprinkler designs.

To reflect Tyco&#x27;s global presence following the abundant acquisitions, the company&#x27;s name was changed from Tyco Laboratories, Inc. to Tyco International Ltd. in 1993. In addition, Tyco launched The Pipeline, an internal employee newsletter; the title was later changed to Tyco World. Its final issue was published in April–May 2006.

In 1996, Tyco was added to the Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s S&amp;P 500 Composite Index, which consists of the 500 publicly traded companies in the United States with the largest market capitalization.

In 1997, Tyco acquired AT&amp;T Submarine Systems, gaining research and development and fleet assets, along with the manufacturing capability to produce repeaters and transmission equipment. These additional capabilities, combined with cable manufacturing at Tyco Integrated Cables Systems in Newington, New Hampshire, established Tyco Telecommunications as the world&#x27;s first vertically integrated global optical network supplier, capable of developing the technology and manufacturing the components, to designing, building and maintaining systems.

In July 1997, Tyco merged by reverse takeover with a smaller publicly traded security services company named ADT Limited, controlled by Michael Ashcroft. As part of the deal, Tyco International Ltd. of Massachusetts became a wholly owned subsidiary of ADT Limited, and simultaneously ADT changed its name to Tyco International Ltd., retaining the former Tyco stock symbol, TYC. The merger moved Tyco&#x27;s incorporation to Bermuda, a tax haven, where it was headquartered in the colonial capital of Hamilton. A new subsidiary named ADT Security Systems was also formed out of the merger, and later changed its name to ADT Security Services.

In 1999, Tyco acquired two S&amp;P 500 companies in a buyout. They acquired the electronics connector manufacturer AMP Inc., for $12.22 billion and a materials science company, Raychem Corp., for $1.4 billion.

=== 2000s ===

====2000–2001====

Tyco&#x27;s aggressive acquisition strategy continued into the early 2000s, with the purchases of General Surgical Innovations, Siemens Electromechanical Components, AFC Cable and Praegitzer. The additions gave Tyco an ending fiscal 2000 year revenue exceeding $28 billion, nearly $2 billion coming from the sale by a subsidiary of its common shares.

In the fiscal 2000 year, Tyco acquired Mallinckrodt Inc, a subsidiary of United States Surgical Corporation and Simplex Time Recorder Company which it merged in January 2002 with Grinnell Fire Protection to form an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, SimplexGrinnell LP, the world&#x27;s largest fire protection company. For the year ended September 2000, the company&#x27;s book value exceeded $141 billion. However, the company more than doubled its long-term debt, by over $80 billion.
&quot;Mallinckrodt US LLC, is completely separate from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. Mallinckrodt US LLC is a subsidiary of United States Surgical Corporation, and an affiliate of Medtronic plc, the ultimate parent company of both entities&quot;.

In October 2001, the Engineered Products and Services segment acquired Century Tube Corp, and followed it by buying Water &amp; Power Technologies in November 2001. The following November, the Tyco Electronics segment acquired Transpower Technologies. The next month, the Plastics and Adhesives segment acquired LINQ Industrial Fabrics, Inc.

====Early 2002====
With complexity growing within Tyco&#x27;s subsidiaries, in January 2002, Tyco announced a plan to split the business into four separate companies. However, this plan was abandoned after a downgrade in its credit rating and a significant drop in its stock price.

Later that month, Tyco&#x27;s acquisitions continued throughout all of its segments: the Electronics segment acquired Communications Instruments, Inc. The Healthcare segment bought Paragon Trade Brands. The Engineered Products and Services segment acquired Clean Air Systems. And the Fire and Security segment of Tyco acquired SBC/Smith Alarm Systems, DSC Group, and Sensormatic Electronics Corp.

For all the acquisitions Tyco made in 2002, the company also incurred extensive losses. During the first quarter of 2002, following the recession of the previous year, the electronics segment recorded a charge of over $2 billion, related to massive overcapacity of fiber-optic cable, which in turn affected the in-process buildout of Tyco&#x27;s global undersea fiber-optic network, known as Tyco Global Network (TGN). TGN generated a loss for fiscal 2002 of over $3 billion, with a restructuring charge of over $500 million. Construction of TGN was eventually completed in 2003.

The electronics segment also recorded over $1 billion in restructuring charges in 2002 from inventory write-down and facility closures. In addition, 2002 struck Tyco with two goodwill impairments, the first for over $500 million in the second quarter, due to their fiber-cable overcapacity issue and other corporate problems. The second, costing the electronics segment $250 million related to sales issues in Power Systems, Electrical Contracting Services, and the Printed Circuit Group. To make Tyco&#x27;s financial matters worse, the company lost over a quarter of $1 billion in investment during 2002 in FLAG Telecom Holdings Ltd.

In an effort to cut losses, on July 8, 2002, Tyco divested its Tyco Capital business through an initial public offering, with the sale of 100% of the common shares in CIT Group. It recorded the CIT divestment as discontinued operations for 2002, taking a $6 billion loss, and as an almost $7 billion impairment charge. That month, the Tyco Healthcare segment also divested Surgical Dynamics, Inc.

For the year ended September 2002, Tyco revenue rose to nearly $35 billion. However, it suffered more than a $9 billion loss that year, which included the asset impairment write-down of TGN by over $3 billion, losses of nearly $2 billion for the two restructuring charges, and over $1 billion from the two goodwill impairment charges. In all, the net charges totaled nearly $7 billion of the loss that year. The stock price plummeted.

To add to the financial woes of the company, midway through the fiscal 2002 year, Tyco became embroiled in a massive scandal involving the excesses by its former chairman and CEO, L. Dennis Kozlowski, and his senior management team. Kozlowski resigned and former Tyco CEO John F. Fort became interim CEO until the board of directors completed a search for a permanent replacement. Early 2002, Tyco was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by nondisclosure of major financial information and artificially inflating its earnings. On June 17, 2002, Tyco filed federal suit against Mark H. Swartz, Tyco&#x27;s former executive vice president and chief corporate counsel, and Frank E. Walsh, a former director.

====Late 2002====
In July 2002, Edward D. Breen was appointed president, CEO, and chairman of Tyco for an initial three-year term. Breen had previously been president and COO of Motorola since his promotion at that company in January 2002.

Breen made an immediate impact on Tyco by gutting the existing board of directors and leadership team that worked with Kozlowski and replacing them with a new set of managers. One month after his appointment, Tyco announced the appointment of John Krol as lead director of the board of directors with the priority of improving Tyco&#x27;s corporate governance.

Breen made additional changes, appointing David FitzPatrick as Executive Vice President and CFO, William Lytton, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Eric Pillmore as Senior Vice President of Corporate Governance.

With a new management team in place, Tyco began a two-phase internal investigation of former CEO Kozlowski. The investigation led to Tyco filing two federal lawsuits. On September 12 and December 6, 2002, Tyco filed a federal suit against Kozlowski and an arbitration claim against former CFO and director, Mark H. Swartz. Swartz, however, failed to submit to the American Arbitration Association and Tyco followed with a federal suit against him.

At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Dennis Kozlowski, Mark H. Swartz and chief legal officer Mark A. Belnick.

On November 27, 2002, the State of New Jersey took action in the scandal, filing a federal suit against Tyco and former personnel, with charges in part of violating the New Jersey Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute, stemming from the Kozlowski scandal.

As a result of the scandal, Tyco and some former directors and officers were named as defendants in more than two dozen securities class-action lawsuits. Most of the cases were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and filed by court-appointed lead plaintiffs on January 28, 2003, as the case In Re Tyco International Securities Litigation, citing causes of action under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That March 31, Tyco made a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part over a year later, on October 14, 2004.

====2003====
On February 3, 2003, the scandal continued to play out in the courts, Tyco and more personnel were again named as defendants in an amended consolidated class-action federal suit brought on behalf of retirees in its Retirement Savings and Investment Plans, citing causes under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. On December 2, 2004, the New Hampshire court granted in part Tyco&#x27;s motion to dismiss.

Removed from the scandal, Tyco made internal moves within the company in 2003 forming its Plastics &amp; Adhesives business segment, a former piece of the Healthcare &amp; Specialty Products segment. Other changes came in Tyco&#x27;s corporate governance: Tyco&#x27;s board re-elected John Krol as lead director, Tyco reorganized the assignments of the board&#x27;s committee, adopted a new board of governance principles and new Delegation of Authority policy which strengthened control over cash disbursements within the company. 

The final improvement on corporate governance came in the Guide to Ethical Conduct. The guide was produced to advise employees as to correct procedures and warn of unethical practices and behavior. All Tyco employees are now required to take a brief ethics course and sign an annual ethics statement.

====2004====
In an effort to enhance consumer awareness and revive corporate image, in June 2004, Tyco launched a new global print-advertising campaign, &quot;Tyco a vital part of your world.&quot; Tyco also began a divestiture program following a review of its core businesses. Part of the plan was to sell TGN, which by then had been entirely written off in value. Agreement for the sale was reached in November.

In the second quarter of 2004, ADT Security sold off Sonitrol.

In all, within its divestiture program, by fiscal year end of 2004, Tyco had divested 21 businesses and liquidated four non-core businesses, primarily within the Fire and Security segment.

In September 2004, Tyco also divested Electrical Contracting Services from the electronics segment, due to a decrease in sales. After September 30, Tyco divested an additional seven non-core businesses, bringing the program aggregate proceeds up to $500 million that year.

By the end of 2004, Tyco employed under 260,000 people, with two-thirds outside the United States. Revenue was up strongly, to over $40 billion for the first time. Once again the strengthening euro against the dollar helped Tyco, accounting primarily for $1.5 billion of the increase in revenue. Various charges, losses, and debt repayment totaled nearly $1 billion in 2004, however, profitability tripled that year to almost $3 billion.

====2005====
Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), India acquired the Tyco Global Network (TGN) from Tyco International for $130 million. The chief stockholder in VSNL is India&#x27;s Tata Group, also one of India&#x27;s largest conglomerates. It was once valued at $3 billion during the telecommunications bubble.

Tyco continued its divestiture program throughout 2005. The largest divestiture came in the announcement of a definitive agreement to sell its Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses to an affiliate of private investment firm Apollo Management, L.P. Tyco believed the segment no longer fit within the company&#x27;s portfolio.

Tyco was awarded the largest statewide public safety communications project in the United States in 2004 when one of Tyco Electronics&#x27; businesses, M/A-COM Technology Solutions, signed a contract to maintain New York&#x27;s Statewide Wireless Network (SWN). The contract was worth approximately $2 billion and would last for 20 years.

Tyco also acquired two key companies to its Healthcare segment, Vivant Medical Inc. and Floréane Medical Implants.

====2006–2007====

On February 16, 2006, a group of institutional investors, part of an existing lawsuit against Tyco International, sued the company to stop its proposed breakup plan.

By the end of the fiscal year 2006, Tyco&#x27;s revenue had eclipsed $17 billion. Despite the strong cash flow, growing revenue and decreased debt, Tyco and its board of directors approved a plan to separate Tyco into three publicly independent companies. Tyco believed that this would allow for each segment to perform better within its particular market and create more value for its shareholders.

The separation was completed in July 2007, when Tyco separated into three publicly independent companies:
*Covidien Ltd. (formerly Tyco Healthcare)
*Tyco Electronics Ltd. (now TE Connectivity)
*Tyco International Ltd. (formerly Tyco Fire &amp; Security and Tyco Engineered Products &amp; Services (TFS/TEPS))

Following the separation, chairman and CEO Ed Breen remained at the head of Tyco International, which was then composed of five major business segments: ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services, Safety Products, Flow Control and Electrical and Metal Products. The company generated revenue of $18.8 billion in 2007, and employed 118,000 people across all 50 states and in more than 60 countries.

===2010s===

==== 2010 ====
Tyco filed against Kozlowski, asserting that the $500 million in compensation and benefits he received during his time of disloyalty, between 1997 and 2002, were forfeit under New York&#x27;s &quot;faithless servant&quot; doctrine. Southern District of New York Judge Thomas Griesa concluded in 2010 that under the faithless servant doctrine, Kozlowski must forfeit all compensation and benefits he earned during his period of disloyalty.

====2011–2012====

Tyco International announced in January 2011 that it was acquiring Brink&#x27;s Home Security Holdings (operating as Broadview Security) in a transaction valued at $2.0 billion. It was reported that Broadview Security would merge into Tyco&#x27;s ADT Security Services division.

 In 2011, Tyco acquired Visonic, a developer and manufacturer of home security alarm systems and components, for $100 million. Visonic was established in 1973 by the brothers Moshe and Yaacov Kotlicki. Visonic had an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 2004 with a valuation of $65 million and removed in 2010 from the LSE. In June 2006, Visonic shares were traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

In September 2011, Tyco International&#x27;s directors announced plans to split the company once again, separating the company&#x27;s Flow Control business, North America&#x27;s residential security business and its international fire and security business in a plan that Chief Executive Ed Breen described as: &quot;the best path to create long-term shareholder value.&quot;

The separation was completed on October 1, 2012, resulting in the following companies being created:
* Tyco: focused on fire protection and electronic security products, installation and services worldwide.
* The ADT Corporation in North America: focused on residential and small business security installation and services in North America.
* Flow Control: focused on water and fluid solutions, valves and controls, and equipment protection products worldwide. This business merged with Pentair Inc. and was part of Pentair Valve and Controls business in 2012. This Pentair division was then acquired by Emerson Electric in 2017.

Tyco retained use of the ADT brand for security installation and services outside of North America. ADT&#x27;s commercial security installation and services business in North America was rebranded and became Tyco Integrated Security. Tyco had over 70,000 employees worldwide, operating in nearly 50 countries and serving over three million customers.

In September 2012, Tyco was accused of violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and agreed to a payment of around $13 million in civil penalties to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

====2013====
In November 2013, Tyco approached various private equity firms offering to sell its Korean security unit, Caps Co.

====2014====
In February 2014, US private equity firm Carlyle Group entered into talks with Tyco to acquire its South Korean security systems unit, valued at around $2 billion.

In 2014, Tyco International sold its New Zealand based security company Armourguard Security limited to Evergreen International, The cost of the sale is yet to be released.

====2016====
On January 25, 2016, Johnson Controls announced it would merge with Tyco, and all businesses of Tyco and Johnson Controls would be combined under Tyco International plc, to be renamed as Johnson Controls International plc. The merger was completed on September 9, 2016.

==Corporate scandal of 2002==
Former chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than US$150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation.

During jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an &quot;okay&quot; sign on the table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a mistrial on April 4, 2004.

On June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski and Swartz were each sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Then in May 2007, New Hampshire Federal District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by Grant &amp; Eisenhofer P.A., Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz &amp; Kessler, and Milberg Weiss &amp; Bershad.

On January 17, 2014, Kozlowski was granted parole from Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City.

== Environmental record ==

Due to the Clean Air Act (CAA), Tyco International (US) Inc. was fined over $1.1 million for its previous metal forming and finishing facility in Hamburg, New Jersey because it failed to comply with requirements under CAA regulations. The facility, which Tyco operated from 1963 to 2000, operated trichloroethylene to degrease chromium to metal parts, which are among some of the most toxic, dangerous air pollutants that could cause serious health effects.

In regards to the Clean Water Act, a health and safety manager from Enfield, Connecticut, was sentenced guilty on August 5, 2002, for deliberately routing wastewater produced in one of Tyco&#x27;s manufacturing facilities around a sand filter; it was supposed to remove impurities from the wastewater before discharging into the Manchester sewers. The company used this bypass in order to accelerate production and lessen use of the waste treatment system. However, the wastewater discharged from the factory exceeded the levels of copper and lead, which were both toxic metals and could have led to harmful effects if passed through sewage treatment plants.

Tyco Printed Circuit Group (TPCG) of Stamford, Connecticut, was sentenced on 12 counts of violating the Clean Water Act in August 2004. The plea agreement called for TPCG to pay a total of $10 million in fines. Of that amount, $6 million was paid as a federal criminal fine; $2.7 million went to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection&#x27;s (DEP) natural resources fund; the Towns of Stafford and Manchester received $500,000 each to fund improvements in their sewer and water treatment system; and $300,000 was paid for recycling deionized and other wastewater at the company&#x27;s Stafford, Staffordville facilities. Between 1999 and June 2001, TPCG managers at the company&#x27;s Stafford, Staffordville and Manchester facilities engaged in a variety of practices that caused the facilities to discharge wastewater with higher than permitted levels of pollutants into municipal sewage treatment systems. The illegal practices included, but were not limited to, diluting potentially non-compliant wastewater samples, discarding samples with excessive levels of toxic metals, and omitting samples that were not in compliance for pH. Daniel R. Callahan, the former Director of Environmental Health and Safety of Stafford Division of Tyco Printed Circuit Group, pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Water Act on November 17, 2003. Callahan falsified reports submitted to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The reports failed to include the fact that a &quot;batch tank&quot; had been discharged into the Manchester public sewer system. Tyco&#x27;s DEP permit required that all discharges into public sewer systems be reported. Tyco was 41st on the 2002 Political Economy Research Institute&#x27;s (PERI) Toxic 100.

When Tyco acquired Ansul, it also became responsible for the arsenic salt contamination to their local environment.

==Restatement==
On June 26, 2000, the company restated some figures in 1999 annual report to shareholders.
On October 18, 2001, the company adopted the provisions of SAB 101, related to revenue recognition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, results in the first three quarters of fiscal 2001 be restated.
On October 24, 2002, the company restated its earnings for earlier in the year 2002 because of questions raised in an internal audit over it how it accounted for dealer fees involving its ADT home security systems business.
On June 16, 2003, the company restated several years of financial results in connection with securities regulators&#x27; previously announced review of its filings.

<text>Keith Williams MRIAI FRSA (born 21 April 1958) is a British architect and founder of London-based Keith Williams Architects.

Keith Williams was born in Kent. His father was an electrical design engineer chiefly working on the upgrade of the National Grid and latterly in the North Sea oil industry, whilst his mother was a librarian. His younger brother Martin Williams is also an architect.

==Education and Career==
When he was 5 years old, the family moved to Surrey. Keith was then educated at Kingston Grammar School before going on to study architecture at Kingston and then Greenwich Schools of Architecture.

In 1984, he became a chartered architect and a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He worked for Sheppard Robson and then Sir Terry Farrell at Farrells, before co-founding Pawson Williams Architects in 1987 with fellow architect Terry Pawson, whom he had known since student days at Kingston.

In 2001 he split from Pawson and established his own independent architectural firm, Keith Williams Architects operating as its founder and director of design.

He became a member of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland in 2005 and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 2007. 

From 2008, he served as a National Design Review Panel for the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) until 2010 when it became Design Council CABE. He remained an active participant until 2020 when he stood down.

In 2011, he joined the National Panel of the Civic Trust Awards operating as its chair from 2015 to 2023.

From 2013, he has chaired the Lewisham Design Review Panel, and since 2014, has operated as a Panel Chair for Design South East.

In 2016 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

He joined Docomomo UK in March 2024 as a trustee, becoming Chair of the Board of Trustees in July the same year.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C467/136) with Keith Williams in 2017-2019 for its Architects&#x27; Lives collection.

The family was attending the 1973 Christmas midnight mass at Mount Carmel Roman Catholic Church when Margaret Trudeau went into labour and was rushed to The Ottawa Hospital. His mother struggled with severe postpartum depression after his birth, and was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He was given the nickname &quot;Sacha&quot; (the French spelling of the Russian diminutive for Alexander) in recognition of his father&#x27;s love of Russian literature and culture; the name also is linked to former ambassador of the USSR to Canada and Trudeau family friend Alexander Yakovlev. Alexandre Trudeau&#x27;s younger brother, Michel, was born in 1975. All three of Pierre and Margaret Trudeau&#x27;s children became media sensations from birth.

When talking about her sons each having distinctly different personalities, in an interview in 1977, Margaret Trudeau said, &quot;Justin, 6, is a prince – a very good little boy. Sacha, born Christmas Day, 1973, is a bit of a revolutionary, very determined and strong willed. Miche (Michel) is a happy, well-adjusted child, who combined the best traits of both brothers.&quot;

His parents announced they would separate in 1977. His mother, unbeknownst to the public, then lived in an attic suite within the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence at 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa for the next three years, so as to make the adjustment easier on the children. After the divorce was finalized on April 2, 1984, he and his brothers attended the civil ceremony in which Margaret Trudeau remarried to Ottawa real estate developer Fried Kemper on April 18, 1984. A half-brother, Kyle Kemper (born 1984), and a half-sister, Alicia Kemper (born 1988), soon followed. Pierre and Margaret Trudeau tried as much as possible to protect their children from the public eye, and following Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s retirement as Prime Minister in 1984, he raised them in relative privacy in Montreal. Alexandre Trudeau gained another half-sister, Sarah Coyne (born 1991), from his father&#x27;s relationship with Canadian politician Deborah Coyne.

Like his father and brothers, Alexandre Trudeau studied at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. He graduated with a B.A. in philosophy and a Masters in architecture from McGill University. While attending McGill, he joined the Canadian Forces as a Reserve Entry Scheme Officer with Royal Canadian Hussars reserve regiment in 1996. He trained at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, but released voluntarily before completing his training as an armoured officer. Following graduation, he traveled to West Africa to produce his first documentary: &quot;Liberia, the Secret War&quot; (1998). In the same year in which the documentary was made, his brother Michel died in an avalanche that pushed him into British Columbia&#x27;s Kokanee Lake, where he drowned.

When Pierre Trudeau died in 2000, both his surviving sons returned to the public eye. Although Alexandre Trudeau was visibly more reserved and quieter than his brother, his heightened public profile brought new attention to his work as a journalist. After Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s death, Alexandre continued to live in his father&#x27;s Art Deco home (Cormier House) in Montreal.

==Work==

In the years following his father&#x27;s death, Trudeau produced documentaries for Canadian television. In 2003, he was one of the highest-profile Canadian journalists covering the 2003 invasion of Iraq, producing a documentary film for the CTV program W5, &quot;Embedded In Baghdad&quot;. His 2004 film, &quot;The Fence&quot;, shot in Afula, Israel and Jenin of the Palestinian territories draws up a portrait of families on either side of the Israeli-built security barrier around the West bank.

In June 2005, Trudeau focused attention on what he said were the implications for civil liberties in the Canadian government&#x27;s use of security certificates to detain indefinitely, without trial, suspected terrorists based on secret evidence. Trudeau offered to be a surety for Hassan Almrei, a Syrian refugee held in a Canadian jail for four years without any charges being laid. His appearance in court in support of Almrei resulted in front-page coverage in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;National Post&quot; and major media attention being given to the security certificate issue for the first time. Trudeau&#x27;s efforts were chronicled in his documentary &quot;Secure Freedom&quot;. Almrei was ordered released under house arrest by a Federal Court judge on January 2, 2009. On December 14, 2009, Almrei was released.

Known for his staunchly anti-imperialist views, Trudeau attracted controversy in August 2006 for an article he penned praising Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba. Trudeau&#x27;s documentary &quot;Refuge&quot;, produced in 2008, tells the story of the humanitarian crisis facing Africa&#x27;s Darfur region and eastern Chad. In 2012, he produced the film &quot;The New Great Game&quot;, for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about the maritime geopolitics of the Middle-East and Western Indian Ocean.

In 2016, Trudeau published his first book with Harper Collins, &quot;Barbarian Lost, Travels in the New China&quot;, a number one Canadian best-seller. The book is a travel mémoire with an undercurrent of philosophical and historical reflection. It paints a personal and nuanced portrait of an ancient country in the throes of massive change. About the book, Trudeau is quoted as saying: &quot;My whole professional career has had a focus on geopolitics, and in this age, you cannot understand the world without understanding the massive role that China has grown to play.&quot;

In 2018, Trudeau presented his first scripted work, the short film &quot;Wiisgaapte&quot; (Bitter Smoke). A product of a collaboration with Dr Shirley Williams, an Ojibwe language specialist, the film’s dialogue is entirely in old Ojibwe dialect and tells the story of the windigo legend of Algonquian lore.

==Public life==
Currently, Trudeau is President and Chief Producer at Same Adventure Productions. He and wife Zoë Bedos are the parents of a son, Pierre-Emmanuel, and two daughters, Gala Simone and Ariane Lea. He is a founding member of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation for excellence in social sciences and humanities research and innovation.

<text>CITY-DT (channel 57), branded as Citytv Toronto or simply Citytv, is a television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, serving as the flagship station of the Citytv network. It is owned and operated by network parent Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside Omni Television outlets CFMT-DT (channel 47) and CJMT-DT (channel 40). The stations share studios at 33 Dundas Street East on Yonge–Dundas Square in downtown Toronto, while CITY-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.

The station went on the air on September 28, 1972, by a consortium led by Phyllis Switzer, Moses Znaimer, Jerry Grafstein and Edgar Cowan, as CITY-TV, branded &quot;Citytv&quot; on Queen Street. In 1981, the station was sold to CHUM Limited, who retained Znaimer as an executive and moved to its 299 Queen Street West studios in 1987. For the majority of its early life, CITY-TV operated as an independent station, best known for its unconventional approaches to news and other locally produced programming. After having used syndication to bring its original programming to other Canadian markets, CHUM later used CITY-TV as the basis and flagship station of a television system, acquiring and establishing new stations under the Citytv name.

In 2006, CTVglobemedia announced its intent to acquire CHUM Limited, but was required to divest stations due to conflicts with CTV stations it already owned in Citytv&#x27;s markets. CTV chose to keep the stations of CHUM&#x27;s secondary A-Channel system, as well as CITY-TV&#x27;s sister news channel CP24 and its other cable channels MuchMusic, but divested CITY-TV and its sister stations to Rogers Media. Under Rogers ownership, CITY-TV&#x27;s programming became more conventional in nature.

==History==

The station first signed on the air on September 28, 1972, broadcasting on UHF channel 79, an allocation given to the station as all of the VHF licences in the Toronto area were taken by other parties. It operated as an independent station, and its transmitter operated at an effective radiated power of 31kW. The founding ownership group Channel Seventy-Nine Ltd. consisted of – among others – Phyllis Switzer, Moses Znaimer, Jerry Grafstein and Edgar Cowan. The four principal owners raised over $2 million to help start up the station, with Grafstein raising about 50% of the required funds, Znaimer raising around 25%, and the remainder being accrued by Switzer and Cowan. The channel 79 licence was granted to the company on November 25, 1971. The station operated from studio facilities located at 99 Queen Street East, near Church Street, at the former Electric Circus nightclub.

The station lost money early on, and was in debt by 1975. Multiple Access Ltd. (the owners of CFCF-TV in Montreal) purchased a 45% interest in the station, and sold its stake to CHUM Limited three years later. CITY was purchased outright by CHUM in 1981 with the sale of Moses Znaimer&#x27;s interest in the station. Znaimer remained with the station as an executive until 2003, when he retired from his management role but continued to work with the station on some production projects.

In 1976, the station&#x27;s main transmitter began broadcasting at 208 kW from the CN Tower. The station switched channel allocations on July 1, 1983, moving to UHF channel 57, the result of Industry Canada&#x27;s decision to reassign frequencies corresponding to high-band UHF channels 70 to 83 to the new AMPS mobile phone systems as a result of a CCIR international convention in 1982. On September 1, 1986, a rebroadcast transmitter was put into operation in Woodstock (CITY-TV-2 on channel 31, which also served nearby London); another transmitter was set up in Ottawa in 1996 (CITY-TV-3 on channel 65).
In May 1987, CITY and the other CHUM-owned television properties moved their operations to the company&#x27;s headquarters at 299 Queen Street West, which became one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. On March 30, 1998, CHUM launched CablePulse 24 (CP24), a local cable news channel whose programming used anchors from and featured reports filed by CITY-TV&#x27;s news staff, rebroadcasts of the station&#x27;s &quot;CityPulse&quot; newscasts and select programming from CITY and other CHUM stations.

Despite efforts to extend the brand to other major markets, for 30 years, CITY was the only Canadian station to identify on-air as &quot;Citytv&quot; – with &quot;Citytv&quot; and &quot;CITY&quot; serving as interchangeable names for the station. In July 2001, however, CHUM purchased CKVU-TV in Vancouver from Canwest Global Communications; CKVU changed its branding to &quot;Citytv&quot; in July 2002, making Citytv a two-station system. In 2005, three more Citytv stations were added in Calgary (CKAL-TV), Edmonton (CKEM-TV) and Winnipeg (CHMI-TV) after CHUM purchased the A-Channel television stations and other assets owned by Craig Media (the existing A-Channel brand was revamped and was transferred to CHUM&#x27;s former NewNet stations). When the three A-Channel stations switched to the Citytv brand on August 2, 2005, the flagship &quot;CityPulse&quot; newscast was renamed &quot;CityNews&quot;.

===Sale to Rogers Media===
On July 12, 2006, CTVglobemedia announced its offer to acquire CHUM Limited and its assets, including the Citytv stations, and related cable properties for $1.7 billion. Since CTV already owned television stations in all Citytv markets (including Toronto, where CTV owns and operates CFTO-TV, channel 9), the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) stipulated the sale of the Citytv stations as a condition for the approval of the CHUM purchase. The Citytv stations (including CITY) were subsequently sold to Rogers Communications: the sale was approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007, and Rogers took ownership on October 31. CTV kept ownership of 299 Queen Street West, where CHUM&#x27;s specialty television channels now owned by CTV (such as CP24, MuchMusic, Star!, Bravo! and Space) would remain. As such, Rogers had to find a new home for CITY-TV&#x27;s operations. Rogers subsequently purchased 33 Dundas Street East, the former Olympic Spirit building located at the edge of Dundas Square, to house the operations of its Toronto television stations; CITY-TV moved into the new facility on September 8, 2009.

The Citytv system expanded into Western Canada in 2009 when the Jim Pattison Group signed a deal to carry the system&#x27;s programming on its stations in Kamloops (CFJC-TV), Prince George (CKPG-TV) and Medicine Hat (CHAT-TV); Rogers signed a long-term affiliation renewal agreement for the Pattison stations in September 2012. Rogers gained two more outlets in a cable-only channel in Saskatchewan (Citytv Saskatchewan) and a station in Montreal (CJNT-DT) to broaden and expand its national coverage beginning in 2013, effectively transforming City from a television system to a television network.

On October 3, 2011, Rogers Media launched the CityNews Channel, a 24-hour regional news channel for the Toronto area utilizing the resources of CITY-DT&#x27;s news department, and other Rogers-owned news and media properties such as all-news radio station CFTR (680 AM) and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. The channel used the same news wheel format as CFTR with traffic and weather reports at the top and bottom of every hour, sports news at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour and business news at 26 and 56 minutes past the hour. In addition to rolling news programming, CityNews Channel aired simulcasts of Citytv Toronto&#x27;s news programming, and an audio feed from CFTR during the overnight hours. Due to financial difficulties, Rogers ceased CityNews Channel&#x27;s live broadcasts on May 30, 2013, with the channel permanently shutting down on June 30, 2013.

Citytv Toronto celebrated its 50th anniversary on September 28, 2022, the day the station first went on the air.

==Programming==
CITY-TV and the Citytv system/network has traditionally pursued a programming strategy targeting hip, young and urban audiences, and featured science fiction series (such as the &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchises) with significant cult followings. The Citytv system has also sometimes aired more adult-oriented fare than most television stations, including the softcore film showcase &quot;The Baby Blue Movie&quot; and the television edition of &quot;Naked News&quot;, both of which were shown very late at night. CITY also aired &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; from its debut in 1986 until the start of the 1992–93 season, when the show&#x27;s broadcast rights were purchased by CTV and its local affiliate CFTO-TV, which aired the talk show until it ended its run in 2011. Shortly after its takeover by Rogers, Citytv&#x27;s long-running &quot;Great Movies&quot; block was cancelled in favour of running more series. Late night reruns of the &quot;Great Movies&quot; block were replaced by infomercials.

The station has also produced much more local programming than most other Canadian television stations, including the daily talk show &quot;CityLine&quot; (hosted first by Dini Petty, then Marilyn Denis, and now Tracy Moore); magazine series such as &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, &quot;Toronto Rocks&quot;, &quot;FashionTelevision&quot;, &quot;Life on Venus Ave.&quot; and &quot;MovieTelevision&quot;; and interactive series such as &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot;. As well, the station often pursued synergies with its sister cable networks, sharing programming with MuchMusic, Bravo!, Space and CP24. The station also produced the &quot;Citytv New Year&#x27;s Eve Bash&quot;, a live concert special from Nathan Phillips Square – although it still sponsored (and aired some coverage of) the event, it was replaced on-air with &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; in simulcast with ABC for 2013–14.

=== Sports programming ===
On March 2, 2008, CITY aired its first Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball game, a spring training game against the Cincinnati Reds (both Citytv and the Blue Jays are owned by Rogers Media). This is not the first time that a live sporting event has aired on a Citytv station, it also served as the Canadian broadcaster for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; along with CBC until its American rights moved from ABC to ESPN, and in Canada to TSN, in 2006. Beginning with the 2007 NFL season as part of Rogers Media&#x27;s broadcast rights with the NFL; two late season games were shown by CITY and Vancouver sister station CKVU-TV weekly, the opposite games aired regionally on their respective Sportsnet feed. In 2008, CITY aired the pre-season games of the Buffalo Bills, which included a game played at Rogers Centre as part of the Bills Toronto Series. From 2014 until 2017 (when this portion of the package was acquired by TSN and CTV Two), it also aired &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games in simulcast with CBS.

Under Sportsnet&#x27;s television deal with the National Hockey League beginning in the 2014–15 NHL season, the station, along with the rest of the City network, airs a Saturday night game as part of the &quot;Hockey Night In Canada&quot; package. Toronto Maple Leafs games are typically designated to CBC Television and CBLT during &quot;Hockey Night&quot;, unless otherwise simulcast. Often, City broadcasts Montreal Canadiens games. In the inaugural season, City also broadcast the Sunday-night &quot;Rogers Hometown Hockey&quot; games, before they moved exclusively to Sportsnet.

The station simulcast games 3 and 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals featuring the Toronto Raptors. The simulcast was intended to enforce simsub rights on ABC affiliates, and hence used the &quot;NBA on ESPN&quot; telecast rather than the Sportsnet-produced telecast. CITY-TV was also one of the two original regional broadcasters (alongside then co-owned CKVR) of Raptors games during the team&#x27;s first three seasons in the NBA from 1995 to 1998.

===News operation===
CITY-DT broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the largest local newscast output among the Greater Toronto Area market&#x27;s television stations and the largest of any station in Ontario. It is also the only remaining owned-and-operated station of the Citytv network that operates a full-scale news department, as local midday and evening newscasts on its Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver sister stations were cancelled between 2006 and 2010; outside of Toronto, locally produced programming on Citytv&#x27;s O&amp;O sister stations is now limited to local versions of the morning news and talk program franchise &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, a program that originated on CITY in September 1989. For many years, CITY aired its late evening newscast at 10 p.m. (as such, it was one of the few Canadian television stations to air a local news program during the final hour of prime time, a more common practice across the border in the United States); after Citytv became a television system and shifted its prime time schedule towards a line-up of primarily American programs, the station moved its late newscast to 11 p.m.

On January 19, 2010, Rogers Media announced the immediate cancellation of &quot;CityNews at Noon&quot;, &quot;CityOnline&quot;, &quot;CityNews at Five&quot;, Citytv&#x27;s national and international newscast &quot;CityNews International&quot;, and the station&#x27;s weekend evening newscasts, as part of massive restructuring and layoffs at the Citytv stations. Among those laid off were longtime 6 p.m. co-anchor Anne Mroczkowski and six reporters (Farah Nasser, Jee Yun Lee, Laura Di Battista, Marianne Dimain, Merella Fernandez and Michael Serapio); Pam Seatle was also dismissed, but returned to the station one month later.

The weekend 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts returned to the station in March 2011, followed by the return of the weekday &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; and the half-hour expansion of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; (with its start time moved up to 5:30 a.m., and expanding to hours as a result) on September 5, 2011. On October 3, 2011, the station began producing half-hour extensions of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and its nightly 11 p.m. newscast, &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot;, for exclusive broadcast on CityNews Channel (these, along with a half-hour extension of the weekend 6 p.m. newscast also began airing on CITY-DT the following year, and became exclusive to CITY-DT once CityNews Channel ceased operations).

On April 14, 2012, CITY-DT began simulcasting CityNews Channel&#x27;s morning news programming from Saturdays from 7 to 8 a.m. and Sundays from 7 to 9 a.m., becoming the only television station in the Toronto market that carried news programs on weekend mornings; this ended when CityNews Channel discontinued live broadcasts in May 2013, with CITY-DT filling those time periods with a mix of infomercials and lifestyle programming. On August 13, 2012, the station expanded its nightly 11 p.m. newscast, &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot;, to one hour, making the program the only hour-long late evening newscast in the Toronto market. In September 2013, the weeknight 5 p.m. newscast was reformatted as &quot;The 5&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
CITY launched a test transmission of its digital signal using the ATSC DTV standard on January 16, 2003, and began regular digital transmission a month and a half later on March 3, becoming the first station in Canada to operate a digital television signal. CITY-TV shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 57, on August 31, 2011, the date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53 to its post-transition UHF channel 44, using virtual channel 57.

<text>The Western Slope is a colloquial term generally understood to describe the part of the state of Colorado west of the Continental Divide. Bodies of water west of the Divide flow toward the Pacific Ocean; water that falls and flows east of the Divide heads east toward the Gulf of Mexico. The Western Slope encompasses about 33% of the state, but has just 10% of the state&#x27;s residents. The eastern part of the state, including the San Luis Valley and the Front Range, is the more populous portion of the state.

==Location==

The Western Slope, though without an official definition, generally is understood to include Delta, Dolores, Eagle, Garfield, Grand, Gunnison, Hinsdale, La Plata, Mesa, Moffat, Montezuma, Montrose, Ouray, Pitkin, Rio Blanco, Routt, San Juan, San Miguel, and Summit counties and portions of Archuleta, Mineral, and Saguache counties. 

The Western Slope has about 70% of the state&#x27;s water. The Colorado River and its tributaries divide the region into north and south at Grand Junction, Colorado. The area has a climate similar to that of the Great Basin.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Paleo-Indians, early nomadic hunter-gatherers, followed large game throughout the Western Slope beginning about 12,000 B.C. according to archaeological evidence found at the Mountaineer Archaeological Site near Gunnison. Ancestral Puebloans inhabited the Gunnison and Colorado River basins between 6500 B.C. and A.D. 200. From about 350 B.C. to A.D. 1300, Puebloans lived in southwestern Colorado, including Mesa Verde. The Puebloans, while also continuing to hunt and gather food, were the first to farm and irrigate crops on the Western Slope. They left the area in the late 13th century, following a period of extensive drought. The Ute people came to the Western Slope from the Great Basin and ranged through the area beginning about A.D. 1300. Their way of life, called the Mountain Tradition, relied on hunting mule deer, elk, rabbit, and buffalo. They also gathered berries, roots, nuts and seeds. They frequented the area&#x27;s hot springs, including the areas of Pagosa Springs, Glenwood Springs, and Steamboat Springs. Many of the trails established by the Utes became routes for roads, stage lines, highways, and railways.

===European contact===
Spanish explorers visited the Western Slope in the 18th century. Juan de Rivera explored the area in 1765, followed in 1776 by the Domínguez–Escalante expedition. Fur trappers, also called mountain men, of European descent entered the area to trap beaver for their furs. Trading posts were established on the Western Slope beginning in 1828 with the Fort Uncompahgre and Fort Davy Crockett at the center for trapping furs at Brown&#x27;s Hole. The trading posts were used to trade furs for supplies or goods. Trappers and explorers include Kit Carson and Jim Bridger. They and others guided John C. Frémont (1843–53), John W. Gunnison (1853), and John Wesley Powell (1869) on their expeditions into the Western Slope. Once the demand for beaver furs declined and beaver had been over-trapped, the fur trade was greatly diminished.

In 1858 and 1859, the Gold Rush into Colorado brought miners into the region and mining towns like Breckenridge. Mining districts were established in the San Juan Mountains, Gunnison River Valley, Sawatch Mountains and Elk Mountains. The initial interest was panning for gold in rivers and that grew over the decades to including mining for ore, coal, and fuel below ground. Many mining towns were established in the Western Slope. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden&#x27;s expedition of 1872 to 1873 resulted in maps of the Western Slope that were later used by investors, mining engineers, railroad owners, and others leading the western expansion into western Colorado.

After contact with people of European descent, there were a number of treaties to define boundaries for Native Americans, including the Treaty of 1868 that resulted in the Utes relinquishing their land east of the Continental Divide. They maintained most of their land in the Western Slope with the treaty. The Utes were pushed out of much of the Western Slope after gold was found in the San Juan Mountains, including through the Brunot Agreement. Utes were removed from the state after the Meeker Massacre of 1879. A reservation was created in Utah for the tribes that participated in the massacre. The Southern and Ute Mountain Utes have land in southern Colorado, the Southern Ute Indian Reservation and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe Reservation.

The region has a rich heritage in farming and ranching, with agribusiness remaining a key industry for most of the western slope. It is historically an energy hub, with coal, oil, uranium, and natural gas production.

==Population==
The Western Slope region is sparsely populated, containing 38% of Colorado&#x27;s area but only 10.7% of its population. The region had a population of 563,138 in July 2013, an increase of 0.6% on the previous year, and had a low growth rate over the previous three years compared to the rest of the state. 
The most populated areas of the Western slope are the Tri County area, which contains Grand Junction, Montrose, and Delta, and the Intermountain area, containing Glenwood Springs, Aspen, and Vail. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, with a population of 61,881 (2016, US Census Bureau).

According to the State Demographer&#x27;s Office, the population of the Western Slope is estimated to grow by two-thirds by 2050. Mesa County is expected to grow to 236,554 residents, accounting for 25% of the population growth on the Western Slope and become the 10th most populous county in the state. In 2015, the total population on the Western Slope was 563,766 and is projected to increase 67.2% to 942,463 residents in 2050.

==Economy==
Economic activity has primarily centered around ranching, mining, and tourism. Fruit farming is also prevalent in areas along the Colorado and Gunnison rivers, including the Grand Valley, where the Town of Palisade is recognized as the center of Colorado Wine Country, with over 20 wineries, and purveyor of Palisade peaches. 

Much of the area&#x27;s economy continues to be dependent upon energy extraction services and tourism. The region contains plentiful sources of oil, natural gas, uranium, and coal. Although much of the area&#x27;s economy is still dominated by energy extraction services and tourism, the Grand Junction area&#x27;s most prominent economic sector is health care. Grand Junction and surrounding Mesa County is a regional healthcare hub serving approximately 11 counties in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, which includes more than 500,000 people.

==Education==
Colorado&#x27;s Western Slope is home to several colleges and universities:

===Community/technical colleges===
* Colorado Mountain College (multiple campuses)
* Colorado Northwestern Community College (Rangely)
*IntelliTec College (Grand Junction)

===Four-year colleges/universities===
* Colorado Mesa University (Grand Junction)
* Fort Lewis College (Durango)
* Western Colorado University (Gunnison)

==Tourism==
The Western Slope has climate zones that include the desert, mountains, mountain lakes, and river valleys. As a result there are a number of outdoor recreational options that may include rock climbing, hiking, skiing, horseback riding and other activities. Crested Butte, Aspen, Telluride, and Vail are skiing areas. National forests include White River National Forest, Grand Mesa National Forest, Gunnison National Forest, Uncompahgre National Forest, and the San Juan National Forest. Black Canyon is in the Gunnison National Park.

Glenwood Springs has the world&#x27;s largest hot springs pool, fairy caves, and whitewater rafting. Events in Aspen include the Aspen Musical Festival, the Wine and Food Classic, and Theatre Aspen. Vineyards and wineries are found in Palisade and Grand Junction. Mesa Verde National Park is the home of cliff-dwellings of the Ancient Puebloans. Dinosaur National Monument and Colorado National Monument are other areas of interest. Two of the many rivers of the Western Slope are the Colorado River and Crystal River.

==Fauna==
Voters narrowly approved a November 2020 ballot measure that directed the commission that oversees CPW to develop a plan to begin to reintroduce wolves by the end of 2023 on the Western Slope. The wolves are managed and designated as a non-game species, meaning they cannot be hunted, with fair compensation being offered for livestock killed by the predators. Passage of the referendum was opposed by many cattle ranchers, elk hunters, farmers and others in rural areas that argue wolf reintroduction is bad policy which will threaten the raising of livestock and a $1 billion hunting industry.

<text>The Clyde Dam, New Zealand&#x27;s second-largest hydroelectric dam, is built on the Clutha River / Mata-Au near the town of Clyde. It is owned and operated by Contact Energy.

==History==

There was considerable controversy when the dam was planned because it would flood many houses and orchards upstream at Cromwell, as well as the scenic Cromwell Gorge, which was a highlight of the then young but growing New Zealand tourism industry. Construction also required replacement of a stretch of highway and the closure of the Otago Central Railway beyond Clyde, though materials for the dam would provide significant traffic for the rest of the line which was experiencing a drop in freight tonnage. To mitigate these problems, the Kirk Labour government decided a low dam should be built at Clyde. This decision was overturned by the following National government, who preferred a high dam.

There was also debate about whether the dam was needed. National&#x27;s support for a controversial aluminium smelter at Aramoana, another of Prime Minister Sir Robert Muldoon&#x27;s Think Big projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s, was one justification propounded for the dam. An initial grant of water rights for the dam was overturned by the High Court following an appeal by landowners. National overturned this decision, after bargaining for the support of Social Credit (who had initially opposed a high dam), in the Clutha Development (Clyde Dam) Empowering Act 1982. The Act was later repealed by the following National government on 1 October 1991, when it was superseded by the Resource Management Act 1991.
The dam was constructed between 1982 and 1993. Filling it was done in four controlled stages beginning in April 1992, and completed the following year, creating Lake Dunstan. The power station has a capacity of four 120 MVA (116 MW) Francis turbines (for a total of 464 MW), but was only allowed to run 432 MW due to resource consent conditions. The dam was built with two additional penstocks, allowing additional turbines to be installed in future. The resource consent was changed in 2005 to allow the full 464 MW to be produced.

During construction, the adjacent rock was discovered to be microfractured, because of an earthquake fault running underneath the dam site. The dam was redesigned, losing a sluice channel and cutting its generation capacity from 612 MW to 464 MW. A slip joint was built into the dam to accommodate 1–2 metres of potential ground movement, and a large amount of slurry cement was pumped into the rock to stop water leaks. This additional work was one reason for a major project cost overrun, which made the dam the most expensive in New Zealand. The other areas of overrun were due to stabilisation of landslides in the Cromwell Gorge. There are over 18 km of tunnels throughout the gorge for draining purposes. Because of all this extra work it overran the budget by nearly an extra 50% and delayed the filling of Lake Dunstan by a few years.

Maintenance workers accidentally activated fire alarms in the dam on 15 December 2008. The alarms triggered the release of a large bank of cylinders at the generators, flooding the equipment with the gas. Extractor fans to clear the then activated, and firefighters with breathing apparatus and gas detectors checked through the dam to ensure it had cleared.

<text>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is a synthetic, semicrystalline organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (CH2CHCN)n. Almost all PAN resins are copolymers with acrylonitrile as the main monomer. PAN is used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, and oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of very high-quality carbon fiber. PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 °C to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 °C in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found in a variety of both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets and bicycle frames. It is a component repeat unit in several important copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic.

==History==
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was first synthesized in 1930 by Hans Fikentscher and Claus Heuck in the Ludwigshafen works of the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben. However, as PAN is non-fusible, and did not dissolve in any of the industrial solvents being used at the time, further research into the material was halted. In 1931, Herbert Rein, head of polymer fiber chemistry at the Bitterfeld plant of IG Farben, obtained a sample of PAN while visiting the Ludwigshafen works. He found that pyridinium benzylchloride, an ionic liquid, would dissolve PAN. He spun the first fibers based on PAN in 1938, using aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium sodium thiocyanate and aluminum perchlorate for the production process and considered other solvents including DMF. However, commercial introduction was delayed due to the wartime stresses on infrastructure, inability to melt the polymer without degradation, and solvents to allow solution processing were not known yet.
The first mass production run of PAN fiber was in 1946 by American chemical conglomerate DuPont. The German intellectual property had been stolen in Operation Paperclip. The product, branded as Orlon, was based on a patent filed exactly seven days after a nearly identical German claim. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), industrial polyacrylonitrile fibre production was started in 1956 at the VEB Film- und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen due to the preliminary work of the &quot;Wolcrylon&quot; collective (&quot;:de:Max Duch&quot;, Herbert Lehnert et al.). Prior to this, the preconditions for the production of the raw materials had been created at the Buna Werke Schkopau (Polyacrylonitrile) and Leuna works (Dimethylformamide). In the same year, the collective was awarded the GDR&#x27;s National Prize II Class for Science and Technology for its achievements.

== Physical properties ==
Although it is thermoplastic, polyacrylonitrile does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above.

Glass transition temperature is around 95 °C and fusion temperature is at 322 °C. PAN is soluble in polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, ethylene and propylene carbonates, and in aqueous solutions of sodium thiocyanate, zinc chloride or nitric acid. Solubility parameters: 26.09 MPa1/2 (25 °C) are 25.6 to 31.5 J1/2 cm−3/2. Dielectric constants: 5.5 (1 kHz, 25 °C), 4.2 (1 MHz, 25 °C).Can behave as branched as well as linear polymer.

==Synthesis==
Most commercial methods for the synthesis of PAN are based on free radical polymerization of acrylonitrile. In most of the cases, 10% amounts of other vinyl comonomers are also used (1–10%) along with AN depending on the final application. Comonomers include acrylic acid, acrylamide, allyl compounds, and sulfonated styrene. Anionic polymerization also can be used for synthesizing PAN. For textile applications, molecular weight in the range of 40,000 to 70,000 is used. For producing carbon fiber higher molecular weight is desired.

In the production of carbon fibers containing 600 tex (6k) PAN tow, the linear density of filaments is 0.12 tex and the filament diameter is 11.6 μm which produces a carbon fiber that has the filament strength of 417 kgf/mm2 and binder content of 38.6%. This data is demonstrated in the Indexes for Experimental Batches of PAN Precursor and Carbon Fibers Made from It table.

==Applications==
Homopolymers of polyacrylonitrile have been used as fibers in hot gas filtration systems, outdoor awnings, sails for yachts, and fiber-reinforced concrete. Copolymers containing polyacrylonitrile are often used as fibers to make knitted clothing like socks and sweaters, as well as outdoor products like tents and similar items. If the label of a piece of clothing says &quot;acrylic&quot;, then it is made out of some copolymer of polyacrylonitrile. It was made into the spun fiber at DuPont in 1942 and marketed under the name of Orlon. Acrylonitrile is commonly employed as a comonomer with styrene, e.g. acrylonitrile, styrene and acrylate plastics. Labelling of items of clothing with acrylic (see acrylic fiber) means the polymer consists of at least 85% acrylonitrile as the monomer. A typical comonomer is vinyl acetate, which can be solution-spun readily to obtain fibers that soften enough to allow penetration by dyes. The advantages of the use of these acrylics are that they are low-cost compared to natural fiber, they offer better sunlight resistance and have superior resistance to attack by moths. 
Acrylics modified with halogen-containing comonomers are classified as modacrylics, which by definition contain more than PAN percentages between 35-85%. Incorporation of halogen groups increases the flame resistance of the fiber, which makes modacrylics suitable for the use in sleepwear, tents and blankets. Some mattresses also use them to meet the flame resistance requirements in North America. However, the disadvantage of these products is that they are costly and can shrink after drying.

PAN absorbs many metal ions and aids the application of absorption materials. Polymers containing amidoxime groups can be used for the treatment of metals because of the polymers’ complex-forming capabilities with metal ions.

PAN has properties involving low density, thermal stability, high strength and modulus of elasticity. These unique properties have made PAN an essential polymer in high tech.

Its high tensile strength and tensile modulus are established by fiber sizing, coatings, production processes, and PAN&#x27;s fiber chemistry. Its mechanical properties derived are important in composite structures for military and commercial aircraft.

===Carbon fiber===
Polyacrylonitrile is used as the precursor for 90% of carbon fiber production. Approximately 20–25% of Boeing and Airbus wide-body airframes are carbon fibers. However, applications are limited by PAN&#x27;s high price of around $15/lb.

===Glassy carbon===
Glassy carbon, a common electrode material in electrochemistry, is created by heat-treating blocks of polyacrylonitrile under pressure at 1000 to 3000 °C over a period of several days. The process removes non-carbon atoms and creates a conjugated double bond structure with excellent conductivity.

===Support polymer===
Divinylbenzene-crosslinked polyacrylonitrile is a precursor to ion exchange resins. Hydrolysis converts the nitrile groups to carboxylic acids. Amberlite IRC86 is one commercial product. These weakly acidic resins have high affinities for divalent metal ions like Ca2+ and Mg2+.

<text>The Eastern Plains of Colorado refers to a region of the U.S. state of Colorado east of the Rocky Mountains and east of the population centers of the Front Range.

==Geography==

The Eastern Plains are part of the High Plains, which are the westernmost portion of the Great Plains. The region is characterized by mostly rolling plains, divided by the South Platte River and Arkansas River valleys. There are also several deciduous forests, canyons, buttes, and a few large natural lakes and rivers throughout the region. The Eastern Plains rise from approximately 3,400 feet (1,000 m.) at the eastern border of Colorado with Kansas, where the Arkansas River leaves the state, to 7,500 feet (2,300 m.) east of the Denver Basin.

Most of the Eastern Plains region lies within Colorado&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

===Climate===
The Eastern Plains have a semi-arid climate and receive little rainfall. Much of the area relies on irrigation to survive. Summers are typically hot and dry, often bringing thunderstorms, which are often severe, to the area, with some occasionally forming landspouts and tornadoes. Eastern Colorado winters are cold and dry, with significant snowfalls and icy conditions. Temperatures can sometimes fall to -40 to -30 degrees Fahrenheit in extreme cold waves, although this is rare.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Eastern Colorado was once home to many Native American tribes. The Plains Indians that lived in the region included the Arapahoe, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Pawnee, and Sioux. The Ute people formally ruled all over central and western Colorado, and onto the eastern plains as well. The Comanche once ruled all over southeastern Colorado, and the Jicarilla Apache ruled in southeastern Colorado as well.

===Settlement===
In 1541, the Spanish came to the area now known as the south eastern portion of Colorado, in search of gold after hearing rumors in Mexico city. Not having found any gold, the Spanish largely left the area untouched. During the late 17th and 18th century Spain and France claimed southeastern Colorado. However, nobody settled the land. In 1803 the United States gained possession of much of the land east of Rocky Mountains with the Louisiana Purchase.

Zebulon M. Pike was sent by the federal government to lay out the boundary lines of territory in 1806. This expedition investigated the area now known as Colorado Springs. The prominent mountain in the area was named Pike&#x27;s Peak after Pike, the leading commander of the exploration. There were multiple expeditions sent to lay out and explore the territory throughout the early 1800s. This created multiple trading posts with fur trades attracting many backcountry adventurers. There was still no permanent settlement created until after the conclusion of the Mexican War in 1848. San Luis was founded on the Culebra River in 1851. Spanish-speaking settlers who had moved north from New Mexico founded it. San Luis was shortly followed by settlements of San Pedro, San Acacio and Guadalupe.

===Population===
The Eastern Colorado plains are among the most sparsely populated areas in the continental United States. Some of the region, with the exception of comparatively urban areas like Sterling, is experiencing depopulation, which in some areas began with the influenza pandemic of 1918 and agricultural price collapses after World War I. The Dust Bowl devastated the region and further accelerated this outmigration. Baca County is emblematic of the population decline and its associated effects, as the county&#x27;s population declined in every census from 1960 to 2020.

==Protected areas==

Both the Pawnee National Grasslands and Comanche National Grasslands are located in the Eastern Plains. They are composed of marginal farmlands that were withdrawn from agriculture and consolidated under federal control beginning in the Dust Bowl.

The Amache National Historic Site, located near Granada in Prowers County is administered by the National Park Service.

==Agriculture==
Eastern Colorado is largely farmland, with many small farming communities. The major cash crops are corn, wheat, hay, oats, and soybeans. There is also significant livestock farming, dairy and poultry farming, including chicken for meat and eggs, and turkey farming. Most of the towns in the region have grain elevators and prominent water towers. Also, over 90% of the farms in Eastern Colorado are family farms.

==Education==
In Eastern Colorado most small towns have their own schools and sports teams, but in some parts where depopulation has been the worst, a single school is shared among surrounding towns. There are also a number of schools serving students in grades K–12 run by religious groups or public school districts. Eastern Colorado is one of the few remaining places in the United States that was still operating one-room school houses in 2010.

Eastern Colorado is home to several institutions of higher education, primarily community colleges: 

*Morgan Community College (Fort Morgan)
*Northeastern Junior College (Sterling)
*Lamar Community College (Lamar)
*Otero College (La Junta)

==Religion==
The most prominent religion in Eastern Colorado is Christianity, with Roman Catholicism the largest denomination.

==Transportation==
Eastern Colorado roads span the gamut from paved roads to gravel roads to dirt roads. The unpaved roads are typically county or local roads that do not receive enough traffic to be paved. Some of the major paved roads include:
* Interstate 76
* Interstate 70
* U.S. Highway 6
* U.S. Highway 24
* U.S. Highway 36
* U.S. Highway 40
* U.S. Highway 50
* U.S. Highway 160
* U.S. Highway 287
* U.S. Highway 350
* U.S. Highway 385
* State Highway 10
* State Highway 11
* State Highway 36
* State Highway 59
* State Highway 71
* State Highway 86
* State Highway 94
* State Highway 96

<text>Aimée &amp; Jaguar is a 1999 German drama film set in Berlin during World War II. It was written and directed by Max Färberböck and based on Erica Fischer&#x27;s book chronicling the actual lives of Lilly Wust and Felice Schragenheim during that time. Before Erica Fischer&#x27;s bestseller, Lilly Wust was tracked down by the American journalist, author, and noted Holocaust researcher Charles Brady, who considered Lilly Wust a Holocaust victim. It was over a year and a half, however, before Wust was able to confide in Brady and tell him her whole story. They remained close friends for 20 years until her death in 2006.

Fischer&#x27;s book contains photos of the many letters shared between herself and Wust, and of official correspondence after World War II in regard to Felice&#x27;s whereabouts. The movie stars Juliane Köhler as Lilly Wust and Maria Schrader as Felice Schragenheim, as well as Johanna Wokalek, Elisabeth Degen, Heike Makatsch and Detlev Buck.

==Plot==
The film explores the lives of Felice Schragenheim (Maria Schrader), a Jewish woman who has assumed a false name and belongs to an underground organization, and Lilly Wust (Juliane Köhler), a married mother of four who is unsatisfied with her philandering Nazi officer husband.

The film begins in 1997, with an 83-year-old Lilly (played by Inge Keller) taking up residence in a dilapidated flat that once served as an underground hideout. Brought to a retirement home, Lilly encounters her old maid Ilse (played by Johanna Wokalek in the 1940s scenes and by Kyra Mladeck in 1997 scenes), who was rounded up during 1945, and is already a tenant.

In 1943 Felice, assuming a false last name and working as a journalist at a Nazi newspaper, meets Lilly via her friend and sometime lover Ilse, who works as Lilly&#x27;s housekeeper. Instantly smitten, she takes the initiative in the love affair by sending flagrant letters to Lilly and signing her name as Jaguar, much to Ilse&#x27;s dismay. One fateful afternoon Felice, Ilse and their friends Klara and Lotte are accosted by German soldiers. All but Lotte manage to escape. After Lotte is shot dead, the soldiers find no identification on her body except a photograph of her and Felice. Lonely due to the absence of her husband at the front, Lilly engages in a series of affairs with other men, but is disillusioned by her callous treatment at the hands of her latest lover, another Nazi officer. She grows closer to Felice, who attempts to kiss her during a New Year&#x27;s Eve Party in her Berlin apartment after Lilly discovers her husband with Ilse. Lilly rejects Felice but, as her husband tries to make amends the following morning, Lilly realizes she has never loved him and reconciles with Felice.

With her husband again away at war, Lilly and Felice begin a shaky but intense relationship. The film features both erotic encounters and sentimental love poems (quoted from the book) and, during one love scene, Felice proclaims Lilly Aimée to her Jaguar. On Lilly&#x27;s birthday, Felice and her friends throw a party in her apartment that culminates in a lesbian orgy. Lilly is mortified when she sees Ilse and Felice kissing drunkenly, and is further disillusioned when Felice rejects her advances for the night. The next morning, Lilly&#x27;s husband arrives on special leave for his wife&#x27;s birthday only to witness the aftermath of the previous night&#x27;s events. Although enraged, he vows to not punish her for her indiscretion so long that their marriage and life remain intact, but Lilly instead surprises him by asking for a divorce. Afraid that Lilly&#x27;s husband may turn them in, Felice and her friends stop seeing Lilly for the sake of their own survival. Heartbroken, Lilly holes up in her apartment, eventually sending her children away to safety, and erupts in anger when Felice finally visits her after several weeks. Felice reveals the truth that she is Jewish and feared for her life, and the two make up.

After the 20 July Plot, Felice and her friends fear for their lives and arrange to flee Germany before they are rounded up. At the last moment, Felice decides to stay in spite of the danger so that she may remain with Lilly. After a day of frolicking in the countryside, the two return to Lilly&#x27;s apartment, where Felice is captured by the Gestapo, who have identified her through the photograph of her and Lotte. She is sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp, from where she still manages to correspond with Lilly, but all contact is lost by the end of 1944.

Lilly and Ilse reminisce about times past as the film ends. Lilly, though saddened by the tragedy that she has caused her friends and lovers, is unable to imagine how her life could have been any different, given her obsessive live-for-today-for-tomorrow-we-die mentality, common among besieged Berliners. Lilly Wust lived in Berlin until her death on 31 March 2006. The tagline of the film is &quot;Love Transcends Death&quot;.

<doc id="451792" wikidata="Q2931678" url="?curid=451792" title="CKXT-DT">
<text>CKXT-DT (channel 52) was a broadcast television station based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which broadcast to much of southern and eastern Ontario. It was owned by Quebecor Media through its Groupe TVA unit. Although beginning as a general interest independent station carrying a typical schedule of entertainment and information programming, by the time of the station&#x27;s closure on November 1, 2011, the station had been converted into an over-the-air simulcast of Quebecor&#x27;s cable news channel, Sun News Network. The station transmitted on channel 52 in Toronto.

CKXT began broadcasting on September 19, 2003, owned and operated by Craig Media as a general-interest independent station branded Toronto 1. Following the station&#x27;s sale to Quebecor, it was renamed Sun TV on August 29, 2005. It then began to simulcast Sun News upon that channel&#x27;s launch on April 18, 2011.

Although Sun News was licensed as a Category C (optional carriage) digital specialty channel, CKXT, as a broadcast station, had mandatory cable carriage in its over-the-air service area. Hence the simulcast meant that Sun News programming was available to analog cable subscribers throughout southern and eastern Ontario. However, the station retained its own broadcast licence separate from the specialty channel. The station&#x27;s Ottawa transmitter was closed on August 31, 2011, while the remaining transmitters in Toronto, Hamilton, and London were closed on November 1, 2011.

==History==

===Toronto 1: licensing and launch===
Craig Media was awarded a licence for Toronto 1 (originally stylized as &quot;Toronto One&quot;) by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on April 8, 2002, in a controversial split decision regarding five competing applications for new Toronto-area TV stations. Torstar, which proposed a &quot;Hometown Television&quot; format with a main station in Toronto and repeaters in Hamilton and Kitchener, was widely deemed the frontrunner for the licence. However, its proposed schedule, with minimum 85% Canadian content consisting primarily of local and regional programming and no U.S. simulcasts, was found to be unviable by most commissioners. Several existing broadcasters were opposed to any new stations being licensed in the Toronto area because of the unstable economic climate. Alliance Atlantis and Canwest were also unsuccessful applicants. At the same time Rogers applied for and received a licence for a second Toronto multicultural station, OMNI.2, in a much less controversial decision.

The CKXT license also marked the first time that Craig Media had been granted a licence to compete directly with a station owned by CHUM Limited, which meant that CHUM lost sales revenues from the broadcast rights it had contracted to Craig&#x27;s A-Channel stations. CHUM retaliated by applying for broadcast licences in Calgary and Edmonton, two markets it had previously avoided so as not to compete directly with Craig. The CRTC denied CHUM&#x27;s applications.
CKXT went to air on September 19, 2003, as the first new general-interest television station in Toronto in 30 years. Toronto 1 proved, however, to be a financial and critical disaster for Craig. The station was frequently criticized in the Toronto media, particularly for flashy but vacuous and repetitive local content, newscasts that had a tabloid feel, an uninspired daytime schedule laden with American talk shows and an equally uninspired prime time schedule based heavily on movies, much like CHUM&#x27;s longstanding Citytv. Columnist Russell Smith of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called Toronto 1 an &quot;abject, wretched excuse for a television station&quot; whose only truly locally-focused programming was a trio of celebrity-focused talk shows and a health-issues show.

On May 19, 2004, Craig announced that 28 Toronto 1 employees and nine employees working at CKAL in Calgary were being laid off. In addition, a large portion of Toronto 1&#x27;s original programming, including weekday morning show &quot;Toronto Today&quot;, variety show &quot;The Toronto Show&quot;, and late evening talk show &quot;Last Call&quot;, were cancelled. Some of the hosts, such as Wei Chen and Roz Weston, were reassigned to other roles with the station at that point. Craig Media said the cuts were made to &quot;further rationalize its operations and control costs&quot;.

None of the changes worked, however, and on April 12, 2004—seven months after CKXT launched—Craig sold its conventional television assets to CHUM Limited for $265 million. CHUM was required by CRTC competition regulations to put CKXT back on the market immediately, owing to its already strong presence in the Toronto television market through CITY-TV.

===Sale to Quebecor Media and relaunch as SUN TV===

CHUM sold CKXT to Quebecor Media (QMI), the media unit of Montreal-based communications conglomerate Quebecor. The deal was completed on December 2, 2004; Quebecor gave CHUM and Sun Media&#x27;s 29.9 percent share in CP24 for CKXT. Ownership in CKXT was split, 75 percent to 25 percent, between QMI&#x27;s publicly traded broadcasting unit Groupe TVA and wholly owned publishing subsidiary Sun Media, which owned &quot;The Toronto Sun&quot;. The station would be re-branded as &quot;Sun TV&quot; on August 29, 2005.

After CKXT&#x27;s sale to Quebecor, the new management cancelled the station&#x27;s evening news program, &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot;, and announced it would expand its entertainment magazine program &quot;The A-List&quot; to one hour in length, airing weeknights from 7 to 8 p.m. (which was later reduced to a weekend only timeslot, effective March 24, 2006). A late-night sports talk show, &quot;The Grill Room&quot;, premiered on September 1.

Before &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot; ended on June 30, 2005, former &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot; co-anchor Ben Chin announced he would be moving to Global Television Network as a senior news correspondent; later that summer he decided instead to enter political life as an advisor in Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s communications team.

Chin&#x27;s &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot; co-anchor Sarika Sehgal was also let go at the same time. In late 2005, Sehgal joined the 24-hour news channel CBC Newsworld as a host. In the winter of 2003, &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot; correspondent Chris Mavridis left to join CBS News as a New York–based network correspondent. In addition to anchoring and reporting, Mavridis helped create new programming for the network&#x27;s broadcast radio and online divisions.

Roz Weston joined &quot;ET Canada&quot;. Natasha Ramsahai, the morning weather person on &quot;Toronto Today&quot;, is now a meteorologist for Citytv Toronto, while Bill Coulter, the evening weather person on &quot;Toronto Tonight&quot;, is now a meteorologist for CP24. Tracy Moore and Dina Pugliese both joined Citytv Toronto. Wei Chen is now a host on CBC Radio One.

As Sun TV, the station met its Canadian content obligations primarily by airing repeats of older Canadian series such as &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, &quot;The Beachcombers&quot;, &quot;Danger Bay&quot;, &quot;Ready or Not&quot;, &quot;My Secret Identity&quot;, &quot;Super Dave&quot; and &quot;Side Effects&quot;, while also picking up some original non-fiction programming, including the movie review series &quot;DVD Show&quot;, the concert series &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; and the food program &quot;Street Eats&quot;.

The performance of CKXT under Quebecor was no better than it was under Craig. In March 2006, the Canadian Media Guild announced that 13 employees would be laid off from the station, including its entire marketing department, and &quot;Inside Jam&quot; (the rebranded &quot;A-List&quot;) would be relegated to weekends only. A new program, &quot;Canoe Live&quot;, was launched in May 2006 to poor reviews.

At the same time, the station stepped up its acquisitions of U.S. network series, albeit mainly the &quot;leftovers&quot; not obtained by other Canadian networks. The fall 2006 schedule, for instance, included &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Cops&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. The first four programs aired on other Canadian television networks but with poor ratings.

CKXT also carried both of the original MyNetworkTV telenovelas, &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Fashion House&quot; in 2006, although it scheduled them in the afternoons rather than in prime time. Due to low ratings, the station elected not to air future MNTV telenovelas after the first two series concluded on December 5, 2006. With the conversion of the CH television system to E! Canada, CKXT also picked up some of CHCH-TV&#x27;s former daytime programming, including the long-running American game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which has moved to OMNI.2, but it has since began airing on CITY-DT.

CKXT-TV was the only English-language independent television station outside of religious and community television stations in Canada on the UHF band.

The station applied for rebroadcasters in Ottawa and London in 2007, in order to improve its reach across southern Ontario. The move would give the station coverage roughly equal to that of Citytv, OMNI.1 or OMNI.2. On September 14, 2007, the CRTC approved CKXT&#x27;s request, giving the station channel 26, digital 19 in London; and channel 54, digital 62 in Ottawa. Sun TV later applied to change its digital channel in Ottawa to 20; this was given approval on June 17, 2008 and began transmissions in September 2008. As of late December 2008, CKXT was broadcasting in London in high definition on channel 19.1 and standard definition on channel 19.2.

On December 1, 2009, the CRTC approved an application by Quebecor Media to allow a corporate reorganization through which Groupe TVA would acquire Sun Media&#x27;s 25 percent stake in CKXT.

===Transition to Sun News===
On June 14, 2010, Channel Zero and CHEK Media Group (then-owners of CHCH-TV/CJNT-TV and CHEK-TV, which they acquired respectively after the E! system folded) announced they had acquired the rights to virtually all of the first-run U.S. series that had aired on CKXT during the 2009–10 season, including &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The programming announcement came amidst speculation that CKXT parent Quebecor Media was planning to launch a new news channel, with some of the rumours suggesting that CKXT might be part of the new venture. On June 15, 2010, Quebecor confirmed its plans for the new Sun News Network with a scheduled launch date of January 1, 2011. As part of its plans for Sun News, Groupe TVA submitted an application to the CRTC to replace CKXT&#x27;s licence with a new three-year Category 1 specialty channel licence for the news channel. The Category 1 application was declined by the CRTC in July 2010, but a Category 2 application was approved in November 2010. This left CKXT&#x27;s fate in 2011 unclear (Quebecor management had initially stated that it did not plan to convert CKXT to an over-the-air all-news format).

For the bulk of the 2010–11 season, CKXT broadcast no local programming, and mainly broadcast movies (three movies each weekday, Monday through Friday, at 8a.m., 1 and 8p.m.; and a quadruple-feature of movies on Saturdays and Sundays at 3, 5, 7 and 9p.m.), along with paid programming and a handful of &quot;off-network&quot; series reruns.

A CRTC filing in early 2011, seeking the authority to continue CKXT&#x27;s operations following the digital conversion in August 2011, led to speculation that Quebecor was revisiting its earlier decision to surrender its over-the-air licence. Then, in late March 2011, the station&#x27;s website began to redirect to the Sun News Network URL (the station itself continued to air regular programming). Sun News later confirmed via Twitter that it would simulcast its programming on CKXT, at least initially. The simulcast began at the same time Sun News was launched, at 4:30 p.m. ET on April 18, 2011.

Bell Satellite TV dropped CKXT the morning of May 3, due to a dispute with Quebecor on whether or not carriage fees should be levied, as Sun News was broadcast via CKXT, leading to Bell treating Sun News as a terrestrial channel (i.e., available without carriage fees). Quebecor argued that it should charge Bell TV for the rights, as it was a licensed cable specialty channel. (The outage did not affect Bell Fibe TV in the Toronto area, which was compelled to carry CKXT.)

===Closedown===
The CRTC had questioned Quebecor in early July on its usage of the station to simulcast Sun News, noting &quot;Quebecor should expect to be asked to demonstrate why this is the best use of the radio spectrum&quot;. Quebecor management told the CRTC that it would shut the station down, rather than to renew the over-the-air licence. Quebecor closed CKXT on November 1, 2011. It was the fifth major TV station in Canada (and the first in one of Canada&#x27;s three large cities) to have gone dark since 1977, when CFVO-TV in Hull, Quebec (now Gatineau), left the air (this station would be returned as a Radio-Québec station CIVO-TV, with a new CRTC license). Other than the 2009 closedowns of CHCA-TV in Red Deer, Alberta, and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba (both of which went dark entirely), all other defunct stations in Canada became repeaters of other stations almost seamlessly. In addition, CIAN-TV in Calgary and CJAL-TV in Edmonton were closed down as they became the cable-only CTV Two Alberta on August 31, that same year.

Following these changes, Sun News Network no longer received mandatory carriage and lost its previous low channel position in Toronto, Hamilton, London and Ottawa; the channel&#x27;s programming was only available on cable and satellite providers carrying the specialty channel. In the Toronto area, shortly after the station left the air, Rogers-owned CityNews Channel took the place of CKXT on its former cable channel 15 slot for digital subscribers, while Buffalo PBS station WNED-TV occupied channel 15 for analogue subscribers. Sun News retained the other channel positions previously allocated for CKXT on Rogers&#x27; cable systems (142 and 567), but it was no longer included as part of its basic service.

Sun News Network itself shut down on February 13, 2015, with Quebecor attributing the channel&#x27;s failure to it being denied mandatory carriage.

==Transmitters==
Following the shutdown of these rebroadcasters, most channel allocations were transferred to other stations:
* CKXT-DT-1&#x27;s allocation is occupied by CHCH-DT since December 2, 2013, with virtual channel 11.1.
* CKXT-DT-2&#x27;s allocation is vacant as of May 2020.
* CKXT-DT-3&#x27;s allocation is occupied by CJMT-DT-2 (OMNI 2) since August 31, 2011, with virtual channel 14.1.

== Digital television and high definition==
Subchannels were for the London and Ottawa digital repeaters only.

The same program content was duplicated on both subchannels.

After the analogue television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CKXT-DT remained on channel 66 until its closedown at the end of October. Digital television receivers would display CKXT-DT&#x27;s virtual channel as 52.1.

CKXT-DT-1 in Hamilton and CKXT-DT-2 London stayed on 15 and 19 respectively, following the transition until their closedowns.

<text>HMAS &quot;Glenelg&quot; (J236/M236), named for the city of Glenelg, South Australia, was one of 60 constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Glenelg&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Glenelg&quot; was laid down by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales on 2 March 1942. She was launched on 25 September 1942 by the wife of Doctor H.V. Evatt, then Minister for External Affairs, and was commissioned into the RAN on 16 November 1942.

==Operational history==
&quot;Glenelg&quot; began her career as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia, initially from Queensland to New Guinea before being assigned to the Sydney to Queensland leg in May 1943. In December, the corvette began a refit.

On completion, she was assigned to New Guinea waters as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort ship for the duration of 1944; during this time the ship sailed and was active for over 10,000 hours. On 20 October 1944, the corvette was called to assist an American patrol under heavy mortar fire near Maffin Bay in Dutch New Guinea. &quot;Glenelg&quot;’s whaler was deployed to help move the American wounded; although swampled, the boat was dragged ashore by her crew, with seating and flooring boards used as improvised stretchers to move the wounded to the American-controlled bank of the Woske River. &quot;Glenelg&quot;, under the guidance of two US Army personnel standing on the beach, fired 31 rounds from her main gun at the Japanese attackers, and was later praised by the patrol&#x27;s senior officer as the decisive factor in allowing the patrol to withdraw with all wounded, leaving five dead behind.

The corvette arrived in Australia at the start of 1945 for a two-month refit in Melbourne, before returning to Manus Island and spending the remainder of the war as a convoy escort. After the end of World War II, &quot;Glenelg&quot; was involved in the reoccupation of Ambon during September, before departing for Fremantle on 1 November, visiting her namesake city en route.

The corvette earned two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Glenelg&quot; was paid off into reserve in Fremantle on 14 January 1946. She was sold to the Hong Kong Rolling Mills on 2 May 1957 for breaking up as scrap.

<text>Curepipe (), also known as &quot;La Ville-Lumière&quot; (The City of Light), is a town in Mauritius, located mainly in the Plaines Wilhems District. Its eastern part lies in the Moka District. The town is administered by the Municipal Council of Curepipe. Curepipe lies at a higher elevation, often referred to as the &quot;Central Plateau&quot;. According to the census made by Statistics Mauritius in 2018, the population of the town was at 78,618.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name, Curepipe, is said to be originated from the French &quot;curer sa pipe&quot;, which translates to &quot;cleaning his/her pipe&quot;. There are several theories by historians as to the naming of the city. Some historians believe that the name was given as travellers and soldiers from the 19th century often travelled from Port Louis and Grand Port (now Mahébourg) to refill their pipes in Curepipe. Other historians believe that the name was given after a late landowner during the 18th century.

The town officially covers an area of . It is located in the Plaine Wilhems district on the central plateau of Mauritius at an altitude of 561 meters. Of the larger towns of the island&#x27;s central plateau, Curepipe is the most southern and also the highest. As a consequence of its height, Curepipe is known for its relatively cooler and rainier climate. The dormant volcano Trou aux Cerfs is nearby.

==Politics==
Curepipe is managed by a council, which is democratically elected by its citizens. The council is headed by the mayor and is principally responsible for local policy making. The current mayor is Mr. Hans Berty Margueritte. The town&#x27;s administration on the other hand is responsible for the implementation of these policies as well as the day-to-day management of the council&#x27;s activities. The current administrative head is Mrs Jugroop

Curepipe&#x27;s historic town hall was actually originally situated in Moka, and the whole building was moved to Curepipe in 1903.

For the general elections the town is classified as the No 17 constituency known as &quot;Curepipe and Midlands&quot;.

== Demographics ==

According to the census made by Statistics Mauritius in 2018, the population of the town was at 78,692. The primary spoken language is Mauritian Creole, though French predominates in more formal situations. Tamil, Bhojpuri, Hindi, Telugu, Urdu, Mandarin and Hakka Chinese are also spoken as second or third language mostly in religious activities. The council&#x27;s official language is English.

=== Religion ===

According to the 2012 census conducted by Statistics Mauritius, Christianity is the most prevalently practised religion in Curepipe (48.4%) (Catholic 39.2%, Protestant 1.3%, Other Christian 8%), followed by Hinduism (37.7%) and Islam (13.9%).

==Economic activities==
The town hosts several textile factories, a diamond processing industry and a range of jewelry businesses. In addition, handicraft shops, restaurants and shopping centres add to the commercial mix of the town. The relatively affluent suburbs are also home to a great deal of business activity.

<text>China Netcom, full name China Netcom Group Corporation (Hong Kong) Limited (former stock codes: HKEX:0906, NYSE:CN), abbreviated CNC, was a telecommunication service provider in People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was formed in August 1999 by the Chinese government to enable inward investments to build high speed Internet communications in the country.

==Sectors==
CNC was a provider of wire-line telecommunications services in mainland China, mainly to areas in the north of China. The firm was building a new broadband Internet backbone across the country. It was widely seen as the number two fixed-line operator in mainland China after China Telecommunications Corporation, and operated a semi-mobile PAS or xiaolingtong system.

Traditionally services were provided by the company to northern Chinese provinces and large cities such as Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Liaoning; however, later they had a presence in most provinces.

As well as offering ADSL internet services (not always available outside of north China), the company offered internet collocation services and was a leading provider of connectivity to China&#x27;s so-called &#x27;IP telephone&#x27; shops, who offer discount rate, walk-in telephony services to the general public across China.

Moreover, ChinaNetcom was the Beijing 2008 Olympic&#x27;s Official telecommunications operator and partner and provided fixed-line telecommunications services for the Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games. It offered good fixed-lined telecommunication service and ensured its network was stable during the Good Luck Beijing Test Sport Event, the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games and the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games.

== History ==
The company started as a wholesaler for high-speed data networks in 1999, headquartered in Shanghai. It was backed by Jiang Mianheng, Jiang Zemin&#x27;s son, and Liu Chuanzhi, chairman of &quot;Legend Computers&quot; (now Lenovo). However, the business flopped partly because at the time China Telecommunications Corporation (China Telecom Group) held a monopoly over the telecom market.

Netcom was on the verge of bankruptcy. Fortunately for Netcom, with the backing of Jiang&#x27;s son, the Chinese government broke up the China Telecom monopoly and granted Netcom a third of China Telecom&#x27;s assets. Most of those assets are located in the northern provinces.

== Merger with China Unicom ==
China Netcom was a subsidiary of China Network Communications Group Corporation.

On June 2, 2008, Netcom announced its intention to merge with China Unicom, after the latter sold its CDMA network to China Telecommunications Corporation. The combined company has all the assets of China Netcom, plus Unicom&#x27;s nationwide GSM network with 125 million subscribers, as well as its smaller dial-up and ADSL ISP business.

The merger was completed on 6 October 2008. China Netcom became a wholly owned subsidiary of China Unicom and the listings of its shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and its American depositary receipt Shares on the New York Stock Exchange were withdrawn.

==Complaints about spam==
China Netcom and its domain cnc-noc.net have been noted in the West as a source of e-mail spam and host of spamvertised websites for products such as pills, porn and poker.

In 2008, Norwegian researchers identified cnc-noc.net as &quot;by far the world&#x27;s worst ISP&quot;, and noted that the ISP did not respond to incident reports.

Spamhaus lists the Unicom ISP as the 3rd worst ISP for spamming.

<doc id="451801" wikidata="Q5630355" url="?curid=451801" title="HMAS Goulburn">
<text>HMAS &quot;Goulburn&quot; (J167/B243/A117), named for the city of Goulburn, New South Wales, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but subsequently manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4 inch Mk XIX gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Goulburn&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

At 743 tons standard displacement, &quot;Goulburn&quot; exceeded the designed standard displacement of the &quot;Bathurst&quot; class ships by 93 tons.

&quot;Goulburn&quot; was laid down by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 10 July 1940. She was launched on 16 November 1940 by the wife of Rear Admiral John Gregory Crace, the commander of the Australian Squadron, and was commissioned on 28 February 1941.

==Operational history==
After entering active service, &quot;Goulburn&quot; was assigned to minesweeping duties along the east and south-east coasts of Australia, and was one of several ships attempting to locate mines deployed by the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Pinguin&quot; and the auxiliary minelayer &quot;Passat&quot;. Although operating in this role from 23 April to 31 May 1941, the corvette located only a single mine.

On 16 June, &quot;Goulburn&quot; and sister ship &quot;Burnie&quot; were assigned to the China Station and sailed to Singapore. The corvettes operated as convoy escorts, minesweepers, and anti-submarine patrol ships until January 1942. &quot;Goulburn&quot; was then deployed to Batavia and used as a minesweeper and convoy escort throughout the Sunda Islands. On 27 February, the corvette passed the ABDA cruiser force shortly before the beginning of the Battle of the Java Sea. Although removed from the main battle area, &quot;Goulburn&quot; was attacked by three waves of three Japanese dive bombers, but was undamaged. On 29 February, &quot;Goulburn&quot; departed for Australia, arriving in Fremantle on 9 March with only seven tons of fuel remaining. The corvette was assigned to convoy escort runs along the Queensland coast until the end of 1943, then entered a three-month refit.

After refitting, &quot;Goulburn&quot; was deployed to New Guinea waters as an escort and patrol vessel. During June 1944, the corvette supported landings at Dugumu Bay and Sogari Island. On 25 September, native scouts and a US Army Intelligence officer were embarked to be transported to the Malpia Islands. The native scouts were landed on 27 September to assess Japanese troop strength throughout the island group. After the scouts failed to rendezvous with the ship two days later, and following a failed search attempt by six sailors and the US officer, it was assumed that the scouts had been captured. This was confirmed when American PT boats attempted to land troops on the island a few days later, meeting heavy Japanese resistance. Before leaving the area, &quot;Goulburn&quot; shelled a village on Pegun Island believed to hold Japanese troops. At the start of October, the corvette was tasked with retrieving another native scout group. After several failed attempts to locate the scouts, they were retrieved from Mois Aoeri Island. While returning to the ship, the shore party was able to capture three Japanese soldiers attempting to escape in a canoe. After observing numerous Japanese personnel on shore, and receiving conformation that several hundred Japanese were based on the island, &quot;Goulburn&quot; opened fire on the main camp. After these operations, the corvette returned to convoy escort duties until December 1944, then returned to Australia.

Goulburn spent the first part of 1945 operating in Australian waters, before returning to New Guinea in May. She spent a month on escort and minesweeping duties, before sailing to Darwin and escorting a floating dry dock to Milne Bay. The corvette remained in New Guinea waters until the end of the war on 15 August. On 30 August, &quot;Goulburn&quot; and two sister ships escorted a convoy to Hong Kong, arriving on 21 September. The corvette was involved in minesweeping operations throughout Chinese waters, before returning to Sydney in December 1945.

The ship received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942–44&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Goulburn&quot; was paid off on 27 September 1946. She was sold to Pacific Enterprise Incorporated on 13 October 1947, and after several re-sales, ended up in the possession of the Ta Hing Company of Hong Kong in December 1950. However, a Commonwealth Statutory Order prevented the ship from leaving Australian waters, and she was sold again to John Manners &amp; Co of Sydney in 1953. The corvette was broken up for scrapping at Iron Cove in 1953.

<text>China United Network Communications Group (China Unicom) is a Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator. Originally founded as a wireless paging and GSM mobile operator, it currently provides a range of services including mobile network, long-distance, local calling, data communication, Internet services, and IP telephony. As of 2022, China Unicom is the third-largest wireless carrier in China and the sixth largest mobile provider in the world.

== History ==
China Unicom (then known as ) was founded as a state-owned enterprise in 1994 by the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Electronics and the Ministry of Electric Power Industry; the establishment was approved by the State Council in December 1993.

China Unicom was among six state-owned companies that built the communications infrastructure and assisted in financing the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&#x27;s Connecting Every Village Project, which began in 2004. The project aimed to promote universal telecommunications and internet access in rural China. The program successfully extended internet infrastructure throughout rural China and promoted development of the internet.

China Unicom has operated a CDMA network in Macau since October18, 2006 and internet services in North Korea since 2010. , the company had 125 million GSM subscribers and 43 million CDMA subscribers. As of November 2008 the CDMA operations have been moved to China Telecommunications Corporation (China Telecom Group). On 7 January 2009, China Unicom was awarded WCDMA license to expand its business to 3G telecommunication. UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) was launched in major cities across China on May 17, 2009.

On July 11, 2020, China Unicom joined hands with Lu Han to launch the &quot;FuLu Companion Card&quot;, which sounded the forward number for the further development of 5G. LuHan also officially unlocked his new identity and became a &quot;China Unicom Innovation Partner&quot;, with the &quot;FuLu companion card&quot; to bring exclusive benefits and surprises to the majority of Unicom users.

===IPOs===
In February 2000 a subsidiary &quot;China Unicom Hong Kong&quot; was incorporated in Hong Kong and was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on June 22, 2000.

The intermediate parent company &quot;China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited&quot; was &quot;China Unicom (BVI) Limited&quot;, , the BVI company owned 77.47% shares of China Unicom (H.K.). In turn, China Unicom (H.K.) owned the operating subsidiaries of the group. In 2002, another intermediate parent company &quot;China United Network Communications Limited&quot; was established in Shanghai (headquartered in Beijing), to own 51% stake of &quot;China Unicom (BVI) Limited&quot; as well as listing the shares in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. , state-owned China Unicom Group owned 74.6% shares of the A share company, in turn the A share company owned 73.84% of the BVI company. The BVI company owned 77.47% shares of the red chip company. To sum up, the Chinese Government via A share company, owned 42.67% stake of the operating subsidiaries, as well as additional 20.27% stake by the minority stake in the BVI company.

===Merger with China Netcom===
On June 2, 2008, China Unicom announced its intention to sell its CDMA business and assets to China Telecommunications Corporation (China Telecom Group) for a combined total of 110 billion RMB and to merge the remainder of the company, in a share swap valued at US$56.3 billion (based on Unicom&#x27;s stock last traded price) on June 2, 2008, with China Netcom. The CDMA business was officially moved to China Telecom in early November.

In July 2009, China Unicom signed a $700 million deal with infrastructure vendor Ericsson to upgrade the company&#x27;s GSM network.

In April 2012, China Unicom was a founding member in the formation of Cloud Computing Industry Alliance in Beijing. Other members of the alliance include Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba.

=== Partnership with Telefonica ===
In 2009, China Unicom (Hong Kong) agreed to a US$1 billion cross-holding with Spain&#x27;s Telefónica. In January 2011, the two partners agreed a further US$500 million tie-up in each other, which following completion in late 2011, Telefónica will hold a 9.7% shares in China Unicom (H.K.), while the red chip company will own 1.4% shares of the Spanish firm. The companies also agreed to deepen their cooperation in areas such as procurement, mobile service platforms, service to MNC&#x27;s wholesale carriers, roaming, technology, among others, where both companies have been cooperating since the signature of their strategic alliance agreement.

In June 2012, China United Network Communications Group (China Unicom Group), the ultimate parent company of Hong Kong listed company &quot;China Unicom (Hong Kong)&quot;, had agreed to buy back about 1.1 billion shares (approx. 4.6% of the share capital) of the red chip company from Telefónica for an approx. HK$11 billion. (HK$10.21 per share; by narrow band floating exchange rate approx. US$1.4 billion), via an unlisted subsidiary &quot;China Unicom Group Corporation (BVI) Limited&quot;. Immediate after the deal, Telefónica still owned 5% of China Unicom (H.K.). In 2014 Telefónica sold a further 2.5% shares of &quot;China Unicom (H.K.)&quot; for HK$6.66 billion (HK$11.14 per share).

During year 2016, Telefónica sold a further 1.51% shares of &quot;China Unicom (H.K.)&quot; for HK$2.822 billion (HK$7.8 per share), Telefónica owned 1% shares of the red chip company (decreased from 2.51% year-to-yearly), as well as Telefónica&#x27;s director César Alierta, still served as a director of &quot;China Unicom (H.K.)&quot;.

===Mixed-ownership reform of state-owned enterprise===
In 2017 China Unicom became one of the pilot projects of the mixed-ownership reform of the Chinese state-owned enterprise, which saw a decrease in the Government&#x27;s ownership.

In 2017 the Class A listed company of the group introduced ten strategic investors: state-controlled China Structural Reform Fund, state-controlled listed company China Life Insurance, a private equity fund () that was owned by China Cinda Asset Management and a company related to Tencent, a private equity fund partially owned by Baidu and Industrial Bank (), a private equity fund that related to JD.com (), a public company Ali Venture Capital (), a public company Suning Commerce Group and three minor private equity funds that was subscribed by companies such as Kuang-Chi and CRRC Group.

In the same year, the fund raised by the A share company was injected to the Hong Kong incorporated red chip company, via &quot;China Unicom (BVI) Limited&quot;, for HK$13.24 per share (for a maximum of 6.64 billion share / HK$88 billion).

=== Establishment of China Unicom Global Limited ===

On 2 December 2016, China Unicom Global Limited launched the “CUniq” overseas mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) service in London, UK and unveiled the one-card-multiple-number service.

=== U.S. sanctions ===

In October 2019, a group of U.S. senators urged the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to divest U.S. pension money from any investment in China Unicom for providing telecommunications services to disputed artificial islands in the South China Sea. In August 2020, the United States Department of Defense published a list of companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States with ties to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. China Unicom was included on the list.

In October 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requested the United States Department of Justice report whether China Unicom poses a &quot;national security risk&quot;.

In November 2020, the U.S. President issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. companies and individuals owning stocks that the United States Department of Defense deemed to have links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army - which included China Unicom. In consequence of the order, the New York Stock Exchange delisted China Unicom in January 2021.

In March 2021, the FCC initiated proceedings to revoke China Unicom&#x27;s authorization to operate in the U.S. due to &quot;national security&quot; concerns. In January 2022, the FCC revoked China Unicom&#x27;s authorization to operate in the United States, giving it 60 days to cease providing telecommunications services. In September 2022, the FCC added China Unicom to a list of companies considered &quot;national security threats&quot;.

In December 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected China Unicom&#x27;s challenge of the 2022 FCC revocation of its authorization to operate in the U.S.

=== Response to invasion of Ukraine ===
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, China United Network Communications Group continued its operations in Russia through its subsidiary, China Unicom (Russia) Operations Limited Liability Company, maintaining business as usual despite international sanctions and widespread corporate withdrawals. Research from the Yale School of Management placed the company in the &quot;Grade F&quot; category of &quot;Digging In,&quot; indicating that it has defied demands for exit or reduction of activities in Russia.

<doc id="451810" wikidata="Q5630362" url="?curid=451810" title="HMAS Gympie">
<text>HMAS &quot;Gympie&quot; (J238/M238), named for the city of Gympie, Queensland, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Gympie&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Gympie&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin &amp; Co at Brisbane, Queensland on 27 August 1941. She was launched on 30 January 1942 by Mrs Deakin, wife of the managing director, and commissioned into the RAN in Brisbane on 4 November 1942.

==Operational history==
From November 1942 to February 1944, &quot;Gympie&quot; escorted convoys off Australia&#x27;s east coast. While none of the convoys under her protection were attacked, she came to the aid of the torpedoed US ship &quot;Peter H. Burnett&quot; in January 1943. Following a refit &quot;Gympie&quot; was deployed to New Guinean waters in February 1944, where she was used for escort and anti-submarine patrol duties. She returned to Australia in February 1945 for a refit and was returned to New Guinea in July 1945.

Following the end of World War II, &quot;Gympie&quot; participated in surrender ceremonies at Dili on 24 September and Kupang on 3 October, after which she performed survey work in the area. In November, the corvette collided with the merchant vessel SS &quot;Tullahoma&quot;, and returned to Brisbane for minor repairs.

The ship received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Gympie&quot; was decommissioned into reserve in Brisbane on 23 May 1946. In early November 1947, she was towed to Sydney by sister ship &quot;Lithgow&quot;.

&quot;Gympie&quot; was sold for scrapping on 6 January 1961 to Kinoshita (Australia) Pty Ltd.

<text>China Telecommunications Corporation (), known as its trading name China Telecom, is a Chinese state-owned telecommunication company. It is the largest fixed-line service and the third largest mobile telecommunication provider in China.

The corporation has three listed companies: China Telecom Corporation Limited (), China Communications Services Corporation Limited (), and Besttone Holding Co., Ltd. ().

== History ==
The company originated as a government agency of the . On 27 April 1995, it was registered as a separate legal entity as Directorate General of Telecommunications, P&amp;T, China, using &quot;China Telecom&quot; as brand name. On 17 May 2000 it was registered as China Telecommunications Corporation. In May 2002, China Netcom Corporation was spun off as a separate company that was also supervised by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council directly. It also owned subsidiaries in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan and Shandong that formerly belonged to China Telecommunications Corporation. According to the United States Department of Defense, the company has links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

On 10 September 2002, a subsidiary, China Telecom, was listed. The listed company gradually acquired the assets from China Telecommunications Corporation. , however, China Telecommunications Corporation still owned the controlling stake in the company, for 70.89%.

In 2009 China Telecommunications Corporation received some of the assets of China Satellite Communications.

The company provides fixed-line and &quot;Xiaolingtong&quot; (Personal Handy-phone System) telephone services to 216 million people as of April 2008, and broadband internet access to over 38 million subscribers, providing approximately 62% (46 Gbit/s) of China&#x27;s internet bandwidth. On 2 June 2008, China Telecommunications Corporation announced that it would purchase China Unicom&#x27;s nationwide CDMA business and assets for , giving it 43 million mobile subscribers. According to the company, the listed portion of China Telecom Group (China Telecom Corp., Ltd.) paid , the unlisted portion of China Telecom Group (China Telecommunications Corporation) paid .

On 7 January 2009, China Telecommunications Corporation was awarded CDMA 2000 license to expand its business to 3G telecommunication.

=== U.S. sanctions===

In November 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting U.S. companies and individuals from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which included China Telecom. In consequence of the executive order, the New York Stock Exchange delisted China Telecom in January 2021.

In December 2020, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initiated proceedings to revoke China Telecom&#x27;s authorization to operate in the U.S. due to national security concerns. In October 2021, the FCC revoked China Telecom&#x27;s operating license in the U.S. In March 2022, the FCC designated a U.S. subsidiary of the company, China Telecom (Americas) Corp, a national security threat. In December 2024, the United States Department of Commerce moved to crack down on China Telecom&#x27;s cloud and internet routing business in the U.S.

== Consolidation and expansion ==
On 2 June 2008, the company announced it would acquire China Unicom&#x27;s CDMA business and network for in cash, a series of transactions aimed at transforming the company into a fully integrated telecommunications operator.

Such shifts mark a new era for the telecommunications industry in China in which analyst have further commented that these changes are aimed at promoting a more fair and competitive industry environment.

China Telecom was chosen by the Chinese Government as an investor in the Philippines for providing telecom services. They were later chosen as &#x27;provisional&#x27; telecommunications provider of the country after a bidding led by the Philippine government on November 7, 2018. As current laws restrict foreign ownership to 40%, China Telecom (through its parent company) forms a venture with local companies Udenna Corporation (owner of Phoenix Petroleum) and Chelsea Logistics under the franchise of Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc (or the Mislatel consortium). The selection was formalized on 20 November after the Philippine National Telecommunications Commission junked petitions from its rival bids. On 8 July 2019, Mislatel was renamed to Dito Telecommunity and at the same time, was granted its permit to operate. The firm began its commercial operations on 8 March 2021.

=== Subsidiaries ===

* Besttone Holding (58.45%, excluding shares held by China Telecom)
* China Communications Services
* China Telecom
* Dito Telecommunity (40% stake)

== Allegations of rerouted Internet traffic ==
On 8 April 2010, China Telecom rerouted about 15% of foreign Internet traffic through Chinese servers for 18 minutes. The traffic included the commercial websites of Dell, IBM, Microsoft, and Yahoo! as well as U.S. government and military sites. China Telecom denied hijacking any Internet traffic.

<doc id="451814" wikidata="Q52667" url="?curid=451814" title="Alberto Juantorena">
<text>Alberto Juantorena (born 3 December 1950) is a Cuban former runner. He is the only athlete to win both the 400 and 800 m Olympic titles, which he achieved in 1976. He was ranked as world&#x27;s best runner in the 400 m in 1974 and 1976–1978, and in the 800 m in 1976–77, and was chosen as the &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; Athlete of the Year in 1976 and 1977.

==Biography==

===Early sports activities===
As a 14-year-old, Juantorena was first considered a potential star at basketball; he was sent to a state basketball school, and was a member of the national team. Meanwhile, he had been a regional high-school champion at 800 and 1500 meters. His running talent was discovered by a Polish track coach, Zygmunt Zabierzowski, who convinced him to start running seriously. Juantorena was ready for the change because as he states himself he was a &#x27;bad&#x27; basketball player and his idol was the Cuban sprinter Enrique Figuerola. Only a year later, Juantorena reached the semifinals of the 400 m event at the 1972 Summer Olympics, missing a place in the final by 0.05 seconds.

Juantorena proceeded to win a gold medal at the 1973 World University Games and a silver at the 1975 Pan American Games, both in the 400 meters. He was unbeaten in 1973 and 1974, but underwent two operations on his foot in 1975. He only seriously took up running the 800 meters in 1976, so few thought he was a candidate for the Olympic gold that year. His coach, Zabierzowski, had initially tricked him in to trying an 800 m race by convincing him the other runners needed a pacemaker.

===Olympics 1976===
Juantorena made it to the 800m Olympic final, and led the field for most of the race, eventually winning in a world record time of 1:43.50. He was the first non-English speaking athlete to win Olympic gold in this event. Three days later, he also won the 400 meter final, setting a low-altitude world record at 44.26. By winning the 400 meters, he became the first athlete since Paul Pilgrim at the 1906 Intercalated Games to do such a double at an Olympic sports event, and was the only man to do so at an officially recognized Olympics.

===Subsequent athletics career===
In 1977, he set another world record in the 800, running 1:43.44 in Sofia at the World University Games. He also won both the 400 m and 800 m at the 1977 IAAF World Cup. The 400 m race was mired in controversy when the race was re-run a day after the initial race, in which Juantorena finished third, because Juantorena lodged a successful protest that his slow start had been due to not being able to hear the starter&#x27;s gun. The latter race featured an epic duel with his great rival Kenya&#x27;s Mike Boit, a duel that did not happen at the previous year&#x27;s Olympics because of the African countries boycott.

Juantorena, now known at home as &quot;El Caballo&quot; (&quot;the horse&quot;), continued his career, although injuries meant he would never reach the same level as in Montreal. Juantorena had been born with flat feet that caused feet and back problems, and he had to have corrective surgery in 1977. In 1978 he was unbeaten at the 400 m, but suffered his first ever defeat at 800 meters. Injuries, particularly hamstring injuries, hampered his training and racing leading up to the 1980 Moscow Olympics, where he just missed out on a medal in the 400 meters, placing fourth.

At the 1983 World Championships, his last international appearance in a major event, he broke his foot and tore ligaments when he stepped on the inside of the track after qualifying in the first round of the 800 m. He returned to training with a view to competing in the 1984 Summer Olympics. However the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott ended his last chance for competing at Olympics. Instead, he took part in the Friendship Games, the alternative to the official Olympics for the Eastern bloc countries, where he shared the gold medal in the 800 m with Ryszard Ostrowski.

===After retirement===
After retirement from athletics in 1984, Juantorena has served in many official capacities, including as the Vice President of the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education and Recreation for Cuba, Vice Minister for Sport of Cuba, and vice-president, later Senior Vice-president of the Cuban Olympic Committee. He is a member of the World Athletics Council, and has also served as an Athletes&#x27; Commission Chairman and Grand Prix Commission Member.

==Personal life==
Juantorena was first married in 1972 to Yria, a former gymnast, with whom he had two children; He married twice more before meeting his current wife Yolanda, an employee of Cubana de Aviación. He has seven children in total. His nephew Osmany Juantorena is a professional volleyball player. In 2021 Juantorena was the subject of a feature documentary &quot;Running for the Revolution&quot; produced by British filmmaker Mark Craig. https://worldathletics.org/news/news/alberto-juantorena-running-for-the-revolution-film-release

==International competitions==

1Representing the Americas&lt;br&gt;
2Did not start in the semifinals

==Rankings==
Juantorena was ranked among the best in the world in both the 400 and 800 m sprint events over the spread of 10 seasons from 1973 to 1982, according to the experts of &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;.

<doc id="451817" wikidata="Q1516852" url="?curid=451817" title="Taxi (2004 film)">
<text>Taxi is a 2004 action comedy film directed by Tim Story and starring Queen Latifah, Jimmy Fallon, Gisele Bündchen in her film debut, Jennifer Esposito, and Ann-Margret. An incompetent New York City police officer is banned from driving and comes to rely on a talented taxi driver to help him solve a series of bank robberies. The film is a remake of the 1998 French film of the same name and was panned by critics.

The film is set in New York City. In the film, a demoted police detective convinces a taxicab driver to help him track down a Brazilian gang of bank robbers, and to find out how the gang transports the stolen money. The detective is soon fired for insubordination, but the duo proceed in confronting the gang.

==Plot==

Bicycle courier Belle Williams earns her taxi license and installs a supercharger in her custom-built 1999 Ford Crown Victoria taxicab. Her first customer offers her a $100 tip if she can make it to the Airport in fifteen minutes. She does, with incredible speed and skill in the process, maneuvering through the streets of New York City.

Meanwhile, bumbling detective Andy Washburn crashes his partner&#x27;s car while on a mission to apprehend a group of robbers, and is demoted to foot patrol duty by his boss Lt. Marta Robbins, who is also his ex-girlfriend. Hearing of a bank robbery, Washburn flags down Belle&#x27;s taxicab. They arrive at the bank just as a quartet of female Brazilian robbers leave in a BMW E65. Belle recognizes them as models she saw earlier at the airport. Police arrive and mistakenly apprehend Belle and Washburn. Belle&#x27;s cab is impounded, and she is questioned. Washburn promises to get her cab back if she helps him solve the bank robberies.

Washburn takes Belle to his home after her boyfriend Jesse kicks her out for missing a dinner date. Washburn&#x27;s constantly drunk mother brings up embarrassing moments of Washburn&#x27;s past and talks about why he is such a bad driver. Washburn convinces the impound cop to return Belle&#x27;s cab. They realize the gang robs banks just before the garbage collection is due, placing the money in the trash, which the garbage man then collects. Washburn is fired for disobeying orders, and Belle is given a final warning for reckless driving. Belle teaches Washburn to drive, and they discover the garbage collector is acting for the gang because they have kidnapped his wife. They recover the garbage collector&#x27;s wife and all the loot.

The police learn which bank is next to be hit and ambush the robbers, who take Lt. Robbins hostage and escape, followed by Washburn and Belle in her cab. Belle calls on the help of her bicycle courier friends to pinpoint the car. They negotiate a trade of the cash from the garbage truck for Robbins, and try to swap the hostage for the money while driving down the highway. Washburn forces the robbers down a long bridge under construction.

The robbers&#x27; leader, Vanessa, fires her gun at them and wounds Belle. While the police arrest Vanessa, Washburn drives Belle to the hospital, singing &quot;This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)&quot;. He crashes into the hospital, so Belle can be quickly recovered.

Belle achieves her dream of driving in NASCAR, sponsored by New York banks. Washburn is reinstated for foiling the robberies. Washburn&#x27;s mother and Robbins attend Belle&#x27;s first race to cheer her on. Jesse proposes to Belle. As Belle begins the race, Jeff Gordon pulls up as a challenger.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 9% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Silly and unfunny remake of a French movie of the same name.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;How one likes &quot;Taxi&quot; has everything to do with how one responds to the hapless cop character, played by Jimmy Fallon.&quot; LaSalle was also critical of the car chases, calling them &quot;lackluster and fairly unconvincing.&quot; Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote: &quot;This thoroughly repetitive, ill conceived and poorly executed effort—with an emphasis on the word &#x27;effort&#x27;—defeats these two talented people more often than not.&quot;

Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;embarrassing evidence that even a ragged French original can be better than its American remake. Failing to improve on the inept but hugely successful 1998 Luc Besson vehicle.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; states &quot;Oh, this is a bad movie&quot; and &quot;only gets worse as it plows along.&quot; Megan Lehmann of the &quot;New York Post&quot; dubbed the film &quot;Taxi Drivel&quot; and said: &quot;This witless action comedy begins to insult the audience&#x27;s intelligence from the opening scene.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote: &quot;A surprisingly funny, female-driven romp—as long as you don&#x27;t question too many plot particulars.&quot;

<text>Rocky Mountain oysters or mountain oysters, or meat balls, also known as prairie oysters in Canada (), is a dish made of bull testicles. The organs are often deep-fried after being skinned, coated in flour, pepper and salt, and sometimes pounded flat. The dish is most often served as an appetizer.

==Description==
The dish is served in parts of Canada, where cattle ranching is prevalent and castration of young male animals is common. &quot;Prairie oysters&quot; is the preferred name in Canada where they are served in a demi-glace. In Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, they are often called calf fries. In Spain, Argentina and many parts of Mexico, they are referred to as &quot;criadillas&quot;, and they are colloquially referred to as &quot;huevos de toro&quot; (literally, &quot;bull’s eggs&quot;; besides its literal meaning, &quot;huevos&quot; is a Spanish slang term for testicles) in Central and South America. Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes confused because of their appearance with cattle fries or animelles (cattle testicles), which are served in a similar manner. A few other terms, such as &quot;cowboy caviar&quot;, &quot;Montana tendergroins&quot;, &quot;dusted nuts&quot;, &quot;swinging beef&quot;, or simply &quot;mountain oysters&quot; may be used.

The dish, purportedly cowboy fare, is most commonly found served at festivals, amongst ranching families, or at certain specialty eating establishments and bars. They are, however, also readily available at some public venues (e.g., at Coors Field during Colorado Rockies baseball games). Eagle, Idaho, claims to have the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Rocky Mountain Oyster Feed&quot; during its Eagle Fun Days (now held the second weekend in July). Clinton, Montana; Deerfield, Michigan; Huntley, Illinois; Sesser, Illinois; Olean, Missouri; Severance, Colorado; and Tiro, Ohio also hold testicle festivals. Virginia City, Nevada holds a Rocky Mountain Oyster Fry in conjunction with St. Patrick&#x27;s Day each year. Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes served as a prank to those unaware of the origin of these &quot;oysters&quot;. They are also considered to be an aphrodisiac by many people.

The primary goal of testicle removal is not culinary. Castration in veterinary practice and animal husbandry is common and serves a variety of purposes, including the control of breeding, the growth of skeletal muscle suitable for beef, and temperament alteration.

==Similar dishes==

Testicles from other animals can also be used in similar dishes. The most common is lamb fries (not to be confused with lamb&#x27;s fry which is another term for liver of lamb) made with testicles from castrated sheep. In some cases, pig testicles are used as well to make &quot;pig fries&quot;.

Another dish found on occasion is turkey fries made from turkey testes. These are sometimes known as &quot;short fries&quot; as well.

<text>Southern Indiana is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises the southern third of the U.S. state of Indiana and borders the states of Illinois to the west, Kentucky to the south, and Ohio to the east. Spanning the state&#x27;s southernmost 33 counties, its main population centers include Southwestern Indiana (anchored by the city of Evansville), the Louisville metropolitan area (south), and the Cincinnati metropolitan area (southeast). The region&#x27;s history and geography have led to a blending of Southern and Midwestern cultures, distinct from the rest of the state. It is often considered to be part of the Upland South and the Southern influenced Lower Midwest.

The Wabash and Ohio rivers form the region&#x27;s western and southern boundaries, respectively. Elevation ranges from around above mean sea level at the rivers&#x27; confluence to at the highest point in the Knobstone Escarpment. Southern Indiana&#x27;s topography is considerably more varied than Central and Northern Indiana, including large tracts of forest, rolling hills, and karst caves. The region is also home to the oldest exposed Devonian fossil beds in the world at the Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area. Situated in the Wabash Valley seismic zone, Southwestern Indiana is at elevated risk for earthquakes.

Southern Indiana, home to about 1.4 million people, was the first area of the state to be settled by European colonists. Founded in 1732, Vincennes is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in Indiana and served as the first capital of the Indiana Territory; Corydon would later serve as the state&#x27;s first capital. Protected areas include Charles C. Deam Wilderness Area, George Rogers Clark National Historical Park, Hoosier National Forest, and the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial. Southern Indiana is home to about a dozen higher education institutions, including Indiana University Bloomington, the flagship campus of the Indiana University system. The Catholic Church has a significant presence in the region, including Saint Meinrad Archabbey, the Monastery Immaculate Conception, and Mount Saint Francis. The region is split between the Eastern and Central time zones.

==Geography==
===Sub-regions===

====Kentuckiana====

Kentuckiana, a portmanteau of &quot;Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot;, is a loosely defined sub-region of the Upland South that spans north-central Kentucky and Southern Indiana&#x27;s south-central counties. It is primarily centered on the Louisville metropolitan area. Counties typically considered part of the Kentuckiana sub-region include:

*Clark
*Crawford
*Floyd

Southern dialect and South Midland dialect of American English are prevalent, as opposed to the Inland North dialect in far Northern Indiana and the North Midland dialect in Central and North-Central Indiana. Southern Indiana is the northernmost extent of the South Midland region, forming what linguists refer to as the &quot;Hoosier Apex&quot; of the South Midland dialect.

==Educational institutions==

About 12 accredited institutions of higher education are located throughout Southern Indiana, including some private, liberal arts colleges and multiple public university campuses, including the flagship campus of the Indiana University system, IU Bloomington.

<text>Sir Peter Frank Hannibal Emery (27 February 1926 – 9 December 2004) was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
Emery was born in London, but was evacuated to the United States during World War II. He was educated at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in New Jersey, graduating in 1943, before serving with the Royal Air Force. He attended Oriel College, Oxford. While at Oriel he founded the political group &quot;United Europe&quot; with Edward Boyle, Peter Kirk, and Dick Taverne. He was librarian of the Oxford Union.

Emery was a councillor on Hornsey Borough Council, chairing the housing committee. He was a school governor and a member of the executive committee of the London Municipal Society.

==Parliamentary career==
He stood for Parliament without success in Poplar at the 1951 general election and Lincoln. He first gained a seat in parliament at the 1959 general election, when he famously ousted trade unionist Ian Mikardo—of whose union Emery was a member—from his Reading seat. He became a founding member of the Bow Group. In the 1964 general election, his majority was just 10 votes.

After being defeated in Reading in the 1966 general election, Emery returned the following year by winning a by-election in Honiton. He represented that seat and its successor East Devon until stepping down at the 2001 general election, having served 40 years in Parliament. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1993.

Emery spent most of his long political career as a backbencher, although he did serve as a junior Energy minister under Edward Heath, which included oversight of the notorious three day week and, during his final term, served as treasurer of the powerful 1922 Committee. Emery was a freemason.

<text>EuroTrip is a 2004 American teen sex comedy film written and directed by Jeff Schaffer, Alec Berg and David Mandel. It stars Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Michelle Trachtenberg and Travis Wester.

Mechlowicz portrays Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Thomas, an American high school graduate who travels across Europe in search of his German pen pal, Mieke (Boehrs). Accompanied by his friend Cooper (Pitts) and twin siblings Jenny and Jamie (Trachtenberg and Wester), Scott&#x27;s quest takes him to England, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Germany, and Italy, encountering awkward, humorous, and embarrassing situations along the way.

&quot;EuroTrip&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. However, it became successful upon its release on home video.

==Plot==
In the town of Hudson, Ohio, Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Thomas is dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona, immediately after his high school graduation. With his best friend, Cooper Harris, Scotty attends a graduation party that evening, where the band performs a song (&quot;Scotty Doesn&#x27;t Know&quot;) detailing the affair Fiona was having with the band&#x27;s singer, Donny (played by Matt Damon). Scotty returns home drunk and angry and reads an email from his German pen pal, Mieke—who Scotty calls &quot;Mike&quot;—expressing sympathy for Scotty and suggesting they meet in person. Cooper suggests that &quot;Mike&quot; may be a sexual predator and Scotty tells Mieke to stay away from him. Scotty&#x27;s younger brother, Bert, informs him that &quot;Mieke&quot; is actually a common German feminine name. Realizing Mieke is a girl and he has feelings for her, Scotty tries to contact her again, but she blocks his email address. Scotty decides to travel to Europe with Cooper to find Mieke and apologize in person.

Scotty and Cooper first arrive in London, where they befriend a Manchester United football hooligan firm, led by Mad Maynard. After a night of drinking, Scotty and Cooper wake up on a bus on their way to Paris with the hooligans. In Paris, they meet up with their classmates, Jenny and Jamie, fraternal twins who are touring Europe together. Jenny and Jamie decide to accompany Scotty and Cooper to find Mieke in Berlin. The group travels to Amsterdam, where Jamie is robbed while receiving oral sex in an alley, losing everyone&#x27;s money, passports, and train tickets. They attempt to hitchhike to Berlin, but due to a language misunderstanding, they end up in Bratislava. Finding a great exchange rate with the U.S. dollar, the group goes to a nightclub. Drunk on absinthe, Jenny and Jamie make out with each other, witnessed by Scotty and Cooper, and are horrified when they realize what they are doing. The next day, a Slovak man drives them to Berlin. Scotty and Cooper learns that Mieke has left with a summer tour group, and will be reachable in Rome for only a short time. Jamie sells his Leica Camera for plane tickets to Rome to find Mieke.

In Rome, the group heads to Vatican City, where Mieke is touring before her summer at sea. Inside the Vatican, Scotty and Cooper search for Mieke and accidentally rings the bell of San Marco, which signals the Pope has died. Scotty appears on a balcony and spots Mieke in the cheering crowd below, who have mistaken him for the newly elected pope; all this happens while the current pope is watching everyone. The Swiss guards realize what is going on and detain Scotty and Cooper for their actions. However, the Manchester United football hooligans from London suddenly appear at the Vatican and demand the guards to release Scotty and Cooper. Scotty finally introduces himself to Mieke and confesses his love. Mieke is happy to see him, and they have sex in a confessional booth before she leaves on her trip. On the flight back to Ohio, Jenny and Cooper give into their urges and have sex in the plane&#x27;s lavatory, while Jamie stays in Europe after being hired by Arthur Frommer.

Scotty moves to Oberlin College in the fall term to begin his studies. During his phone conversation with Cooper, who is dating Jenny, Cooper asks what Scotty&#x27;s new roommate looks like. Mieke knocks on the door of his room, having been assigned to the same room because of another misunderstanding about her name. Scotty and Mieke embrace and get into bed together, with Cooper calling for Scott on the other end of a still-open cell phone call and the film&#x27;s closing with the Absinthe Green Fairy wondering at his own lack of a sex life.

==Cast==
* Scott Mechlowicz as Scott &quot;Scotty&quot; Thomas: A recent high school graduate who inadvertently makes the mistake of thinking his German pen pal Mieke to be a homosexual man, thanks to his limited fluency in speaking German. When he finds out that Mieke is in reality an attractive woman, Scotty travels across Europe to Berlin to beg for her forgiveness. Mechlowicz described Scotty as a flawed but kindhearted man, who is &quot;very lucky to have such a good group of friends to prop him back up&quot;.
* Jacob Pitts as Cooper Harris: Scotty&#x27;s raunchy, libidinous best friend. Pitts described Cooper as a hypersexual man who is &quot;driven by his own base impulses ... which gets everyone else into trouble.&quot;
* Michelle Trachtenberg as Jenny: Scotty and Cooper&#x27;s friend and twin sister of Jamie. Trachtenberg described Jenny as both book savvy and a risk-taker. &quot;She is more willing to take a chance or go on an adventure, whereas Jamie always has to be convinced&quot;, said Trachtenberg.
* Travis Wester as Jamie: Jenny&#x27;s twin brother. Wester described Jamie as a lifelong learner whose aspiration is &quot;the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge&quot;.
* Jessica Boehrs as Mieke Schmidt: Scotty&#x27;s German pen pal. Boehrs made her film debut with &quot;EuroTrip&quot;.

The cast also includes Vinnie Jones as Mad Maynard (leader of the Manchester United football hooligans), Lucy Lawless as Madame Vandersexxx (a sex-club dominatrix), Patrick Malahide as Arthur Frommer, Diedrich Bader as Mugger, Fred Armisen as Creepy Italian Guy, Kristin Kreuk as Fiona (Scotty&#x27;s ex-girlfriend), Nial Iskhakov as Bert Thomas (Scotty&#x27;s younger brother), Matt Damon as Donny (Fiona&#x27;s new boyfriend), J.P. Manoux as Robot Man, and Steve Hytner as the Absinthe Green Fairy. Jeffrey Tambor (uncredited) and Cathy Meils were cast as Mr. and Mrs. Thomas, respectively.

==Production==
Writers Mandel, Berg, and Schaffer all directed, but the Directors Guild of America forbade them from sharing the credit. Schaffer earned the honor of receiving sole credit when a production assistant picked his name out of a hat.

All scenes were filmed in Prague, Czech Republic. The opening scenes set in Ohio were filmed at the International School of Prague. The scene where the main characters are boarding at the Paris railway station was filmed in Prague&#x27;s main railway station (Praha hlavní nádraží). The scene inside Vatican City was actually filmed in National Museum in Prague. The scenes with a German lorry driver were taken at the then-unfinished D5 motorway near Plzeň. Matt Damon was filming &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot; in Prague and agreed to play the punk singer; as he wore a wig for &quot;Grimm&quot;, Damon could shave his head for &quot;EuroTrip&quot;. Arthur Frommer was initially approached to cameo as himself in the film; due to scheduling difficulties the role would ultimately be played by Patrick Malahide.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;EuroTrip&quot; a 47% rating based on 120 reviews, and an average of 5.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus says, &quot;A trip worth taking if one&#x27;s not offended by gratuitous nudity and bad taste.&quot; On Metacritic, the film scored 45 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In her review for &quot;Salon&quot;, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, &quot;The giddy ridiculousness of &quot;Eurotrip&quot; is a pleasant surprise: The picture starts out slow and unsteady in its rhythms. But just when you begin to wonder if it’s ever going to get funny, or if it’s going to be merely desperate all the way through, it lifts off like a wobbly helicopter—and somehow it keeps flying.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell wrote that &quot;almost every girl in the movie with fewer than 10 lines to speak has to take her top off.&quot; In his review for &quot;Village Voice&quot;, Michael Miller criticized the film for its &quot;constant anxiety that women might turn out to be men and vice versa.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was released in the United States and Canada on February 20, 2004, in 2,512 theaters. Over its opening weekend, the film grossed $6.7 million. It went on to gross $17.8 million in the United States and Canada and $3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $20.8 million.

===Home media ===
The film was released on DVD in the U.S. on June 1, 2004, in an R-rated theatrical version (90 minutes) and an &quot;Unrated&quot; extended version (92 minutes). The theatrical version was released on Blu-ray in 2013. The &quot;Unrated&quot; extended edition was released on Blu-Ray in 2022.

===Legacy===
Although not as successful at the box office as the producers&#x27; &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2000), &quot;EuroTrip&quot; did well on home video and became a cult classic. Ultra Culture blogger Charlie Lyne, who introduced a screening of the film in 2011 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, wrote in 2012 that &quot;&quot;EuroTrip&quot; is satire at its most brazenly self-loathing and audaciously entertaining&quot;.

Damon reportedly has said that despite appearing in notable films like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, and the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise, fans often repeat &quot;Scotty doesn&#x27;t know!&quot; to him.

<text>Edward Rowlands, Baron Rowlands (born 23 January 1940) is a Welsh politician, who served as a Labour Party Member of Parliament for over thirty years, including a period as a junior minister in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Education==
He attended Rhondda Grammar School and Wirral Grammar School, and then King&#x27;s College London, where he obtained a BA in History in 1962.

==Political career==
Rowlands was first elected to the Commons at the 1966 general election as Member of Parliament for Cardiff North, but lost his seat at the 1970 election. He was elected to represent Merthyr Tydfil at the 1972 by-election called after the death of the long-standing MP S. O. Davies. Rowlands served as Member of Parliament for Merthyr Tydfil until the constituency boundaries were redrawn and renamed for the 1983 general election, when he was returned for the new Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney constituency. He was returned at three further elections before he stepped down at the 2001 general election.

He had served as a junior minister in Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Welsh Office from 1969 to 1970, and again from 1974 to 1975, when he was appointed to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. From 1976, under James Callaghan&#x27;s premiership, he was Minister of State at the Foreign Office until Labour was defeated at the 1979 general election.

In a debate on the Falklands War on 3 April 1982, Rowlands revealed that the British were reading Argentine diplomatic traffic. Rowlands was criticised (but not prosecuted as per parliamentary privilege) for revealing this intelligence source, as the likely result of his disclosure was that the Argentinians would secure their systems and the intelligence would dry up.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours, and on 28 June 2004 was created a life peer, as Baron Rowlands, of Merthyr Tydfil and of Rhymney in the County of Mid-Glamorgan. In the House of Lords, as of July 2019, he is a member of the EU Justice Sub-Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.

Lord Rowlands sat on the Richard Commission which reported on 31 March 2004 on whether the National Assembly for Wales should have additional legislative powers.

<text>The Fifth Child is a short novel by the British writer Doris Lessing, first published in the United Kingdom in 1988, and since translated into several languages. It describes the changes in the happy life of a married couple, Harriet and David Lovatt, as a consequence of the birth of Ben, their fifth child. A sequel, &quot;Ben, in the World&quot; (2000) recounts Ben&#x27;s life after he has left his family.

==Plot summary==

When David Lovatt meets Harriet at a party, they both immediately fall in love. They both share the same conservative outlooks, which they perceive to be a rarity in the immoral London of the 1960s.

The two marry and purchase a large house in a small town within commuting distance of London. The couple intends to have several children—a wish frowned upon by the rest of the family. By the time they have four children–two boys and two girls–their house becomes a centre of joy not only for them but for all their relatives and friends who come and visit. This continues until Harriet has a fifth, wildly dysfunctional child, Ben. Her painful pregnancy with him marks the beginning of the misery and suffering that this child brings to the whole family.

<doc id="451830" wikidata="Q693593" url="?curid=451830" title="White-tailed kite">
<text>The white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) is a small raptor found in western North America and parts of South America. It replaces the related Old World black-winged kite in its native range.

==Taxonomy==
The white-tailed kite was described in 1818 by the French ornithologist, someone who studies birds, Louis Pierre Vieillot under the binomial name &quot;Milvus leucurus&quot; with the type locality as Paraguay. It is now one of four species in the genus &quot;Elanus&quot; which was introduced in 1809 by the French zoologist Jules-César Savigny. The word &quot;Elanus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;elanos&quot; for a &quot;kite&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;leucurus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;leukouros&quot; for &quot;white-tailed&quot;: &quot;leukos&quot; is &quot;white&quot; and &quot;oura&quot; is &quot;tail&quot;.

For some recent decades, it was lumped with the black-winged kite of Europe and Africa as &quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot; and was collectively called black-shouldered kite.[4] However, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union accepted a more recent argument that the white-tailed kite differed from the Old-World species in size, shape, plumage, and behavior, and that these differences were sufficient to warrant full species status.[5] Thus, the white-tailed kite was returned to its original name. Meanwhile, the Old World &quot;E. caeruleus&quot; is once again called black-winged kite, while the name black-shouldered kite is now reserved for an Australian species, &quot;Elanus axillaris&quot;, which had also been lumped into &quot;E. caeruleus&quot; but is now regarded as separate again.

==Description==
The coloration of the white-tailed kite is gull-like, but its shape and flight is falcon-like, with a rounded tail. While it has white faces and white underparts, it has black wingtips, beaks, and shoulders. Contrastingly, the white-tailed kite has deep red eyes that stand out at night. A mid-sized kite, it measures in length, spans across the wings and weighs . Both the wings and tail are relatively elongated, and the tarsus measures around .

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-tailed kite was rendered almost extinct in California in the 1930s and 1940s due to shooting and egg-collecting, but they are now common again. Their distribution is patchy, however. They can be found in Central Valley and southern coastal areas, open land around Goleta including the Ellwood Mesa Open Space, marshes in Humboldt County, and also around the San Francisco Bay. Elsewhere in California, they are still rare or absent. Although they are not migratory birds, they are also found from southern Texas and eastern Mexico to the Baja California Peninsula and through Central and South America to central Argentina and Chile. 
Globally, they are not considered threatened species by the IUCN. On rare occasions the bird can be found far outside its usual range. At different times, two had been sighted in New England as of 2010.

White-tailed kites typically nest at the top of trees, usually around 20 to 50 feet above ground level. These nests can be in open-country trees growing in isolation, or at the edge of or within a forest. Their nests are built from medium-sized sticks and twigs, grasses, weeds, hay, and moss and are measured about 21 inches across with a cup that is around 7 inches across and 4 inches deep.

==Behaviour==
The white-tailed kite is famously known for &quot;kiting,&quot; hovering in a position by facing into the wind and fluttering its wings. Although it may seem like irrelevant behavior at first, it does serve a purpose for hunting. While hovering around 80 feet in the air, it tips its head down to look for small mammals moving in the grass below. When prey is spotted, it dives down, quickly grabs the animal with its talons, and flies back up to eat. 

White-tailed kites feed principally on rodents (as well as small opossums, shrews, reptiles, amphibians and large insects), and they are readily seen patrolling or hovering over lowland scrub or grassland. They rarely if ever eat other birds, and even in open cerrado, mixed-species feeding flocks will generally ignore them. Most of the hunted insects are consumed on the wing while flying. This means that instead of returning to a perch to feed, these birds transfer the prey from their talons to their beaks while flying to eat. In the case of larger prey such as rodents and lizards, they will fly to a perch to pluck and eat.

Outside the breeding season during the winter, they roost, congregate or settle to rest at night, communally in groups of up to 100. However, once mating formally begins with the construction of nests by both males and females in mid-February, the female kite abstains from hunting for the time being and stays in the nest to incubate the eggs while the male brings food back to the nest for the female and children. This incubation period lasts around 26-32 days and they lay around 4 to 5 eggs at a time. Their eggs are cream-colored with splotches of light and dark brown. Once they have hatched, it takes them around 35-40 days to develop the proper feathers and start learning how to fly. 

White-tailed kites have been observed in aerial combat at the margins of territories, locking talons in a behavior described as &quot;grappling&quot;. This is most often done during mating season as an act of dominance when the male Kite patrols the nest. They will typically slash and peck at intruding birds until one of the birds backs down or falls. 

== Threats ==
Their predators are primarily other birds like red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons, and great-horned owls. Meanwhile, smaller birds like American crows, common ravens, and small to medium-sized carnivores will go for the eggs of white-tailed kites. 

Deforestation and urban expansions have caused the number of white-tailed kites to decrease as they lose suitable places to live and truly thrive. Climate change also impacts the white-tailed kite population as heat waves in the spring put young birds at risk as their bodies are not developed enough to properly regulate their body temperature and can die from dehydration.

<doc id="451835" wikidata="Q3826712" url="?curid=451835" title="Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp">
<text>Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp is an American action/adventure comedy television series originally aired Saturday mornings on ABC from September 12, 1970, to January 2, 1971, and rebroadcast the following season. The live-action film series featured a cast of chimpanzees given apparent speaking roles by overdubbing with human voices.

==Production==
&quot;Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp&quot; had a &quot;seven-figure budget&quot; with location filming, props and costumes, and the laborious staging and training of the animals. The filmmakers made the most of the budget, staging multiple episodes with the same settings and wardrobe, occasionally reusing the more elaborate chase footage. Lance Link drove a 1970 Datsun Sports 2000 while villain Baron Von Butcher (and his chauffeur Creto) used a late-&#x27;50s Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. The primates themselves rode Kawasaki MB-1 Coyote minibikes in a number of episodes.

Two of the three producers/creators were Stan Burns and Mike Marmer, former writers for &quot;Get Smart!&quot; Both resigned from their jobs as head writers on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; to work on &quot;Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp.&quot;

According to &quot;The Believer,&quot; &quot;to make the dialogue fit the chimps’ lip action, Burns and Marmer went to ridiculous lengths. Voiceovers were ad-libbed on the set, giving birth to beautifully absurd moments of the chimps breaking into songs at the end of sentences or spontaneously reciting Mother Goose rhymes just so it would look right.&quot; Co-producer Allan Sandler explained that the writers studied the silent film footage of the chimps, and counted the syllables as the chimps&#x27; mouths moved. The writers would then shorten or lengthen the scripted lines according to the syllable count.

==Plot construction==
Owing considerable lineage to &quot;Get Smart&quot;, the plot was always played for laughs and featured Lancelot Link and his female colleague, &quot;Mata Hairi,&quot; whose own name in turn was a play on Mata Hari, in secret agent and spy satires. Link and Hairi worked for A.P.E., the Agency to Prevent Evil, in an ongoing conflict with the evil organization C.H.U.M.P., the Criminal Headquarters for Underworld Master Plan (sic).

APE&#x27;s chief Darwin gave Link and Hairi their orders after explaining his &quot;theory&quot; about each crime-in-progress, a play on the Darwin theory of ape-to-human evolution. CHUMP&#x27;s monocled chief Baron von Butcher inevitably hatched the latest plan to endanger the world. The Baron&#x27;s network of international bad guys included his shifty chauffeur Creto, mad scientist Dr. Strangemind, imperious Dragon Woman, drowsy Wang Fu, singing sheikh Ali Assa Seen, and the cultured Duchess. One or more of these bad guys would appear in each episode.

A regular weekly feature, during the intermission between spy stories, was chimpanzee TV host &quot;Ed Simian&quot; (styled as an impersonation of Ed Sullivan of the popular &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;) introducing a musical number by an all-chimpanzee band, &quot;The Evolution Revolution.&quot; The second intermission feature was &quot;Chimpies&quot;, a short series of comedy blackouts similar to the &quot;Crazy Shots&quot; gags that writers Stan Burns and Mike Marmer had created for Steve Allen&#x27;s TV show. The Chimpies repertoire: &quot;Freddie and Joe&quot;, two chimps in loud suits as burlesque comedians, telling riddles; &quot;Monk the Magician&quot;, a chimp producing streams of handkerchiefs and other objects from his coat; &quot;Herman and Sherman&quot;, a chimp and a miniature-chimp ventriloquist dummy; and &quot;Sneezes&quot;, showing a chimp sneezing and other chimps reacting to it.

==The characters==

===A.P.E.===
* Lancelot Link (played by Tonga, voiced by Dayton Allen imitating Humphrey Bogart). His surname is a play on &#x27;The Missing Link&#x27;.
* Mata Hairi (played by Debbie, voiced by Joan Gerber). Mata spoke in a high, whiny voice reminiscent of the Dumb Dora comediennes of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. Her name was a take-off on Mata Hari.
* Commander Darwin (voiced by Dayton Allen). Named after Charles Darwin.
* Bruce - Official A.P.E. courier.

===C.H.U.M.P.===
* Baron von Butcher (voiced by Bernie Kopell). Modeled on Kopell&#x27;s character of &quot;Siegfried&quot; in the television show &quot;Get Smart!&quot; Kopell is believed to have approached his voicings of the Baron as if Siegfried were the head of KAOS.
* The Dragon Woman (voiced by Joan Gerber in a precise dialect). Her name was a take-off on the Dragon Lady, a villainess in the Terry and the Pirates comic-strip series.
* Creto (voiced by Bernie Kopell). His name was basically a play on the word &quot;cretin.&quot; Also a play on Kato, the Green Hornet&#x27;s chauffeur and crime-fighting &quot;sidekick&quot;.
* Wang Fu (voiced by Bernie Kopell). His name was a play on Kung Fu.
* The Duchess (voiced by Joan Gerber with cultured diction).
* Ali Assa Seen (voiced and sung by Dayton Allen). His last name was meant to sound like &quot;assassin.&quot;
* Dr. Strangemind (voiced by Dayton Allen impersonating Béla Lugosi). Name inspired by Dr. Strangelove.

===Additional characters===
* Marty Mandrill III - Former songwriter for The Evolution Revolution turned C.H.U.M.P. spy.
* Unnamed Orangutan - Appeared in cameos as a picturesque extra. Often referred to by Lance as &quot;that weirdo.&quot;
* Ernest Finster - English writer who was captured by C.H.U.M.P.
* Blackie - The drummer in The Evolution Revolution.
* Parnelli Smith (voice: Dayton Allen) An auto-racing champion and supplier of cars to A.P.E., his name was a take-off on former Indy 500 champion Parnelli Jones.
* Bart Sparks (voice: Bernie Kopell) Emcee of the Miss Globe beauty contest (parody of Miss America host Bert Parks).
* Raquel Wench (voice: Joan Gerber, imitating Mae West) Screen star making an appearance at the road races. Parody of Raquel Welch.
* Herman - C.H.U.M.P. henchman.

==The Evolution Revolution==
This all-chimp band, dressed in colorful hippie-style wigs and wardrobe, featured Lancelot Link (played by Tonga) on guitar and Mata Hairi (played by Debbie) on tambourine, with Blackie as &quot;Bananas Marmoset&quot; on the drums. &quot;SweetWater Gibbons&quot; (in fringed vest and granny glasses) was credited for playing Farfisa organ, although the organ usually pictured in the clips was a Vox Continental organ.

In the episode &quot;The Evolution Revolution&quot;, it was established that the band&#x27;s music was used to communicate coded messages for A.P.E. agents.

The songs were usually co-written and performed by Steve Hoffman, in the bubblegum pop style then in vogue; Hoffman received &quot;voices&quot; credit along with the various character actors. A Lancelot Link record album was released on ABC Records, as well as a single titled &quot;Sha-La Love You&quot;, a song originally intended for The Grass Roots; the music shared some of its style with the music of The Grass Roots, who used the same recording facilities and studio musicians. Steve Barri, who is listed as producer on the album, was the co-creator and long-time producer of The Grass Roots as well.

==Episodes== 
The show&#x27;s first-season episodes were an hour long, and also included Warner Bros. cartoon shorts from that animation studio&#x27;s final years. The second season consisted of repeats from the first season with the cartoons removed. The original network broadcast included a laugh track; this was later removed for the syndicated and video releases.

The series consisted of 17 episodes (standard practice at the time for the ABC network, allowing for each episode to be broadcast three times per year). Each episode featured two Lance Link stories, plus a band number and Chimpies sketches.

The Comedy Channel (now Comedy Central) aired reruns of this as well as Gerry Anderson stop-motion series &quot;Dick Spanner, P.I.&quot; in a block hosted by detective-themed stand-up comedian Tommy Sledge.
