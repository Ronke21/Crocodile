<text>San Pedro, officially the City of San Pedro (), is a component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 326,001 people.

It is named after its patron saint, Saint Peter.

San Pedro has been dubbed as “dormitory town” of Metro Manila and migrants from other provinces commuting everyday through its highly efficient road and transport system. Despite being one of the smallest political units in the entire province, with a total land area of only , San Pedro is the 5th most populous city (out of 6) after the cities of Calamba, Santa Rosa, Biñan and Cabuyao. The city also has the highest population density in the province of Laguna and in the whole Calabarzon region, having . As a municipality, it became a component city of Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 10420 dated March 27, 2013.

==Etymology==
The name of San Pedro originates from its old name: San Pedro [de] Tunasán. The first part of the name comes from Spanish for its patron saint, Saint Peter; while the second part comes from &quot;Tunasán&quot;, which literally means &quot;a place where there is Tunás&quot; (&quot;Nymphaea nouchali&quot;), a medicinal plant abundant on the shoreline of Laguna de Bay. Tunasan is also the name of a neighboring barangay in Muntinlupa, located just north of San Pedro. In 1914, by virtue of Act No. 2390, the town&#x27;s name was abbreviated to its current iteration.

==History==
===Pre-Colonial Period (900-1565)===
While there is no archaeological evidence yet that indicate precolonial settlement in the present-day city of San Pedro, the area where the modern city of San Pedro is believed to be part of the native settlement of the Tagalogs centuries before Spanish contact. It is believed that the Laguna de Bay and the San Isidro River gave livelihood and food to the early settlers. As the Laguna Copperplate Inscription dated back to 900 AD was found in Lumban, Laguna, this gives an idea that the area of San Pedro may had an independent Ancient Barangays headed by their own Datus and was under the influence if not directly under the alliance network of the Lakan of Tondo.

===Spanish Colonial Period (1565-1896)===
On July 28, 1571, a month after the Spanish conquest of Manila, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi distributed certain parts of Luzon to the members of his expedition who assisted them in securing the Philippines for the King of Spain. Among those given were settlements near Laguna de Bay, with Gaspar Ramirez received 16 villages, with 14 of which located near the river of Calamba, while Francisco de Herrera received four other villages near the lake. Martin Gutierrez and Alonzo Ligero received five villages each, Pedro de Herrera received six villages, including the Indios of the Siniloan River, and Lope Garcia de Herrera received four villages. It is estimated that among these communities was the township of Tabuco, which comprises the modern-day cities of San Pedro, Binan, Santa Rosa, and Cabuyao. By 1591, it was written that the encomienda of Tabuco belonged to Don Luis Enriquez, with four thousand persons.

One member of Legazpi&#x27;s expedition, the Portuguese-born Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, also received vast land grants from the King of Spain in recognition of his efforts to conquer the Philippines for Spain. Recognizing that he may die on his upcoming military expedition in Mindanao, he wrote down his last will in Arevalo, Iloilo, where he donated the funds that established the Jesuit-run Colegio de Manila, and naming his wife and daughter as heirs. He likewise wrote that if they die without direct heirs, the Jesuits would use their inheritance for a college. Rodriguez died in 1595, and after almost a decade, in 1604, his daughter perished when the galleon &quot;San Antonio&quot; sank en route to Mexico. Upon their demise, the endowment of Rodriguez was subsequently applied to Colegio de San Jose (now San Jose Seminary), established three years earlier, in 1601.

Around 1629, the Colegio de San Jose acquired from the Colegio de Manila parcels of land on the southwestern shore of the Laguna de Bay, near the present-day City of Biñan. Years later, in 1634, they also purchased parcels of land within the area owned by the widow of Sergeant Pedro Dominguez Franco. They merged these acquisitions to form the Hacienda San Pedro de Tunasan. However, in November 1639, the Chinese who were working against their will in the neighboring Calamba estate revolted, with the sugarcane fields of the Hacienda Tunasan destroyed in the process. In 1698, Tabuco, together with Biñan and San Pedro Tunasan, underwent pastoral visitation by Manila Archbishop Diego Camacho. In the said inspection, Camacho observed that the parishones are not knowledgeable of the Christian faith, prompting him and his assistant Fr. Juan Melendrez to meet the residents individually and test them on their knowledge on the basic Christian (i.e. Catholic) doctrines. Afterwards, he commanded the priests-in-charge of the area, Rev. Frs. Manuel de Leon (Tabuco), Nicolas Godiño (Biñan), and Jesuit Miguel de Salas (San Pedro Tunasan) to instruct their people on the fundamental Christian doctrines. Camacho likewise ordered that the priests and their successors should not to oblige their parishioners to offer anything for the administration of the sacrament of penance, with major excommunication as penalty for non-compliance.

It is claimed that San Pedro de Tunasán became a town on January 18, 1725, upon the request of a group of San Pedrense Principalía led by Alonzo Magtibay, Francisco Santiago, and Ignacio de Guevarra and subsequently approved by the Governor-General and Manila Archbishop Francisco de la Cuesta. King Philip V of Spain was said to have decreed that the town be separated from Tabuco. Francisco Santiago subsequently became the first mayor of the newly formed town. However, another author, Agustin de la Cavada wrote that San Pedro Tunasan became a town in 1712.

Agriculture, especially livestock raising, farming, and fishing, during that period, was its residents&#x27; primary income source. Manuel Buzeta and Felipe Bravo described the town in 1851 as having 613 houses, with a town hall and jail, and a primary school that caters to the young learners. Its parish was constructed using mixed materials and managed by a native secular priest. The crops that are said to be grown by the residents at this time were rice, sugar cane, corn, coconuts, mangoes, and other fruits and vegetables. The Rector of the Colegio de San Jose, in support of the Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais, introduced mulberry planting in Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan to compete with the Chinese silk-making industry. Initially successful, the farmers eventually abandoned it, with the Spaniards blaming what they perceived as laziness of the Filipinos. Despite this, San Pedro Tunasan was among the towns that frequently experience banditry and cattle-rustling, leading to the reputation that the town itself is not safe.

=== The Revolutionary Struggle (1896-98) ===
During the early months of the revolution, siblings Antonino and Jose Guevara led the residents of San Pedro Tunasan in joining the nationalist cause. Due to its proximity to Cavite and to the Manila area, the local residents were advised by General Emilio Aguinaldo to discreetly sympathize with the revolutionaries as not to compromise the role of San Pedro as a rearguard of the revolutionary struggle. San Pedrenses followed this advise and secretly provided food and provisions to the Revolutionaries in Cavite. When the Spaniards launched their counteroffensive in Cavite, the people of San Pedro sheltered refugees from Cavite, including General Mariano Alvarez, and Andres Bonifacio’s widow Gregoria de Jesus.

San Pedro eventually became under the command of Katipunero General Paciano Rizal, brother of Jose. With the help of Guevara, they finally organized a municipal government led by mayor Gregorio Alvarez, who welcomed de Jesus and others to the town in 1897. De Jesus lived in the residence of Almario Ilmedo in San Roque village during her stay. Upon the resumption of the Philippine Revolution in May 1898, San Pedro was among the towns liberated by Filipino revolutionary forces on the offensive in Laguna. Some San Pedrense revolutionaries even helped in the liberation of other towns in the province from Spanish control.

===First Republic and the Philippine-American War (1898-1901)===

San Pedro was among the towns controlled by Filipino forces when the Philippine Declaration of Independence was promulgated on June 12, 1898. As a result, its presidente municipal, Gregorio Alvarez was among those who participated in the Bacoor Assembly of August 1, 1898. In this meeting held at Bacoor&#x27;s Cuenca Mansion, about 200 municipal presidents ratified the Philippine Declaration of Independence. Months later, on December 30, 1898, San Pedro was among the towns who commemorated the first Rizal Day in accordance with the decree issued by President Aguinaldo. The Parish Priest of the San Pedro Apostol Parish, Fr. Victor Enrile, presided a Requiem Mass in honor of Dr. Jose Rizal inside the church, which was followed by a program where patriotic residents praised Rizal and rebuked the Americans due to the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1898).

When the Philippine-American War broke out, San Pedro Tunasan initially served as one of the rearguards for the forces of the First Philippine Republic. Some residents even formed a militia that joined the fight against the Americans. However, on January 6, 1900, during their military expedition of Brigadier General Theodore Schwan, the Americans entered San Pedro Tunasan without any resistance. Some residents who were suspected of sympathizing with the First Philippine Republic were arrested by the Americans and severely tortured. When President Aguinaldo ordered the Filipino forces to shift to guerrilla warfare, the politico-military governor of Laguna, General Juan Cailles placed San Pedro, together with Biñan, Santa Rosa, Cabuyao, and Calamba under the leadership of Colonel Severino Taiño. When Taiño was killed somewhere between San Pedro and Biñan, he was replaced by Colonel Julio Infante.

After the surrender of the First Republic in March 1901, General Miguel Malvar made San Pedro Tunasan part of his guerrilla area of operations, prompting the Americans to subject the town to hamletting tactics to force the remaining Filipino guerrillas to surrender. Later, Filipino resistance forces led by General Macario Sakay operated in San Pedro until his execution in 1907.

===American Colonial Period (1898-1946)===
Once the Americans seized control of San Pedro on January 6, 1900, they appointed Benito Almendrala as Municipal President, and Arcadio Morando as Chief of Police. A year later, Toribio Almeida became the first elected Municipal President of San Pedro. As an austerity measure of the American Colonial Government, in 1903, by virtue of Act No. 939, San Pedro Tunasan&#x27;s township status was dissolved becoming part of the then town of Biñan. In the same year, Muntinlupa was joined to the aforementioned under Act No. 1008. The local residents requested the Insular Government to reinstate San Pedro as a town, which succeeded upon the enactment of Act No. 1553 in 1906. Pascual Mindo became the municipal president of the revived Municipality of San Pedro Tunasan in 1907. It was also around this time that the Hacienda San Pedro de Tunasan was reverted to Jesuit control, following the orders of the Holy See that the Colegio de San Jose, together with the Hacienda Tunasan be returned by the Dominican friars to the Jesuit fathers. Eventually, an American businessman, Carlos Young, leased the Hacienda from the Jesuits.

Despite the town&#x27;s development under the Americans, San Pedro also experienced conflicts and upheavals during the American Period. This period saw the tense agrarian conflict between the local residents and the administration of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan. Young, as the lessor of the Hacienda, was alleged to impose rent hikes to the point that the tenants were not able to pay it. This resulted to the expulsion of some tenants and demolition of their houses in the hacienda property. The residents, asserting their right to the Hacienda lands that they cultivate, organized various agrarian movements in San Pedro, such as the Katipunang Laban sa Hacienda (KALASAHA), the JAMAT, and Samahang Oras Na. The conflict swung to a violent turn when in 1935, a demolition attempt by the Hacienda administration in Barangay Cuyab resulted in a riot that resulted to the death of a young resident, Generoso &quot;Ka Osong&quot; Garcia. This prompted the Philippine Constabulary to deploy troops in San Pedro Tunasan in order to restore peace and order. While the conflict was ongoing, the town also witnessed the peasant-led Sakdal Uprising in the mid-1930s, with reports indicate that an attack by Sakdalistas in San Pedro was averted by the Constabulary.

With these issues at hand, the Commonwealth government under President Manuel Quezon were compelled to resolve the conflict as soon as possible. In 1936, the National Assembly passed Commonwealth Act No. 20, which authorized President Quezon to initiate expropriation proceedings or negotiate for the acquisition of landed estates and sell them to qualified individuals. President Quezon even invited the leaders of Samahang Oras Na and San Pedro municipal officials led by Mayor Ciriaco Limpiahoy to personally witness the signing of the said law. Three years later, the Commonwealth acquired the of the Hacienda, and through the Rural Progress Administration, planned to sell it to the residents. This led to the division of the Samahang Oras Na to two factions: those who favored the government&#x27;s solution, composed of the local intelligentsia and town elites, were called as &quot;No Parking,&quot; while the San Pedrense masses who were advised by Atty. Juan Rustia and opposed the government&#x27;s plan out of belief that the lands of the Hacienda should be automatically be owned by them were called as the &quot;Yapak.&quot; This difference in beliefs led to tense relations between the two groups, with the Yapak members refusing to interact nor do business with the No Parking members. The refusal of the Yapaks to recognize the ownership of the Colegio de San Jose to the Hacienda lands forced the government to sell their lands to other interested individuals. The municipal officials, led by Mayor Benedicto Austria, sided with the Yapak, prompting Quezon to suspend him and the Municipal Council in 1941, and replace them with a new set of municipal officials led by Jose L. Amante.

===World War II and Japanese Occupation (1941-1945)===
During World War II, the Japanese entered San Pedro on January 1, 1942, and conquered the town for the next three years. San Pedro was among the routes used by the Imperial Japanese Army forces to reach Manila and occupy the national capital.

Out of fear from the advancing Japanese forces, the municipal officials at that time hurriedly evacuated to other towns, leaving their townmates behind. The Japanese then ordered the residents to elect their local officials, with former mayor Ciriaco Limpiajoy winning the polls. Despite this, the town was virtually controlled by a Japanese resident, Fujiwara Itizi, who acted as interpreter for the Japanese forces. During the Occupation, there were incidents of atrocities that occurred in the town, among them was a zonification (&quot;sona&quot;) inflicted by the Japanese against the male residents in July 1944. In this event, the Japanese announced that the male residents, who were members of the Japanese-organized &quot;bamboo army,&quot; would have a practice drill in the town plaza. Instead they were arrested and locked inside the San Pedro Apostol Parish for three days.

Some residents of San Pedro joined the guerilla movement and commanded units in Laguna. Among the guerrilla units who operated in San Pedro are the Fil-American Irregular Troops (FAIT) led by Capt. Felipe Alviar, and a branch of the Blue Lake Battalion, Hunters ROTC Guerrillas led by Lieutenant Antonio Partoza. One of the local residents, Abelardo Remoquillo, became a Hunters ROTC guerrilla commander in Eastern Laguna, and died during the liberation campaigns in Bay, Laguna on March 8, 1945. He was honored with a monument and his death anniversary declared as the San Pedro Veterans’ Day. Eventually, the FAIT and Hunters, together with the President Quezon&#x27;s Own Guerrillas (PQOG), liberated San Pedro from Japanese control on February 7, 1945. Subsequently, Lt. Partoza, a lawyer by profession, was appointed by the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) as military mayor of San Pedro.

===Post-War and Martial Law Period (1946-1986)===

The post-war years saw the prominence of San Pedro&#x27;s sampaguita industry, with it becoming the country&#x27;s leading producer of Sampaguita buds. However, the conflict over the lands of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan resumed once the war had ended. Because of their sheer numbers, the Yapaks continued to dominate the municipal leadership in the years after the war. They filed several cases against the Colegio de San Jose in the Court of First Instance, but these cases were eventually dismissed by the court. Their assertions continued despite the five-year suspension imposed by the Supreme Court of the Philippines against Rustia, and his subsequent death in 1951. In 1948, the Hacienda&#x27;s administrator, N.V. Sinclair, gradually sold the remaining Hacienda lands to other individuals, even to non-San Pedrenses.

This forced the Yapaks, who were already called then as the Anak ng Bayan, to sought the help of the newly elected President Ramon Magsaysay. Magsaysay advised them to follow the court&#x27;s decision, while at the same time ordering the government to investigate the case of Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan. Eventually, the Magsaysay administration decided to acquire the remaining 850 hectares of the Hacienda. On August 30, 1954, President Magsaysay visited San Pedro and witnessed at the town plaza the sale of the Hacienda San Pedro Tunasan to the government. He likewise signed there the Agricultural Tenancy Act (Republic Act No. 1199), which codified the different tenancy laws in the Philippines. The farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in Bayan-Bayanan under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration. These resettlement areas are the present-day barangays Magsaysay, Riverside, United Bayanihan, United Better Living, Estrella, Langgam, Laram, and Bagong Silang.
San Pedro likewise benefited from the postwar commercialization and industrialization boom of Mega Manila as some companies and real estate developers established their factories and subdivisions within the town. The 1960s saw the gradual emergence of industrial estates and subdivisions in San Pedro. Among those who made San Pedro as their base of operations are Holland Milk Products Inc. (now Alaska Milk Corporation), Cosmos Bottling Corporation, ACLEM Paper Mills, Kimberly-Clark Philippines, Philippine Tobacco Flu Curing Corporation, Berbacs Chemicals, US Tobacco Corporation, and Trinity Lodge Mining Corporation. It was also in the 1960s when the Holiday Hills Golf Club (now Filipinas Golf Hallow Ridge) was built in Barangay San Antonio. Between 1964 and 1971, the National Government commenced the San Pedro Resettlement Project, with parcels of land that was part of the 850-hectare acquisition made in 1954 by President Magsaysay distributed to landless San Pedrenses and other settlers. To further boost the urbanization of San Pedro, in 1973, the Carmona Line of the Philippine National Railways was inaugurated. It was a spur line from San Pedro going to Carmona, Cavite (now General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite), passing thru Pacita Complex. In 1978, under Presidential Decree No. 1474, the Department of Agrarian Reform was ordered to convert the San Pedro Tunasan Estate to a commercial, industrial, and residential site, and transfer it afterwards to the National Housing Authority. These chain of events occurred under the administrations of Mayors Mario Brigola (1960–1963), Jose L. Amante (1964–1971), and Felicisimo Vierneza (1972–1986).

===Contemporary History (1986-present)===

Following the 1986 EDSA Revolution, President Corazon Aquino appointed the local leader of the anti-dictatorship movement, Calixto Cataquiz, as OIC-Mayor of San Pedro. Known as &quot;Calex,&quot; it was during his administration that San Pedro&#x27;s annual income increased, leading it to achieve the status as a first-class municipality in 1992. It was during his administration that the iconic San Pedro Welcome Arch was built, as well as the Jose L. Amante Emergency Hospital and the Gavino Alvarez Lying-in Clinic. In 1998, former mayor Vierneza was re-elected, thereby continuing the progress that was started by Mayor Calex, as manifested by the further establishment of subdivisions, business establishments, and the opening of the San Pedro Exit of the South Luzon Expressway.

On March 27, 2013, President Benigno Aquino III signed the Republic Act No. 10420, converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna. The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the Commission on Elections (Philippines) (COMELEC) on December 28, 2013, after the National Barangay Elections. With 16,996 &quot;yes&quot; votes over 869 &quot;no&quot; votes and an 11% turnout, it was proclaimed the sixth city of Laguna on December 29, 2013, after the cities of Biñan, Cabuyao, Calamba, San Pablo, and Santa Rosa, and also the third to be a city in the 1st congressional district of Laguna - making it the first city district in the province.

Once it achieved its cityhood status, there had been proposals to make San Pedro part of the National Capital Region. Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Francis Tolentino pushed for the inclusion of the city in the National Capital Region, and eventually become its 18th member city. Tolentino said that in the first meeting of the MMDA Council of mayors in January 2015, he would push for the inclusion of the city to the MMDA.

In 2015, due to its large population, San Pedro&#x27;s Barangay San Vicente was split to eight barangays, namely: San Vicente, Pacita I, Pacita II, Chrysanthemum, Rosario, Fatima, San Lorenzo Ruiz, and Maharlika. This increased the number of San Pedro&#x27;s barangays to 27. This was approved by the local population through a plebiscite. This was further reinforced when President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11295 in 2019. In the same year, Senator Aquilino &quot;Koko&quot; Pimentel III sought the separation of the city of San Pedro from the first legislative district of Laguna province to constitute a lone congressional district. In 2015, he filed Senate Bill No. 3029 for the creation of the San Pedro as a separate district to commence in the next national and local elections. After the city of Santa Rosa formally gained its own representation effective 2022, San Pedro remained as the only local government unit in the first district. Hence, the 1st District may be also referred as the Lone District of San Pedro.

==Geography==
San Pedro is located in Region IV-A or Calabarzon. San Pedro is the boundary between Laguna and Metro Manila, so San Pedro is known as &quot;Laguna&#x27;s Gateway to Metro Manila&quot;. San Pedro shares boundaries with Metro Manila&#x27;s southernmost city, Muntinlupa (North) bounded by Tunasan River, Biñan (south), Dasmariñas (west), Carmona and General Mariano Alvarez (Southwest) bound with San Isidro River.

<text>Calamba, officially the City of Calamba (), is a component city in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 539,671 people making it the largest city in the province.

Calamba is the regional center of the Calabarzon region. It is situated south of Manila and west of Santa Cruz. The city is known as the &quot;Spring Resort Capital of the Philippines&quot; because of its numerous hot spring resorts, which are mostly located in Barangays Pansol, Bucal, Bagong Kalsada, and Lingga.

According to the 2020 census, Calamba has a population of 539,671 people, making it the most populous local government unit in Laguna. It is the fifth-densest city in the province with more than 2,600 people per square kilometer after San Pedro, Biñan, Cabuyao, and Santa Rosa. Based on the overall rankings of the 2014 Cities and Municipalities Index, the city ranked 18th in the overall competitiveness (cities ranking) and first among cities in the Calabarzon region. Calamba is known to be Calabarzon&#x27;s richest city because of its numerous industries.

Calamba is the hometown of the &quot;de facto&quot; Philippine national hero, José Rizal.

==Etymology==

The name of the city is derived from Tagalog &quot;kalamba&quot;, meaning a wide-mouthed earthen water jar (also called &quot;balanga&quot; or &quot;banga&quot;). The origin of the name is reflected in the Calamba Jar landmark in city plaza, as well as the city&#x27;s seal which depicts a water jar superimposed with a profile of José Rizal.

==History==
===Early history===
The oldest part of Calamba is believed to be Barangay Sucol where its first settlers remained. With the arrival of Spaniards, the whole area was converted into a hacienda, then a part of Tabuco (present-day Cabuyao). In 1639 Calamba was the site of a rebellion of Chinese farmers, who had been forcibly resettled there by Governor Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera. This rebellion spread north of the Pasig River and eventually culminated in the deaths of over 20,000 Chinese in the whole region surrounding Manila. Calamba became an independent &quot;pueblo&quot; on August 28, 1742, and formed into the town of Calamba in 1770. In 1813, Calamba was placed in the hands of &quot;encargados&quot; by the Dominican Brothers, who divided it into portions and sold the haciendas to the natives during the American regime.

===World War II===
During the Japanese occupation in World War II, Calamba was the location of a massacre committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, in which at least 2,000 civilians were killed. The St. John the Baptist Church, established in 1859, was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of José Rizal. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurbished.

===Cityhood===

After a process of more than seven years, Calamba became the second component city of the Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 9024, &quot;&quot;An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna into a Component City to be known as the City of Calamba&quot;.&quot; R.A. 9024 was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on March 5, 2001, at the Malacañan Palace. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) then set the plebiscite for Calamba&#x27;s cityhood on April 21, 2001, where 15,056 residents participated. 3,413 or 22.67% voted &quot;&quot;No&quot; while the remaining 77.33% voted &quot;Yes&quot;&quot; to Calamba&#x27;s conversion into a component city.

====Events leading to Cityhood====
As early as 1994, the town&#x27;s Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 1994 requesting the Senate of the Philippines through its president and the House of Representatives through its speaker to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba&#x27;s conversion into a city. It was only after two years that another resolution, Resolution No. 115 was passed requesting then Congressman Joaquin M. Chipeco Jr, to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba&#x27;s cityhood and requesting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for their comments and recommendations regarding the matter. Another two years passed before House Bill No. 986 and Senate bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 were filed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chipeco and Senate of the Philippines by Senators Franklin M. Drilon and Sergio Osmeña III, respectively.

It was only in the year 2000 that the motion for Calamba&#x27;s cityhood was fast-tracked. Then Mayor Severino J. Lajara requested favorable endorsement of House Bill No. 986 from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on January 3, 2000. The Sangguniang Bayan also endorsed House Bill No. 986 and Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and also requested favorable endorsement from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the same month. A month passed and Mayor Lajara sent a follow-up letter to then Vice Governor Teresita &quot;Ningning&quot; Lazaro on updates regarding the matter.

On March 8, the House Committee on Local Government approved House Bill No. 986 on 2nd reading at a hearing held at Hotel Rembrandt, Quezon City. The same House Committee conducted a public hearing on House Bill No. 986 at the Calamba Elementary School (Central II) gymnasium on March 23, approving the House Bill in principle. House Bill 986 was deliberated in April by the House of Representatives in plenary session and approved as House Bill No. 10661, which was then filed with the Senate of the Philippines in June.

The year 2001 came and brought about approval on 2nd reading of Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 in a hearing held on February 5 at the Ambrocio Padilla Hall, Senate of the Philippines.

== Tourism ==
Calamba is the location of José Rizal&#x27;s birthplace, Rizal Shrine, found in the &quot;poblacion&quot; (city proper), and St. John the Baptist Parish Church, the location of Rizal&#x27;s baptism. A park built to commemorate José Rizal, Rizal Park (or the Plaza) hosts a tall statue of Rizal, with the number symbolizing the 22 languages and dialects used by Rizal. The statue sits on top of a 15-step podium, symbolizing one decade since Rizal was born. The monument was once cited as the tallest Jose Rizal Monument in the world, until a monument of Rizal was built in Santa Cruz, Laguna, for the Palarong Pambansa 2014. The monument was inaugurated by President Benigno Aquino III in preparation for the Jose Rizal&#x27;s sesquicentennial birth anniversary on June 19, 2011.

Other tourist attractions include the Calamba Claypot (&quot;Banga&quot; or &quot;Calambanga&quot;), a large pot that is the namesake of the city, Republic Wakepark, a water sports park in the Nuvali mixed-use residential development in Canlubang, and Calamba Island, an islet off Laguna de Bay.

Being near to Mount Makiling, Calamba also hosts hot spring resorts, concentrated at barangays Pansol, Bucal and Bagong Kalsada near the boundary with Los Baños.

==Culture==
===Festivals===
The Buhayani Festival, the official festival of the City of Calamba was the brainchild of Mayor Justin Marc SB. Chipeco during his first year as Mayor in 2013. Mayor Timmy wanted the city to have a festival that will best characterize its culture, progress and tourism potential. He wanted to capitalize on the city&#x27;s historical heritage as the birthplace of unofficial Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Thus, the Buhayani Festival was born.

The term &quot;Buhayani&quot; was coined by joining two Filipino words, &quot;buhay&quot; meaning life or the state of being alive and lively and &quot;bayani&quot; or hero. The festival&#x27;s tagline &quot;Buhay ng Bayani, Buháy na Bayani&quot; literally translates to &quot;Life of the Hero&quot;pertaining to the life of our famous kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal and &quot;Living Hero&quot;which refers to the common man who has the capacity and potential to become everyday heroes in their own small ways.

&quot;We want everyone who revere our kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal to come to Calamba and join us in honouring him on his birthday and in celebrating the modern Rizal in us. We want to make our National Hero modern and relevant in today&#x27;s challenging times and we want to celebrate the spirit of heroism that lives in each Filipino, not just in us Calambeños,&quot; Mayor Chipeco was quoted saying.

Different activities were lined up for this year&#x27;s Buhayani Festival: Kuwentong Bayani for selected Grade 5 students, Talinong Rizal Quiz Bee, Buhayani Football Cup, Independence Day Job Fair, SayawIndak Street Dancing Competition, Marching Band Competition, Baile de Gala, Hawig Rizal (Rizal Look-a-Like), Buhayani Eye Care Mission, and a whole lot more. Highlighting this year&#x27;s celebration is the Morning Program wherein Philippine National Police Chief, Director General Ronald &quot;Bato&quot; Dela Rosa is the Guest of Honor and Speaker. A special wreath-laying ceremony shall also commence at the Museo ni Rizal sa Calamba after a simultaneous floral offering at five different Rizal monuments around the city.

&quot;Jose Rizal is not just the pride of Calamba, he is the pride of the entire country as he was the Greatest Malay to have lived. His works, teachings and ideals have inspired and will continue to inspire us as we strive to live up to his ideals of nationalism and love of country. In the Buhayani Festival, we celebrate an ideal and an advocacy that through this festival, we can rekindle the fire of patriotism and heroism in the hearts of every Filipino. Come to Calamba – retrace history&#x27;s footsteps, rediscover the richness and uniqueness of our heritage, fire up our Filipino pride and be inspired to share and spread what you have experienced and be part of the force that will bring about a renewed love of country in every Filipino,&quot; Mayor Chipeco challenged.

<text>The Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 is a French fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by Morane-Saulnier starting in 1938. It was France&#x27;s most numerous fighter during the Second World War and one of only two French designs to exceed 1,000 in number. At the beginning of the war, it was one of only two French-built aircraft capable of 400 km/h (250 mph) – the other being the Potez 630.

In response to a requirement for a fighter issued by the French Air Force in 1934, Morane-Saulnier built a prototype, designated MS.405, of mixed materials. This had the distinction of being the company&#x27;s first low-wing monoplane, as well as the first to feature an enclosed cockpit, and the first design with a retracting undercarriage. The entry to service of the M.S.406 to the French Air Force in early 1939 represented the first modern fighter aircraft to be adopted by the service. Although a sturdy and highly manoeuvrable fighter aircraft, it was considered underpowered and weakly armed when compared to its contemporaries and the M.S.406 was outperformed by the Messerschmitt Bf 109E during the Battle of France.

The type was capable of holding its own during the so-called Phoney War from September 1939 to 10 May 1940. Upon the invasion of France in May 1940, approximately 400 Moranes were lost. Out of these, around 150 were lost to enemy fighters and ground fire, while another 100 aircraft were destroyed on the ground during enemy air raids; the remainder were deliberately destroyed by French military personnel to prevent the fighters from falling into German hands. French M.S.406 squadrons had achieved 191 confirmed victories, along with another 83 probable victories. Limited production of the type continued in France for sometime after the Armistice of 22 June 1940 under German supervision.

The M.S.406 was exported to a range of customers. Out of 160 aeroplanes ordered by Poland, none had reached Polish territory before the outbreak of war, with the first consignment sent on 29 August 1939. Of particular note was its service in the hands of Finnish and Swiss air forces; both operators chose to develop indigenous derivatives of the M.S.406, such as the Finnish &quot;Mörkö-Morane&quot;). By the end of the war, the majority of M.S.406s and its derivatives were out of service, having been rendered obsolete by rapid advances in fighter aircraft technology. Its final use was as an advanced trainer aircraft in Finland, prior to the last examples of the type being scrapped during 1952.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
During 1934, the &quot;Service Technique de l&#x27;Aéronautique&quot; (Aeronautical Technical Service) of the French Air Force issued the &quot;C1 design&quot; requirement for a new and modern single-seat interceptor fighter. Envisaged as a monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, the prospective fighter aircraft was to serve as a replacement for the Dewoitine D.371, Dewoitine D.500, and Loire 46 aircraft. Amongst the various aviation companies who took interest in the specification, to which the potential for a large production order was attached, was French aircraft manufacturer Morane-Saulnier.

The company&#x27;s design team quickly projected that a low-wing monoplane design would be capable of delivering the desired level of performance; other features were to include an enclosed cockpit, a variable-pitch propeller and landing flaps. It was decided to submit their own response to the requirement, the &quot;M.S.405&quot;; work on the design was headed by the firm&#x27;s Engineer-in-Chief, Paul-René Gauthier. The shape and basic configuration of the M.S.405 were hotly contested, particularly between &#x27;traditional&#x27; advocates of biplane aircraft and &#x27;modern&#x27; monoplane supporters.

The MS.405 was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, with fabric-covered wooden tail, with a bonded metal–wood material (&quot;Plymax&quot;) skin fixed to duralumin tubing. Plymax consisted of a thin sheet of duralumin bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood. Morane-Saulnier had a long history of producing warplanes dating back to the pre-First World War years but in the inter-war period, they had concentrated on civil designs. The aircraft was a departure for them, being their first low-wing monoplane, first with an enclosed cockpit and first with retracting landing gear. Prior to this, their most modern designs were fixed-gear parasol monoplanes.

===Into flight===

The new Hispano-Suiza 12Ygrs engine driving a two-pitch Chauvière propeller powered the first &quot;M.S405-1&quot; prototype, which flew on 8 August 1935. First flown by French aerobatic pilot Michel Détroyat, the prototype demonstrated the type&#x27;s favourable flying characteristics from the onset. Early test flights were flown with a fixed undercarriage, which was replaced by a retractable counterpart later on. After 80 hours of test flights, in January 1936, the prototype was delivered with all military equipment fitted to CEMA at Villacoublay to participate in service trials. On 19 June 1937, the first prototype generated substantial publicity when Détroyat flew it from Paris to Brussels in Belgium, to be displayed at the Brussels Aeronautical Exhibition.

Development of the M.S.405 proceeded fairly slowly; testing revealed the need to modify the wing planform and dihedral, while the Chauvière-built propeller was replaced by a Levasseur-built counterpart. The second &quot;M.S.405-2&quot; prototype with a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine did not make its first flight until 20 January 1937, almost a year and a half behind the first prototype. The second prototype was able to attain a speed of during testing. During July 1937, both prototypes were flown to the Paris Air Show. On 29 July 1938, the second prototype was lost along with its pilot. During March 1937, having been suitably impressed with its performance, an initial order was placed for the construction of 16 pre-production prototypes, which were to incorporate the design improvements that had been made upon the previous version.

As a consequence of various changes made between the prototypes and the pre-production aircraft, the name &quot;M.S.406&quot; was adopted for the type. On 3 February 1938, the first pre-production aircraft made its first flight; during December 1938, the final pre-production M.S.406 was delivered. The pre-production aircraft served to build up experience of manufacturing and testing of the type in advance of production M.S.406s. These 15 aircraft were used for various purposes, such as the third and tenth which served as examples for subcontractors Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques de l&#x27;ouest (SNCAO) and Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Midi (SNCAM), and the twelfth and thirteenth functioned as prototypes for the Swiss D-3801 and D-3800 export models. Variants of the aircraft, including some which later entered mass production, were first represented amongst the pre-production aircraft.

The two main changes of the M.S. 406 were the inclusion of a new wing structure which saved weight and the fitting of a retractable radiator, underneath the fuselage. Powered by the production HS 12Y-31 engine, the new design was over faster than the earlier M.S.405 model. Designed to reach speeds of , examples were tested without encountering any difficulty in reaching up to 730 km/h (454 mph) in a dive. Armament consisted of a Hispano-Suiza HS.9 or 404 cannon with 60 rounds in the V of the engine, fired through the propeller hub and two MAC 1934 machine guns (one in each wing, each with 300 rounds). A weakness of the MAC 1934 was its operation at high altitudes. It was found that at altitudes over , the guns had a tendency to freeze. Heaters were added to the guns for high-altitude use.

===Further development===
Beyond the base M.S.406 design, the development of improved variants and derivatives were emphasised even as mass production of the type was still being established. Perhaps the most significant of these was the &quot;M.S.410&quot;, which was developed on the basis of very early combat experience gathered during autumn 1939. This model had four MAC 1934 machine guns with 550 rounds per gun, all of which were heated by warm air fed via a heat exchanger placed on the port engine exhausts. The cockpit had a modified windscreen to accommodate a new reflector sight arrangement, as well the adoption of electropneumatic controls of the armaments and provisions for the carriage of under-wing auxiliary fuel tanks.

Following the completion of a pair of prototypes, during February 1940, the French government issued an order authorising the bulk upgrading of 500 M.S.406 fighters to the better armed, stronger and faster ( M.S.410 configuration. It took 15 days to convert each fighter but conversions were stopped in May 1940 to put every available combat aircraft into action during the Battle of France against invading German forces. Only five complete production M.S.410 aircraft, along with 150 pairs of the revised wings, had been completed by this point.

===Production===

During the late 1930s, there was a growing perception that a major conflict between Germany and France was not only looming but increasingly unavoidable. As part of its rearmament, the French Air Force placed an order for 1,000 M.S406 airframes during March 1938. Morane-Saulnier was unable to produce anywhere near this number at their own factory, thus a second assembly line was established at the nationalized factories of SNCAO at St. Nazaire in order to produce the type. In April 1937, an initial order for 50 SNCAO-built M.S.406 fighters was placed; in August 1937, a follow-up order for 80 aircraft was issued. In April 1938, as a component of the French Air Force&#x27;s &quot;Plan V&quot;, a large order for 825 M.S.406 was placed with the various nationalised French aircraft industries.

During late 1938, production of the M.S.406 commenced; the first production example performed its maiden flight on 29 January 1939. Production was initially quite slow; only 18 aircraft were produced at Puteaux, along with 10 fighters built by SNCAO. Deliveries were hampered more by the slow deliveries of engines than by the lack of airframes; while efforts were made to correct this, according to Botquin, the engine shortage was present throughout the manufacturing programme. By April 1939, the production lines were delivering six aircraft per day and when war broke out on 3 September 1939, the rate production had risen to 11 aircraft per day; at this time, 535 M.S.406s had entered squadron service. According to aviation author Gaston Botquin, the rate of production of the type was comparable to the initial model of the British Hawker Hurricane.

Production had reached a high-point of 147 M.S.406 aircraft during August 1939, before declining as manufacturing efforts were progressively re-directed towards other aircraft, such as the Lioré et Olivier LeO 45. Manufacturing of the M.S.406 was wound down during March 1940, by which point the original order for 1,000 fighters had been delivered in full to the French Air Force, along with a further 77 aircraft which had been constructed for foreign users (30 fighters for Finland and 45 for Turkey). Additional M.S.406 orders that had been placed for Lithuania and Poland were cancelled with the outbreak of the war.

According to Botquin, the M.S.406 had attracted considerable foreign attention during the late 1930s, and had shown signs of commercial promise early on. During 1937, negotiations were underway between France and Belgium to undertake the licensed production of the type by Belgian aircraft manufacturer Avions Fairey for both the Belgian and French air forces, but these ultimately came to nothing. Instead, the first major export customer was Switzerland who, in September 1938, acquired a manufacturing licence for the type to be manufactured by Swiss firm Fabrique fédérale d&#x27;avions in Emmen.

==Operational history==
===In French service===

During May 1938, the 2nd &quot;Escadrille&quot; of the 7th &quot;Groupe de Chasse&quot; at Reims conducted operational testing of the type using a handful of pre-production M.S.406 aircraft. In spite of some accidents experienced, pilots were commonly pleased with the type&#x27;s performance; in response to the accidents, improvements such as the strengthening of the undercarriage and the cabin hood were implemented during mid-1939. In spite of complaints regarding the forward fuselage exterior covering and motor attachments, no corrective actions were implemented to address these concerns.

Production M.S.406s quickly followed the earlier examples. Between December 1938 and January 1939, the 6th Escadre exchanged its obsolete Loire 46 fighters for the type, while other units rapidly followed. By Bastille Day of that year, sufficient production M.S.406 aircraft had been delivered to enable the type to perform the Paris fly-past on 14 July 1939. Overall, the M.S.406 equipped 16 &quot;Groupes de Chasse&quot; and three &quot;Escadrilles&quot;, stationed in both mainland France and across its overseas colonies; of these, 12 of the &quot;Groupes&quot; saw action against the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

On 23 August 1939, in response to the diplomatic crisis emerging over the Invasion of Poland, all French Air Force units were mobilised as part of preparations to be ready for imminent combat operations. Various M.S.406-equipped units were deployed along the border with Germany stretching between Luxembourg and Switzerland, intended to support the sizable ground elements of the French Army from the air. During the Phoney War opening phase of the Second World War, a time of relatively low combat intensity, the type&#x27;s activities focused upon air defence operations with the aim of countering the prolific aerial reconnaissance and probing activities of small groups of Axis-aligned fighters coming over the border, in addition to escorting friendly reconnaissance aircraft. Throughout the Phoney War, a total of 10,119 fighter missions were reportedly flown over the Army Zones on the border, around half of which being flown by M.S.406 fighters.

During the Phoney War, isolated skirmishes occurred between the M.S.406 and fighters of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, particularly early models of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. For 32 claimed &#x27;kills&#x27; and 16 &#x27;probables&#x27; achieved by M.S.406s, including against the Bf 109, 13 were lost in combat along with 33 more that were lost within the border zone under vague circumstances. According to Botquin, by this stage, the weaknesses of the M.S.406 were already apparent, such as the lack of armouring, frequent gun-jamming, inadequate firepower, slow responsiveness of the guns, unreliable radio units, very high rate of engine wear, corrosion of rudder components, cabin glazing breaking under air pressure during certain manoeuvres, loss of exterior panels due to screws deteriorating rapidly, and the lack of rear-view mirrors.

While the aircraft was very manoeuvrable and could withstand high amounts of battle damage, potentially giving possible advantages during combat against Luftwaffe fighters, the M.S.406 was overall outclassed by the Bf 109. Efforts to replace the M.S.406 (by, for example, converting existing aircraft to the improved M.S.410 standard) with a more capable fighter failed to occur prior to the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940, the month in which a massive full-scale invasion by German forces of mainland France commenced, resulting in the Battle of France. On the eve of the invasion, a total of 10 Groupes de Chasse were equipped with M.S.406 fighters, along with a number of defensive units which were almost exclusively equipped with either the M.S.406 or Bloch MB.152 aircraft.
During the relentless fighting that followed, Allied forces suffered a high rate of attrition and were unable to keep up with the level of damage being sustained. Of the M.S.406s that saw action against the Germans, heavy losses were incurred; reportedly, 150 aircraft were lost in action while a further 250–300 fighters were recorded as having been lost through other causes. The rapid advance of German forces led to repeated retreats and abandonment of bases, rendering most repair and replacement efforts disorganized, along with ground crews often having to destroy large numbers of their own fighter aircraft on the ground to prevent their capture. The decision to employ small groups of French fighters against larger German formations was mostly ineffective against bombers and often costly.

In combat against enemy fighters, the M.S.406 often experienced mixed results. While there were isolated incidents of favourable results being achieved with the type even against the capable Bf 109 - which was 100 km/h faster than the Morane - the 406 was usually outclassed by the Luftwaffe fighters. The story of GC III/7 was tragically typical. On 15 May, nine Moranes of this fighter unit encountered a dozen Bf 109s over Mézières. The Messerschmitts stayed a few thousand feet above their French opponents and dived in pairs to attack, with a single firing pass, before climbing back and then repeating the attack. Three M.S.406 went spinning down in flames and only one pilot bailed out, severely wounded. A fourth Morane, riddled with bullets, crash-landed at Soissons and was wrecked. A fifth pilot, Sergent Deshons, was wounded in the head by splinters, forcing him to land. Six days later, on 21 May, 17 Morane of the same unit intercepted 50 Dorniers over Compiègne, escorted by as many Bf 109s. Before the Morane could close in to open fire, the Messerschmitts jumped them and shot down four Moranes almost at once. Two more were too badly damaged to be repaired. On their side, the French pilots claimed two Bf 109s. The M.S.406 holds the unfortunate distinction of being the least effective French fighter in service during the Battle of France, which Botquin suggests was due to its relatively low firepower. On 24 June 1940, a M.S.406 flown by Sous Lieutenant Marchelidon of G.C.1/2 scored the French Air Force&#x27;s last kill in the conflict. Botquin stated of the aircraft: &quot;it would be pointless to pretend, as was often done during the war for propaganda purposes, that the M.S.406 was the finest fighter in the world...but it was certainly a pleasant machine to fly with no vices and great maneuverability&quot;.

In the aftermath of the armistice, only a single Vichy unit, GC. 1/7, was equipped with the M.S.406. According to Botquin, the deployment of the type from this point onwards reflected the fighter&#x27;s relative obsolescence; it was reduced to relatively minor roles, being used mainly for training purposes in mainland France. A handful of Syrian M.S.406 aircraft flew to Egypt, joining up with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Free French Air Force, continuing to be operated there until they became unserviceable. Those that remained in Vichy France&#x27;s control saw action in Syria against encroaching RAF forces, and on Madagascar against the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy, suffering heavy losses against the service&#x27;s Fairey Fulmar fighters.

Germany took possession of a large number of M.S.406s and the later M.S.410s. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operated a number of the type for training purposes, while others were sold off to third parties. Finland purchased additional M.S.406s (as well as a few 406/410 hybrids) from the Germans, while others were passed off to Italy and some 48 aircraft were delivered to the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia during 1943. Both Switzerland and Turkey also operated the type; the Swiss actually downed a number of both German and Allied aircraft during the 1944–45 period.

Before the Pacific campaign proper, Vichy authorities in French Indochina were engaged in a frontier war against Thailand, during 1940–41. A number of M.S.406s stationed in Indochina downed several Thai fighters before all French Air Force units were withdrawn from the theatre.

===In Finnish service===
The M.S.406 had a parallel career in Finland. In February 1940, the first 30 French fighters were allocated to &quot;LeLv 28&quot;, commanded by Major Jusu. These aircraft received the Finnish designations MS-301 to MS-330. They were used in combat against the USSR during the Winter War, and carried out 259 operational sorties and shot down 16 Soviet aircraft. In modified form, the M.S.406 were later involved in the Continuation War. Between November 1939 and 4 September 1944, Lv28 scored 118 aerial victories flying the Morane M.S.406 (the unit flew Bf 109Gs for a time, as well). The unit lost 15 aircraft. Total Finnish kills in Moranes were 121. The top Morane ace in all theatres was W/O Urho Lehtovaara, with 15 of his 44.5 total kills achieved in Moranes. The Finnish nicknames were &quot;Murjaani&quot; (&quot;moor&quot; or &quot;Negro&quot;), a twist on its name, and &quot;Mätimaha&quot; (roe-belly) and &quot;Riippuvatsa&quot; (hanging belly) because of its bulged ventral fuselage.

==Variants==
===M.S.405===
The &quot;M.S.405&quot; was a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, being furnished with a fabric-covered wooden tail and a bonded metal/wood material (&quot;Plymax&quot;) skin fixed to duralumin tubing. Plymax consisted of a thin sheet of duralumin bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood. It was the company&#x27;s first low-wing monoplane design, as well as the first with an enclosed cockpit, and the first to feature retractable landing gear. The new Hispano-Suiza 12Ygrs engine driving a two-pitch Chauvière propeller powered the first prototype, &quot;M.S.405-01&quot;, which flew on 8 August 1935. The second prototype, &quot;M.S.405-02&quot;, powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine, performed its first flight on 20 January 1937. Outfitted with the new engine, the fighter was able to attain a speed of .

===M.S.406===

The &quot;M.S.406&quot; designation was adopted following various design changes from the earlier M.S.405 prototypes; two of the principal design changes were the inclusion of a new weight-saving wing structure and the new retractable radiator. Powered by the production HS 12Y-31 engine, the new M.S.406 was over faster than the M.S. 405, at , tested with no problem to reach up to in a dive. Armament consisted of a Hispano-Suiza HS.9 or Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon with 60 rounds in the V of the engine and fired through the propeller hub, and two MAC 1934 machine guns (one in each wing, each with 300 rounds).

===M.S.410===
While the M.S.406 was entering squadron service in 1939, an upgrade series was initiated with the aim of improving the design. The result was the &quot;M.S.410&quot;, which included the adoption of a stronger wing, simpler fixed radiator in place of the earlier retractable design, an arrangement of four belt-fed MAC guns (which were heated by hot air to prevent the frequent jamming of the wing guns at low temperatures suffered by the M.S.406) in place of the earlier pair of drum-fed weapons, and the fitting of exhaust ejectors for additional thrust. The added thrust boosted the top speed to at , resulting in an improvement of about over the M.S.406 at the same height. Production of the M.S.410 had only just started in May 1940, when the German attack resulted in the conversion programme being stopped, by which point only five examples of the type had been completed. Production was allowed to continue under German supervision, converting earlier 406s to the 410 standard, but many of these aircraft received only the new wings. Altogether, a total of 74 planes were modified.

===M.S.411, M.S.412===
A single example of the &quot;M.S.411&quot; was constructed by converting the 12th aircraft of the pre-production line with the 406 wing and the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 engine. A later modification was started as the &quot;M.S.412&quot; with the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine, but this was not completed by the time the war ended.

===M.S.450===
In 1939, Hispano started prototype deliveries of the new Hispano-Suiza 12Z engine of . One was fitted to a modified M.S.410 to create the &quot;M.S.450&quot;, giving dramatic improvements in performance, especially at altitude. However the engine did not enter production before France fell, and the similarly modified Dewoitine D.520 (the D.523) was considered a better design for the engine anyway.

===Other variants===

The M.S.406 airframe was also used in a number of other projects.
;M.S.430: a two-seat trainer built by inserting a &quot;plug&quot; in the central fuselage with an extra cockpit for the trainee pilot, and using the much less powerful Salmson 9AG radial engine.
; M.S.435: a more powerful two-seat trainer version with the Gnome-Rhône 9K engine.

===Swiss variants===

====D-3800====
In 1938, Switzerland obtained a license for local production of the MS.406. Two MS.406H fighters were supplied to Switzerland in September 1938 and April 1939 to serve as pattern aircraft as the &quot;D-3800&quot;, retaining the earlier wing design of the 405, but powered by the newer Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 engines as used by the MS.406.

Pre-production started with a run of eight aircraft from EKW with engines built by Adolph Saurer AG driving a new Escher-Wyss EW-V3 fully adjustable propeller. Instruments were replaced with Swiss versions and the drum-fed MAC machine guns with locally designed and built belt-fed guns, eliminating the wing-bulges of the French version, and avoiding the freezing problems encountered by French guns. The first of these aircraft was completed in November 1939. The pre-production models were then followed with an order for a further 74 examples, which were all delivered by 29 August 1940. In 1942, a further two were assembled with spares originally set aside for the original production run.

During 1944, surviving aircraft were modified with new cooling and hydraulic installations, and were fitted with ejector exhausts. These modifications were the same standard as the D-3801 series, making them identical with the exception of the engine installation. At the end of the war the remaining aircraft were used as trainers, until the last one was scrapped in 1954.

====D.3801/3803====
The Swiss continued development of the MS.412 when French involvement stopped following the June 1940 Armistice. The Dornier-Altenrhein factory completed a prototype powered with a licensed-produced HS-51 12Y engine, generating together with the fixed radiator and revised exhausts as tested on the MS.411, in October 1940. The new type retained the armament changes and other improvements introduced on the D.3800. This series was put into production in 1941 as the &quot;D-3801&quot; with continued deliveries until 1945 with 207 completed. Another 17 were built from spares between 1947 and 1948. Reliability of the new engine was at first extremely poor, with problems with crankshaft bearings causing several accidents. The engine problems slowed deliveries, with only 16 aircraft produced in 1942 and a single aircraft delivered in 1943. The engine problems were eventually resolved in 1944. With from the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51, the speed was boosted to , roughly equivalent to the D.520 or the Hurricane. Weights were between . After being retired from operational use as a fighter when the North American P-51 Mustang was acquired in 1948, the type remained in service as a trainer and target tug until 1959.
The D.3802 was based on the MS.450, emerging as the MS.540, with a Saurer YS-2 engine. The prototype flew in the autumn of 1944, revealing several shortcomings, but it was capable of . 12 were produced seeing limited use with Fliegerstaffel 17 and some other units.

The last development of this aircraft was the D.3803, with Saurer YS-3 engine, and modified dorsal fuselage (with an all-round visibility canopy). The D.3803 was armed with three HS-404 cannon (one in the nose, two in the wings), plus up to bombs and rockets. Despite not having a powerful engine, the type reached at . The performance was impressive, but the last development of this 1935 fighter design had several shortcomings and was not entirely successful. Its development was halted as P-51D Mustangs became available.

===Finnish variants===
====Mörkö-Morane====

France sent 30 M.S.406s to Finland, between 4 and 29 February 1940. By 1943 the Finns had received an additional 46 M.S.406s and 11 M.S.410s purchased from the Germans. By this point, the fighters were hopelessly outdated, but the Finns were so desperate for serviceable aircraft that they decided to start a modification program to bring all of their examples to a new standard.

The aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa turned the obsolete &quot;M-S&quot; into a first rate fighter, the &quot;Mörkö-Morane&quot; (&quot;Mörkö&quot; is the Finnish for &quot;Bogeyman&quot; or &quot;Bugbear&quot;). It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;LaGG-Morane&quot;. The Germans also supplied captured Klimov M-105P engines (a licensed version of the HS 12Y) of with a fully adjustable VISh-61P propeller to power the Moranes. The airframe required some local strengthening and also gained a new and more aerodynamic engine cowling. These changes boosted the speed to . Other changes included a new oil cooler taken from the Bf 109, the use of four belt-fed guns like the M.S.410, and the excellent MG 151/20 cannon in the engine mounting. However, supplies of the MG 151 were limited, and several received captured Berezin UBS guns instead.

The first example of the modified fighter, MS-631, made its first flight on 25 January 1943, and the results were startling: the aircraft was faster than the original French version, and the service ceiling was increased from to .

Originally, it was planned to convert all the 41 remaining M.S.406s and M.S.410s with the Soviet engine, but it took time, and the first front-line aircraft of this type did not reach LeLv 28 until July/August 1944. By the end of the Continuation War in September 1944, only three examples had been converted (including the original prototype). Lieutenant Lars Hattinen (an ace with six victories) scored three kills with the Mörkö-Morane, one with each Mörkö-Morane in the squadron. More fighters arrived from the factory, though, and the Mörkö-Moranes took part in the Lapland War as reconnaissance and ground attack aircraft. Not all the Mörkö-Morane conversions were completed before March 1945, when the entire re-engining programme was halted. After the end of the war, the total was brought to 41, which served as advanced trainers with TLeLv 14 until September 1948. In 1952 all remaining Finnish Moranes were scrapped.

<text>The Mormon Battalion was the only religious unit in United States military history in federal service, recruited solely from one religious body and having a religious title as the unit designation. The volunteers served from July 1846 to July 1847 during the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. The battalion was a volunteer unit of between 534 and 559 Latter-day Saint men, led by Mormon company officers commanded by regular United States Army officers. During its service, the battalion made a grueling march of nearly 1,950 miles from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to San Diego, California.

The Battalion’s march and service supported the eventual cession of much of the American Southwest from Mexico to the United States, especially the Gadsden Purchase of 1854 of portions of modern southern Arizona and New Mexico, extending the American-Mexican border further south to access the most suitable surveyed east-west land route for the future trans-continental railroad (later constructed 1866-1869). The Battalion&#x27;s march also opened a southern wheeled wagon accessible route to California. Veterans of the Battalion played significant roles in America&#x27;s westward expansion in California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and other parts of the West.

==Enlistment==
At the time they enlisted, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were seeking U.S. government aid for their migration west to the Rocky Mountains and Salt Lake Valley, despite having their previous petitions for redress of grievances denied. Under continued religious persecution, they had fled Nauvoo, Illinois, starting on February 4, 1846, across the Mississippi River. They camped among the Potawatomi Indians near present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Brigham Young, (1801-1877, served 1847-1877), the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, (second L.D.S. Church President) sent Elder Jesse C. Little (1815-1893), to Washington, D.C., to seek assistance from the federal government for the Mormon Pioneers fleeing from the Illinois mobs. Little arrived in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 1846, only eight days after Congress had declared war on Mexico. Pennsylvania Army officer and attorney Thomas L. Kane (1822-1883), offered the Mormons his advice and assistance. Politically well connected through his jurist father, Kane provided letters of recommendation and joined Little in Washington, D.C. The two called on members of the President&#x27;s Cabinet - the U.S. Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and 11th President James K. Polk. (1795-1849, served 1845-1849), After several interviews in early June 1846, President Polk agreed to Mr. Little&#x27;s offer if &quot;a few hundred&quot; men enlisted. On June 2, 1846, President James K. Polk wrote in his diary: &quot;Col. [Stephen W.] Kearny was ... authorized to receive into service as volunteers a few hundred of the Mormons who are now on their way to California, with a view to conciliate them, attach them to our country, and prevent them from taking part against us.&quot;

On July 1, 1846, Captain James Allen, dispatched by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Stephen W. Kearny, (1794-1848), of the U.S. Army arrived at the Mormons&#x27; Mosquito Creek camp. He carried President Polk&#x27;s request for a battalion of 500 volunteers to fight in the coming Mexican War. Most members of the Church were suspicious of the request, as the Federal government had ignored the persecutions that they suffered. They were concerned about facing discrimination by the government, as they had from both the state and federal government in the past.

Kane obtained Federal government permission for the refugee Mormons to occupy Pottawattamie and Omaha Indian lands along the Missouri River. After carrying dispatches relating to the land agreements and battalion criteria to famous Mid-Western military post of Fort Leavenworth in the then larger Indian Territory (1834-1907, later that part in the future Kansas Territory, 1854 then subsequent state of Kansas, 1861). Capt. Kane sought out Jesse Little in the Mormon encampments on the Missouri River. On July 17, 1846, he held a meeting with church leaders and Army Captain Allen.

Young had planned on moving the Mormons west that summer, but circumstances were against his plan. He saw several possible advantages to the Saints in the proposed federal service. Their enlistment would be a public relations victory for the church, demonstrating additional evidence of its loyalty to the United States. As the drafted men were given a uniform allowance at Fort Leavenworth, (future Kansas), of US$42 each, paid in advance, for their one-year enlistment and as they were allowed to wear their civilian clothing for the march, the bulk of those funds were immediately donated to a general Church fund. These funds were used to purchase wagons, teams, and other necessities for the American exodus (Actual wages paid over the next year to the Mormon Battalion totaled nearly $30,000). Having been forced to leave farms and homes in Nauvoo, Illinois, the Latter-day Saints were going to spend the winter on the banks of the upper Missouri River. Raising a group of able-bodied men would be difficult. Many men had already scattered to outlying areas where they sought jobs with wages to help support the group. Young wrote a letter to the Saints living in Garden Grove in which he justified the call-up and asked for help:

The public approval of Young and other members of the Twelve were critical to gain men&#x27;s enlistment. While some men quickly volunteered, Young had to persuade reluctant enlistees. It took three weeks to raise the five companies of men.

Allen&#x27;s instructions were to recruit &quot;four or five companies&quot; of men who were to receive the &quot;pay, rations, and other allowances given to other infantry volunteers.&quot; Each company was authorized four women as laundresses, &quot;receiving rations and other allowances given to the laundresses of our army.&quot; Approximately thirty-three women, twenty of whom served as laundresses, and fifty-one children accompanied the men. Five women would eventually complete the cross-continental trek. The Mormon Battalion was mustered into volunteer service on July 16, 1846, as part of the Army of the West under Brigadier General Stephen Kearny, a seasoned military veteran. His units included two regiments of Missouri volunteers, a regiment of New York volunteers who had traveled by ships around South America and Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean and arrived in California to meet Gen. Kearney with there, artillery and infantry battalions, Kearny&#x27;s own 1st US Dragoons (cavalry), and the battalion of Mormons. For years afterward, some Mormons viewed the Mormon Battalion as an unjust imposition and as an act of persecution by the United States.

==Journey begins==

The battalion arrived at Fort Leavenworth on August 1. For the next two weeks, they drew their clothing allowance of $42 per man, received their equipment (Model 1816 smoothbore flintlock muskets and a few Harper&#x27;s Ferry Model 1803 Rifles), and were more formally organized into a combat battalion. The volunteers took the approved clothing allowance in cash per regulations. To assure the main body of the group benefited from the men&#x27;s wages, Young sent Parley Pratt to see that the men handed over the pay they had committed to contribute. Young used this and the wages they earned later to buy supplies for the main group at wholesale prices in St. Louis, Missouri. He wrote to the enlistees that the money was a &quot;peculiar manifestation of the kind providence of our Heavenly Father at this time.&quot; There was little time for training and instilling discipline. Newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel James Allen became ill but ordered the battalion forward along the Santa Fe Trail to overtake Kearny&#x27;s Army of the West. On August 23, Allen died and was the first officer buried there in the old officer&#x27;s burial grounds. Later his remains were moved to what became Fort Leavenworth National Military Cemetery.

Captain Jefferson Hunt, commanding A Company, was the acting commander until word reached Council Grove, Kansas, that Allen had died. While there, Lieutenant Andrew Jackson Smith, West Point Class of 1838, arrived and was given temporary command of the Battalion with the Mormons&#x27; consent. For the next several weeks, the Mormon soldiers came to hate &quot;AJ&quot; Smith and the assistant surgeon, Dr. George B. Sanderson, for their treatment of the men, and the long marches suffered across the dry plains of Kansas and New Mexico. The Mormon men were not accustomed to the austere military standards of the day nor to the medical treatments imposed by Dr. Sanderson, including the use of feeding mercury compounds to the sick, which were standard for the time. Because the church leaders had counseled the battalion members to avoid military medical treatment, they challenged the doctor&#x27;s authority and unrest arose among the men. Smith and Sanderson continued to hold the Mormon Battalion to ordinary standards of discipline, and tensions continued.

===Cooke assumes command===

Arriving in Santa Fe in October, General Kearny had dispatched Captain (brevet promotion to Lieutenant Colonel) Philip St. George Cooke, West Point class of 1827, to assume command of the Battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way (today known as Cooke&#x27;s Wagon Road). In Santa Fe, 91 sick men and all but five of the women and one child were sent to Pueblo, in present-day Colorado. Three separate detachments left the Battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next three months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the Battalion across some of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned to respect and follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico – adventurer and mountain man Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, who as an infant had traveled with his mother Sacagawea across the continent with the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

Lieutenant Smith and Dr. Sanderson continued with the battalion, along with Lt. George Stoneman, newly graduated from West Point that Spring. During the Civil War, Cooke, Smith and Stoneman were promoted to high-level commands for the Union Army, and Stoneman would later be elected Governor of California.

===Battle of the Bulls===

The only &quot;battle&quot; they fought was near the San Pedro River in present-day Arizona against a sizable number of wild cattle. The Battalion reached this area in December 1846, and their presence aroused curiosity among these animals. After the bulls of these herds caused destruction to some of the mules and wagons and resulted in two men being wounded, the men loaded their guns and attacked the charging bulls, killing 10–15 of the wild cattle, causing the event to be termed the &quot;Battle of the Bulls&quot;.

===Capture of Tucson===

Approaching Tucson, in present-day Arizona, the Battalion nearly had a battle with a small detachment of provisional Mexican soldiers on December 16, 1846. The Mexicans retreated as the US battalion approached. Cooke never seems to have considered the encounter as capturing the town. He never made that claim. The local O&#x27;odham and other Piman tribes along the march route were helpful and charitable to the American soldiers. Mormon soldiers learned irrigation methods from these native inhabitants and employed the techniques later as pioneers in Utah and other areas.

===Temecula Massacre===
Nearing the end of their journey, the battalion passed through Temecula, California, during the aftermath of the Temecula Massacre, a conflict between Mexican government forces and the Luiseño tribe. The Mormons stood guard to prevent further bloodshed while the Luiseño people gathered their numerous dead into a common grave.

==Journey complete==
The Mormon Battalion arrived in San Diego on January 29, 1847, after a march of some 2,080 miles from Iowa. For the next five months until their discharge on July 16, 1847, in Los Angeles, the Battalion trained and performed occupation duties in several locations in southern California. The most significant service the Battalion provided in California was as a reliable unit under Cooke to reinforce General Kearny&#x27;s one company of army dragoons. The construction of Fort Moore in Los Angeles was one measure Cooke employed to protect military control under Kearny. Some 22 Mormon men died from disease or other natural causes during their service. About 80 of the men re-enlisted for another six months of service.

Fifteen men were selected to accompany General Kearny and escort John C. Fremont back east to his court-martial. During their journey over the Sierra Nevada, these men encountered one of the campsites of the Donner Party, and were ordered to bury the human remains and clean up the area.

After being mustered out, Jesse D. Hunter, captain of Company B, was appointed Indian Agent for southern California by the military governor, Colonel Richard Mason. Hunter was California&#x27;s third indian agent, the first two being Johann Sutter and Mariano Vallejo, both appointed by Mason&#x27;s predecessor, Stephen Kearny. Hunter&#x27;s mission was to protect ranchos and missions from depredations, and to generally control the Indian labor force, to the point of requiring Indians to carry passports.

Nearly 100 discharged veterans worked in the Sacramento, area for James W. Marshall at Sutter&#x27;s Mill. Henry Bigler recorded in his diary the actual date when gold was discovered, January 24, 1848. This gold find started the California Gold Rush the next year. $17,000 in gold was contributed to the economy of the Latter-day Saints&#x27; new home by members of the Mormon Battalion returning from California.

One group of discharged battalion members established the Carson Trail wagon road (also called the Mormon Emigrant Trail) on their return east. This road started near Placerville, California, and went across the crest of the Sierra Nevada at Carson Pass before dropping down and eventually meeting the already-established California Trail. The newly established route was afterwards used by many emigrants traveling to California&#x27;s gold fields. Three members of this group were killed at a location which became known as Tragedy Spring.

==Historic sites and monuments==

==Current research==
A resurgence of interest in the Battalion is linked to the 175th anniversary of the Battalion&#x27;s service.
Original documents held at the National Archives have been located, including original muster and pay rolls. These are being prepared for public access online along with transcriptions. A more accurate count and list of participants is being prepared.
A series of events are being planned along the routes during 2021–2022.

<text>In written English usage, a comma splice or comma fault is the use of a comma to join two independent clauses. For example:

The comma splice is sometimes used in literary writing to convey a particular mood of informality. It is usually considered an error in English writing style. Some authorities on English usage consider comma splices appropriate in limited situations, such as informal writing or with short similar phrases.

== Description ==
Comma splices are rare in most published writing, but are common among inexperienced writers of English.

&quot;The Elements of Style&quot; by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White advises using a semicolon, not a comma, to join two grammatically complete clauses, or writing the clauses as separate sentences. &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; notes an exception to the semicolon rule, preferring a comma when the clauses are &quot;very short and alike in form,&quot; or when the sentence&#x27;s tone is &quot;easy and conversational.&quot; For example:

Comma splices are similar to run-on sentences, which join two independent clauses without any punctuation or a coordinating conjunction such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, etc. Sometimes the two types of sentences are treated differently based on the presence or absence of a comma, but most writers consider the comma splice a special type of run-on sentence. According to &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;: 

Comma splices often arise when writers use conjunctive adverbs (such as &quot;furthermore&quot;, &quot;however&quot;, or &quot;moreover&quot;) to separate two independent clauses instead of using a coordinating conjunction.

== In literature ==
Comma splices are also occasionally used in fiction, poetry, and other forms of literature to convey a particular mood or informal style. Some authors use commas to separate short clauses only. The comma splice is more commonly found in works from the 18th and 19th century, when written prose mimicked speech more closely.

&quot;The New Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; describes the use of the comma splice by the authors Elizabeth Jolley and Iris Murdoch:

Journalist Oliver Kamm wrote in 2016 of novelist Jane Austen&#x27;s use of the comma splice, &quot;Tastes in punctuation are not constant. It makes no sense to accuse Jane Austen of incorrect use of the comma, as no one would have levelled this charge against her at the time. Her conventions of usage were not ours.&quot;

The author and journalist Lynne Truss writes in &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves&quot; that &quot;so many highly respected writers observe the splice comma that a rather unfair rule emerges on this one: only do it if you&#x27;re famous.&quot; Citing Samuel Beckett, E. M. Forster, and Somerset Maugham, she says: &quot;Done knowingly by an established writer, the comma splice is effective, poetic, dashing. Done equally knowingly by people who are not published writers, it can look weak or presumptuous. Done ignorantly by ignorant people, it is awful.&quot;

<text>Pushing hands, Push hands or tuishou (alternately spelled &quot;tuei shou&quot; or &quot;tuei sho&quot;) is a two-person training routine practiced in internal Chinese martial arts such as &quot;baguazhang&quot;, &quot;xingyiquan&quot;, tai chi, and &quot;yiquan&quot;. It is also played as an international sport akin to judo, sumo and wrestling, such as in Taiwan, where the biannual Tai Chi World Cup is held.

==Overview==
Pushing hands is said to be the gateway for students to experientially understand the aspects of the internal martial arts: leverage, reflex, sensitivity, timing, coordination and positioning. Pushing hands works to undo a person&#x27;s natural instinct to resist force with force, teaching the body to yield to force and redirect it. Some tai chi schools teach push hands to complement the physical conditioning of performing solo routines. Push hands allows students to learn how to respond to external stimuli using techniques from their forms practice. Among other things, training with a partner allows a student to develop &quot;ting jing&quot; (listening power), the sensitivity to feel the direction and strength of a partner&#x27;s intention. In that sense pushing hands is a contract between students to train in the defensive and offensive movement principles of their martial art: learning to generate, coordinate and deliver power to another and also how to effectively neutralize incoming forces in a safe environment.

==History==
According to the Chen family of tai chi teachers, pushing hands was created by Chen Wangting (1600–1680), the founder of the Chen-style tai chi, and was originally known as hitting hands (&quot;da shou&quot;) or crossing hands (&quot;ke shou&quot;). Chen was said to have devised pushing hands methods for both empty hands and when armed with a spear. Other tai chi schools attribute the invention of pushing hands to mythical Zhang Sanfeng.

==Training pushing hands==
In tai chi, pushing hands is used to acquaint students with the principles of what are known as the &quot;Eight Gates and Five Steps,&quot; eight different leverage applications in the arms accompanied by footwork in a range of motion, intended to allow students to defend themselves calmly and competently if attacked. Also known as the &quot;13 original movements of tai chi&quot;, a posture expressing each one of these aspects is found in all tai chi styles. Training and pushing hands competitions generally involve contact but no strikes.
The three primary principles of movement cultivated by push hands practice are:

* Rooting - Stability of stance, a highly trained sense of balance in the face of force.
* Yielding - The ability to flow with incoming force from any angle. The practitioner moves with the attacker&#x27;s force fluidly without compromising their own balance.
* Release of Power (Fa Jing) - The application of power to an opponent. Even while applying force in push hands one maintains the principles of Yielding and Rooting at all times.

The Eight Gates ():
:P&#x27;eng () - An upward circular movement, forward or backward, yielding or offsetting usually with the arms to disrupt the opponent&#x27;s centre of gravity, often translated as &quot;Ward Off.&quot; Peng is also described more subtly as an energetic quality that should be present in every taiji movement as a part of the concept of &quot;song&quot; (鬆) -- or relaxation -- providing alertness, the strength to maintain structure when pressed, and absence of muscular tension in the body.
:Lü () - A sideways, circular yielding movement, often translated as &quot;Roll Back.&quot;
:Chi () - A pressing or squeezing offset in a direction away from the body, usually done with the back of the hand or outside edge of the forearm. Chi is often translated as &quot;Press.&quot;
:An () - To offset with the hand, usually a slight lift up with the fingers then a push down with the palm, which can appear as a strike if done quickly. Often translated as &quot;Push.&quot;
:Tsai () - To pluck or pick downwards with the hand, especially with the fingertips or palm. The word &quot;tsai&quot; is part of the compound that means to gather, collect or pluck a tea leaf from a branch (採茶, cǎi chá). Often translated &quot;Pluck&quot; or &quot;Grasp.&quot;
:Lieh () - Lieh means to separate, to twist or to offset with a spiral motion, often while making immobile another part of the body (such as a hand or leg) to split an opponent&#x27;s body thereby destroying posture and balance. Lieh is often translated as &quot;Split.&quot;
:Chou () - To strike or push with the elbow. Usually translated as &quot;Elbow Strike&quot; or &quot;Elbow Stroke&quot; or just plain &quot;Elbow.&quot;
:K&#x27;ao () - To strike or push with the shoulder or upper back. The word &quot;k&#x27;ao&quot; implies leaning or inclining. Usually translated &quot;Shoulder Strike,&quot; &quot;Shoulder Stroke&quot; or &quot;Shoulder.&quot;

The Five Steps ():
:Chin Pu () - Forward step.
:T&#x27;ui Pu () - Backward step.
:Tsuo Ku () - Left step.
:You P&#x27;an () - Right step.
:Chung Ting () - The central position, balance, equilibrium. Not just the physical center, but a condition which is expected to be present at all times in the first four steps as well, associated with the concept of &quot;rooting&quot; (the stability said to be achieved by a correctly aligned, thoroughly relaxed body as a result of correct tai chi training). Chung ting can also be compared to the Taoist concept of moderation or the Buddhist &quot;middle way&quot; as discouraging extremes of behavior, or in this case, movement. An extreme of movement, usually characterized as leaning to one side or the other, destroys a practitioner&#x27;s balance and enables defeat.

The Eight Gates are said to be associated with the eight trigrams (&quot;bagua&quot;) of the &quot;I Ching&quot;, the Five Steps with the five &quot;phases&quot; (&quot;Wuxing&quot;) of Taoist philosophy; metal, water, wood, fire, and earth. Collectively they are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Thirteen Postures of Tai Chi&quot; and their combinations and permutations are cataloged more or less exhaustively in the different styles of solo forms which tai chi is mostly known for by the general public. Pushing hands is practiced so that students have an opportunity for &quot;hands-on&quot; experience of the theoretical implications of the solo forms. Traditional internal teachers say that just training solo forms isn&#x27;t enough to learn a martial art; that without the pushing hands, reflex and sensitivity to another&#x27;s movements and intent are lost. Each component is seen as equally necessary, yin and yang, for realizing the health, meditative, and self-defense applications.

Pushing hands trains these technical principles in ever increasing complexity of patterns. At first students work basic patterns, then patterns with moving steps coordinated in different directions, patterns at differing heights (high, middle, low and combinations) and then finally different styles of &quot;freestyle&quot; push hands, which lead into sparring that combines closing and distancing strategies with long, medium and short range techniques. These exchanges are characterized as &quot;question and answer&quot; sessions between training partners; the person pushing is asking a question, the person receiving the push answers with their response. The answers should be &quot;soft,&quot; without resistance or stiffness. The students hope to learn to not fight back when pushed nor retreat before anticipated force, but rather to allow the strength and direction of the push to determine their answer. The intent thereby is for the students to condition themselves and their reflexes to the point that they can meet an incoming force in softness, move with it until they determine its intent and then allow it to exhaust itself or redirect it into a harmless direction. The degree to which students maintain their balance while observing these requirements determines the appropriateness of their &quot;answers.&quot; The expression used in some tai chi schools to describe this is &quot;Give up oneself to follow another.&quot; The eventual goal for self-defense purposes is to achieve meeting the force, determining its direction and effectively redirecting it in as short a time as possible, with examples provided of seemingly instantaneous redirections at the highest levels of kung fu by traditional teachers. Pushing hands also teaches students safety habits in regard to their own vital areas, especially acupressure points, as well as introducing them to the principles of chin na and some aspects of the manipulative therapy or tui na also taught in traditional tai chi schools. At a certain point, pushing hands begins to take on aspects of &quot;qigong (chi kung)&quot;, as the students learn to coordinate their movements in attack and defense with their breathing.

==Competition==

Pushing hands has become a part of competitive Chinese martial arts, especially those devoted to internal arts. The rules and the judging are subjective, problematic, and constantly in flux.

Push hand contests is divided into two types.
:Moving step () - The players stand in a circle; the player who is pushed or pulled out of the circle, or falls down, loses a point.

:Fixed step () - The players stand in a small box; the player who is pushed or pulled out of the box loses a point.

<text>A littoral combat ship (LCS) is either of two classes of relatively small surface vessels designed for near-shore operations by the United States Navy. It was &quot;envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals&quot;, although their ability to perform these missions in practice has been called into question.

Littoral combat ships are comparable to corvettes found in other navies. The and the are the two LCS variants. Each is slightly smaller than the U.S. Navy&#x27;s earlier but larger than &quot;Cyclone&quot;-class patrol ships. Each has the capabilities of a small assault transport, including a flight deck and hangar for housing two SH-60 or MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, a stern ramp for operating small boats, and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-on/roll-off port facility. Standard armaments include Mk 110 57 mm guns and RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles. They are also equipped with autonomous air, surface, and underwater vehicles. Possessing lower air defense and surface warfare capabilities than destroyers, the LCS emphasizes speed, flexible mission modules, and a shallow draft.

The first LCS, , was commissioned on 8 November 2008 in Veteran&#x27;s Park, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The second ship, the trimaran , was commissioned on 16 January 2010, in Mobile, Alabama. In 2012, ADM Jonathan W. Greenert stated that the LCS would be deployed to Africa in place of destroyers and cruisers. In 2013 and 2014, the Navy&#x27;s requirement for LCSs was progressively cut from 55 to 32 vessels in favor of a newly proposed frigate more capable of high-intensity combat. In late 2014, the Navy proceeded with a procurement plan for enhanced versions of the LCS and upgraded older ships to meet the program&#x27;s 52-ship requirement; the modified LCS will be redesignated as FF, or frigate. In December 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ordered the Navy to reduce planned LCS and FF procurement from 52 to 40 and downselect to one variant by FY 2019.

In July 2017, the Navy released a request for information for a new multi-mission guided-missile frigate that can perform the same roles as the LCS while having better offensive and defensive capabilities. Almost any existing design that can be adapted to FFG(X) requirements can be considered, extending beyond versions of the two LCS hulls. In April 2020, it was announced that Fincantieri Marinette Marine had won the contract with its FREMM multi-purpose frigate-based design, which would be eventually adopted as the .

==Design features==
The concept behind the littoral combat ship, as described by former Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England, is to &quot;create a small, fast, maneuverable and relatively inexpensive member of the DD(X) family of ships&quot;. The ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles, including anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, homeland defense, maritime intercept, special operations, and logistics. Due to its modular design, the LCS will be able to replace slower, more specialized ships such as minesweepers and larger amphibious-type assault ships.

Most of the mission modules&#x27; functions are performed by carried vehicles such as helicopters or unmanned vehicles such as the Spartan Scout, AN/WLD-1 RMS Remote Minehunting System and MQ-8B Fire Scout as part of the Navy&#x27;s goal to &quot;unman the front lines&quot;. Performing functions such as sonar sweeps for mines or submarines as well as launching torpedoes against hostile submarines at a distance from the ship is less risky. Placing sensors on remote vehicles allows the LCS to exploit concepts such as bistatic sonar. DARPA&#x27;s Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program aims to build a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (MALE UAV) that can operate from LCS-2 and can carry a payload of out to an operational radius of .
A 2010 report by the Pentagon&#x27;s director of operational test and evaluation (DOT&amp;E) found that neither design was expected to &quot;be survivable in a hostile combat environment&quot; and that neither ship could withstand the Navy&#x27;s full ship shock trials. The Navy responded that the LCS is built to a Level 1+ survivability standard and that the ships will rely on warnings from networks and speed to avoid being hit, or if hit be able to limp to safety. ADM Jonathan Greenert said that the crew would &quot;conduct an orderly abandon ship&quot; if their ship was struck by enemy fire, an action that might not be necessary on other vessels in the same circumstances. The ships were designed to minimize vulnerability with modern automated damage control systems to perform its mission, then withdraw from the area under its own power.
The combat abilities of the LCS were said to be &quot;very modest&quot; even before the cancellation of the XM501 Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System. The &quot;Independence&quot; variant reportedly has better helicopter facilities and more internal space while the &quot;Freedom&quot; variant is said to be better able to launch and recover boats in high seas. Admiral Gary Roughead said that a mix of both types would be &quot;operationally advantageous&quot;.

In April 2012, Chief of Naval Operations Greenert said, &quot;You won&#x27;t send it into an anti-access area&quot;; rather, groups of two or three ships are intended to be sent into areas where access is jeopardized to perform missions like minesweeping while under the cover of a destroyer. The LCS&#x27;s main purpose is to take up operations such as patrolling, port visits, anti-piracy, and partnership-building exercises to free up high-end surface combatants for increased combat availability. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus clarified that the ship could operate in combat areas while under the protection of other warships. The LCS&#x27;s utility against high-tech enemies would be when working with and being covered by destroyers, like they do with aircraft carriers. With destroyers providing extended air and missile defense, the cheaper (one-fourth the cost of a destroyer) and more numerous LCS can sweep for mines and deploy more sophisticated submarine-detecting sonar. Following the decision to arm the LCS with anti-ship missiles, Navy wargames showed the adversary&#x27;s risk calculus was radically changed, devoting more reconnaissance assets to trying to locate the smaller ships and sustaining heavier losses.

The ships are planned to have a 3:2:1 manning concept. That is three ship crews, and two hulls for each ship that is on station at any time. The other ship and other two crews who are not on deployment will either be preparing for deployment or in rotation in or out of theater. The result is a 50% reduction in ships and a 25% reduction in crews (and smaller crew sizes) than traditional deployment practices. The ships were predicted to fall short in manning. The Navy has deployed ships with berthing modules in the mission bays in order to carry the crew required for operations. However, the ships are designed with sufficient headroom to change from 2-high bunking to 3-high bunking, which would allow crew sizes of 100 if needed.

The LCS is the first USN surface combatant class in a generation to not use the Aegis Combat System, though Aegis-equipped variants have been offered to foreign customers. They have suffered from problems in their communications and radars and will require refits in these areas. Neither LCS class is able to defend itself effectively against anti-ship cruise missiles, which are commonly employed in the littorals, although they can disperse in shallow waters better than larger warships.

===Mission modules===
The LCS is reconfigured for various roles by changing mission packages, each of which includes mission module equipment (weapon systems, sensors, etc.), carried craft and mission crews. Modules include anti-submarine warfare (ASW), mine countermeasures (MCM), surface warfare (SUW), and special warfare missions. The MCM and SUW modules are planned to reach initial operating capability in Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, and the ASW module in FY 2016. Module changes were envisioned to allow a single LCS to change roles in a matter of hours at any commercial port, allowing it to rapidly optimize effectiveness against a threat. A report from the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) on a January 2012 sustainment wargame reportedly stated that, possibly for logistics reasons, the mission module changes may take as long as weeks, and that in the future, the Navy plans to use LCSs with a single module, with module changes being a rare occurrence. In 2014, &quot;Independence&quot; switched from mine to surface warfare modes in 96 hours on short notice.

In an announcement on 8 September 2016, the Navy revealed a radical change in operations and organization plans for the LCS. Of the 28 Flight 0 ships built or on order, the first four, two of each class, will be turned into training ships, and the remaining 24 will be divided into six divisions of four ships each: three divisions of the &quot;Freedom&quot; class based at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and three divisions of the &quot;Independence&quot; class based at Naval Station San Diego, California. The new organization does away with the LCS&#x27;s signature interchangeable mission module concept, with each division being tasked to fulfill one of the three mission sets. Crewing is also changed into a more simplified two-crew &quot;blue/gold&quot; model, like that used on submarines and minesweepers, where ships cycle to forward deployed locations with the two crews swapping roles every 4–5 months; aviation detachments will also deploy with the same LCS crew, creating an arrangement of a core 70-sailor crew to conduct the warfare mission and a 23-person air detachment.

====Surface warfare====
In addition to the ships&#x27; organic weapons systems, the surface warfare package includes two 30 mm gun systems, a counter-boat missile system, two rigid-hull inflatable boats (RHIBs), and weapons deployed from MH-60 helicopters and MQ-8 Fire Scout UAVs. The surface warfare mission module is intended to deal with small boats and is called the &quot;best swarm killer in the surface fleet&quot;. It includes two 30 mm gun mission modules manufactured by Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. The Navy&#x27;s proposed budget for FY 2015 includes funding for the Surface-to-Surface Missile Module (SSMM) for the first time.

In January 2011, the U.S. Navy recommended the selection of Raytheon&#x27;s Griffin missile to replace the NLOS-LS missile, lowering the LCS&#x27;s missile range from to . The packages were to be deployed in sets of three, with 15 per set for a total of 45 missiles. Initial deployment of the Griffin was set for 2015, with a longer-ranged version to enter service around 2017; however, procurement was canceled after the missiles were judged as &quot;too lightweight&quot;. An enhanced Griffin and the Sea Spear were considered likely competitors for the increment 2 missile. The Navy chose to integrate the millimeter wave radar-guided AGM-114L Hellfire missile to increase the LCS&#x27;s standoff firepower and defense against swarming fast attack craft. Navy use of the Hellfire gives access to the U.S. Army&#x27;s existing stockpile of 10,000 missiles. The Hellfire is an interim decision; the Navy is interested in developing a longer-range version. An LCS can carry 24 Hellfire missiles in its SSMM, using M299 vertical launchers mounted within a gas containment system; the SSMM design does not facilitate at-sea reloading. The Hellfire was slated to be operational aboard the LCS by 2017. A longer-range missile with an over-the-horizon (OTH) engagement capability was planned to defend against fast attack craft, ships, and patrol boats by 2020 as part of the surface warfare package Increment 4.

Norwegian company Kongsberg Defense &amp; Aerospace proposed equipping LCSs with their radar-evading Naval Strike Missile, presenting scale models of the &quot;Freedom&quot; class with 12 NSMs and the &quot;Independence&quot; class with 18 NSMs. In July 2014, the Navy confirmed that it would test-launch the NSM from to evaluate feasibility, the first time an LCS fired a surface-to-surface missile. The NSM has a range of , greater than the Harpoon anti-ship missile, but LCSs lack long-range fire control systems to detect targets at this distance. On 24 September 2014, the NSM was successfully fired at a mobile target. The LCS&#x27;s modular design makes it possible to add weapons and sensors as part of the warfare suite. This could mitigate lethality criticism of the LCS, which is oriented toward asymmetric swarm boat threats rather than comparable surface combatants.

In September 2015, the Navy issued a directive to install an OTH missile on &quot;Freedom&quot; and &quot;Coronado&quot; for their next deployments in early and mid-2016. The exact missile was not specified, but sources say it will be both the Harpoon and NSM, each ship equipped with only one model of missile. The directive calls for up to eight missiles, likely in two quad packs, to be installed on box launchers as a standalone system without requiring full integration into the LCS combat system. On 19 July 2016, &quot;Coronado&quot; conducted a live-fire missile test of a Block 1C Harpoon missile; although the missile missed the target, the test validated the ability to launch Harpoon missiles from the forward deck of an LCS. In May 2018, the Navy selected the NSM as the LCS&#x27;s OTH missile.

In January 2020, the Navy reported that Lockheed Martin&#x27;s 150 kW High Energy Laser with Integrated Optical-dazzler and Surveillance (HELIOS) would be put on for her upcoming deployment. The laser is part of a risk reduction effort to contribute to a layered laser defense effort and the LCS&#x27;s lethality to counter fast-attack craft and UAS.

====Anti-submarine module====
The anti-submarine module had its focus changed from stationary to en-stride systems (while the ship is moving) that are useful in the open ocean as well as in coastal areas. One of the items to be added is a torpedo detection capability. Thales has sold one CAPTAS-4 low-frequency active sonar to the U.S. Navy to be towed behind the LCS, with a potential order of 25 units. The USN tested combination of this unit, derived from the Sonar 2087 on British Type 23 frigates, with the TB-37 Multi-Function Towed Array (MFTA) found on U.S. warships. , deployment of the ASW module was planned for 2016, with the 2013 sequestration cuts potentially pushing it back to 2017.

Submarine detection will be achieved on the LCS using a variable depth sonar (VDS) and the TB-37 MFTA. Both can passively listen or actively emit to analyze the returns. The VDS was originally planned to be the Raytheon AN/SQS-62, but the Navy canceled it in 2022 due to high risk, instead choosing the Thales CAPTAS-4 in 2023. The VDS will allow the LCS to detect diesel-electric submarines while on the move. Submarines can hide behind water layers based on how sound is refracted through the temperature, salinity, and pressure profile; a VDS can pierce layers better than hull-mounted sonars found on destroyers and cruisers. LCSs will also be fitted with a torpedo decoy system under development. To destroy submarines, an MH-60S helicopter will deploy the Mark 54 Lightweight Torpedo.

A wargame held by the Naval War College demonstrated the possibility of using the LCS in open water operations to assist carrier strike groups and guided-missile destroyers. The LCS was found to be more useful in open water operations than previously considered. The wargame found that an LCS operating the ASW package could perform the mission, which freed up a destroyer that would normally perform the mission to contribute to the lethality of the strike group. Submarine hunting ability is increased by the combination of a destroyer&#x27;s towed array and hull-mounted sonar and an LCS&#x27;s VDS.

In July 2015, the Navy awarded three contracts to reduce the weight of the package elements down to or below 105 metric tons total to meet mission package weight requirements. Since both elements are mature and fielded (the VDS on Royal Navy Type 23 frigates and MFTA on and s), the systems cannot be overhauled, and other weight reduction ideas need to be implemented, such as lightening sensors and using composites in the handling system. Plans for the package shifted dramatically in 2011 when it was decided not to use the RMMV, used in the MCM package, in favor of an &quot;in stride&quot; capability. The ASW elements were chosen as cost-effective COTS sensors, so weight reduction needs by between 15 and 25 percent have been planned for since their selection for integration onto the LCS.

====Mine countermeasure module====
The Mine Countermeasure Module (MCM) is designed to provide minesweeping; remotely detecting and bypassing mines; and minehunting, detecting, and disabling. It was envisioned to perform &quot;influence&quot; minehunting via acoustic and magnetic signatures rather than contact or mechanical minehunting. The MCM includes the Airborne Laser Mine Detection system, the Airborne mine neutralization system, the AN/AQS-20A underwater towed sonar, the remote minehunting system, the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis system, and the Knifefish, a Surface mine countermeasure unmanned undersea vehicle. Canceled module features include the Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep System, and the Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System. The final increment IV MCM will not have an EOD team or an in-stride capability to neutralize discovered mines; neutralization is preceded by post-detection mission analysis.

The first increment of the MCM included three systems: the helicopter-deployed airborne laser mine detection system (ALMDS); the airborne mine neutralization system (AMNS); and the remote minehunting system (RMS) composed of the remote multi-mission vehicle (RMMV) paired with the AQS-20A sonar. The ALMDS detects mines near the top of the water, and the RMS will detect them below the waterline. To destroy mines, the AMNS is lowered by the helicopter and guided by an operator on board to neutralize it. Increment two will be the coastal battlefield reconnaissance and analysis system (COBRA) mounted on the MQ-8B to search beaches and surf zones.

Increment three will involve adding the Fleet-class unmanned surface vessel (USV) with the unmanned surface sweep system (USSS), a cable towed behind the boat. Each LCS will carry two, and they will be used for both MCM and ASW. It will mimic the acoustic and magnetic signature of a ship to fool magnetic and influence mines into detonating; introduction is expected in 2017. The final increment will be the Knifefish unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) to find and detect buried mines in 2019.

In February 2016, the Navy announced they were halting procurement of the RMMV due to reliability issues, with the existing ten RMMVs to be upgraded to increase reliability. The upgraded RMMVs will be fielded in 2018, and testing will be conducted to see if the Fleet class common unmanned surface vessel (CUSV) can tow the AQS-20A, and if successful will be used for minehunting by 2020. If the Knifefish UUV can have its endurance increased, the vessel will take over the mission from both systems.

====Irregular warfare and amphibious modules====
The Navy included an irregular warfare package in its 2012 budget request to Congress.

Californian congressman Duncan D. Hunter wrote that the purchase of 55 LCS units was made at the cost of 10 fewer amphibious vessels. Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Joseph Dunford said in 2011 that the LCS is one of the platforms under consideration to help close the gap in amphibious shipping. In August 2014, USS &quot;Coronado&quot; demonstrated the ability to rapidly stage and deploy Marine Corps ground units, including operations by two Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons (HMLA) that conducted day and night deck-landing qualifications. The &quot;Independence&quot;-class LCS&#x27;s features of high speed, a large flight deck to support UH-1Y Venom and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters, and reconfigurable mission bay can support air and small-boat employment and delivery of ground and air forces; a small Marine ground unit can be carried within an embarked mission module. In 2014, Marine Corps General John M. Paxton, Jr. claimed several deficiencies in using an LCS for amphibious operations as a substitute platform for an amphibious assault ship, including the ability to operate in difficult sea states, survivability in contested waters, limited flight deck and berthing space, and command and control limitations.

In 2014, the U.S. Coast Guard began advocating the LCS as a tailor-made platform for drug interdiction missions. Under pressure from Navy vessels retiring, the Coast Guard will suffer a surface vessel shortage for intercepting smuggling ships in the Caribbean area, forcing the Navy to examine other platforms for drug interdiction. The Coast Guard noted that the LCS has previously performed this task, and pointed towards its high speed and embarked helicopters to run down fast smuggling boats; the Navy plans to base 10 &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships at Naval Station Mayport, Florida which could be tasked to conduct interdiction missions.

==Development==
In the late 1990s, the U.S. Navy realized its Cold War-era cruisers and destroyers had been designed for open-ocean warfare and would be vulnerable in shallow coastal waters, where they would face dangers from high-speed boats, missile-firing fast-attack craft, small submarines, sea mines, and land and air-launched anti-ship missiles. The Navy&#x27;s official solution was the DD-21, a large coastal warship that could absorb hits. Two Navy strategists, retired Captain Wayne Hughes and Vice Admiral Art Cebrowski, refined an opposing &quot;Streetfighter&quot; concept for a 1,000-ton small, specialized, and heavily armed vessel costing just $90 million (2001 dollars). Being small, light and numerous, the &quot;Streetfighter&quot; was envisioned as a &quot;single-serving&quot; ship to be abandoned once it suffered battle damage deemed &quot;fatal&quot; to the ship, made possible by its low cost. The concept of a manned expendable warship was contentious and the idea was not picked up. When Donald Rumsfeld was made Secretary of Defense in early 2001, he promised transformational approaches and doing jobs with fewer people. In October 2001, Cebrowski was assigned to head the Pentagon&#x27;s new Office of Force Transformation, shortly after which Admiral Vernon Clark canceled the DD-21 and replaced it with a &quot;family&quot; of ships, including the littoral combat ship, being motivated to produce ships cheaper and faster to increase fleet size. Clark declared the LCS was his &quot;most transformational effort&quot; and number-one budget priority in 2003.

The Navy committed to the $15 billion (2003) program in advance of rigorous analysis or clearly defined purpose, appearance, or survivability. Proponents typically pointed to its speed, asymmetric littoral threats, and impact on the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The LCS suffered from requirements creep, adding more missions and equipment, potentially rendering it too complex and expensive to use. When it was decided the ship would not be expendable, the original concept of a small, cheap, simple coastal warship became bigger, more expensive, and more complicated, with a smaller crew due to automation. The new design was assigned six different missions which had been previously performed by individual ships: submarine and mine hunting; combating small boats; intelligence gathering; transporting special forces; and counter-drug and piracy patrols. Each ship would be big enough to sail across the Pacific alone, embark a helicopter, have a minimum 40 knot top speed, and cost $220 million. The Navy was only willing to build one type of ship; the ship&#x27;s task force, realizing that it would be virtually impossible for one vessel to fill all roles, advocated for a larger hull to cover the mission range through modularity, organic combat power, and unmanned systems. Empty space was left for weapon and sensor mission modules. When the first production contracts were awarded in 2004, no mission module worked outside of a laboratory. Fast, cheap construction was emphasized, solving problems with technology.
In 2003, the Navy launched its first experimental LCS, &quot;Sea Fighter&quot;, designated as fast sea frame or FSF-1. In 2005, the SWATH-hulled &quot;Sea Fighter&quot; entered service as an experimental vessel using mission modules. As the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;, , and classes were reaching the end of their lives, the U.S. Navy released the LCS requirement. In 2004, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon submitted design proposals. It was decided to produce two vessels each (Flight 0) of the Lockheed Martin design (LCS-1 and LCS-3) and of the General Dynamics design (LCS-2 and LCS-4). After these are brought into service, and experience gathered on the design&#x27;s usability and efficiency, the future design for the class would be chosen (Flight I). The ultimate decision was to fund both designs as two variants of the class. On 9 May 2005, Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England announced that the first LCS would be named . Her keel was laid down on 2 June 2005 at Marinette Marine, Marinette, Wisconsin. The contract to build the ship was managed by Lockheed&#x27;s Maritime Systems and Sensors (MS2) division, directed by Fred Moosally. On 23 September 2006, LCS-1 was christened and launched at the Marinette Marine shipyard. On 19 January 2006, the keel for the General Dynamics trimaran, , was laid at the Austal USA shipyards in Mobile, Alabama. LCS-2 was launched 30 April 2008.

==Operational history==
===Deployments and budget overruns===
In 2007, the U.S. Navy canceled contracts to build LCS-3 of Lockheed Martin and LCS-4 of General Dynamics and Austal USA, citing failure to control cost overruns. Subsequently, the Navy announced a new bidding process for the next three ships, the winner building two ships and the loser building one. In the 26 September 2008 U.S. presidential debate, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) cited the LCS as an example of botched contracting driving up costs unnecessarily. In March 2009, then-Secretary of the Navy Donald C. Winter announced that LCS-3 would be named after Fort Worth, Texas, and the fourth ship would be named &quot;Coronado&quot; after Coronado, California. The contracts for LCS-3 and LCS-4 were renewed in early 2009.

In April 2009, the Navy announced its revised procurement plan that three ships be funded in the FY 2010 budget; officials also hinted that the Navy may not down-select to one design for further orders, pointing out complementary features of the two designs. Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman called for fixed-price contracts to be adopted. Pressure mounted in Congress for the Navy to control the cost: in June 2009, during a hearing of the House Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, Subcommittee Chairman Gene Taylor, D-Miss, said that other contractors would be keen to build LCS as the subcommittee added language requiring the Navy to open bidding if either lead contractor walked away from the offered $460 million fixed price contracts. In response, the Naval Sea Systems Command conducted a study on whether reducing the top speed requirement from 40 knots to 30 could help keep the ships under the price cap.

The Congress asked the Navy to study improvement programs on existing ships in place of the LCS program. In June 2009, Vice Admiral Barry McCullough, USN testified in a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting that the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates and &quot;Avenger&quot;-class minesweepers were too worn out to cover the gap if the LCS suffered further delays. Retired Admiral James Lyons, USN called for a $220 million common design with the U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s National Security Cutter (NSC) program to save costs and meet &quot;limited warfare requirements&quot;. A Huntington-Ingalls study found that the NSC would be a better match for the listed mission set while lacking the LCS&#x27;s mission modules to perform many missions.

In May 2012, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems released a study that showed seven LCS can more efficiently perform anti-piracy patrols in the Western Indian Ocean than a fleet of 20 conventional ships for a quarter of the cost. To help reduce cost of each ships, in September 2009, Navy Acquisition Chief Sean Stackley and Vice Admiral Barry McCullough indicated that only one contractor would be offered a fixed price contract in 2010 for up to ten ships, followed by an offer to build five additional ships of the same design as the first contract to the secondary builder. The Congress agreed with the Navy on this plan. On 23 August 2010, the U.S. Navy announced a delay in awarding the contract for 10 ships until the year&#x27;s end.

FY 2010 budget documents revealed that the total costs of the two lead ships had risen to $637 million for &quot;Freedom&quot; and $704 million for &quot;Independence&quot;. On 16 January 2010, &quot;Independence&quot; was commissioned in Mobile, Alabama.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that deploying the first two ships will delay the overall program because these two ships were not available for testing and development so changes may have to be made in the second pair of ships during construction instead of in advance. The U.S. Navy responded that &quot;Early deployment brought LCS operational issues to the forefront much sooner than under the original schedule, some of which would not have been learnt until two years on.&quot;

In 2013, Under Secretary of the Navy Robert O. Work explained that cost overruns were partly due to the shipbuilders&#x27; bidding to American Bureau of Shipping commercial standards, the Navy changed this to Level I survivability standards for greater crew survivability, although the ships were not expected to operate after being hit. The Navy acknowledged that their failure to communicate clearly that the experimental and developmental nature of the first two ships caused a perception that the overall LCS program was in worse shape. A GAO report in July 2014 found that the annual cost to operate an LCS was $79 million, compared to $54 million to operate a larger frigate. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus pointed out that new vessels traditionally start off costing more to operate because of difficulties with building and testing ships simultaneously; GAO reports of new warships since the 1960s support this claim. As more littoral combat ships are built and enter service, Mabus said operational costs will decline to acceptable limits. On 2 November 2016 the Pentagon blocked publication of cost overruns on both designs.

On 2 December 2016, it was reported that the GAO was critical of the LCS&#x27;s ability to complete a navy requirement of 30 consecutive days underway without a critical failure of one or more essential subsystems. DOT&amp;E Michael Gilmore states that the current LCS fleet &quot;have a near-zero chance&quot; of meeting this requirement.

===Building both designs===
Instead of declaring a winner out of the two competing designs, the U.S. Navy in November 2010 asked the Congress to allow for the order of ten of each design. U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) said that the change was made because both bids were under the Congressional price cap. Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said that unlike the possibility of splitting orders for projects like KC-X or the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136, the Pentagon had already paid the development cost for both designs so there was no further development required for both designs and have them compete for future orders.

In December 2010, the Government Accountability Office identified some problems with the designs including extremely long crew training time, unrealistic maintenance plans, and the lack of comprehensive risk assessment. On 13 December 2010, both production teams extended their contract offers until 30 December in order to give more time for the Navy to push through the plan. The Navy would be forced to award the contract to only one team if it failed to secure Congressional approval. The Navy budgeted $490 million for each ship while the Congressional Budget Office projected a cost of $591 million for each ship. Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley testified to a Senate panel that the actual price range was $440 to $460 million.

A day before the offer&#x27;s expiration, both Lockheed Martin and Austal USA received Navy contracts for an additional ten ships of their designs; two ships of each design being built each year between 2011 and 2015. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s LCS-5 had a contractual price of $437 million, Austal USA&#x27;s contractual price for LCS-6 was $432 million. On 29 December 2010, Department of Navy Undersecretary Sean Stackley noted that the program was well within the Congressional cost cap of $480 million per ship. The average per-ship target price for Lockheed ships is $362 million, Stackley said, with a goal of $352 million for each Austal USA ships. Government-furnished equipment (GFE), such as weapons, add about $25 million per ship; another $20 million for change orders, and &quot;management reserve&quot; is also included. Stackley declared the average cost to buy an LCS should be between $430 million and $440 million. In the fiscal year 2011, the unit cost was $1.8 billion and the program cost $3.7 billion.
In May 2012, Robert Work said that the two designs may each be best suited to different theaters, the LCS-1 design being better suited for the enclosed waters of the Middle East, while the LCS-2 design for the Pacific Ocean&#x27;s open waters. In order to increase commonality, the Navy will force both types to use the same combat system electronics.

The handoff from General Dynamics to Austal of management for the &quot;Independence&quot; class led to a 13-month schedule slip as the company struggled with building the JHSV ships at the same facilities. In May 2013, the GAO called for a pause in ship construction until issues with the sea frames and modules were resolved. In August 2013, the USN revealed plans to reduce the procurement rate in 2016.

===Operational issues===
A 2012 report by Rear Admiral Samuel Perez, USN, found that the ships lacked the manpower and firepower to complete the missions required by regional combatant commanders. The report found that the LCS is &quot;ill-suited for combat operations against anything but&quot; small, fast boats not armed with anti-ship missiles. It also found that the excessive beam (width) of the trimaran &quot;Independence&quot;-class ships may pose a &quot;navigational challenge in narrow waterways and tight harbors&quot;. The report also found that the contractor-based maintenance scheme for the ships had led to poorly supervised and unaccountable contractors leaving problems unresolved. As contract workers are required to be American, they must be flown out to any foreign ports visited by an LCS. A special panel was appointed to investigate &quot;challenges identified&quot;. Twenty more bunks were installed to allow for a larger crew.

In 2013, Captain Kenneth Coleman, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s requirements officer for the program, identified the LCS as being especially vulnerable to tactical aircraft armed with standoff anti-ship missiles. Vice Admiral Thomas H. Copeman III is reported to be considering an upsized &quot;Super&quot; LCS, with space to install needed firepower, because he noted that the 57 mm main gun was more suitable to a patrol boat than a frigate. Austal&#x27;s vice president for sales, Craig Hooper, suggested that the ships should instead be used for UAV operations. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has called the lack of identified missions for the LCS &quot;one of its greatest strengths&quot;. The various modules all use the same Internet Protocol formats. In 2013 Congressional auditors found that the ships lacked robust communications systems and a USN review &quot;uncovered classified deficiencies&quot; in the ship&#x27;s cyberdefenses.

At a hearing on 25 July 2013, the House Armed Services Committee&#x27;s seapower subcommittee argued with Vice Admiral Richard W. Hunt on how the LCS would be employed if tensions with North Korea or China led to a confrontation in the Western Pacific. Hunt said the ships are designed in accordance with the Navy&#x27;s survivability standards, and that the LCS would be used during the initial phase in the theatre and sense the environment before hostilities occur. Detractors claim the LCS is not survivable enough for long-range threats that China possesses; LCSs are built to the Navy&#x27;s survivability category Level I+, higher than Level I patrol craft and mine warfare ships, but lower than the Level II &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate they are replacing. The Navy has said the LCS was designed to pull out of combat upon sustaining damage. The baseline LCS seaframe designs, however, boast a better air and missile defense capability than the partially disarmed and now retired Perry class, which somewhat counters claims that LCS is &quot;unsurvivable&quot;. Other observers suggest that the ships&#x27; lifecycle costs and resilience challenges result from the optimal-manning concept, which increases the Navy&#x27;s dependence on contractors and diminishes opportunities to monitor and repair engineering systems during operations.

The deployment of USS &quot;Freedom&quot; was seen by the Navy as an opportunity to test the ship and operational concepts in the real-world. The Navy was about to conclude a war game at the Naval War College to examine ways of exploiting LCS capabilities in Western Pacific and other scenarios. Hunt added that the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission package would play an important role in protecting aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, and the mine countermeasures (MCMs) mission package would also provide necessary port security and waterway patrol capability following combat operations.

A Government Accountability Office report in April 2014 found that several U.S. 7th Fleet officials thought the LCS was more useful in the Persian Gulf, but not suitable in the Pacific theater as they lacked the speed, range, and electronic warfare capabilities. The first two vessels from each maker were found to be overweight and not meeting performance requirements for endurance or sprinting over 40 knots. Navy leaders contend that the LCS&#x27;s shallow draft is well suited for Pacific operations due to the many shallow-water ports, typically difficult for larger warships to access. The GAO report recommended the Navy consider buying fewer ships of the type if its limitations prevent effective use in the Pacific theater. The GAO also found that both designs were overweight and underperforming.

===Revised requirements and designs===

A 2013 DOT&amp;E report on the two LCSs raised doubts about their survivability, as they did not include features for sustained combat operations. Concerned that the LCS would make up one-sixth of the Navy&#x27;s 300-ship force, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed the Navy to submit alternative proposals for a versatile surface combatant comparable to a frigate. Options considered included the in use by the U.S. Coast Guard, three variants of differing size, an Aegis-equipped version of the , and lastly, an American-built version of the Spanish Navy&#x27;s F-100-class frigate.

On 30 April 2014, the Navy issued two requests for information (RFI) to industry. Lockheed Martin responded with a variant of their &quot;Freedom&quot;-class LCS; upgrades included an increase in length to , vertical launch systems for Standard Missile 2 missiles or the Standard Missile 6, and the SPY-1F Aegis radar or an Air Missile Defense Radar derivative. Austal USA submitted a modified &quot;Independence&quot;-class ship, replacing the LCS&#x27; mission modules with permanent systems like a towed array sonar, torpedoes, vertical launch anti-submarine rockets, and aviation capability to support MH-60 helicopters. Like Lockheed&#x27;s submission, it had a vertical launch system for Standard missiles, a 76 mm gun in place of the 57 mm gun, and could take on an Aegis or ADMR radar. Huntington Ingalls Industries submitted a larger, more heavily armed Legend-class cutter. General Dynamics provided an unspecified response.

Results from the Navy task force on LCS upgrades, capabilities, costs, and alternative options were completed by 31 July 2014 for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to review. On 11 December 2014, Hagel accepted the Navy&#x27;s recommendation to base the remaining 20 SSCs on more powerful versions of both existing LCS designs. The new SSC was planned to have an improved 3D air defense radar, air defense decoys, better electronic warfare systems, over-the-horizon anti-ship missiles, multi-function towed array sonar, torpedo defenses, additional armor, and less displacement than Flight 0 vessels.

The new SSC would now focus on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, with mine countermeasures handled by existing LCSs. It would retain the ability to carry mission modules and LCS mission package equipment, including 30 mm and 57 mm cannons, Hellfire missiles, RHIBs, and the ASW variable-depth sonar. Other planned enhancements include spaced armor, installation of Mk 38 Mod 2 25 mm chain guns, improved decoy systems, the SeaRAM missile interceptor, a &quot;lite&quot; version of the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP), and improved signature management through degaussing.

This new SSC was projected to cost $60–$75 million more than a Flight 0 LCS, with procurement beginning by 2019. Hagel also directed the Navy to study which improvements could be fitted to completed and incomplete LCSs. This new design would decision prioritize surface and submarine defenses over anti-aircraft or missile defense, which would be left instead to large surface combatants. Contrary to industry submissions and advice from naval experts, vertical launch systems were not included in the new designs for reasons of weight and cost.

In January 2015, the Navy announced that the up-gunned LCS would be reclassified as a frigate. Hull designations were changed from LCS to FF, including LCSs back-fitted with modifications. The Navy planned to start upgrading existing and incomplete LCSs before 2019. To free up weight for the new systems, the frigates removed LCS equipment that was no longer needed, such as the handling equipment needed to launch and recover the RMMV for the MCM mission package. To accommodate the changes while using the same hull designs, the original LCS high sprint speed was dropped. The LCS&#x27; two 11-meter RHIBs were replaced with two 7-meter equivalents.

A report released in September 2015 indicated that the first 24 ships would retain the basic design principles of the LCS program, with upgrades where needed. This group would be considered &quot;Block 0&quot; and also retain the &quot;LCS&quot; designation, for the time being. Ships 25 through 32, &quot;Block 1&quot; would include significant upgrades and design changes, inline with the intended capabilities of the last 20 ships of the total 52-ship procurement, these being the new &quot;Frigate&quot; class. The new frigates would be larger, with increased defensive and survivability capabilities.

===Reduced procurement and early retirement===
On 14 December 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ordered the Navy to reduce the planned procurement of LCS and FF ships from 52 to 40, and down-select to one variant by FY 2019. The intent of this cut was to reallocate funds to other priorities, including buying more F-35C Lightning II and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters, and SM-6 missiles, accelerating Flight III &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyer DDG-51 acquisition, and expanding development of the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) for the Block V . Though fewer ships would be available in some instances, those needs were expected to be met by higher-end vessels.

In February 2020, media reports stated that the U.S. Navy proposed to retire the first four LCSs in 2021 as part of a cost-savings measure. If approved, these would have been USS &quot;Freedom&quot; and USS &quot;Fort Worth&quot; from the &quot;Freedom&quot; class, and USS &quot;Independence&quot; and USS &quot;Coronado&quot; from the &quot;Independence&quot; class.

On 18 June 2021, &quot;Naval News&quot; reported that, in a report to Congress, the Navy planned to inactivate &quot;Fort Worth&quot;, &quot;Coronado&quot;, &quot;Detroit&quot; and &quot;Little Rock&quot; in Fiscal Year 2022 and put them on the Out of Commission in Reserve (OCIR) list. In the final budget Congress forbade the Navy from retiring the three &quot;Freedom&quot; class ships in Fiscal Year 2022. By May 2022, the Navy shifted its plans to decommission nine LCS warships in Fiscal Year 2023, citing their ineffective anti-submarine warfare system, their inability to perform any of the Navy&#x27;s missions, constant breakdowns, and structural failures in high-stress areas of the ships.

==Foreign sales==
Saudi Arabia and Israel both expressed an interest in a modified version of the &quot;Freedom&quot; variant, the LCS-I, but Israel dropped out of this project in favor of a new frigate design to be built in Israel. Interest by Saudi Arabia in LCS continues however. Media reports indicate that Saudi Arabia could buy two to four ships of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s &quot;Freedom&quot;-class LCS variant as part of the Saudi Arabian Naval Expansion Program II—a program to modernize the nation&#x27;s oldest warships operating in the Persian Gulf. On 22 May 2017, as part of an arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia, the acquisition of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) ships based on the &quot;Freedom&quot;-class LCS was announced.

In October 2010, the Taiwanese navy showed interest in procuring U.S. littoral combat ships, to replace aging s. In November 2023, Taiwanese media reported that Taiwanese navy was planning to procure littoral combat ships with support from the Legislative Yuan. However, the Taiwanese Navy denied the plan. According to analysts, the probability of introducing LCS to Taiwan was low due the incompatibility with existing naval infrastructure and combat system, high maintenance requirement, high cost of sustainment, and the possibility of introducing propaganda opportunity for China considering LCS&#x27;s poor reputation.

Japan will design its own version of the &quot;Independence&quot; class. The warship concept was unveiled in the defense trade-show MAST Asia 2017.

The Royal Malaysian Navy has also built its littoral combat ship based on the &quot;Gowind&quot;-class design, named &quot;Maharaja Lela&quot;-class frigate.

==List of littoral combat ships==

, a total of 35 littoral combat ships is planned, including 16 &quot;Freedom&quot;-class ships and 19 &quot;Independence&quot;-class ships. Ships are assigned to either Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One, based in San Diego Ca., or Littoral Combat Ship Squadron Two, based in Mayport, Florida.
Note: The Navy has yet to place orders for 17th, 18th, and 19th &quot;Freedom&quot;-class variants. Should that occur, they will be entered on this list as &quot;LCS-33&quot;, &quot;LCS-35&quot;, and &quot;LCS-37&quot;.

<text>If You Had Wings was an attraction at Walt Disney World. It was a two-person Omnimover dark ride in Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom, sponsored by Eastern Air Lines. It featured travel destinations throughout the Caribbean and elsewhere, all of which were served by Eastern. It had an eponymous theme song by Buddy Baker.

==Overview==
Guests passed through a series of colorful theater-like sets with rear-projected short scenes of straw-hat markets, fishermen, limbo dancers, and steel drum bands. Locations featured various Eastern destinations, like Mexico, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad, and New Orleans.

Then, the vehicles reclined into a room with projected snippets of flights taking off on an ovoid-shaped surface. Next, film of snow-covered mountains reflected on floor-to-ceiling mirrors.

As guests disembarked to an area containing an Eastern Air Lines reservation desk, an agent stood ready to assist riders with travel arrangements.

Diorama windows allowed the Mexico, Jamaica, and Trinidad scenes to be visible from the WEDWay PeopleMover.

In 1987, Eastern withdrew its sponsorship and the attraction closed on June 1 of that year. Eastern itself went out of business four years later.

==Successors==
After the closing of the original attraction, new attractions were created to inhabit the same space.

===If You Could Fly===

Disney removed all references to Eastern, changed the name of the ride to &quot;If You Could Fly&quot;, and re-opened it on June 6, 1987. The sets and films were intact, but the theme music had been replaced. On January 4, 1989, &quot;If You Could Fly&quot; was permanently closed.

===Delta Dreamflight===
Soon after, Delta Air Lines took over sponsorship and made plans to update and remodel the attraction. The replacement was &quot;Delta Dreamflight&quot;, which made use of the same ride system and floor layout, but all-new scenery and music.

===Take Flight===
Delta dropped its sponsorship in June 1996. WDW removed all references to Delta and renamed the attraction &quot;Take Flight&quot;. The ride lasted two years, closing in January 1998. Unlike the musical change from &quot;If You Had Wings&quot; to &quot;If You Could Fly&quot;, &quot;Take Flight&quot;″s music was the same as &quot;Dreamflight&quot;″s except for minor alterations to the lyrics.

===Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin===
Disney now uses the space for the attraction Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, where riders can control the rotation of their vehicle via joysticks, and are armed with laser cannons to shoot at targets stationed throughout the attraction. Many of the elements in this attraction are similar to If You Had Wings, including the speed tunnel with the projections on the walls, and the loading and unloading areas. Buzz Lightyear sign above the door is in the shape of a cloud and was painted over after the attraction was renamed.

<doc id="460014" wikidata="Q1415934" url="?curid=460014" title="Version 2.0">
<text>Version 2.0 is the second studio album by Scottish/American rock band Garbage. It was released on May 11, 1998, by Mushroom Records worldwide, with the North American release on Almo Sounds the following day. With this album, the band aimed to improve and expand upon the style of their 1995 eponymous debut rather than reinventing their sound. Lead singer Shirley Manson wrote dark, introspective lyrics, which she felt complemented the songs&#x27; melodies.

&quot;Version 2.0&quot; was a commercial success, topping the charts in the United Kingdom, France, and New Zealand, and earning platinum certifications in several countries. The album has sold 1.7 million copies in the United States and four million copies worldwide. Garbage embarked on an 18-month-long world tour, and released a string of commercially successful singles backed with innovative music videos. &quot;Version 2.0&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, and was included on year-end lists of 1998&#x27;s best albums by several publications. In 1999, it was nominated for Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Rock Album. The album&#x27;s third single &quot;Special&quot; was further nominated the following year for Best Rock Song and for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.

==Recording==
Garbage began writing their second album, which would go under the working title of &quot;Sad Alcoholic Clowns&quot;, in March 1997 in the band&#x27;s label head Jerry Moss&#x27;s vacation house in Friday Harbor, Washington. The group demoed and made rough outlines for new songs. When they felt they had made a good start, Garbage took the work they made in Washington back to their Madison, Wisconsin, base at Smart Studios and begin fleshing out the ideas and rough sketches over the following year. The group recorded all of their work for the second album through a 48-track digital system digitally, direct to hard drives utilizing a 24-bit Pro Tools rig. While only one recorder was up in the early sessions, eventually another was installed to edit, and ultimately a third so Manson could record vocals while the other members fiddled with recordings. Vig estimated that the sample collage approach led to &quot;probably have five albums&#x27; worth of music&quot;, and songs featuring up to 120 audio tracks. After the digital file was ready, mixing was done in an analog tape deck, which held only 14 tracks.

Much of the percussion was recorded in a disused candy factory located in Madison; Vig, Steve Marker and sound engineer Billy Bush set up a drum kit within the factory and recorded various fills, utilizing the acoustics of the dilapidated building. Forced to stop after local police officers responded to complaints about the noise, some of the percussion was later incorporated into &quot;Temptation Waits&quot;, &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Paranoid&quot; and &quot;Hammering in My Head&quot;.

Garbage completed recording by December 1997, as Manson wanted to return to her family in Scotland for Christmas, and asked her bandmates to just move onto the mixing. Vig added that otherwise more time would be spent recording, and &quot;it was kind of scary—because we had to commit to what these songs were going to become.&quot; Production was done until mid-February 1998. The eventual title, &quot;Version 2.0&quot;, was a tongue-in-cheek take on how computers were heavily involved in the album&#x27;s production, with Manson adding that &quot;in the studio, at any given moment, someone would come in and find the four of us in front of the screen.&quot;

==Composition and style==
Building on framework sound and style Garbage established on their debut set, &quot;Version 2.0&quot; featured musical references to the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, songs featuring live strings, over 100 recorded tracks, and an interpolation of the Beach Boys and The Pretenders. The band said that the goal of &quot;Version 2.0&quot; was to create a &quot;rapprochement between the high-tech and low-down, the now sound and of golden memories.&quot; Butch Vig stated that the band did not want to reinvent their sound, as they &quot;felt that we had carved our own turf on the first record and we wanted to take everything we did and make it better&quot;. This meant to &quot;have the guitars noisier and write poppier melodies&quot;, showing how the band had grown together: &quot;With &quot;Garbage&quot;, we were struggling to find an identity and to get comfortable with Shirley – and vice versa. After touring so much, there&#x27;s a better camaraderie and sense of communication.&quot;

Shirley Manson declared that &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to totally embrace the world of electronica&quot;, so &quot;Version 2.0&quot; juxtaposed &quot;the super-hi-fi with the super-organic&quot;. The band wanted there to be echoes of music they like in the record, &quot;and that means not just Björk and Portishead and Radiohead but the Beatles and Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra&quot;, Manson said, concluding that the album is overall &quot;more diverse—it goes to extremes.&quot; The increased usage of techno beats emerged from frequent exposure to electronic music during the Garbage tour, both in clubs and listening to The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. Steve Marker stated that the band used as a reference point the &quot;Garbage&quot; song &quot;As Heaven Is Wide&quot;, &quot;but with a more technoey and dance end.&quot; The band also aimed to channel some of the energy of their live shows into the rhythm parts of the album. Vig remarked that &quot;the songs sound looser, tougher&quot; that way, as by the last concerts, &quot;we&#x27;d speeded things up and toughened up a lot of the grooves&quot; and in the album &quot;we wanted that to be apparent from the get-go.&quot;

While &quot;Garbage&quot; had lyrical input from all band members, Manson was responsible for all the lyrics in &quot;Version 2.0&quot;. Consequently, it was described by Manson as &quot;more direct and more personal than the first. I was able to verbalize things a little clearer this time—I mean, I&#x27;m no Nick Cave, I&#x27;m never gonna be Bob Dylan. I do what I can to express myself.&quot; The singer &quot;tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies&quot;, adding that &quot;like human beings, songs shouldn&#x27;t be one-dimensional&quot;. The singer declared that the introspective nature of &quot;Version 2.0&quot; served to &quot;reassure myself while I&#x27;m going crazy&quot; due to her experiences during production, as she was &quot;living by myself in a hotel, and I had no one to really talk to&quot; and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only &quot;The Trick Is to Keep Breathing&quot; had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. &quot;Medication&quot; came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is &quot;a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn&#x27;t all my fault. There&#x27;s a huge relief and release that comes from that&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The entire visual campaign for &quot;Version 2.0&quot; was tailored to play off the album cover artwork, the icons designed to represent each single release, provided point-of-sale and the band&#x27;s videogenic sensibility. Garbage spent three weeks in Europe providing interviews with music journalists from a multitude of territories, while Manson continued on her own to Australia and Asia.

&quot;Version 2.0&quot; was released in Japan on May 4, 1998, a week ahead of the international street date, to counteract parallel imports. The album was released in two editions, a standard album with a bonus remix of &quot;Push It&quot; by Boom Boom Satellites and a limited run of 20,000 copies featuring two international B-sides, &quot;Lick the Pavement&quot; and a cover version of Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;. &quot;Version 2.0&quot; debuted at number four in the Japanese international album chart.

On May 11, &quot;Version 2.0&quot; was released worldwide, with the North American street date a day later. Mushroom Records released the album in the United Kingdom on CD, LP and cassette. In North America, &quot;Version 2.0&quot; was released on CD and cassette by Almo Sounds in partnership with Interscope Records, who shipped 500,000 copies to stores in the first week.

==Tour==
Preceding the start of their world tour, Garbage played three shows in the Midwest under the alias Stupid Girl. The Version 2.0 World Tour officially kicked off with club dates starting at San Francisco&#x27;s Warfield Theatre on May 20, 1998, and took the band to a number of cities in the United States and Canada. Garbage then travelled to Europe to play a number of rock festivals beginning June 1 at Netherlands&#x27; Pinkpop and wrapping up at Scotland&#x27;s T in the Park on July 12. In between the festivals, Garbage performed some headlining shows in France and the United Kingdom, with support coming from The Crystal Method. In August, the band travelled to Japan to perform on the bill at the Fuji Rock Festival, and then back to Scotland to perform at two &quot;warm up&quot; shows at Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowland Ballroom and then headlining the last night of the Reading Festival.

Garbage returned to North America on September 17, to start a three-month tour. Support came from Girls Against Boys. The itinerary took the band from Denver, up the West Coast as far north as Vancouver, before routing towards the Southern states. Following these dates, the tour moved up the Eastern Seaboard and into Quebec and Ontario, before finishing up in the Midwest on November 28 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. During December, Garbage performed at radio shows on both coasts, including KROQ-FM&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas, and made a visit to Mexico City before wrapping up on December 20 in Detroit.

Continuing their touring commitment into 1999, Garbage launched a European arena tour on January 14 at Dublin&#x27;s Point Theatre. Local acts such as Laurent Garnier and The Rasmus supported continental dates; Moloko supported Irish and UK shows. Concerts in Paris and St. Petersburg were filmed to be broadcast by MTV Europe and MTV Russia, respectively. A show in Tallinn was cancelled on the day when the band&#x27;s equipment was held up by customs officials at the Estonian border. The European run ended in Madrid on February 11. Garbage then returned to North America to support Alanis Morissette on two legs of her Junkie Tour, starting on February 16 in Cincinnati, routing along the Midwest, Four Corners states and onto the West Coast, ending on April 7 in Los Angeles.

Garbage revisited Europe to play a second summer of rock festivals, beginning with Vienna&#x27;s Libro on May 19. The shows included visits to Israel and Iceland, although four concerts in the Baltic States and Russia were cancelled on the advice of the American Embassy due to the US&#x27;s involvement in Kosovo. Garbage headlined a special show to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh on July 1. The European dates conclude in Duisburg on July 25. Garbage then travelled to South Africa to play four shows with Placebo.

The final legs of the Version 2.0 tour see Garbage moving on to New Zealand and Australia to co-headline with Alanis Morissette, beginning in Auckland for 16 days from October 1, and ending in Newcastle. During this time the band also performed at the Livid festival. Garbage returned to North America to wind down the tour by headlining a series of shows organised by MTV on university campuses. Titled the &quot;Campus Invasion Tour&quot;, and supported by Lit, the shows began on October 20 in Denver and is routed through the Midwest, North East and Southern States, Arizona and California. The final date of the Version 2.0 tour is held in Irvine, California, on November 24.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Version 2.0&quot; received critical acclaim. In a review for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Christopher John Farley found its music exceptional because of songs that are gloomy and sexual yet lively and introspective, while J. D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said the album is a more melodic version of the approach exhibited on &quot;Garbage&quot;, and commended the songwriting and Manson&#x27;s multifaceted singing. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot believed its mix of pop and electronica has an &quot;ersatz charm&quot;, while the noisy production retains Garbage&#x27;s tuneful hooks. Barry Walters of &quot;Spin&quot; felt the songs are better developed than on the band&#x27;s debut, while showcasing their passionate, avant-garde sounds and Manson&#x27;s personalized yet relatable lyrics. According to Jim Farber of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Manson&#x27;s vocal presence elevates the unexpected sounds and makes the songs &quot;more than just clever exercises in avant-pop&quot;. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, said the songwriting has improved, but Manson remains the highlight, her seductive, emotive singing evoking new wave greats and appropriating the band&#x27;s complex sounds into a well-crafted, original rock album. Donna Freydkin of CNN commended the album for enhancing, not departing from, the style of the debut, and praised the amalgam of sounds and Manson&#x27;s &quot;clever, biting lyrics&quot;. In a column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau concluded that the metallic, discordant music suits Manson&#x27;s aggressive sexuality and allows listeners to experience sadomasochism vicariously through &quot;12 impregnable theoretical hits&quot;. Jane Rocca of &quot;The Age&quot; praised it as a &quot;personality loaded&quot; sonic spectacle and concluded that it &quot;salutes the new millennium with futuristic nuance&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Paul Verna said the group has expanded the possibilities on an impressive upgrade to their debut. John Pecorelli of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; felt that the album noticeably deviates from the style of &quot;Garbage&quot; as it is more melodious, more saturated, and features enhanced percussion, while its lyrical themes make it arguably more subversive.

Other reviewers lamented Manson&#x27;s singing and the production effects. Brett Milano conceded in &quot;Stereo Review&quot; that Garbage can produce hooky songs, but felt Manson showed limited &quot;emotional range&quot; as she sang in no other way but &quot;sexy&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s David Gates was critical of the samples and what he believed to be &quot;space-age wheeps&quot; and &quot;calculated showbiz shtik&quot; in the music. Danny Eccleston of &quot;The Times&quot; facetiously remarked &quot;it&#x27;s bin done&quot; in reference to the similar approach used on &quot;Garbage&quot;. Stephen Dalton of &quot;NME&quot; called the album a lifeless, &quot;beautiful engineered piece of modern design&quot; and believed Manson&#x27;s lyrics to be its weakness, criticizing a directness and shortage of wit. Melissa Bobbitt of &quot;The About Group&quot; was more enthusiastic in a retrospective on important 1990s rock records by female artists. She argued that Manson&#x27;s intimidating and alluring style, the singular electronic rock sound, and the feminist stance on &quot;Version 2.0&quot; were innovative at the time, but these elements also embodied &quot;the futuristic path music and technology were racing toward&quot; and can be heard throughout modern popular music. Reviewer Neil Z. Yeung also praised the album in his re-evaluation for AllMusic, calling &quot;Version 2.0&quot; &quot;Balanced and taut&quot; and &quot;a greatest-hits collection packaged as a regular album, [that is] not only a peak in Garbage&#x27;s catalog, but one of the definitive releases of the late &#x27;90s.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Version 2.0&quot; was voted the 19th best album of 1998 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual critics poll run by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

It was the seventh and 18th highest rated album by &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, respectively. &quot;Version 2.0&quot; was Canada&#x27;s largest modern rock station, The Edge 102&#x27;s number-one album, while three tracks make Australia&#x27;s Triple J Hottest 100 annual poll: &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Paranoid&quot; (at number 57), &quot;Push It&quot; (number 87), and &quot;Special&quot; (number 89).

On July 14, the video for &quot;Push It&quot; was nominated for eight MTV Video Music Awards (for Best Group Video, Best Alternative Video, Best Breakthrough Video, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Direction and Best Special Effects), coming second to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; video which received nine.

<text>The Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Poland. It is a member of the Polish Ecumenical Council, the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Warsaw.

==History==
Modern Baptist work began in Poland in 1844. The first typical Polish congregation was formed in the village of Zelow in 1872. Polish Baptists adopted the &quot;German Baptist Confession of 1847&quot; as their own confession.

In 1922, the &quot;Union of Slavic Baptists in Poland&quot; was formed, and the &quot;Union of the Baptist Churches of the German Language&quot; was formed in 1928. The unions of German-speaking and Polish-speaking Baptists existed until World War II, when they were forced into a merger with other evangelical Christian bodies. In 1946, the Baptist Christian Church of the Republic of Poland was founded. In 1994, it founded the Warsaw Baptist Theological Seminary in Warsaw. 

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 102 churches and 5,390 members.

<text>The Mitsubishi J8M &quot;Shūsui&quot; (Japanese: 三菱 J8M 秋水, literally &quot;Autumn Water&quot;, used as a poetic term meaning &quot;Sharp Sword&quot;, deriving from the swishing sound of a sword) is a Japanese World War II rocket-powered interceptor aircraft closely based on the German Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;. Built as a joint project for both the Navy and the Army Air Services, it was designated J8M (Navy) and Ki-200 (Army).

==Design and development==
The J8M1 was intended to be a licence-built copy of the Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;, but difficulties in shipping an example to Japan meant that the aircraft eventually had to be reverse-engineered from a flight operations manual and other limited documentation. A single prototype was tested before the end of World War II.

The Japanese were aware of the results of the strategic bombing of Germany, and they knew that the B-29 Superfortress would be bombing Japan and that there would be problems trying to combat this. Japanese military attachés had become aware of the &quot;Komet&quot; during a visit to the Bad Zwischenahn airfield of &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; 16, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; evaluation squadron charged with service test of the revolutionary rocket-propelled interceptor. They negotiated the rights to licence-produce the aircraft and its Walter HWK 509A rocket engine. The engine licence alone cost the Japanese 20 million &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; (equivalent to million euros).

The agreement was for Germany to provide the following by spring 1944:
* Complete blueprints of the Me 163B &quot;Komet&quot; and the HWK 509A engine.
* One complete &quot;Komet&quot;; two sets of sub-assemblies and components.
* Three complete HWK 509A engines.
* Inform Japan of any improvements and developments of the &quot;Komet&quot;.
* Allow the Japanese to study the manufacturing processes for both the &quot;Komet&quot; and the engine.
* Allow the Japanese to study &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operational procedures for the &quot;Komet&quot;.

The broken-down aircraft and engine were sent to Kobe, Japan in early 1944. It is probable that the airframe was on the Japanese submarine &quot;RO-501&quot; (ex-&quot;&quot;), which left Kiel, Germany on 30 March 1944 and was sunk in the mid-Atlantic on 13 May 1944 by the hunter-killer group based on the escort carrier . Plans and engines were on the Japanese submarine &quot;I-29&quot;, which left Lorient, France on 16 April 1944 and arrived in Singapore on 14 July 1944, later sunk by the submarine on 26 July 1944, near the Philippines, after leaving Singapore.

The Japanese decided to attempt to copy the Me 163 using a basic instructional manual on the &quot;Komet&quot; in the hands of naval mission member Commander Eiichi Iwaya, who had travelled to Singapore in the &quot;I-29&quot; and flown on to Japan when the submarine docked. Germany tried to send another &quot;Komet&quot; in &quot;U-864&quot;, but the submarine was sunk near Bergen by British submarine in February 1945.

From its inception, the project was a joint Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (JAAF)/Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (JNAF) venture. The JAAF wanted a new design to be drawn up. The JNAF, on the other hand, felt the design should mimic the German &quot;Komet&quot; because it had already proven to be a stable aerodynamic body. It was the JNAF which won and issued the &quot;19-shi&quot; specification in July 1944 for the design of the rocket-powered defence fighter. The contract went to Mitsubishi &quot;Jukogyo&quot; KK, which would produce both the JNAF version the J8M1 &quot;Shūsui&quot; and the JAAF version Ki-200.

The project was headed by Mijiro Takahashi. The JAAF, however decided to undertake their own design to meet the &quot;19-shi&quot; specifications, working at their &quot;Rikugun Kokugijitsu Kenkyujo&quot; (JAAF Aerotechnical Institute) in secret.

At the 1st Naval Air Technical Arsenal in Yokosuka, in association with Mitsubishi and Yokosuka Arsenal, work began to adapt the Walter HWK 509A engine to Japanese manufacturing capabilities and techniques. This was also where efforts were underway to produce a glider version of the J8M to provide handling data. While working on this glider, the MXY8 &quot;Akigusa&quot; (秋草, &quot;Autumn Grass&quot;), Mitsubishi completed a mock-up of the J8M1 in September 1944.

Both the JAAF and JNAF approved its design and construction, and a prototype was built. In December 1944, the MXY8 was completed and, on 8 December 1944, at the Hyakurigahara Airfield, Lieutenant-Commander Toyohiko Inuzuka took the controls of the MXY8. Once in the air, Inuzuka found the MXY8 almost perfectly emulated the handling characteristics of the &quot;Komet&quot;. Two additional MXY8 gliders were constructed in the naval yard at Yokosuka, and one was delivered to the &quot;Rikugun Kokugijitsu Kenkyujo&quot; (JAAF Aerotechnical Institute) at Tachikawa for evaluation. The JNAF initiated the construction of another prototype, production designation Ku-13. This was to use water ballast to simulate the weight of an operational J8M, complete with engine and weapons. This variant was to be built by Maeda Aircraft Institute, while the JAAF version was to be constructed by &quot;Yokoi Koku KK&quot; (Yoki Aircraft Co). The JNAF also proposed a more advanced trainer, designated the MXY9 &quot;Shūka&quot; (秋火, &quot;Autumn Fire&quot;), which would be powered by a thrust Tsu-11 ducted-fan engine. However, the war ended before this model could be built.

Mitsubishi and partners Nissan and Fuji proceeded with development of the airframe, and Yokosuka Arsenal was adapting the engine for Japanese production, designated the Ro.2. The Japanese succeeded in producing prototypes that outwardly looked very much similar to the &quot;Komet&quot;. The J8M1 had a wet weight that was lighter, the aircraft having a plywood main spar and wooden vertical tail. The designers had also dispensed with the armoured glass in the cockpit, and the aircraft carried less ammunition and slightly less fuel.

The Ki-200 and the J8M1 differed only in minor items, but the most obvious difference was the JAAF&#x27;s Ki-200 was armed with two 30 mm (1.18 in) Type 5 cannon (with a rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute and a muzzle velocity of ), while the J8M1 was armed with two 30 mm (1.18 in) Ho-105 cannon (rate of fire 400 rounds per minute, muzzle velocity . The Ho-105 was the lighter of the two and both offered a higher velocity than the MK 108 cannon of the Me 163 (whose muzzle velocity was . The Toko Ro.2 (KR10) rocket motor did not offer the same thrust rating as the original, and Mitsubishi calculated that the lighter weight of the J8M1 would not offset this. Performance would not be as good as that of the &quot;Komet&quot; but was still substantial.

The engine used the German propellants of T-Stoff oxidizer and C-Stoff fuel (hydrogen peroxide/methanol-hydrazine), known in Japan as &quot;Ko&quot; and &quot;Otsu&quot; respectively.

A total of sixty of the training version (Ku-13, Ki-13, MXY-8 &amp; MXY-9) were produced by Yokosuka, Yokoi and Maeda. Seven of the operational version (J8M1/Ki-200) were built by Mitsubishi.

==Operational history==

On 8 January 1945, one of the two J8M1 prototypes was towed aloft, water ballast added in place of the fuel tank and rocket engine to test its aerodynamics. The test flights confirmed the design. Training courses for JAAF and JNAF pilots began on the Ku-13 glider, which shared a similar configuration to the J8M1. The 312th Naval Air Group was selected to operate the first J8M1. Mitsubishi, Fuji Hikoki, and Nissan Jidosha all had tooling for mass production well into the advanced stages, ready to produce both the J8M1 and the J8M2 variant, which differed from the J8M1 in sacrificing one of the Type 5 cannon for a small increase in fuel capacity. The first J8M1 prototype to be equipped with the Toko Ro.2 (KR10) was ready in June 1945. They were then transferred from the Nagoya plant to Yokoku for final checks before powered flight testing, after final glide tests with the engine installed.

The J8M took to the air for its first powered flight on 7 July 1945, with Lieutenant Commander Toyohiko Inuzuka at the controls; after his &quot;sharp start&quot; rocket-powered takeoff, Inuzuka successfully jettisoned the dolly upon becoming airborne and began to gain speed, climbing skywards at a 45° angle. At an altitude of , the engine stopped abruptly, and the J8M1 stalled. Inuzuka managed to glide the aircraft back but clipped a small building at the edge of the airfield while trying to land, causing the aircraft to burst into flames. Inuzuka died the next day. While Mitsubishi and naval technicians sought to find the cause of the accident, all future flights were grounded. The engine cutout had occurred because the angle of climb, coupled with the fuel tanks being half-filled for this first flight, caused a shifting of the fuel, which in-turn caused an auto cutout device to activate because of an air lock in the fuel line. Requests to continue flight testing were denied pending the modification of the fuel pumps in the aircraft. The sixth and seventh prototypes were to be fitted with the modified Ro.2 engine.

Contractors were already manufacturing components, and almost ready for full-scale production. Despite another explosion of the fuel mixture during a ground test days after Inuzuka&#x27;s crash, flight testing was to resume in late August 1945, and the J8M2 design was finalized. But on 15 August 1945 the war ended for the Japanese, and all work on the J8M ceased. The end of the war also spelled the end of the JAAF&#x27;s Ki-202 &quot;Shūsui-Kai&quot; (Modified &quot;Shusui&quot;), whose design had begun in secret months before. The Ki-202 was to offer improved flight endurance over the Ki-200 and was slated to be the priority fighter for the JAAF in 1946, but no metal was cut before Japan&#x27;s surrender.

As with many other Japanese fighter types combating air raids over Japan, the Ki-200 was considered for use in ramming attacks against B-29s. The envisioned mission profile was to make one or two firing passes and then, with the remaining energy, conduct a ramming attack. Any fuel left on board would most likely detonate, increasing the effectiveness of the attack but also meaning the pilot had little chance of survival. Nevertheless, the cost was deemed to be worth it, and plans were being drawn up to form a &quot;Hagakure-Tai&quot; (Special Attack Unit), similar to the German Sonderkommando Elbe, when the war ended.

==Survivors==
In November 1945, two aircraft were taken from Yokosuka to the United States for evaluation aboard USS &quot;Barnes&quot;. FE-300/T2-300 (USA ident) (Japanese ident 403) is now exhibited at the Planes of Fame Museum in Chino, California.

The other was at NAS Glenview in October 1946 (identity unknown), but was scrapped.

In the 1960s, a nearly complete (but badly damaged) fuselage was discovered in a cave in Japan. This was on display at a Japanese Air Self Defense Force base near Gifu until 1999, when it was restored and completed by Mitsubishi for display in the company&#x27;s internal Komaki Plant Museum.

<doc id="460025" wikidata="Q2744331" url="?curid=460025" title="Langeleik">
<text>The langeleik, also called langleik, is a Norwegian stringed folklore musical instrument, a droned zither.

==Description==
The langeleik has only one melody string and up to 8 drone strings. Under the melody string there are seven frets per octave, forming a diatonic major scale. The drone strings are tuned to a triad. The langeleik is tuned to about an A, though on score the C major key is used, as if the instrument were tuned in C. This is for simplification of both writing and reading, by circumventing the use of accidentals.

Since the instrument can not play a chromatic scale, nor be easily tuned to other pitches, it is very limited in its ability to play along with other instruments and/or more harmonically complex music.

The combination of the lone melody string and the multiple drone strings gives the langeleik a distinctively rich sound.

==History==
There exists a variety of box zithers in Europe. The German &quot;scheitholt&quot; and the Swedish Hummel have been suggested as the predecessor of the langeleik. However, in 1980 a langeleik dated as early as 1524 was uncovered on a farm in Vibergsroa, Gjøvik, Norway. This instrument predates any documented occurrences of the scheitholt, the hummel or any other similar instrument.

The older Langeleik types were tuned after Pythagorean fashion, based on pure fifths and octaves, with variable smaller intervals. Thus, the pitches could easily be moved between more sombre &quot;low&quot; intervals and the more bright major ones. The fixed Langeleik with a recognizable major scale is dated to after 1850. After this change in tonation, many players had to change their melodies, or find new ones, as the older repertoire no longer fitted into the new system.

==Types of langeleik==
Early langeleiks are basically rectangular in shape, and often have an open bottom. They usually have five or six strings. They often had unique traditional scales other than the modern major scale (using 3/4 tones, etc.). Especially the third and seventh tend to be different; the third is often neutral (between a major and minor third) and the seventh tends to be lower than the modern leading tone.

Modern langeleiks are somewhat curved, being wider at the middle, as it is the experience of modern instrument makers that this makes the instrument sound louder. They are all tuned to a major scale.

==Playing==
The right hand holds a long plectrum, and with this plectrum it strikes the beat, the basic rhythm.

The left hand utilizes only its index, middle and ring finger.

When a desired melody note is to be executed on the basic beat, the left hand only need to hold down the melody string, and the right hand will strike it with the plectrum.

When a note is wanted in between the basic rhythm, the index or middle finger needs to hammer-on or pull-off the melody string.

==Tradition==
Norway has several areas of culture, amplified due to its many mountains, valleys and fjords; some areas have their own versions of springdans. (See Polska)

Valdres and Vardal are the only areas where the langeleik has a living (and thus more developed) tradition, with more melodies available, especially of the more recent, more complex kind, made for arguably better instruments. The picture above is of a Valdres langeleik. It is also home of the valdres springar dance.
Telemark is another distinct area of Norway, home of the Telemark springar. The Telemark langeleik is distinct from the Valdres kind in that the sound-box is thin and straight-walled whereas the Valdres-langeleik curves to a broader lower part, and it does not have a board at the bottom and thus is more dependent on a good table for amplification. Also the head looks all different.

The langeleik has had a renaissance, and while there are players in most part of Norway, there are not so many places -at least not well known- where the instrument is being played officially. This is perhaps mostly due to that it is a solo instrument.

Gjøvik Spelemannslag (the folk musician guild of Gjøvik ) has a steady group of langeleik-players which meets every Wednesday. They also build langeleiks and a lot of other kinds of instruments.

==Music==
The types of tunes mostly played on the instrument are reinlender, vals, mazurka, gangar, springar and halling.

See Gammeldans (old dance) and Bygdedans (village dance) for more information.

<doc id="460032" wikidata="Q2740651" url="?curid=460032" title="Round Rock Express">
<text>The Round Rock Express are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers. They are located in Round Rock, Texas, and play their home games at the Dell Diamond. The team is named for Baseball Hall of Famer and Texas native Nolan Ryan, who was nicknamed &quot;The Ryan Express.&quot; Ryan, along with son Reid Ryan and Don Sanders make up the team&#x27;s ownership group, Ryan Sanders Baseball.

The Express were established as a Double-A team of the Texas League (TL) in 2000. They won the Texas League championship in 2000. Round Rock was replaced by a Triple-A Pacific Coast League team in 2005. The Triple-A Express carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. With Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Express were shifted to the Triple-A West, which was renamed the PCL in 2022.

==History==
The ownership group led by Nolan Ryan and Don Sanders began its operations in Round Rock in 2000 as the Dell Diamond opened, moving the Double-A Texas League&#x27;s Jackson Generals to the new park, affiliating with the Houston Astros and setting attendance records for the Double-A level. By 2003, Corpus Christi had offered the Ryan-Sanders group $20 million to build a stadium and move a professional franchise there, and the ownership group was convinced Round Rock could support Triple-A baseball.

Meanwhile, the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Edmonton Trappers franchise, left isolated by the departure of the Calgary Cannons after the 2002 season for Albuquerque, was under pressure from the rest of the league to relocate to the United States. After the 2003 season, the Ryan group purchased the Trappers franchise with plans to relocate that franchise to Round Rock for 2005, once the Corpus Christi stadium would be ready for the Double-A franchise. The Triple-A club would carry on the Round Rock Express identity; the Double-A club would become the Corpus Christi Hooks, and the Ryan group was able to negotiate an affiliation swap with the New Orleans Zephyrs to obtain the Astros&#x27; Triple-A affiliation for the newly-arriving PCL club.

In 2006, the Round Rock Express clinched the Southern Division of the league&#x27;s American Conference with a win–loss record of 85–59. After defeating the Nashville Sounds in five games to take the American Conference championship, they advanced to the PCL championship series, but lost to the Tucson Sidewinders in three straight games.

In 2011, after 6 seasons of serving as the Triple-A affiliate of the Houston Astros, and 11 seasons of being affiliated with the Astros overall, the Express became the Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers. Through the end of the 2018 season, attendance figures have dropped 8% since changing affiliations from Houston to Texas (see table below). Each of the top 9 season attendances all occurred in the 11 seasons the team was affiliated with Houston.

In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed the Express as the sixth-most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $40 million.

On September 20, 2018, the Express announced a 4-year Player Development Contract with the Houston Astros. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors after the 2020 season, the Astros opted to discontinue their affiliation with Round Rock, leaving them in need of a new major league affiliate.

The Express later re-affiliated with the Texas Rangers for 2021 and were organized into the Triple-A West. Round Rock ended the season tied for second place in the Eastern Division with a 61–58 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Round Rock finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record. In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

Playing under a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half qualified for the playoffs, Round Rock won the second-half title at 45–30. Overall, the team posted the league&#x27;s second-best record, 89–60. In a single round of playoffs to determine the PCL championship versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, winners of the first half, the Express were defeated, two games to none.

The &quot;Play Ball&quot; episode of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, a reality television series starring young wealthy socialites Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, took place during an Express game. The show aired on July 21, 2004, as the 15th episode of the show&#x27;s second season.

The team made headlines in 2010 when it &quot;signed&quot; Billy Ray &quot;Rojo&quot; Johnson, described in a press release as an East Texan who grew up in Venezuela and had run-ins with the law. In reality, Johnson was actor Will Ferrell, who briefly took the mound at Dell Diamond to promote his nearby charity golf tournament.

<text>The Finsteraarhorn () is a mountain lying on the border between the cantons of Bern and Valais. It is the highest mountain of the Bernese Alps and the most prominent peak of Switzerland. The Finsteraarhorn is the ninth-highest mountain and third-most prominent peak in the Alps. In 2001 the whole massif and surrounding glaciers were designated as part of the Jungfrau-Aletsch World Heritage Site.

== Geography ==
Despite being the most elevated, prominent and isolated mountain of both the Bernese Alps and the canton of Bern, the Finsteraarhorn is less known and frequented than the nearby Jungfrau and Eiger. This is due to its location in one of the most remote areas in the Alps, completely surrounded by un-inhabited glacial valleys.

To its west lies the Fiescher Glacier, the second longest in the Alps, and to the east lie the Great Aar Glaciers. The smaller Lower Grindelwald Glacier lies north of the massif. The Finsteraarhorn is surrounded by the summits of the Schreckhorn and Lauteraarhorn to the north, the Gross Fiescherhorn, Grünhorn and Gross Wannenhorn to the west and the Oberaarhorn to the east.

The summit lies on the border between the cantons of Valais and Bern. Politically, it is split between the municipalities of Fieschertal (Valais) and Guttannen (Bern). The Valais–Bern border is also the watershed between the Rhône (Mediterranean Sea) and Rhine (North Sea) rivers. The Finsteraarhorn is the culminating point of the Rhine drainage basin.

The Finsteraarhorn was dethroned by Monte Rosa as the highest summit of Switzerland when Valais joined the Swiss Confederation in 1815.

== Geology ==

The Finsteraarhorn is the culminating point of the Aarmassif, a geologic crystalline massif which crops out in the eastern Bernese Alps and Urner Alps. The massif belongs to the Helvetic zone and consists of rocks from the European continent, mainly granites and gneisses. The summit itself is composed of amphibolites.

The tectonic uplift of the massif occurred late in the alpine orogeny, during the Oligocene, 30 to 40 million years ago. The inelastic deformation of rocks led to many fractures and formation of hydrothermal crystals by the deposition of the saturated water flowing inside.

== Climbing history ==

===Controversial first ascent===
The first ascent was long a controversial matter. The first attempt was made on 16 August 1812 by the Aargau merchant , guided by the locals Kaspar Huber, Arnold Abbühl, Joseph Bortes and Aloys Volker. Bortes and Volker, guiding and uncle, had been the first to climb the Jungfrau the previous year. They approached the mountain via the Oberaarjoch, Studer glacier, and south-east ridge, which is a more difficult and longer route than the current normal route over the north-west ridge. Meyer became exhausted and remained behind after reaching the ridge, perhaps near P. 3883 (&quot;Meyer&#x27;s Peak&quot;). Huber kept him company, while the three other guides went on and purportedly reached the summit after three hours.

On 19 August 1828, Franz Joseph Hugi, a geologist from Solothurn, made another attempt with seven local climbers. Among these was Arnold Abbühl, who told Hugi about his ascent 16 years earlier, but Hugi scoffingly dismissed his account, partly because Abbühl misidentified the peak in the beginning of their approach. The group reached a ca. saddle (the &quot;Hugisattel&quot;) on the north-west ridge, but had to retreat because of bad weather after Hugi and one of the guides (Arnold Dändler) nearly had fallen off the ridge.

The next year Hugi organized another expedition via the same route. While an attempt on the 3rd of August faltered, on 10 August 1829 two of his guides, Jakob Leuthold and Johann Währen were able to reach the summit, where they spent three hours building a 7-foot pyramid to anchor a flagpole. Hugi stayed behind somewhat above the saddle not daring to cross a steep slope, partly because he had twisted an ankle four weeks earlier. On the way back Hugi&#x27;s ankle played up and Leuthold, Währen and Joseph Zemt took turns carrying him down the glacier. Hugi&#x27;s account makes no mention of evidence of an earlier ascent.

In articles of 1881 and 1908, the mountaineers and leading historians of Alpine exploration Gottlieb Studer and W.A.B. Coolidge, respectively, declared to be convinced that the Meyer expedition had been successful. However, John Percy Farrar concluded in 1913 in an article in the &quot;Alpine Journal&quot; that the guides in 1812 must have reached the 4,167 m high shoulder 200 m south of the true summit, which he considered nevertheless a feat half a century ahead of its time.

=== Other ascents ===

The fifth ascent took place on August 13, 1857. It was the first British ascent, made by John Frederick Hardy, William Mathews, Benjamin St John Attwood-Mathews, John Clough Williams-Ellis and Edward Shirley Kennedy, accompanied by the guides Auguste Simond and Jean Baptiste Croz from Chamonix, Johann Jaun the Elder from Meiringen, Aloys Bortis from Fiesch and the porter Alexander Guntern from Biel in Goms. They left Konkordiaplatz at 2:30 pm, reaching the summit at exactly 11:53 pm. Before ascending the mountain, Mathews already mentioned his idea of a club for alpinists. On the summit of the Finsteraarhorn the climbers decided to found such an association, which would be named the Alpine Club.

The most difficult route to the summit, the north-east face, was opened on 16 July 1904 by G. Hasler and his guide F. Amatter. The ascent marked the beginning of the épopée of the great north faces in the Bernese Alps. In fact the north-east face of the Finsteraarhorn was climbed only 11 times between 1904 and 1977. A third ascent was made on 3 September 1930 by Miriam O&#x27;Brien Underhill with guides A. and F. Rubi. She relates this dangerous ascent in her book &quot;Give Me the Hills&quot;.

== Climbing routes ==
The normal route starts at the Finsteraarhorn Hut (3,046 m) and goes over the south-west flank of the mountain up to the Hugisattel, then follows the north-west rocky ridge to the summit.

<text>The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences (AIAS) is a non-profit organization of video game industry professionals. It organizes the annual Design Innovate Communicate Entertain Summit, better known as D.I.C.E., which includes the presentations of the D.I.C.E. Awards.

== History ==
Andrew S. Zucker, an attorney in the entertainment industry, founded the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in 1991 and served as its first president. AIAS co-promoted numerous events with organizations such as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the Directors Guild of America, and Women in Film. Their first awards show program, &quot;Cybermania &#x27;94&quot;, which was hosted by Leslie Nielsen and Jonathan Taylor Thomas, was broadcast on TBS in 1994. While a second show was run in 1995 and was the first awards program to be streamed over the Web, it drew far fewer audiences than the first.

Video game industry leaders decided that they wanted to reform AIAS as a non-profit organization for the video game industry. The effort was backed by Peter Main of Nintendo, Tom Kalinske of Sega, and Doug Lowenstein, founder of the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), and with funding support from ESA. The AIAS was formally reestablished on November 19, 1996, with Marc Teren as president, soon replaced by game developer Glenn Entis. Initially, in 1998, AIAS&#x27; role was to handle the awards, originally known as the Interactive Achievement Awards. These awards were nominated and selected by game developers that are members of the organization themselves, mimicking how the Academy Awards are voted for by its members.

Around 2000, the ESA pulled out of funding AIAS, leading AIAS members Richard Hilleman and Lorne Lanning to suggest that AIAS create the D.I.C.E. Summit (short for &quot;Design Innovate Communicate Entertain&quot;), a convention centered around the presentation of the awards to providing funding for the organization. The Summit was aimed at industry executives and lead as a means to provide networking between various companies. The D.I.C.E. Summit launched in 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada and has been run on an annual basis since. In addition to video games, AIAS saw these summits as a way to connect video games to other entertainment industries.

Joseph Olin served as the AIAS president from 2004 to 2010; following his departure, Martin Rae was named president in 2012. Rae opted to implement a number of changes to the Summit, shorting talk times to give more attention to the speakers, and rebranding the awards as the D.I.C.E. Awards for the 2013 summit. Mike Fischer replaced Rae as president in 2016.

 AIAS&#x27;s mission is &quot;to promote and advance the worldwide interactive entertainment community, recognize outstanding achievements in the interactive arts and sciences, and host an annual awards show, the DICE Awards, to enhance awareness of games as an interactive art form&quot;.

== D.I.C.E. Summit ==
The D.I.C.E. Summit is an annual multi-day gathering of video game executives held in Las Vegas. Established in 2002 by AIAS, the conference is host to the annual Interactive Achievement Awards, which has since been rebranded as the D.I.C.E. Awards. The conference differs from other conferences in the industry in its emphasis on the business and production end of the industry, with a focus on trends and innovations in video game design. The conference specializes in providing a more intimate, orderly venue for select industry leaders to network.

=== Structure ===
In 2007, a keynote speaker was added to open the event, which had traditionally begun with recreation before the introduction of presentations and panels.

<text>The term inner city (also called the hood) has been used, especially in the United States, as a euphemism for majority-minority lower-income residential districts that often refer to rundown neighborhoods, in a downtown or city centre area. Sociologists sometimes turn the euphemism into a formal designation by applying the term inner city to such residential areas, rather than to more geographically central commercial districts, often referred to by terms like downtown or city centre.

==History==
The term inner city first achieved consistent usage through the writings of white liberal Protestants in the U.S. after World War II, contrasting with the growing affluent suburbs. According to urban historian Bench Ansfield, the term signified both a bounded geographic construct and a set of cultural pathologies inscribed onto urban black communities. Inner city originated as a term of containment. Its genesis was the product of an era when a largely white suburban mainline Protestantism was negotiating its relationship to American cities. Liberal Protestants&#x27; missionary brand of urban renewal refocused attention away from the blight and structural obsolescence thought to be responsible for urban decay, and instead brought into focus the cultural pathologies they mapped onto black neighborhoods. The term inner city arose in this racial liberal context, providing a rhetorical and ideological tool for articulating the role of the church in the nationwide project of urban renewal. Thus, even as it arose in contexts aiming to entice mainline Protestantism back into the cities it had fled, the term accrued its meaning by generating symbolic and geographic distance between white liberal churches and the black communities they sought to help.

==Urban renewal==
Urban renewal (also called urban regeneration in the United Kingdom and urban redevelopment in the United States) is a program of land redevelopment often used to address urban decay in cities. Urban renewal is the clearing out of blighted areas in inner cities to create opportunities for higher class housing, businesses, and more.

In Canada, in the 1970s, the government introduced Neighbourhood Improvement Programs to deal with urban decay, especially in inner cities. Also, some inner-city areas in various places have undergone the socioeconomic process of gentrification, especially since the 1990s.

<doc id="460052" wikidata="Q221586" url="?curid=460052" title="Mystic River (film)">
<text>Mystic River is a 2003 American neo-noir mystery drama film, directed and co-produced by Clint Eastwood, and starring Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney. The screenplay, written by Brian Helgeland, was based on the 2001 novel by Dennis Lehane. It is the first film in which Eastwood was credited as composer of the score.

The film was a critical and commercial success. &quot;Mystic River&quot; was nominated for six awards at the 76th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Actor for Penn, and Best Supporting Actor for Robbins.

==Plot==
In 1975, Irish-American neighborhood friends Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are playing street hockey in Charlestown, Boston. After writing their names in a patch of wet concrete on the sidewalk, two men posing as police officers abduct Dave and sexually abuse him for four days until he escapes.

Twenty-five years later, Jimmy is an ex-convict and neighborhood convenience store owner; Sean is a detective with the Massachusetts State Police whose pregnant wife Lauren recently left, and Dave is a blue-collar worker continually haunted by the abduction and rape he suffered. Jimmy and Dave are connected by marriage: Dave&#x27;s wife Celeste and Jimmy&#x27;s second wife Annabeth are cousins. 
Jimmy&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage, Katie, plans to run away to Las Vegas with Brendan Harris, a boy from a family Jimmy despises that she has been secretly dating. One night, Dave sees Katie and her friends at a local bar. That same night, she is murdered, and Dave comes home bloodied and injured. He tells his wife that he fought off a mugger and possibly killed him. Sean and his partner Whitey Powers investigate the murder while Jimmy, distraught at Katie&#x27;s death, conducts a separate investigation using his neighborhood connections.

A witness statement suggests that Katie may have known her killer. The detectives learn that the gun used to kill her, a .38 Special revolver, was also used in a liquor store robbery in 1984 by &quot;Just Ray&quot; Harris, the father of Brendan. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan claims he still sends his family $500 monthly. Brendan feigns ignorance about Ray&#x27;s gun. Whitey suspects Dave, who keeps changing the story about how his hand got injured. Dave continues to behave erratically, which upsets Celeste to the point that she leaves their home and tells Jimmy she suspects Dave is Katie&#x27;s murderer.

Jimmy and his friends invite Dave to a local bar, get him drunk and confront him when he is about to vomit. Jimmy admits to Dave that he killed &quot;Just Ray&quot; for implicating him in the liquor store robbery, which resulted in his imprisonment. Dave reveals to Jimmy that he did kill someone that night, but it was not Katie. He beat to death a child molester whom he found with a child prostitute. Jimmy does not believe Dave and pulls out a knife. He promises to let Dave live if he confesses to Katie&#x27;s murder. However, when Dave does so, Jimmy kills him and disposes of his body in the adjacent Mystic River.

Meanwhile, after finding his father&#x27;s gun missing, Brendan confronts his mute younger brother &quot;Silent Ray&quot; and his friend John O&#x27;Shea about Katie&#x27;s murder. He beats the two boys, trying to get them to admit their guilt, and then John pulls out Ray&#x27;s gun and is about to shoot Brendan. Sean and Whitey, having connected the teens to the murder, arrive in time to disarm and arrest John and Ray.

The next morning, Sean tells Jimmy that John and &quot;Silent Ray&quot; confessed to killing Katie as part of a prank gone wrong. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, who is wanted for questioning in the murder of a known child molester. Jimmy does not answer, instead thanking Sean for finding Katie&#x27;s killers, but remarks, &quot;if only you&#x27;d been a little faster.&quot; Sean then asks Jimmy if he intends to send Celeste a monthly $500.

Sean reunites with Lauren after apologizing for pushing her away, while Jimmy confesses what he&#x27;s done to Annabeth. She tells him he is &quot;a king, and a king knows what to do and does it. Even when it&#x27;s hard.&quot; Annabeth also mocks Celeste for speaking ill of her own husband Dave. During a local parade, Dave&#x27;s son Michael waits for his father. Sean sees Jimmy and mimics a gunshot at him with his hand, implying he is going to make Jimmy pay, whereas Jimmy spreads his arms in a “what did I do / do your best” gesture.

==Cast==
==Production==
Michael Keaton was originally cast in the role of Det. Sean Devine, and did several script readings with the cast, as well as his own research into the practices of the Massachusetts Police Department. However, creative differences between Keaton and Clint Eastwood led to Keaton leaving the production. He was replaced by Kevin Bacon.

Principal photography took place on location in Boston.

==Reception ==

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Mystic River&quot; has an approval rating of 89% based on 204 reviews, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Anchored by the exceptional acting of its strong cast, &quot;Mystic River&quot; is a somber drama that unfolds in layers and conveys the tragedy of its story with visceral power.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100, based on reviews from 42 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;Clint Eastwood pours everything he knows about directing into &quot;Mystic River&quot;. His film sneaks up, messes with your head, and then floors you. You can&#x27;t shake it. It&#x27;s that haunting, that hypnotic.&quot;

On September 8, 2003, David Edelstein wrote a long article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; with the headline: &quot;Dirty Harry Wants to Say He&#x27;s Sorry (Again).&quot; The piece examines &quot;Mystic River&quot; in the context of Eastwood&#x27;s entire oeuvre, praising his “evolution [into] cinema&#x27;s […] sorrowful conscience”.

Reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot; on October 3, 2003, A.O. Scott wrote a long review of this &quot;mighty&quot; work, at one point observing: &quot;Dave&#x27;s abduction is an act of inexplicable, almost metaphysical evil, and this story of guilt, grief and vengeance grows out of it like a mass of dark weeds. At its starkest, the film, like the novel by Dennis Lehane on which it is based, is a parable of incurable trauma, in which violence begets more violence and the primal violation of innocence can never be set right. &quot;Mystic River&quot; is the rare American movie that aspires to—and achieves—the full weight and darkness of tragedy.&quot;

On October 12, 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; A. O. Scott wrote a piece headlined &quot;Ms. Macbeth and her cousin: The women of &quot;Mystic River&quot;&quot; which he opened with: &quot;One of the most haunting scenes in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;Mystic River&quot;—a film that consists almost entirely of haunting scenes—comes just before the end. The main dramatic action, we have every reason to suspect, is complete... A long, climactic night of revelation and confrontation is over, and the weary streets of Boston are flooded with hard autumnal light. The break of day brings a new insight, one that has less to do with the facts of the story than with its meaning. All along, &quot;Mystic River&quot; has seemed, most obviously, to be about those three men... But it turns out to be just as much about three (or more) damaged families, about the terror and mystery of marriage and about the fateful actions of two women.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, on June 8, 2004, anticipating the DVD and CD release, Dave Kehr praised the film as &quot;a symphonic study in contrasting voices and values. Long fascinated by music as a subject... Mr. Eastwood here creates a genuinely musical style, using his performers like soloists, from Mr. Robbins&#x27;s moody baritone to Mr. Penn&#x27;s spiky soprano. Their individual arias are incorporated into a magnificent choral piece&quot;.

===Box office===
The film earned $156,822,020 worldwide with $90,135,191 in the United States and $66,686,829 in the international box office, which is significantly higher than its $25–30 million budget.

<doc id="460054" wikidata="Q5566104" url="?curid=460054" title="Glacial geology of the Genesee River">
<text>The Genesee River flows northward from its source in northern Pennsylvania to enter Lake Ontario at Rochester, New York.

The present river valley has been modified extensively from preglacial river valleys. A lobe of the last glacier (Wisconsonian) pushed southward almost to the Pennsylvania line, dramatically reshaping the drainage patterns of central and western New York.

==Middle Genesee==

The first image shows the evidence of the glacial rerouting for the middle section of the Genesee. The original river had two branches. The east branch runs southeast of Mount Morris. It was much larger than the west branch, flowing from near present-day Canisteo, New York to empty into the preglacial Ontario River (now lake) north of Rochester. The headwaters of the east branch were blocked and diverted southward into the present Susquehanna River system by huge glacial terminal moraines just south of Dansville. The entire old valley was buried in that area. This left only the small Canaseraga Creek, to flow in the remnant of the large ancient east branch valley from Dansville to Mount Morris.

The current upper Genesee (above Mount Morris) was only the west branch in preglacial times, a tributary river to the original. This branch, which entered the old valley was also dammed in the Nunda area by moraines. A lake was formed with varve clay sediments visible along the valley sides in many spots, but the lake drained as the river found a way to cut a new valley northeastward from Portageville a little west of the original valley, then drop back into the old valley at Mount Morris. This section of new valley is a spectacular gorge with three scenic waterfalls, that is now the site of Letchworth State Park.

Portions of other preglacial valleys can be seen both east and west of the Genesee, occupied now by lakes. The remnants of these valleys were buried by glacial drift. A drumlin field can be seen just north of Conesus and Hemlock Lakes.

==Lower Genesee==
 
In the lower part of the river, before entering Lake Ontario, the river appears to have been diverted once again from its ancient valley by the glacier. The original valley is thought to be that of Irondequoit Creek and Bay. The second image shows the most likely (buried) westward path originally followed by the river. With this blocked, the river cut a new channel, and created three waterfalls where it crossed limestone escarpments.

<doc id="460056" wikidata="Q851772" url="?curid=460056" title="List of Docklands Light Railway stations">
<text>The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is an automated light metro system that serves the London Docklands area of east and south-east London. First opened on 31 August 1987, the DLR was a key component in the regeneration of large areas of disused industrial land into valuable commercial and residential districts.

The system been extended multiple times, and now reaches north to Stratford, south to Lewisham, west to and in the City of London financial district, and east to Beckton, London City Airport and Woolwich Arsenal.

Stations are in the City of London and the boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich and Lewisham with the majority of the network north of the River Thames. Of the 45 stations, four are underground: Woolwich Arsenal, Island Gardens, Bank and Cutty Sark (for Maritime Greenwich).


== Stations and routes ==
Listed for each station is the branch or branches it is on, the local authority, the London Travelcard zone in which it is located, interchanges with other modes of transport, the opening date and any resiting.

Four stations have direct interchanges with London Underground lines: Bank (Central, Circle, District, Northern and Waterloo &amp; City), Canning Town (Jubilee), West Ham (Hammersmith &amp; City, Jubilee and District lines) and Stratford (Central and Jubilee). There are indirect interchanges at Canary Wharf and Heron Quays (for Jubilee line from Canary Wharf), Bow Church (for District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines from Bow Road) and Tower Gateway (for Circle and District lines from Tower Hill). There are interchanges with Mildmay line at Stratford (direct) and Shadwell (indirect). There are interchanges with National Rail at Greenwich, Lewisham, Limehouse, Woolwich Arsenal, Stratford, West Ham and Stratford International.

==List==

== Planned stations ==
There are currently two planned projects that will add stations to the DLR network - a new station at Thames Wharf and an extension to Thamesmead.
==Safeguarded stations==
As part of the development of the Docklands Light Railway, several sites were safeguarded for future station construction, some of which have been implemented.

Previously safeguarded

Two stations were safeguarded as part of the initial construction of the railway in the 1980s.

* Pudding Mill Lane, located alongside the Great Eastern Main Line between Stratford and Bow Church. The station opened in 1996.
* Langdon Park, located between All Saints and Devons Road. Planned as &quot;Carmen Street&quot;, the station opened in 2007.

No longer proposed

* Thames Wharf, located south of Canning Town, was safeguarded during the construction of the Beckton extension. Given construction of flying junctions for access to the Stratford International and Woolwich Arsenal branches of the DLR, construction of this station is no longer possible. A new safeguarded site for a Thames Wharf station was constructed as part of the London City Airport extension.
* Connaught, located on a straight section of viaduct between Prince Regent and Royal Albert stations, was safeguarded during the construction of the Beckton extension in the 1990s. The site was close to the long closed Connaught Road station. Although a straight section of viaduct remains, the station is not currently proposed, despite recent development in the local area such as ExCeL London and London Regatta Centre.

Currently proposed

* Thames Wharf was safeguarded as part of the London City Airport extension, with a straight section of viaduct. The site is currently being used for Silvertown Tunnel construction. Following completion of the tunnel in 2025, 5,000 new homes and a DLR station will be built.

<doc id="460060" wikidata="Q368920" url="?curid=460060" title="George J. Mitchell">
<text>George John Mitchell Jr. (born August 20, 1933) is an American politician, diplomat, and lawyer. A leading member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States senator from Maine from 1980 to 1995, and as Senate Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995. After retiring from the Senate, Mitchell played a leading role in negotiations for peace in Northern Ireland and the Middle East. He was appointed United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland (1995–2001) by President Clinton and as United States Special Envoy for Middle East Peace (2009–2011) by President Barack Obama.

Mitchell was a primary architect of the 1996 Mitchell Principles and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and was the main investigator in two &quot;Mitchell Reports&quot;: one on the Arab–Israeli conflict (2001); and one on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball (2007).

Mitchell served as chairman of the Walt Disney Company from 2004 until 2007, and later as chairman of the international law firm DLA Piper. He was the Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from 1999 to 2009. Mitchell also has served as a co-chair of the Housing Commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He is one of the few people in modern times to have served in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the federal government.

==Early life==

===Origins===
Mitchell was born in Waterville, Maine. His father, George John Mitchell Sr. (born Joseph Kilroy), was born in Ireland and adopted by a Lebanese American when he was orphaned. Mitchell&#x27;s father was a janitor at Colby College in Waterville, where Mitchell was raised. Mitchell&#x27;s mother, Mary (&quot;née&quot; Saad), was a textile worker who immigrated to the United States in 1920 from Bkassine, Lebanon, at the age of eighteen.

Mitchell was raised a Maronite Catholic and in his childhood served as an altar boy at St. Joseph&#x27;s Maronite Church in Maine. Throughout junior high school and high school, he worked as a janitor. In the family of five children, all three of his brothers were athletes; though a talented student as a child, he found himself overshadowed by his brothers&#x27; athletic achievements.

===Education and military service===
After graduating from high school at the age of sixteen, Mitchell attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he worked several jobs and played on the basketball team. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1954, intending to attend graduate school and then teach, but instead served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956, rising to first lieutenant. In 1961, Mitchell received his Bachelor of Laws from Georgetown University Law Center by attending its part-time program at night. He has since received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Bates College.

==Political career==

===Early legal career===
After having performed well academically at Georgetown, Mitchell served as a trial attorney for the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice in Washington from 1960 to 1962, and then as executive assistant to Senator Edmund S. Muskie from 1962 to 1965, where he first gained interest in the political world. Afterwards, Mitchell practiced law with Jensen &amp; Baird in Portland, Maine, from 1965 to 1977 and was assistant county attorney for Cumberland County, Maine, in 1971.

===From judge to senator===
In 1974 Mitchell won the Democratic nomination for governor of Maine, defeating Joseph E. Brennan. He lost in the general election to independent candidate James B. Longley, but was appointed United States Attorney for Maine by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Mitchell served in that capacity from 1977 to 1979.

Mitchell was nominated by President Carter on July 31, 1979, to the United States District Court for the District of Maine, to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the Senate on October 4, 1979, and received his commission on October 5, 1979. His service terminated on May 16, 1980, due to his resignation.

Mitchell was appointed to the United States Senate in May 1980 by the governor of Maine, Joseph Brennan, when Edmund Muskie resigned to become US Secretary of State.

After serving out the remainder of Muskie&#x27;s term, Mitchell was elected to his first full term in 1982 by 99,937 votes against Congressman David Emery, and rose quickly in the Senate Democratic leadership. He was elected as the chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 1984, helping the Democrats regain control of the Senate in 1986 with a net eight new seats and a 55–45 majority in the Senate. He served as Deputy President pro tempore in the 100th United States Congress, because of the illness of president pro tempore John C. Stennis, and remains the only senator other than Hubert Humphrey to have held that post.

The position of deputy president pro tempore was created specifically to be held by a current senator who is a former president or former vice president of the United States. Humphrey is a former vice president of the United States and Mitchell is the only person to have been deputy president pro tempore who has never held one or both of the two highest offices of the US government.

In 1988 Mitchell was reelected by 348,417 votes, the largest margin of victory in a Senate election that year and the largest majority ever for a senator from Maine.
Mitchell voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Mitchell voted against the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, stating explicitly that he believed Thomas&#x27; nomination constituted a racial quota.

===Senate Majority Leader===
Mitchell served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995. While in this role, Mitchell led the movement to reauthorize the Clean Air Act in 1990 and pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Additionally, under his leadership, the Senate approved the North American Free Trade Agreement and the formation of the World Trade Organization.

In 1994, Mitchell turned down an offer of appointment by President Bill Clinton to the United States Supreme Court, to replace the retiring Harry A. Blackmun so that he could continue helping with efforts in the Senate to pass significant health-care legislation. The seat ultimately went to Stephen Breyer. Nevertheless, Congress was not able to pass any significant health-care legislation at the time, and Mitchell did not run for reelection in 1994.

===Political leanings===
For 1994, Mitchell&#x27;s last year in the Senate, the American Conservative Union gave him a rating of 0.00 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being most conservative. For the same year, the Americans for Democratic Action gave him a score of 90 on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being most liberal.

==After the Senate==
Mitchell has served as a director of companies including Walt Disney Company; FedEx; Xerox; Unilever; Staples, Inc.; Starwood; and the Boston Red Sox baseball team. After leaving the Senate, Mitchell joined the Washington, D.C., law firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand; he later became the firm&#x27;s chairman. He was criticized for lobbying on behalf of the firm&#x27;s Big Tobacco clients. He is also senior counsel to Preti, Flaherty, Beliveau, Pachios, Orlick &amp; Haley in Portland, Maine. He is partner and chairman of the Global Board of DLA Piper, US LLP, a global law firm. Mitchell served as an Advisor of ZeniMax Media Inc. He has also served on the advisory board of The Iris Network, a nonprofit blindness rehabilitation agency in Portland.

In 2007, Mitchell joined fellow former Senate Majority Leaders Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and Tom Daschle to found the Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-profit think tank that works to develop policies suitable for bipartisan support.

===Democratic politics===

Mitchell was reportedly among those considered by Al Gore as a running mate for his 2000 presidential run, but Gore selected Joe Lieberman. Had Mitchell been nominated and had the Democratic ticket won that year, he would have been the first Lebanese American to serve as the vice president of the United States, and only the second vice president from Maine, after Hannibal Hamlin. He also was mentioned in both 2000 and in 2004 as a potential secretary of state for a Democratic administration, due to his role as Senate Leader and the Good Friday agreements.

===Education===
Since 2002, Mitchell has been a senior fellow and senior research scholar at Columbia University&#x27;s Center for International Conflict Resolution, where he works to help end or avert conflicts between nations. He was the chancellor of the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, Northern Ireland, until his resignation in April 2009, and namesake of the George J. Mitchell Scholarship, which sponsors graduate study for twelve Americans each year in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

He is the founder of the Mitchell Institute, in Portland, Maine, whose mission is to increase the likelihood that young people from every community in Maine will aspire to, pursue and achieve a college education. In 2007, he became a visiting Professor in Leeds Metropolitan University&#x27;s School of Applied Global Ethics, and the university is developing a new Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution bearing his name.

===Mitchell Report (Arab–Israeli conflict)===
Mitchell led an American fact-finding commission initiated under President Bill Clinton in 2000 intended to find solutions for solving the situation between Israel and the Palestinians. Mitchell&#x27;s report, published in 2001, stressed the need for Israel to halt the expansion of its settlements in the Palestinian territories and for the Palestinians to prevent violence. Interest in the report was renewed when Mitchell was named Special Envoy for Middle East Peace in 2009.

===United Nations===
Mitchell served as co-chairman (with Newt Gingrich) of the Congressionally mandated Task Force on the United Nations, which released its findings and recommendations on June 15, 2005, after having been formed that January.

===World Justice Project===
George J. Mitchell serves as an Honorary Co-chair for the World Justice Project. The World Justice Project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity.

===Northern Ireland peace process===

Since 1995, Mitchell has been active in the Northern Ireland peace process, having served as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland under President Bill Clinton. He first led an international body to review options for paramilitary arms decommissioning, which produced the Mitchell Principles that regulated access to subsequent all-party peace talks. Mitchell then co-chaired the all-party talks, leading to the Belfast Agreement, signed on Good Friday 1998 (known since as the &quot;Good Friday Agreement&quot;). Mitchell&#x27;s mediation between the parties was crucial to the success of the talks. He was succeeded as special envoy by Richard Haass.

For his leadership in the Northern Ireland peace negotiations, Mitchell was awarded the Liberty Medal (on July 4, 1998) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (on March 17, 1999). In accepting the Liberty Medal, he stated: &quot;I believe there&#x27;s no such thing as a conflict that can&#x27;t be ended. They&#x27;re created and sustained by human beings. They can be ended by human beings. No matter how ancient the conflict, no matter how hateful, no matter how hurtful, peace can prevail.&quot;

===Chairman of Disney===
On March 4, 2004, Disney&#x27;s board of directors, on which Mitchell had served since 1995, named him Michael Eisner&#x27;s replacement as Chairman of the Board after 43% of the company&#x27;s shares were voted against Eisner&#x27;s reelection (35% was the minimum for disposal). Mitchell himself received a 24% negative vote, a fact that led dissident Disney shareholders Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold to criticize the appointment of Mitchell, whom they saw as Eisner&#x27;s puppet.

Having already served on the boards of companies including Xerox, Starwood, FedEx, and Staples, Inc., Mitchell assumed his new role at a particularly tumultuous time in the company&#x27;s history, needing to face such issues as Comcast&#x27;s hostile takeover attempts and a possible split with Pixar. Mitchell played an important role in the selection of Robert A. Iger as Eisner&#x27;s successor as CEO in 2005. On June 28, 2006, Disney announced that its board had elected one of its members, John Pepper Jr., former CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble, to replace Mitchell as chairman effective January 1, 2007.

===Baseball&#x27;s steroids investigation===

In 2006, Mitchell was tapped by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to lead an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Major League Baseball players. The investigation derived largely from charges against Barry Bonds, and revelations in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) trials of Victor Conte and Greg Anderson. Selig has said that revelations brought forth in the 2005 book &quot;Game of Shadows&quot; were, by way of calling attention to the issue, in part responsible for the league&#x27;s decision to commission an independent investigation. To this day Mitchell is known to have held meetings with only two active players, Jason Giambi, who was ordered to meet Mitchell by Commissioner Selig in light of his public admissions on the issue, and one additional player whose name was initially not made public but was later revealed to be Frank Thomas. Mitchell did however hold extensive meetings with several known steroid dealers, club attendants, personal trainers, and others who had ties to all players named in the report. Even though the union that protects the players had pressured all but Giambi and Thomas into maintaining the culture of silence that had helped the drug problem remain a secret, there was plenty of other evidence against those named in his report.

Mitchell released a 409-page report of his findings on December 13, 2007. The report includes the names of 89 former and current players for whom it claims evidence of use of steroids or other prohibited substances exists. This list includes names of Most Valuable Players and All-Stars, such as Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Miguel Tejada, Denny Neagle, Paul Lo Duca, David Justice, Barry Bonds, Éric Gagné, Todd Hundley, Randy Velarde, and Benito Santiago.

Mitchell was criticized for having a conflict of interest with the report as he was a director of the Boston Red Sox, especially because no prime Red Sox players were named in the report, despite the fact that Red Sox stars David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez were later accused of using performance-enhancing substances during the 2003 season, as reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on July 30, 2009. Likewise, the report was commissioned by Selig, and no members of the Milwaukee Brewers, whom Selig once owned, appeared in the report. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Mitchell acknowledged that his &quot;tight relationship with Major League Baseball left him open to criticism&quot;. Mitchell responded to the concerns by stating that readers who examined the report closely &quot;will not find any evidence of bias, of special treatment of the Red Sox&quot;.

===Special Envoy for Middle East Peace===

On January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appointed Mitchell as the administration&#x27;s Special Envoy to the Arab-Israeli peace process, formally known as the &quot;Special Envoy for Middle East Peace&quot;. The appointment was seen as an indication of the new Obama administration&#x27;s increased focus on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The choice of Mitchell allowed Obama to demonstrate the seriousness and sincerity of his intentions regarding the peace process, without forcing him to immediately embark on a specific initiative before conditions were yet ripe. An analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars said Mitchell&#x27;s appointment &quot;says to the world, &#x27;I care about this issue; be patient with me.&#x27;&quot; Abraham Foxman, the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, has stated that, &quot;Sen. Mitchell is fair. He&#x27;s been meticulously even-handed&quot;.

Within the first week of his appointment, Mitchell was dispatched to visit Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia for peace discussions in light of the 2008-09 Gaza War between Israel and the Gaza Strip, in which both sides had recently entered into unilateral ceasefires. Mitchell began his meetings in Cairo on January 27, and Obama said his visit was part of the president&#x27;s campaign promise to listen to both sides of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and negotiate a peace deal. However, in a continuation of a George W. Bush administration policy, Mitchell did not plan to talk to Hamas, a group Israel and the United States consider a terrorist organization, but instead focus on talks with the Palestinian National Authority. Mitchell first met with new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February 2009 and has met with many notable figures of the Middle East since. In 2010, he led the US delegation to the Palestine Investment Conference.

On May 13, 2011, Mitchell tendered his resignation from the post of Special Envoy to the Middle East. Obama praised Mitchell, stating, &quot;His deep commitment to resolving conflict and advancing democracy has contributed immeasurably to the goal of two states [Israel and Palestine] living side by side in peace and security.&quot;

===San Bruno pipeline explosion===
In 2012, Mitchell was asked to lead talks towards determining fines involved in the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion.

===Consultant and advisor===
In June 2014, Mitchell was hired as a senior advisor at the public relations and advisory company Teneo, a firm closely connected to the Clintons. Like Mitchell, who in 1995 had been appointed special envoy to Northern Ireland by President Bill Clinton, Teneo founder and CEO Declan Kelly had been appointed economic envoy to Northern Ireland in September 2009 by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

==Personal life==
Mitchell was married for 26 years until he and his wife Sally divorced in 1987. They are the parents of a daughter, Andrea. In December 1994, he married Heather MacLachlan, 35, a sports management consultant. They have a son, Andrew, and daughter, Claire, named in honor of Claire Bowes (&quot;née&quot; Gallagher) who had so inspired him when she was blinded in the Omagh bombing.

Mitchell was diagnosed with a &quot;small, low grade, and localized&quot; prostate cancer in 2007.

In August 2020, he was diagnosed with acute leukemia, but by April 2023, he described himself as &quot;pain-free and in remission.&quot;

==Epstein scandal==
Virginia Giuffre, a woman who has long claimed that disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with powerful men, named Mitchell in documents unsealed on August 9, 2019 (a day before Epstein&#x27;s death), by a Federal court in the Southern District of New York. The papers included affidavits and depositions of key witnesses in a 2015 lawsuit that Giuffre filed against Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre accused the two individuals of sex-trafficking her to high-profile individuals, including Mitchell, in the early 2000s while she was underage. Mitchell denied ever having met or spoken with Giuffre, and stated that he became aware of Epstein&#x27;s criminal prosecution only through the media.

On November 30, 2021, Epstein&#x27;s former pilot Larry Visoski named Mitchell as one of the people he recalled flying on one of Epstein&#x27;s private planes, but claimed to have never seen sexual activity nor indication that such activity had taken place.

==Awards and honors==
In 1994, Mitchell received the US Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award distributed annually by Jefferson Awards.

In recognition for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, Mitchell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Liberty Medal, and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998. In addition, in 1999 Mitchell was invested as an Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

In 2002, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2003, he received the Freedom Medal.

On January 28, 2014, a portrait of Mitchell was unveiled for display at the Maine State Capitol alongside those of other notable Mainers.

On April 10, 2018, Mitchell was awarded Freedom of the City of Belfast, alongside former president Bill Clinton in a ceremony at the Ulster Hall.

<text>The Arroyo Seco Parkway, also known as the Pasadena Freeway, is one of the oldest freeways in the United States. It connects Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river. Mostly opened in 1940, it represents the transitional phase between early parkways and later freeways. It conformed to modern standards when it was built, but is now regarded as a narrow, outdated roadway. A 1953 extension brought the south end to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles and a connection with the rest of the freeway system.

The road remains largely as it was on opening day, though the plants in its median have given way to a steel guard rail, and most recently to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the roadway&#x27;s original name. All of its original bridges remain, including four that predate the parkway itself, built across the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The road has a crash rate roughly twice the rate of other freeways, largely due to an outdated design lacking in acceleration and deceleration lanes.

The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

== Route description ==

The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) begins at the Four Level Interchange, a symmetrical stack interchange on the north side of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes.
As the original freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, one of four bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway&#x27;s construction. A southbound exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the A Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at the first of many folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right-out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the southbound side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with southbound traffic using Shults and Benner Streets to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now A Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, southbound connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway&#x27;s west-side frontage road.
As they enter South Pasadena, northbound motorists can see a &quot;City of South Pasadena&quot; sign constructed, in the late 1930s, of stones from the creek bed embedded in a hillside. This final segment of the Arroyo Seco Parkway heads east in a cut alongside Grevelia Street, with a full diamond at Orange Grove Avenue and a half diamond at Fair Oaks Avenue. In between those two streets it crosses under the A Line for the third and final time. Beyond Fair Oaks Avenue, SR 110 curves north around the east side of Raymond Hill and enters Pasadena, where the final ramp, a southbound exit, connects to State Street for access to Fair Oaks Avenue. The freeway, and state maintenance, ends at the intersection with Glenarm Street, but the six- and four-lane Arroyo Parkway, now maintained by the city of Pasadena, continues north as a surface road to Colorado Boulevard (historic U.S. Route 66) and beyond to Holly Street near the Memorial Park A Line station.

== Route usage ==

According to CalTrans in 2016, the average annual daily traffic (AADT) on the Arroyo Seco Parkway was 78,000 car trips at Orange Grove Blvd, 100,000 car trips at Ave 64, and 123,000 car trips at Ave 43.

== History ==

=== Planning ===
The Arroyo Seco (Spanish: &quot;dry gulch, or streambed&quot;) is an intermittent stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles. During the dry season, it served as a faster wagon connection between the two cities than the all-weather road on the present Huntington Drive.

The first known survey for a permanent roadway through the Arroyo was made by T. D. Allen of Pasadena in 1895, and in 1897 two more proposals were made, one for a scenic parkway and the other for a commuter cycleway. The latter was partially constructed and opened by Horace Dobbins, who incorporated the California Cycleway Company and bought a six-mile (10 km) right-of-way from downtown Pasadena to Avenue 54 in Highland Park, Los Angeles. Construction began in 1899, and about of the elevated wooden bikeway were opened on January 1, 1900, starting near Pasadena&#x27;s Hotel Green and ending near the Raymond Hotel. The majority of its route is now Edmondson Alley; a toll booth was located near the north end, in the present Central Park. Due to the end of the bicycle craze of the 1890s and the existing Pacific Electric Railway lines connecting Pasadena to Los Angeles, the cycleway did not and was not expected to turn a profit, and never extended beyond the Raymond Hotel into the Arroyo Seco. Sometime before 1910, the structure was dismantled, and the wood sold for lumber, and the Pasadena Rapid Transit Company, a failed venture headed by Dobbins to construct a streetcar line, acquired the right-of-way.

Due to the rise of the automobile, most subsequent plans for the Arroyo Seco included a roadway, though they differed as to the purpose: some, influenced by the City Beautiful movement, concentrated on the park, while others, particularly those backed by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC), had as their primary purpose a fast road connecting the two cities. The first plan that left the Arroyo Seco in South Pasadena to better serve downtown Pasadena was drawn up by Pasadena City Engineer Harvey W. Hincks in 1916 and supported by the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and ACSC. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and Harland Bartholomew&#x27;s 1924 &quot;Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles&quot;, while concentrating on traffic relief, and noting that the Arroyo Seco Parkway would be a major highway, suggested that it be built as a parkway, giving motorists &quot;a great deal of incidental recreation and pleasure&quot;. By the mid-1930s, plans for a primarily recreational parkway had been overshadowed by the need to carry large numbers of commuters.

Debates continued on the exact location of the parkway, in particular whether it would bypass downtown Pasadena. In the late 1920s, Los Angeles acquired properties between San Fernando Road and Pasadena Avenue, and City Engineer Lloyd Aldrich began grading between Avenues 60 and 66 in the early 1930s. By June 1932, residents of Highland Park and Garvanza, who had paid special assessments to finance improvement of the park, became suspicious of what appeared to be a road, then graded along the Arroyo Seco&#x27;s west side between Via Marisol (then Hermon Avenue) and Princess Drive. Merchants on North Figueroa Street (then Pasadena Avenue) also objected, due to the loss of business they would suffer from a bypass. Work stopped while the interested parties could work out the details, although, in late 1932 and early 1933, Aldrich was authorized to grade a cheaper route along the east side between Avenue 35 and Hermon Avenue. To the north, Pasadena and South Pasadena endorsed in 1934 what was essentially Hincks&#x27;s 1916 plan, but lacked the money to build it. A bill was introduced in 1935 to add the route to the state highway system, and after some debate a new Route 205 was created as a swap for the Palmdale-Wrightwood Route 186, as the legislature had just greatly expanded the system in 1933, and the California Highway Commission opposed a further increase.

=== Construction ===
To connect the proposed parkway with downtown Los Angeles, that city improved and extended North Figueroa Street as a four-lane road to the Los Angeles River, allowing drivers to bypass the congested North Broadway Bridge on the existing but underutilized Riverside Drive Bridge. A large part of the project lay within Elysian Park, and four Art Deco tunnels were built through the hills. The first three, between Solano Avenue and the river, opened in late 1931, and the fourth opened in mid-1936, completing the extension of Figueroa Street to Riverside Drive. As with the contemporary Ramona Boulevard east from downtown, grade separations were mostly built only where terrain dictated. For Figueroa Street, this meant that all crossings except College Street (built several years after the extension was completed), where a hill was cut through, were at grade. The Figueroa Street Viaduct, connecting the Riverside Drive intersection with North Figueroa Street (then Dayton Avenue) across the Los Angeles River, opened in mid-1937. Closer to downtown, an interchange was built at Temple Street in 1939.
Although many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city&#x27;s voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco&#x27;s west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago&#x27;s Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses&#x27;s parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, &quot;compressed cloverleafs&quot;, where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two lanes and one shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in white Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 &quot;safety bays&quot; were constructed in 1949 and 1950.) The engineers used a design speed of , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this. (The road is now posted at .) Despite the freeway design, many parkway characteristics were incorporated, such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road.

Prior to parkway construction, nine roads and two rail lines crossed the Arroyo Seco and its valley on bridges, and a number of new bridges were built as part of the project. Only four of the existing bridges were kept, albeit with some changes: the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, the 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge, the 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now part of the A Line (Los Angeles Metro)) near Avenue 64, and the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge. The Avenue 43 Bridge would have been kept had the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 not destroyed it. At Cypress Avenue, abutments and a foundation were built for a roadway, but were not used until the 1960s, when a pedestrian bridge was built as part of the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange project. In South Pasadena, seven streets and the Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroad lines on a double track combined bridge were carried over the parkway to keep the communities on each side connected.
Construction on the Arroyo Seco Parkway, designed under the leadership of District Chief Engineer Spencer V. Cortelyou and Design Engineer A. D. Griffin, began with a groundbreaking ceremony in South Pasadena on March 22, 1938, and generally progressed from Pasadena southwest. The first contract, stretching less than a mile (1.5 km) from Glenarm Street in Pasadena around Raymond Hill to Fair Oaks Avenue in South Pasadena, and including no bridges, was opened to traffic on December 10, 1938. A 3.7-mile (6.0 km) section opened on July 20, 1940, connecting Orange Grove Avenue in South Pasadena with Avenue 40 in Los Angeles. The remainder in Los Angeles, from Avenue 40 southwest to the Figueroa Street Viaduct at Avenue 22, was dedicated on December 30, 1940, with great fanfare, and opened to the public the following day in time for the Tournament of Roses Parade and Rose Bowl on New Year&#x27;s Day. However, the highway through South Pasadena was not completed until January 30, 1941, and landscaping work continued through September. The final cost of $5.75 million, under $1 million per mile, was extremely low for a freeway project because the terrain was favorable for grade separations.
The state began upgrading the four-lane North Figueroa Street extension (then part of Route 165) in October 1940 as a &quot;Southerly Extension&quot; of the parkway, even before the parkway was complete. The at-grade intersection with Riverside Drive was already a point of congestion, and the six lanes of parkway narrowing into four lanes of surface street would cause much greater problems. The two-way Figueroa Street Tunnels and Viaduct were repurposed for four lanes of northbound traffic, and a higher southbound roadway was built to the west. From the split with Hill Street south to near the existing College Street overpass, the four-lane surface road became a six-lane freeway. The extension was designed almost entirely on freeway, rather than parkway, principles, as it had to be built quickly to handle existing traffic. The new road split from the old at the Figueroa Street interchange, just south of Avenue 26, and crossed the Los Angeles River and the northbound access to Riverside Drive on a new three-lane bridge. Through Elysian Park, a five-lane open cut was excavated west of the existing northbound tunnel lanes, saving about $1 million. The extension, still feeding into surface streets just south of College Street, was opened to traffic on December 30, 1943, again allowing its use for the New Year&#x27;s Day festivities.
While the Arroyo Seco Parkway was being built and extended, the region&#x27;s freeway system was taking shape. The short city-built Cahuenga Pass Freeway opened on June 15, 1940, over a month before the second piece of the Arroyo Seco Parkway was complete. In the next two decades, the Harbor, Hollywood (Cahuenga Pass), Long Beach (Los Angeles River), San Bernardino (Ramona), and Santa Ana Freeways were partially or fully completed to their eponymous destinations, and others were under construction. The centerpiece of the system was the Four Level Interchange just north of downtown Los Angeles, the first stack interchange in the world. Although it was completed in 1949, the structure was not fully used until September 22, 1953, when the short extension of the Arroyo Seco Parkway to the interchange opened. Though the common name used by the public had become &quot;Arroyo Seco &quot;Freeway&quot;&quot; over the years, it was officially a &quot;Parkway&quot; until November 16, 1954, when the California Highway Commission changed its name to the Pasadena Freeway.

Beginning in June 2010, the state began modifying interchange signs to remove the Pasadena Freeway name and reinstate the Arroyo Seco Parkway name. Signs that indicate route 110 as a &quot;freeway&quot; are being modified to &quot;parkway&quot; or its &quot;Pkwy&quot; abbreviation.

=== Post-construction ===

Despite a quadrupling of traffic volumes, the original roadway north of the Los Angeles River largely remains as it was when it opened in 1940. Trucks and buses were banned in 1943, though the bus restriction has since been dropped; this has kept the freeway in good condition. Except for the Golden State Freeway (I-5) interchange near the river, completed in 1962, the few structural changes to the freeway north of the river include the closure of the original southbound exit to Fair Oaks Avenue after its location on a curve proved dangerous and the replacement of shrubs in the median with a steel and now concrete guard rail. Los Angeles paid for reconstruction of the interchange at Hill Street, south of Elysian Park, in the early 1960s to serve the new Dodger Stadium. An interchange with Amador Street once had both left and right exits and entrances, it now only has a right exit and entrance.

The parkway&#x27;s design is now outdated, and includes tight &quot;right-in/right-out&quot; access with a recommended exit speed of and stop signs on the entrance ramps. There are no acceleration or deceleration lanes, meaning that motorists must attempt to merge immediately into freeway traffic from a complete stop. While the curves are banked for higher speeds, they were designed at half the modern standard. A three-year Caltrans study determined that the parkway has a crash rate that is twice that of comparable highways, with the primary factor being the lack of acceleration and deceleration lanes. &quot;LAist&quot; noted that many motorists find the act of merging onto the parkway to be &quot;terrifying&quot;.

The Arroyo Seco Parkway was the first freeway in the Western United States. It became a new alignment of U.S. Route 66, and the old routing via Figueroa Street and Colorado Boulevard became U.S. Route 66 Alternate. The southern extension over the Los Angeles River to downtown Los Angeles also carried State Route 11 (which remained on the old route when US 66 was moved) and U.S. Routes 6 and 99 (which followed Avenue 26 and San Fernando Road to the northwest). The 1964 renumbering saw US 66 truncated to Pasadena, and SR 11 was moved from Figueroa Street (which became SR 159) to the Pasadena Freeway. Finally, the number was changed to SR 110 in 1981, when SR 11 between San Pedro and the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) became I-110.

Despite its flaws, the Arroyo Seco Parkway remains the most direct car route between downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena; the only freeway alternate (which trucks must use) is the Glendale Freeway (SR 2) to the northwest. (LA Metro&#x27;s A Line [formerly the Gold Line] provides light rail service along the former Santa Fe Railway line.) The state legislature designated the original section of the Parkway, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a &quot;California Historic Parkway&quot; (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999, and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Occidental College hosted the &quot;ArroyoFest Freeway Walk and Bike Ride&quot; on Sunday, June 15, 2003, closing the freeway to motor vehicles to &quot;highlight several ongoing or proposed projects within the Arroyo that can improve the quality of life for everyone in the area&quot;. The event was held again twenty years later, in October 2023. Over 50,000 attended the event.

<text>Route 110, consisting of State Route 110 (SR 110) and Interstate 110 (I-110), is a state and auxiliary Interstate Highway in the Los Angeles metropolitan area of the US state of California. The entire route connects San Pedro and the Port of Los Angeles with Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The southern segment from San Pedro to I-10 in downtown Los Angeles is signed as I-110, while the northern segment to Pasadena is signed as SR 110. The entire length of I-110, as well as SR 110 south of the Four Level Interchange with US Route 101 (US 101), is the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 north from US 101 to Pasadena is the historic Arroyo Seco Parkway, the first freeway in the western United States.

==Route description==
Route 110 is defined as follows in the California Streets and Highways Code&#x27;s section 410, subdivision (a):

Route 110 is from Route 47 in San Pedro to Glenarm Street in Pasadena.

Following its renumbering from Route 11, Route 110 was originally defined as &quot;from San Pedro to Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena.&quot; The conventional highway portions of the route were relinquished to the cities of Pasadena and Los Angeles in 2000 and 2009 respectively.

Route 110 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

===Harbor Freeway===
The Harbor Freeway, signed as I-110, begins at Gaffey Street in San Pedro, where it then travels mostly due north to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) at a point south of downtown Los Angeles, where it becomes signed as SR 110. I-110 is primarily within the city limits of Los Angeles, running right along the South Los Angeles region and the Harbor Gateway, a wide north–south corridor that was annexed by the city of Los Angeles specifically to connect San Pedro, Wilmington, and the Port of Los Angeles with the rest the city.

North of I-10, the freeway continues as SR 110 through Downtown Los Angeles to its junction with US 101 at the Four Level Interchange.

The Harbor Freeway, along with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710), are the principal means for freight from the Port of Los Angeles to railyards and warehouses further inland. Its interchange with the Santa Monica Freeway is notoriously busy and congested, and the portions bordering Bunker Hill in northwest Downtown Los Angeles are choked with traffic at peak travel times.

====Landmarks====
Notable landmarks and attractions near the Harbor Freeway include the Los Angeles Harbor College, California State University, Dominguez Hills, Watts Towers, Exposition Park (including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the BMO Stadium and the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art), the University of Southern California, Crypto.com Arena, L.A. Live, Los Angeles Convention Center, the skyline of Downtown Los Angeles; and Chinatown.

The Harbor Freeway is noted for its elaborate high-occupancy toll lane feature, with the HOT lanes elevated above the rest of traffic in many areas, constructed in 1994 by C.C. Myers, Inc. as HOV lanes and converted to HOT lanes in 2012. Of particular note is the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange, which contains the most elaborate network of direct HOV/HOT connectors in Los Angeles County. It includes a seven-story ramp that connects the Century Freeway&#x27;s HOV lanes to the Harbor Freeway&#x27;s northbound HOT lanes and offers splendid views of the entire Los Angeles Basin and the San Gabriel Mountains. The interchange with SR 91 (formally known as the Edmond J. Russ Interchange) is also fairly large.

===Arroyo Seco Parkway===
SR 110 continues north as the Arroyo Seco Parkway from US 101 to Pasadena. From downtown, it passes through Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. Then after crossing the Los Angeles River and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), the parkway runs alongside the Arroyo Seco seasonal river towards Pasadena.

==Harbor Transitway==
The Harbor Transitway is a grade-separated, shared-use express bus and high-occupancy toll (HOT) corridor, running in the median of I-110, between SR 91 (Gardena Freeway) and Adams Boulevard in the south side of Downtown Los Angeles. The southern end of the HOT lanes also includes dedicated ramps connecting to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center.

, the HOT lanes are a 24/7 service. Solo drivers are tolled using a congestion pricing system based on the real-time levels of traffic. Carpools with two or more people and motorcycles are not charged. All tolls are collected using an open road tolling system, and therefore there are no toll booths to receive cash. Each vehicle using the HOT lanes is required to carry a FasTrak &quot;Flex&quot; transponder with its switch set to indicate the number of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants (1, 2, or 3+). Those with clean air vehicles need to apply to get a 15 percent discount. Solo drivers may also use the FasTrak standard tag without the switch. Drivers without any FasTrak tag will be assessed a toll violation regardless of whether they qualified for free.

==History==

In the 1924 Major Street Traffic Plan for Los Angeles, a widening of Figueroa Street to San Pedro as a good road to the Port of Los Angeles was proposed. Progress was slow, and, in 1933, the state legislature added the entire length to the state highway system as Route 165, an unsigned designation. This route not only extended from San Pedro north to Los Angeles, but continued through the city-built Figueroa Street Tunnels and along the northern extension of Figueroa Street to Eagle Rock, and then followed Linda Vista Avenue (via an overlap on Route 161 (SR 134) over the Colorado Street Bridge) to Route 9 (now I-210) at the Devil&#x27;s Gate Reservoir. The entire length of Route 165 became Sign Route 11 in 1934. US Route 6 was also assigned to the portion between SR 1 and Avenue 26 in 1937, and, at about the same time, US 66 was moved from Eagle Rock Boulevard to Figueroa Street, overlapping SR 11 between Sunset Boulevard (US 101) and Colorado Street (SR 134).

The state completed the Arroyo Seco Parkway which had been added to the state highway system in 1935 as Route 205, in early 1941, providing a faster route between SR 11 at Avenue 26 and Pasadena. US 66 was moved to the new route, while SR 11 remained on Figueroa Street and Linda Vista Avenue, the former also becoming a new US Route 66 Alternate. Construction of a freeway to San Pedro was much slower, despite having been in the earliest plans for an integrated system. Initially, the Harbor Parkway was to split at the merge with the Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, with the East By-Pass and West By-Pass straddling the Los Angeles Central Business District and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. The West By-Pass was soon incorporated into the Harbor Parkway, and the first short piece, by then renamed the Harbor Freeway, opened on July 30, 1952, from the Four Level Interchange south to 3rd Street. (The Arroyo Seco Parkway was completed to the Four Level Interchange on September 22, 1953, and renamed the Pasadena Freeway on November 16, 1954.)

The Harbor Freeway gradually pushed south, opening to Olympic Boulevard on March 23, 1954, and Washington Boulevard on May 14, 1954. On March 27, 1956, the highway was extended to 42nd Street, and on April 24, 1957, it reached temporary ramps at 88th Place. Further extensions were made to Century Boulevard on July 31, 1958, 124th Street on September 24, 1958, Alondra Boulevard (which the county widened to carry the load) on May 2, 1960, 190th Street on July 15, 1960, Torrance Boulevard on August 28, 1962, and finally Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) on September 26, 1962. There it connected with a section that had been open since June 19, 1956, from Pacific Coast Highway south to Channel Street. Along with the Vincent Thomas Bridge to Terminal Island, the final piece in San Pedro opened on July 9, 1970, completing the Harbor Freeway to its present length.

In December 1978, the Harbor Freeway was approved as an Interstate Highway by the FHWA. In 1981, the SR 11 designation was renumbered as I-110 on the Harbor Freeway, and SR 110 on the Pasadena Freeway. The I-110 designation had been previously applied to what is now a spur of I-10 from 1958 to 1968.

===Richard Ankrom signage===
In 2001, Richard Ankrom, a local artist who got lost trying to get onto I-5 North from northbound SR 110 because there was no clear official signage labeling access to I-5 North, solved his frustration by covertly modifying one of the overhead signs on the freeway just before the Four Level Interchange (). Using official government sign specifications, Ankrom fabricated two sign pieces, one being an I-5 marker shield and the other with the word &quot;NORTH&quot;, and affixed them to the left side of the sign. He performed his modifications in broad daylight, disguised as a Caltrans worker. In that district, Caltrans has three sign crews, each thinking one of the other two crews did the installation. After nine months, at Ankrom&#x27;s request, the &quot;Los Angeles Downtown News&quot; broke the story.

Prior to Ankrom&#x27;s work, the only signage directing motorists to the I-5 North off-ramp came at a quarter-mile (0.4 km) before the exit, thus forcing many to merge across multiple lanes in a very short distance. The signs were inspected by Caltrans to ensure they would not fall off onto the road below. Ankrom was never charged, despite statements from officials that his actions were illegal. Ankrom referred to his sign project as &quot;Guerilla Public Service&quot;.

In 2009, Caltrans replaced all signage along this segment with newer, more reflective versions. These new signs include Ankrom&#x27;s original improvements.

==Preservation==
Despite the increased traffic in Los Angeles, including trucks shipping products from the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, there are no plans to upgrade the rest of I-110 from I-10 to Pasadena to Interstate standards. Instead, Caltrans has pushed for a protected status alternative to preserve the Arroyo Seco Parkway as a historic landmark. The state legislature designated the original section, north of the Figueroa Street Viaduct, as a &quot;California Historic Parkway&quot; (part of the State Scenic Highway System reserved for freeways built before 1945) in 1993; the only other highway so designated is the Cabrillo Freeway (SR 163) in San Diego. The American Society of Civil Engineers named it a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1999, and it became a National Scenic Byway in 2002.

<text>Katherine Wilson Sheppard ( Catherine Wilson Malcolm; 10 March 1848 – 13 July 1934) was the most prominent member of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in New Zealand and the country&#x27;s most famous suffragist. Born in Liverpool, England, she emigrated to New Zealand with her family in 1868. There she became an active member of various religious and social organisations, including the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union New Zealand (WCTU NZ). In 1887 she was appointed the WCTU NZ&#x27;s National Superintendent for Franchise and Legislation, a position she used to advance the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage in New Zealand.

Kate Sheppard promoted women&#x27;s suffrage by organising petitions and public meetings, by writing letters to the press, and by developing contacts with politicians. She was the editor of &quot;The White Ribbon&quot;, the first woman-operated newspaper in New Zealand. Through her skilful writing and persuasive public speaking, she successfully advocated women&#x27;s suffrage. Her pamphlets &quot;Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote&quot; and &quot;Should Women Vote?&quot; contributed to the cause. This work culminated in a petition with 30,000 signatures calling for women&#x27;s suffrage that was presented to parliament, and the successful extension of the franchise to women in 1893. As a result, New Zealand became the first country to establish universal suffrage.

Sheppard was the first president of the National Council of Women of New Zealand, founded in 1896, and helped reform the organisation in 1918. In later life, she travelled to Britain and assisted the suffrage movement there. With failing health, she returned to New Zealand, after which she continued to be involved in writing on women&#x27;s rights, although she became less politically active. She died in 1934, leaving no descendants.

Sheppard is considered an important figure in New Zealand&#x27;s history. A memorial to her exists in Christchurch. Her portrait replaced that of Queen ElizabethII on the front of the New Zealand ten-dollar note in 1991.

==Early life==

Kate Sheppard was born Catherine Wilson Malcolm on 10 March 1848 in Liverpool, England, to Scottish parents Jemima Crawford Souter and Andrew Wilson Malcolm. Her father, born in Scotland in 1819, was described in various documents as either a lawyer, banker, brewer&#x27;s clerk, or legal clerk; he married Souter in the Inner Hebrides on 14 July 1842. Catherine was named after her paternal grandmother, also Catherine Wilson Malcolm, but preferred to spell her name &quot;Katherine&quot; or to abbreviate it to &quot;Kate&quot;. She had an elder sister Marie, born in Scotland, and three younger siblings – Frank, born in Birmingham, and Isabella and Robert, both born in London; evidently, the family moved often during that period. Details of the children&#x27;s education are unknown, though Kate&#x27;s later writings demonstrate extensive knowledge of science and law, indicating a strong education. She was known for her broad knowledge and intellectual ability. Her father loved music and ensured that the family had good musical training.

Kate&#x27;s father died in 1862, while in his early forties, but left his widow with sufficient means to provide for the family. After her father&#x27;s death, Kate lived with her uncle, a minister of the Free Church of Scotland at Nairn; he, more than anyone else, instilled in her the values of Christian socialism. During this time, the rest of the family stayed with relatives in Dublin, where Kate later joined them.

George Beath, the future husband of Kate&#x27;s sister Marie, emigrated to Melbourne in 1863, and later moved to Christchurch. After Marie joined him there, they were married in 1867, and their first child was born the following year. Marie&#x27;s accounts of Christchurch motivated Jemima to move her family to New Zealand, as she was seeking better prospects for her sons&#x27; employment and wanted to see her granddaughter. They sailed on the &quot;Matoaka&quot; from Gravesend on 12 November 1868, arriving in Lyttelton Harbour on 8 February 1869.
In Christchurch, most of the family, including Kate, joined the Trinity Congregational Church. The minister was William Habens, a graduate of the University of London who was also Classics Master at Christchurch High School. Kate became part of Christchurch&#x27;s intellectual and social scenes, and spent time with Marie and George&#x27;s growing family.

Kate married Walter Allen Sheppard, a shop owner, at her mother&#x27;s house on 21 July 1871. Walter had been elected to the Christchurch City Council in 1868, and may have impressed Kate with his knowledge of local matters. They lived on Madras Street, not far from her mother&#x27;s home, and within walking distance of the city centre. The Trinity Congregational Church raised funds for a new building from 1872 to 1874, and Kate was most likely involved in this. She formed a friendship with Alfred Saunders, a politician and prominent temperance activist who may have influenced her ideas on women&#x27;s suffrage. Sheppard and her husband arrived in England in 1877 and spent a year there, then returned to Christchurch. Their only child, Douglas, was born on 8 December 1880.

Sheppard was an active member of various Christian organisations. She taught Sunday school, and in 1884 was elected secretary of the newly formed Trinity Ladies&#x27; Association, a body established to visit parishioners who did not regularly attend church services. The association also helped with fundraising and did jobs for the church such as providing morning tea. Sheppard wrote reports on the work of the association, tried to recruit new members, and worked to retain existing ones. The following year she joined the Riccarton Choral Society. Her solo in a May 1886 concert was praised in the &quot;Lyttelton Times&quot;. She also served on the management committee of the YWCA.

==Women&#x27;s suffrage movement==

===Early engagement===
Kate Sheppard&#x27;s activism and engagement with politics began after listening to or reading about a talk by Mary Leavitt from the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) of the United States. In 1885 Leavitt toured New Zealand speaking not only about the problems caused by alcohol consumption, but also the need for women to have a &quot;voice in public affairs&quot;. She spent two weeks in Christchurch, starting with a public speech at the Theatre Royal on 10 May. Journalists were impressed by the strength of public speaking displayed by a woman, something not witnessed often at that time in New Zealand.

Sheppard became involved in establishing a Christchurch branch of the WCTU NZ prior to the formation of a national organisation. Her initial involvement was in promoting petitions to Parliament to prevent women being employed as barmaids, and to outlaw the sale of alcohol to children. This marked the beginning of her collaborations with Alfred Saunders, who advised her on her negotiations with politicians and who wrote to the premier, Sir Robert Stout, seeking to further her campaign. The barmaid petitions (including some from other parts of the country) were rejected by the Petitions Committee of Parliament later in 1885. Sheppard decided that politicians would continue to ignore petitions from women as long as women could not vote.

In 1879 universal male suffrage had been granted to all men over the age of 21 whether they owned property or not, but women were still excluded as electors. A limited number of voting rights were extended to female voters in the 1870s. Female ratepayers were able to vote in local body elections in 1873, and in 1877 women &quot;householders&quot; were given the right to vote in and stand for education boards.

The New Zealand Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union was formed under the leadership of Anne Ward at a conference in Wellington in February 1886. Sheppard did not attend that conference, but at the second national convention in Christchurch a year later, she arrived ready to present a paper on women&#x27;s suffrage, although there was no opportunity for her to do so. She was first appointed Superintendent for Relative Statistics, owing to her interest in economics. In 1887when more local Franchise departments were established within the WCTU NZshe replaced Mrs. G Clarke as National Superintendent for the Franchise and Legislation.

Much of the support for moderation came from women, and the WCTU NZ believed that women&#x27;s suffrage could advance their aim to prohibit alcohol while promoting child and family welfare. Sheppard soon became prominent in the area of women&#x27;s suffrage, but her interest in the cause went beyond practical considerations regarding temperance. Her views were made well known with her statement that &quot;all that separates, whether of race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome.&quot; Sheppard proved to be a powerful speaker and a skilled organiser, quickly building support for her cause.
The WCTU NZ sent a deputation to Sir Julius Vogel, a member of parliament and former premier, asking him to introduce a suffrage bill to parliament. He did so in 1887, with the Female Suffrage Bill, and Sheppard campaigned for its support. In its third reading, the part dealing with women&#x27;s suffrage was defeated by one vote, and the bill was withdrawn. During the general election campaign later that year Sheppard encouraged WCTU NZ members to ask parliamentary candidates questions about suffrage, but few women did so.

In 1888 Sheppard was President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU NZ, and presented a report to the national convention in Dunedin, where the convention decided that prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage would be the organisation&#x27;s central aims. Sheppard made public speeches on suffrage in Dunedin, Oamaru, and Christchurch, developing a confident speaking style. To reinforce her message, she gave audiences leaflets produced in Britain and the United States. Sheppard then published her own single-sheet pamphlet titled &quot;Ten Reasons Why the Women of New Zealand Should Vote&quot;, which displayed her &quot;dry wit and logical approach&quot;. A copy was sent to every member of the House of Representatives.

===Petitions===
The government introduced an Electoral Bill in 1888 that would continue to exclude women from suffrage, and Sheppard organised a petition requesting that the exclusion be removed. She wrote to, and later met with, Sir John Hall, a well-respected Canterbury member of the House of Representatives, inviting him to present the petition and support her cause. He did so, but no action resulted. Sheppard then produced a second pamphlet, &quot;Should Women Vote?&quot;, which presented statements on suffrage from notable people in New Zealand and overseas. The Electoral Bill was delayed until 1890, when on 5 August, Hall proposed a motion &quot;That in the opinion of the House, the right of voting for members of the House of Representatives should be extended to women.&quot; After vigorous debate, this was passed 37 votes to 11. On 21 August, Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage, but it was defeated by seven votes.

Following the defeat, Hall suggested to Sheppard that a petition to parliament should be the next step. She drew up the wording for the petition, arranged for the forms to be printed, and campaigned hard for its support. During the 1890 election campaign, WCTU members attempted to ask all candidates about their position on women&#x27;s suffrage. The petition contained 10,085 signatures (according to WCTU minutes), and Hall presented it to Parliament in 1891 as a new Electoral Bill went into committee. The petition was supported in Parliament by Hall, Alfred Saunders, and the premier at the time, John Ballance. Hall moved an amendment to the Electoral Bill to give women suffrage; it passed with a majority of 25 votes. An opponent of suffrage, Walter Carncross, then moved an amendment which would also allow women to stand for parliament; this seemed a logical extension of Hall&#x27;s amendment but was actually calculated to cause the bill&#x27;s failure in New Zealand&#x27;s upper house, the New Zealand Legislative Council. The bill indeed failed in the Upper House by two votes.

In 1890, Sheppard was one of the founders of the Christian Ethical Society, a discussion group for both men and women, not limited to the members of a single church. In their first few meetings the topics included selfishness, conjugal relations, and dress reform. The society gave Sheppard more confidence debating her ideas with people from diverse backgrounds. During 1891, Sheppard began editing a page in the &quot;Prohibitionist&quot; on behalf of the WCTU. The &quot;Prohibitionist&quot; was a fortnightly temperance paper with a circulation around New Zealand of over 20,000. Sheppard used the pseudonym &quot;Penelope&quot; in this paper.

Sheppard promised that a second petition would be twice as large and worked through the summer to organise it; it received 20,274 women&#x27;s signatures. Using paid canvassers, the Liberal MP Henry Fish organised two counter petitions, one signed by men and the other by women; they received 5,000 signatures between them. An Electoral Bill in 1892 included provision for women&#x27;s suffrage and again it easily passed in the House of Representatives, but the Upper House requested that women&#x27;s votes be postal rather than by ballot. As the two houses could not agree on this, the bill failed.

A third petition for suffrage, still larger, was organised by Sheppard and presented in 1893. This time 31,872 women signedthe largest petition of any kind presented to Parliament at this point.

===1893 Electoral Bill===
The Electoral Bill of 1893, which granted women full voting rights, successfully passed in the House of Representatives in August. Few MPs were willing to vote against it, fearing that women would vote against them in the general election later that year. Many therefore chose to be absent from the house during votes. Henry Fish attempted to delay the proposed statute by calling for a national referendum, but the bill progressed to the Legislative Council. After several attempts to stymie passage failed, the legislation passed 20 votes to 18 on 8 September. The bill now needed the governor&#x27;s signature, and although Governor David Boyle did not support women&#x27;s suffrage and was slow to sign, he eventually did so on 19 September. Sheppard was widely acknowledged as the leader of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

== 1893 general election and further women&#x27;s advocacy ==
Sheppard had no time to rest, as the was only ten weeks away, and the newspapers were spreading rumours that an early election might be called to reduce the number of women enrolled. Along with the WCTU NZ, she was highly active in encouraging women to register as voters. The main meeting venue in Christchurch was the Tuam Street Hall. One of her largest detractors was the liquor industry, which feared for its continued business. Despite the short notice, 88 percent of women had enrolled to vote by election date (28 November), and nearly 70 percent ended up casting a vote. Although women had gained the vote they were not eligible to stand in parliamentary elections until 1919, and it was not until 1933 that the first woman was elected to parliament.

In around 1892 Sheppard had started bicycling around Christchurchone of the first women in the city to do so. She joined the Atalanta Ladies&#x27; Cycling Club, which existed from 1892 to 1897, and was a founding committee member. The club was the first women&#x27;s cycling club in New Zealand or Australia and attracted controversy as some of its members advocated &quot;rational dress&quot;such as knickerbockers rather than skirts for female cyclists.

In December 1893, Sheppard was elected President of the Christchurch branch of the WCTU NZ. She chaired the first two meetings in 1894, before travelling to England with her husband and son. She was in great demand in England as a speaker to women&#x27;s groups about the struggle for women&#x27;s suffrage in New Zealand. In mid-1895, the WCTU launched a monthly journal, &quot;The White Ribbon&quot;, with Sheppard as the editor, contributing to it from overseas. While in England Sheppard experienced health problems, requiring an operation, possibly a hysterectomy. The family returned to New Zealand at the beginning of 1896. Later that year, Sheppard was reappointed editor of &quot;The White Ribbon&quot;.

==Canterbury Women&#x27;s Institute and the National Council of Women==

The Canterbury Women&#x27;s Institute was formed in September 1892, with Sheppard playing a leading role and taking charge of the economics department. The institute was open to both men and women and worked to reduce inequalities between them. Sheppard believed that enfranchisement was the first step towards achieving other reforms, such as reforming unfair laws on marriage, parenthood, and property, and towards eliminating the uneven treatment of the sexes in morality.

The National Council of Women of New Zealand was established in April 1896 by the Canterbury Women&#x27;s Institute and ten other women&#x27;s groups from throughout New Zealand, and Sheppard was elected president at its founding convention. The council promoted the right of women to stand for Parliament, equal pay and equal opportunities for women, the removal of legal disabilities affecting women, and economic independence for married women.

Sheppard&#x27;s election as president, instead of fellow feminist Lady Anna Stout, had caused a rift. This, along with other disagreements such as whether the council should support New Zealand&#x27;s involvement in the Second Boer War, contributed to the organisation going into recess in 1906.

==Later life==
As editor of &quot;The White Ribbon&quot; and president of the National Council of Women, Sheppard promoted many ideas related to improving the situation and status of women. In particular, she was concerned about establishing legal and economic independence of women from men. She was not only occupied with advancing women&#x27;s rights, but also promoted political reforms such as proportional representation, binding referendums, and a Cabinet elected directly by Parliament.

By 1902, Sheppard&#x27;s marriage appears to have been under strain, and possibly had been for several years. Her husband sold their house and moved to England with their son, who wished to study in London. Sheppard bought new furnishings and appeared to be planning for a new permanent residence in Christchurch, but sold them in 1903, stepped down from her positions at the National Council of Women, and moved to England without any fixed date to return. On the way she briefly stopped in Canada and the United States where she met the American suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. In London, she was active in promoting women&#x27;s suffrage, but her health deteriorated further, forcing her to stop this work.

In November 1904, Sheppard returned to New Zealand with her husband, but he went back to England in March the following year. She moved into the house of her long-time friends William Sidney Lovell-Smith and his wife Jennie Lovell-Smith; their third daughter, Hilda Kate Lovell-Smith, had been given her middle name after Sheppard. She remained relatively inactive in political circles, and stopped giving speeches, but continued to write. She prepared a display on the history of women&#x27;s suffrage for the 1906 Exhibition in Christchurch, and wrote the pamphlet &quot;Woman Suffrage in New Zealand&quot; for the International Women&#x27;s Suffrage Alliance in 1907. The following year she travelled to England for her son&#x27;s wedding, visiting the headquarters of the WCTU in Chicago on the way, and meeting with suffrage groups after arriving in Britain. In 1912 and 1913, she travelled with the Lovell-Smiths through India and Europe. While she did not recover her former energy, her health had stopped declining, and she continued to be effective in influencing the New Zealand women&#x27;s movement. She was the first to sign a petition to the prime minister, Sir Joseph Ward, in 1916, asking him to urge the British government to enfranchise women, and she revitalised the National Council of Women along with a group of other prominent suffragists in 1918. Sheppard was elected president of the National Council that year before stepping down in 1919.

Sheppard&#x27;s husband Walter died in England in 1915. Jennie Lovell-Smith died in 1924, and Sheppard and William Lovell-Smith married in 1925. Lovell-Smith died only four years later, and Sheppard herself died in Christchurch on 13 July 1934 at the age of 86. As her son Douglas had died of pernicious anaemia at the age of 29 in 1910, and her only grandchild, Margaret Isabel Sheppard, had died of tuberculosis at the age of 19 in 1930, Sheppard left no living direct descendants. She was buried at Addington Cemetery, Christchurch, in a grave with her mother and her brother Robert.

==Commemoration==
Sheppard is considered an important figure in New Zealand&#x27;s history. Since 1991 her profile has featured on the New Zealand ten-dollar note. A 2005 television show &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s Top 100 History Makers&quot; ranked Sheppard as the second most influential New Zealander of all time. Similarly, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; selected Sheppard as one of their ten greatest New Zealanders in 2013.

In 1972, Patricia Grimshaw&#x27;s book &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage in New Zealand&quot; identified Sheppard as the leading figure of the suffrage movement. This was the first acclaimed book to do so and its publication marked a growth in recognition of Kate Sheppard&#x27;s life and activism.

In 1993, the centenary of women&#x27;s suffrage in New Zealand, a group of Christchurch women established two memorials to Sheppard: the Kate Sheppard National Memorial, on the banks of the Avon River / Ōtākaro, and the Kate Sheppard Memorial Trust Award, an annual award to women in research. That year a special paeony-style white camellia was created at Camellia Glen Nurseries in Kaupokonui, Taranaki; white camellias were a symbol of the suffragists. It was named after Kate Sheppard and planted extensively throughout New Zealand.

The Fendalton house at 83 Clyde Road, where the Sheppards lived from 1888 to 1902 and now known as the Kate Sheppard House, is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I heritage building, in view of the many events relevant to women&#x27;s suffrage that happened there. It was here that Sheppard pasted together the three main petitions onto sheets of wallpaper. Kate Sheppard House came into government ownership in 2019.

New Zealand playwright Mervyn Thompson wrote the play &quot;O! Temperance!&quot; about Sheppard and the temperance movement. It was first performed in 1972 at Christchurch&#x27;s Court Theatre. In 2016 and 2017, the production &quot;That Bloody Woman&quot;, which re-imagined Kate Sheppard&#x27;s life as a punk rock musical, toured New Zealand.
Kate Sheppard Place, located within Wellington&#x27;s parliament precinct, is named in her honour; it is a short one-way street running from Molesworth Street opposite Parliament House to the intersection of Mulgrave Street and Thorndon Quay. There is a Kate Sheppard Avenue in the Auckland suburb of Northcross. In 2014, eight intersections near Parliament in Wellington were fitted with green pedestrian lights depicting Kate Sheppard.

Several New Zealand schools have houses named after Sheppard. In 2014, Whangārei Girls&#x27; High School renamed a house that was named after Richard Seddon, an opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage, to Sheppard House at the request of a student.

On 8 March 2018, coinciding with International Women&#x27;s Day and in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, New Zealand Football renamed its premier women&#x27;s knockout association football tournament the Kate Sheppard Cup.

<text>Picornaviruses are a group of related nonenveloped RNA viruses which infect vertebrates including fish, mammals, and birds. They are viruses that represent a large family of small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a 30 nm icosahedral capsid. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including the common cold, poliomyelitis, meningitis, hepatitis, and paralysis.

Picornaviruses constitute the family Picornaviridae, order &quot;Picornavirales&quot;, and realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;. There are 158 species in this family, assigned to 68 genera. Notable examples are genera &quot;Enterovirus&quot; (including &quot;Rhinovirus&quot; and &quot;Poliovirus&quot;), &quot;Aphthovirus&quot;, &quot;Cardiovirus&quot;, and &quot;Hepatovirus&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;picornavirus&quot; has a dual etymology. Firstly, the name derives from &quot;picorna&quot;- which is an acronym for &quot;&quot;p&quot;oliovirus, &quot;i&quot;nsensitivity to ether, &quot;c&quot;oxsackievirus, &quot;o&quot;rphan virus, &quot;r&quot;hinovirus, and ribo&quot;n&quot;ucleic &quot;a&quot;cid&quot;. Secondly, the name derives from &quot;pico&quot;-, which designates a very small unit of measurement (equivalent to 10−12), combined with &quot;rna&quot; to describe this group of very small RNA viruses.

== History ==
The first animal virus discovered (1897) was the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). It is the prototypic member of the genus &quot;Aphthovirus&quot; in the &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; family. The plaque assay was developed using poliovirus; the discovery of viral replication in culture was also with poliovirus in 1949. This was the first time that infectious virus had been produced in cultured cells. Polyprotein synthesis, internal ribosome entry sites, and uncapped mRNA were all discovered by studying poliovirus infected cells, and a poliovirus clone was the first infectious DNA clone made of an RNA virus in animals. Along with rhinovirus, poliovirus was the first animal virus to have its structure determined by x-ray crystallography. RNA dependent RNA polymerase was discovered in &quot;Mengovirus&quot;, a genus of picornaviruses.

== Virology ==
=== Structure ===
Picornaviruses are nonenveloped, with an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is an arrangement of 60 protomers in a tightly packed icosahedral structure. Each protomer consists of four polypeptides known as VP (viral protein) 1, 2, 3 and 4. VP2 and VP4 polypeptides originate from one protomer known as VP0 that is cleaved to give the different capsid components. The icosahedral capsid is said to have a triangulation number of 3, this means that in the icosahedral structure each of the 60 triangles that make up the capsid are split into three little triangles with a subunit on the corner.

Many picornaviruses have a deep cleft formed by around each of the 12 vertices of icosahedrons. The outer surface of the capsid is composed of regions of VP1, VP2, and VP3. Around each of the vertices is a canyon lined with the C termini of VP1 and VP3. The interior surface of the capsid is composed of VP4 and the N termini of VP1. J. Esposito and Frederick A. Murphy demonstrates cleft structure referred to as canyons, using X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy.

Depending on the type and degree of dehydration, the viral particle is around 30–32 nm in diameter. The viral genome is around 2500 nm in length, so it is tightly packaged within the capsid along with substances such as sodium ions to balance the negative charges on the RNA caused by the phosphate groups.

===Genome===
Picornaviruses are classed under Baltimore&#x27;s viral classification system as group IV viruses, as they contain a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. Their genome ranges between 6.7 and 10.1 (kilobases) in length. Like most positive-sense RNA genomes, the genetic material alone is infectious; although substantially less virulent than if contained within the viral particle, the RNA can have increased infectivity when transfected into cells. The genome RNA is unusual because it has a protein on the 5&#x27; end that is used as a primer for transcription by RNA polymerase. This primer is called VPg genome, and it ranges between 2 and 3 kb. VPg contain tyrosine residue at the 3&#x27; end. Tyrosine as a –OH source for covalently linked to 5&#x27; end of RNA.

The genome is not segmented and positive-sense (the same sense as mammalian mRNA, being read 5&#x27; to 3&#x27;). Unlike mammalian mRNA, picornaviruses do not have a 5&#x27; cap, but a virally encoded protein known as VPg. However, like mammalian mRNA, the genome does have a poly(A) tail at the 3&#x27; end. An untranslated region (UTR) is found at both ends of the picornavirus genome. The 5&#x27; UTR is usually longer, being around 500–1200 nucleotides (nt) in length, compared to that of the 3&#x27; UTR, which is around 30–650 nt. The 5&#x27; UTR is thought to be important in translation, and the 3&#x27; in negative-strand synthesis; however, the 5&#x27; end may also have a role to play in virulence of the virus. The rest of the genome encodes structural proteins at the 5&#x27; end and nonstructural proteins at the 3&#x27; end in a single polyprotein.

The polyprotein is organised as: L-1ABCD-2ABC-3ABCD with each letter representing a protein, but variations to this layout exist.

The 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D proteins are the capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1, respectively. Virus-coded proteases perform the cleavages, some of which are intramolecular. The polyprotein is first cut to yield P1, P2, and P3. P1 becomes myristylated at the N terminus before being cleaved to VP0, VP3, and VP1, the proteins that will form procapsids; VP0 will later be cleaved to produce VP2 and VP4. Other cleavage products include 3B (VPg), 2C (an ATPase), and 3D (the RNA polymerase).

=== Replication ===

==== RNA elements ====

Genomic RNAs of picornaviruses possess multiple RNA elements, and they are required for both negative- and positive-strand RNA synthesis. The cis-acting replication element (CRE) is required for replication. The stem-loop-structure that contains the CRE is independent of position, but changes with location between virus types when it has been identified. Also, the 3&#x27; end elements of viral RNA are significant and efficient for RNA replication of picornaviruses. The 3&#x27; end of picornavirus contains a poly(A) tract, which is required for infectivity. RNA synthesis, though, is hypothesized to occur in this region. The 3&#x27; end NCR of poliovirus is not necessary for negative-strand synthesis, but is important element for positive–strand synthesis. Additionally, the 5&#x27; end NCR that contains secondary structural elements is required for RNA replication and poliovirus translation initiation. Internal ribosome entry sites are RNA structures that allow cap-independent initiation of translation, and are able to initiate translation in the middle of a messenger RNA.

==== Lifecycle ====

The viral particle binds to cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are characterized for each serotype of picornaviruses. For example, poliovirus receptor is glycoprotein CD155, which is special receptor for human and some other primate species. For this reason, poliovirus could not be made in many laboratories until transgenic mice having a CD155 receptor on their cell surfaces were developed in the 1990s. These animals can be infected and used for studies of replication and pathogenesis. Binding causes a conformational change in the viral capsid proteins, and myristic acid is released. The acid forms a pore in the cell membrane through which RNA is injected.

Once inside the cell, the RNA uncoats and the (+) strand RNA genome is replicated through a double-stranded RNA intermediate that is formed using viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Translation by host-cell ribosomes is not initiated by a 5&#x27; G cap as usual, but rather is initiated by an internal ribosome entry site. The viral life cycle is very rapid, with the whole process of replication being completed on average within 8 hours. As little as 30 minutes after initial infection, though, cell protein synthesis declines to almost zero output – essentially the macromolecular synthesis of cell proteins is shut off. Over the next 1–2 hours, a loss of margination of chromatin and occurs in the nucleus, before the viral proteins start to be synthesized and a vacuole appears in the cytoplasm close to the nucleus that gradually starts to spread as the time after infection reaches around 3 hours. After this time, the cell plasma membrane becomes permeable; at 4–6 hours, the virus particles assemble, and can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm. Around 8 hours, the cell is effectively dead, and lyses to release the viral particles.

Experimental data from single-step growth curve-like experiments have allowed observation of the replication of the picornaviruses in great detail. The whole of replication occurs within the host-cell cytoplasm and infection can even happen in cells that do not contain a nucleus (enucleated) and those treated with actinomycin D (this antibiotic would inhibit viral replication if this occurred in the nucleus.)

Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting, viral initiation, and ribosomal skipping. The virus exits in host cell by lysis, and viroporins. Vertebrates serve as the natural hosts. Transmission routes are fecal-oral, contact, ingestion, and air-borne particles.

==== Viral protein (VPg) ====
Picornaviruses have a viral protein (VPg) covalently linked to 5&#x27; end of their genomes instead of 7-methylguanosine cap like cellular mRNAs. Virus RNA polymerases use VPg as primer. VPg as primer uses both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Picornavirus replication is initiated by the uridylylation of VPg. It is uridylylated at the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. A VPg primer mechanism is used by the picornavirus (entero- aphtho-, and others), additional virus groups (poty-, como-, calici-, and others) and picornavirus-like (coronavirus, notavirus, etc.) supergroup of RNA viruses. The mechanism has been best studied for the enteroviruses (which include many human pathogens, such as poliovirus and coxsackie viruses), as well as for the aphthovirus, an animal pathogen causing foot-and-mouth disease.

In this group, primer-dependent RNA synthesis uses a small 22– to 25-amino acid-long viral protein linked to the VPg to initiate polymerase activity, where the primer is covalently bound to the 5&#x27; end of the RNA template. The uridylylation occurs at a tyrosine residue at the third position of the VPg. A CRE, which is a RNA stem loop structure, serves as a template for the uridylylation of VPg, resulting in the synthesis of VPgpUpUOH. Mutations within the CRE-RNA structure prevent VPg uridylylation, and mutations within the VPg sequence can severely diminish RdRp catalytic activity. While the tyrosine hydroxyl of VPg can prime negative-strand RNA synthesis in a CRE- and VPgpUpUOH-independent manner, CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis is absolutely required for positive-strand RNA synthesis. CRE-dependent VPg uridylylation lowers the Km¬ of UTP required for viral RNA replication and CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis, and is required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis, especially when UTP concentrations are limiting. The VPgpUpUOH primer is transferred to the 3’ end of the RNA template for elongation, which can continue by addition of nucleotide bases by RdRp. Partial crystal structures for VPgs of foot and mouth disease virus and coxsackie virus B3 suggest that there may be two sites on the viral polymerase for the small VPgs of the picornaviruses. NMR solution structures of poliovirus VPg and VPgpU show that uridylylation stabilizes the structure of the VPg, which is otherwise quite flexible in solution. The second site may be used for uridylylation,v after which the VPgpU can initiate RNA synthesis. The VPg primers of caliciviruses, whose structures are only beginning to be revealed, are much larger than those of the picornaviruses. Mechanisms for uridylylation and priming may be quite different in all of these groups.

VPg uridylylation may include the use of precursor proteins, allowing for the determination of a possible mechanism for the location of the diuridylylated, VPg-containing precursor at the 3&#x27; end of positive- or negative-strand RNA for production of full-length RNA. Determinants of VPg uridylylation efficiency suggest formation and/or collapse or release of the uridylylated product as the rate-limiting step &quot;in vitro &quot;depending upon the VPg donor employed. Precursor proteins also have an effect on VPg-CRE specificity and stability. The upper RNA stem loop, to which VPg binds, has a significant impact on both retention, and recruitment, of VPg and Pol. The stem loop of CRE will partially unwind, allowing the precursor components to bind and recruit VPg and Pol4. The CRE loop has a defined consensus sequence to which the initiation components bind, but no consensus sequence exists for the supporting stem, which suggests that only the structural stability of the CRE is important.

====Assembly and organization of the picornavirus VPg ribonucleoprotein complex====
# Two 3CD (VPg complex) molecules bind to CRE with the 3C domains (VPg domain) contacting the upper stem and the 3D domains (VPg domain) contacting the lower stem.
# The 3C dimer opens the RNA stem by forming a more stable interaction with single strands forming the stem.
# 3Dpol is recruited to and retained in this complex by a physical interaction between the back-of-the-thumb subdomain of 3Dpol and a surface of one or both 3C subdomains of 3CD.

VPg may also play an important role in specific recognition of viral genome by movement proteins (MP), which are nonstructural proteins encoded by many, if not all, plant viruses to enable their movement from one infected cell to neighboring cells. MP and VPg interact to provide specificity for the transport of viral RNA from cell to cell. To fulfill energy requirements, MP also interacts with P10, which is a cellular ATPase.

==Diseases==
Picornaviruses cause a range of diseases. Enteroviruses of the picornavirus family infect the enteric tract, which is reflected in their name. Rhinoviruses infect primarily the nose and the throat. Enteroviruses replicate at 37 °C, whereas rhinoviruses grow better at 33 °C, as this is the lower temperature of the nose. Enteroviruses are stable under acidic conditions, thus they are able to survive exposure to gastric acid. In contrast, rhinoviruses are acid-labile (inactivated or destroyed by low pH conditions), so rhinovirus infections are restricted to the nose and throat.

<text>Zouk is a musical movement and dance pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav&#x27; in the early 1980s. It was originally characterized by a fast tempo (120–145 bpm), a percussion-driven rhythm, and a loud horn section. Musicians from Martinique and Guadeloupe eventually added MIDI instrumentation to their compas style, which developed into a genre called zouk-love. Zouk-love is effectively the French Lesser Antilles&#x27; compas, and it gradually became indistinguishable from compas.

==Zouk béton==
The original fast carnival style of zouk, best represented by the band Kassav&#x27;, became known as &quot;zouk béton&quot;, &quot;zouk chiré&quot;, or &quot;zouk hard&quot;. Zouk béton is considered a synthesis of various French Antillean dance music styles of the 20th century, including kadans, konpa, and biguine.

<text>Myoga, myoga ginger or Japanese ginger () is the species Zingiber mioga in the family Zingiberaceae. It is a deciduous herbaceous perennial native to Japan, China, and the southern part of Korea. Only its edible flower buds and flavorful shoots are used in cooking. The flower buds are finely shredded and used in Japanese cuisine as a garnish for &quot;miso&quot; soup, &quot;sunomono&quot;, and dishes such as roasted eggplant. In Korean cuisine, the flower buds are skewered alternately with pieces of meat and then are pan-fried.

==Cultivation==
A traditional crop in Japan, myoga ginger has been introduced to cultivation in Australia and New Zealand for export to the Japanese market.

As a woodland plant, myoga has specific shade requirements for its growth. It is frost-tolerant to , and possibly colder.

Three variegated cultivars are known: &#x27;Dancing Crane&#x27;, &#x27;Silver Arrow&#x27; and &#x27;White Feather&#x27;. They are less cold-hardy than unvariegated plants.

== Medicinal properties ==
Myoga has shown promise for potentially anticarcinogenic properties.

<doc id="460086" wikidata="Q1911079" url="?curid=460086" title="Foot-and-mouth disease virus">
<text>Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a virus in the genus &quot;Aphthovirus&quot; that causes foot-and-mouth disease. As a member of the family Picornaviridae, FMDV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Like other members of the Picornavirus family, FMDV is small and unenveloped, with an icosahedral capsid. 

The virus causes foot-and-mouth disease, a highly contagious disease affecting cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and other cloven-hoofed animals. Foot-and-mouth disease causes fever and the formation of vesicles (blisters) in infected animals, which form in the mouth and on the feet and teats. While the disease is usually nonfatal to adult livestock, survivors are left in a weakened state which impacts both meat and milk production, making outbreaks very costly and disruptive to agricultural production overall. 

== Structure and genome ==

The virus particle (25-30 nm) has an icosahedral capsid made of protein, without envelope, containing a positive-sense (mRNA sense) single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome.

== Replication ==

When the virus comes in contact with the membrane of a host cell, it binds to a receptor site and triggers a folding-in of the membrane. Once the virus is inside the host cell, the capsid dissolves, and the RNA gets replicated, and translated into viral proteins by the cell&#x27;s ribosomes using a cap-independent mechanism driven by the internal ribosome entry site element.

The synthesis of viral proteins include 2A &#x27;cleavage&#x27; during translation. They include proteases that inhibit the synthesis of normal cell proteins, and other proteins that interact with different components of the host cell. The infected cell ends up producing large quantities of viral RNA and capsid proteins, which are assembled to form new viruses. After assembly, the host cell lyses (bursts) and releases the new viruses.

===Recombination===

Recombination can occur within host cells during co-infections by different FMDV strains.
Recombination is common and a key feature of FMDV evolution.

== Serotypes ==

&quot;Foot-and-mouth disease virus&quot; occurs in seven major serotypes: O, A, C, SAT-1, SAT-2, SAT-3, and Asia-1. These serotypes show some regionality, and the O serotype is most common.

<text>A wedding dress or bridal gown is the dress worn by the bride during a wedding ceremony. The color, style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants. Wedding dresses hold a significant place in fashion, symbolizing personal expression, and cultural traditions and societal values. In Western culture, the wedding dress is most commonly white, a fashion made popular by Queen Victoria when she married in 1840. In Eastern cultures, brides often choose red to symbolize auspiciousness. These wedding dresses often represent a blend of heritage and contemporary trends, making them a pivotal aspect of bridal fashion and a reflection of evolving style in society.

== Fashion of wedding dresses ==
Wedding dress fashion has evolved significantly, shaped by shifts in aesthetic preferences, technological advancements, and broader cultural trends. Historically, bridal attire featured elaborate designs with structured silhouettes and intricate detailing, reflecting the prevailing styles of their time. In more recent decades, minimalist and modern designs have gained popularity, emphasizing simplicity and personal expression. Wedding dresses continue to adapt to contemporary fashion trends while retaining elements of tradition, offering a wide range of styles that allow brides to express their individuality.

=== Current fashion ===
In the early 21st century, many wedding dresses were sleeveless and strapless. Other brides preferred styles with sleeves, higher necklines, and covered backs.

The latest wedding dress designs, as of 2024, feature drop-waist silhouettes, convertible gowns, intricate crystal embellishments, tulle, and gowns that display vintage charm.

== History of the wedding dress ==
The history of wedding dresses encompasses a diverse array of traditions and cultural practices, each shaped by the social, religious, and economic contexts of their time. In Western cultures, white wedding gowns have symbolized purity and grace since the 19th century, whereas Eastern cultures often feature elaborate, colorful garments imbued with symbolic meanings unique to each region.

=== Western Culture ===
Weddings performed during and immediately following the Middle Ages were often more than a personal union between two individuals. They frequently symbolized a union between families, businesses, or even nations. These ceremonies were driven more by political considerations than romantic love, particularly among the nobility and the higher social classes. Brides were expected to dress in a way that reflected the status of their families, representing more than just themselves during the ceremony. Brides from wealthy families often wore rich colors and exclusive fabrics, wearing bold colors and layers of furs, velvet, and silk. The attire of the bride was a testament to the wealth and social standing of her family. Brides from lower social strata wore their best church dress on their wedding day. The amount and the price of material a wedding dress contained was a direct reflection of the bride&#x27;s social standing and indicated the extent of the family&#x27;s wealth to wedding guests.

==== Color of wedding dresses ====
The first documented instance of a royal bride wearing a white wedding dress was that of Philippa of England. She wore a tunic with a cloak in white silk bordered with squirrel and ermine in 1406, when she married Eric of Pomerania. Similarly, Mary, Queen of Scots, wore a white wedding dress in 1559 when she married her first husband, Francis, the Dauphin of France, because it was her favorite color, although white was then the color of mourning for French queens.

This was not a widespread trend, however: prior to the Victorian era, a bride was married in any color, black being popular in Finland.

White became a popular option in 1840, after the marriage of Queen Victoria to Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, when Victoria wore a white gown trimmed with Honiton lace. Illustrations of the wedding were widely published, and many brides opted for white in accordance with the Queen&#x27;s choice. Although white was later assumed to symbolize virginity, it was originally blue that represented purity, piety, and fidelity, and was associated with the Virgin Mary.

Despite the rise in popularity of white wedding dresses, brides continued to follow contemporary fashion trends. In the early 1900s, clothing included a lot of decorations, such as lace or frills. This was also adopted in wedding dresses, where decorative frills and lace were common. For example, in the 1920s, they were typically short in the front with a longer train in the back and were worn with cloche-style wedding veils. This tendency to follow current fashions continued until the late 1960s, when it became popular to revert to long, full-skirted designs reminiscent of the Victorian era.

Since the mid-20th century, white has been the dominant color for Western wedding dresses, though &quot;wedding white&quot; includes shades such as eggshell, ecru, and ivory. However, white is not the universal color of wedding dresses. In Mexico, for example, red is a popular color.

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the color white is used as a symbol of purity, innocence, and cleanliness, particularly in religious ceremonies, including weddings. For weddings in the temple, white clothing is also worn by all participants during the ceremony, both men and women, to symbolize unity and equality before God. The brides are instructed to wear white dresses that are modest in design and fabric and free of elaborate decoration.

=== Eastern culture ===

Many wedding dresses in China, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan are red; the traditional Indian color representing good luck and auspiciousness. Vietnamese wedding dresses (in the traditional form of áo tấc the ancient Ao dai) were dark blue. Today, many women choose other colors besides red. In modern mainland Chinese weddings, the bride may wear Western dresses of any color and a traditional costume for the wedding tea ceremony.

In modern Taiwanese weddings, the bride generally picks red (following Chinese tradition) or white (more Western) silk for the wedding gown material, but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquets. Traditionally, the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride&#x27;s side and the alcohol (specifically called &quot;xi-jiu,&quot; confusingly the same as what the wedding banquet itself is called) consumed during both banquets. While the wedding itself is often based on the couple&#x27;s choices, the wedding banquets are a symbolic gesture of &quot;thanks&quot; and appreciation, to those who have raised the bride and groom (such as grandparents and uncles) and those who will continue to be there to help the bride and groom in the future. Thus out of respect for the elders, wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally.

Red saris, lehengas, and salwar kameez are traditional garment options for brides in Indian cultures. The fabric of choice is also traditionally silk, regardless of garment type. Over time, color options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crepe, Georgette, charmeuse, and satin are used, and colors have been expanded to include gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well.

Traditionally, a Kurdish first-time bride would wear a red dress for her wedding to symbolize the postcoital bleeding she will experience when she loses her virginity while a Kurdish bride who used to be married before would wear pink. Today, many Kurds associate red wedding dresses with impoverished Kurdish rural society and it is no longer commonly worn.

A Japanese wedding usually involves a traditional pure white kimono for the formal ceremony, symbolizing purity and maidenhood. The bride may change into a red kimono for the events after the ceremony for good luck.

The Javanese people of Indonesia wear a kebaya, a traditional kind of blouse, along with batik.

In the Philippines, variations of the Baro&#x27;t saya adapted to the white wedding tradition are considered to be wedding attire for women, along with the barong tagalog for men. Various tribes and Muslim Filipinos don other forms of traditional dress during their respective ceremonies.

=== Native American culture ===

The indigenous peoples of the Americas have varying traditions related to weddings and thus wedding dresses. A Hopi bride traditionally had her garments woven by the groom and any men in the village who wished to participate. The garments consisted of a large belt, two all-white wedding robes, a white wedding robe with red stripes at the top and bottom, white buckskin leggings and moccasins, a string for tying the hair, and a reed mat in which to wrap the outfit. This outfit also served as a shroud, since these garments would be necessary for the trip through the underworld.

A Pueblo bride wore a cotton garment tied above the right shoulder, secured with a belt around the waist.

In the traditions of the Delaware, a bride wore a knee-length skirt of deerskin and a band of wampum beads around her forehead. Except for fine beads or shell necklaces, the body was bare from the waist up. If it was a winter wedding, she wore deerskin leggings and moccasins and a robe of turkey feathers. Her face was painted with white, red, and yellow clay.

The tribes of Northern California (which include the Klamath, the Modoc, and the Yurok) had a traditional bridal dress woven in symbolic colors: white for the east, blue for the south, yellow (orange) for the west; and black for the north. Turquoise and silver jewelry were worn by both the bride and the groom in addition to a silver Concho belt. Jewelry was considered a shield against evils including hunger, poverty, and bad luck.

<text>The Rikugun Ki-202 &quot;Shūsui-Kai&quot; (, translated as &quot;Autumn Water, improved&quot;) was a direct development of the German Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; rocket-powered interceptor aircraft. None were produced before Japan&#x27;s surrender that ended World War II.

In a split from the development of the Mitsubishi J8M and Mitsubishi Ki-200, the IJA instructed Rikugun to develop a new design based on the Me 163, independent of the IJN&#x27;s J8M. A fundamental shortcoming of the Me 163, and all other aircraft based on it, was extremely limited endurance, typically only a few minutes. The Imperial Japanese Navy proposed to improve the endurance of the J8M1 by producing a version with only one cannon, thereby saving weight and space for more fuel (the J8M2). The Army on the other hand opted to keep both cannons and enlarge the airframe to accommodate larger tanks, resulting in the Ki-202, which was to have been the definitive Army version of the fighter. Power was to be supplied by a thrust Mitsubishi Toku Ro.3 (KR20) rocket motor. Undercarriage was to have been a sprung skid and tail-wheel.

<doc id="460097" wikidata="Q111556" url="?curid=460097" title="Zouk (club)">
<text>Zouk is a Singaporean nightclub located in the Clarke Quay district. Opened in 1991, the brand has since expanded to various cities around Asia and North America. One of the country&#x27;s most prominent nightclubs, it has won the Singapore Tourism Board&#x27;s &quot;Best Nightspot Experience&quot; award 6 times, between 1996 and 2007. Zouk was ranked number 10 on DJ Magazine&#x27;s list of Top 100 clubs in the world in 2006, 2007 and 2010. In 2017, Zouk Singapore earned its highest ranking yet at number 3, the top entry for clubs across Asia. In 2021, Zouk Singapore was ranked number 11 while Zouk KL was ranked 33 on the DJ Mag Top 100 Clubs list in the world.

In September 2015, one of its founders, Lincoln Cheng, sold the rights of the Zouk brand to Genting Hong Kong, an affiliate of Genting Singapore. The brand and its business was valued at S$40 million by the financial audit firm Ernst &amp; Young in 2013. On 1 September 2020, Genting Hong Kong sold Zouk for S$14 million to Tulipa, a firm owned by Lim Keong Hui, the former deputy CEO of Genting Hong Kong and the son of Genting Hong Kong CEO and chairman of Genting Group Lim Kok Thay.

==Etymology==
The club is named after the Antillean Creole word for &#x27;party&#x27;.

==History==
Zouk was designed based on Cheng&#x27;s travels around Ibiza and other Mediterranean coastal countries. The club, located at Jiak Kim Street, was housed in three restored warehouses, which were built in 1919, when Cheng acquired it. Three interconnected clubs were housed within the warehouses.
* Zouk (1991), with a large dance floor, sound and lighting, catering to a variety of artists.
* Velvet Underground (1994), a quieter, more relaxed lounge that plays house and soul.
* Phuture (1996), a more avant-garde bar specializing in broken beats and hip hop/R&amp;B.

In December 2016, Zouk moved to its new premises at Clarke Quay. Housed in a revamped warehouse, the new space retained its multi-room concept with three club outlets and two bars:

* Zouk, the largest club in the complex with a capacity of over 3,500, has a main room that regularly hosts international guest DJs, ‘live’ performances, and other events. 
* Phuture, an underground-esque club outlet for hip-hop and R&amp;B lovers.
* Capital, a dual lounge and club space aimed at older audiences with open format music nights. 
* RedTail Bar.
* Queens, a hip-hop inspired cocktail bar inspired by the New York borough. &quot;(No longer operational after COVID-19; used as a storage/staff area currently.)&quot;
In 2021 (month unknown), amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Zouk further expanded its premises by taking over its neighboring bar, Get Juiced, in the same Clarke Quay entertainment complex. This additional space housed a restaurant and another bar.
* Here Kitty Kitty SG, which borrows its concept from its sister outlet in Zouk Las Vegas, positions itself as a &quot;vice den&quot; inspired by Shinjuku in the 1950s. Featuring Japanese-fusion bites and speakeasy cocktails, it is generally a more luxurious but more expensive place than the other sister bars by Zouk in the area.
* Sushi Ichizuke, a high-end omakase restaurant with only 16 seats, featuring &quot;instagram-worthy dishes&quot; at a high price tag of S$450++ per person.

<text>A semi-automatic pistol (also called a self-loading pistol, autopistol, or autoloading pistol) is a repeating handgun that automatically ejects and loads cartridges in its chamber after every shot fired, but only one round of ammunition is fired each time the trigger is pulled. The pistol&#x27;s fire control group disconnects the trigger mechanism from the firing pin/striker until the trigger has been released and reset manually, unlike the self-cycled firing mechanism in fully automatic pistols.

A semi-automatic pistol recycles part of the energy released by the propellant combustion to move its bolt, which is usually housed inside the slide. After a round of ammunition is fired, the spent cartridge casing is extracted and ejected as the slide/bolt moves rearwards under recoil, the hammer/striker is cocked by the slide/bolt movement, and a new round from the magazine is pushed into the chamber when the slide/bolt returns forward under spring tension. This sets up the following shot (i.e. &quot;in battery&quot;), which is fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again. Most pistols use a short recoil operation to perform this, but some pistols use simple blowback or gas operation mechanisms.

Most types of semi-automatic pistols rely on a removable box magazine to provide ammunition, which is usually inserted into the grip. However, some pistols are based on receiver-style designs similar to existing semi-automatic rifles, and thus have the magazine inserted separately from the grip.

==Terminology==
The language surrounding &quot;automatic&quot;, &quot;semi-automatic&quot;, &quot;self-loading&quot;, etc., often causes confusion due to differences in technical usage between different countries and differences in popular usage. For example, the term &quot;automatic pistol&quot; technically refers to a fully automatic machine pistol, which is capable of continuously firing multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger, although in popular American usage it is also used as a synonym for any self-loading pistol, the vast majority of which are semi-automatic.

In colloquial usage, because machine pistols are very rare on the market, an &quot;automatic pistol&quot;, a &quot;semi-automatic pistol&quot; or a &quot;self-loading pistol&quot; usually all imply a semi-automatic handgun that is fed by a removable magazine, which discharges one round for each trigger pull.

==Operation==
Semi-automatic pistols use one firing chamber that remains fixed in a constant linear position relative to the gun barrel. In contrast, although double-action revolvers can also be fired semi-automatically, their rounds are not fired from a single chamber, but rather are fired from each of the chambers that are rotated into linear alignment with the barrel&#x27;s position in turn just prior for each shot fired.

Typically, the first round is manually loaded into the chamber by pulling back and releasing the slide mechanism. After the trigger is pulled and the round is fired, the recoil operation of the handgun automatically extracts and ejects the shell casing and reloads the chamber. This mode of operation generally allows for faster reloading and storing a larger number of cartridges than a revolver.

Some modern semi-automatic pistols are exclusively double-action (DA or DAO) trigger function; that is, once a round is chambered, each trigger pull cocks the hammer, striker, or firing pin, and additionally releases the same to fire a cartridge in one continuous motion. Each pull of the trigger on a DAO semi-automatic pistol requires the same amount of pressure. The Kel-Tec P-11 is an example of a DAO action. DAO semi-automatic pistols are most generally recommended only in the smaller, self-defense, concealable pistols, rather than in target or hunting pistols.

A notable exception is the Glock range of pistols, which optimize preset triggers (similar to DAO), but the striker is partially cocked back as the slide closes. This allows for significantly shorter trigger pulls than DAO. The trigger spring can be replaced with a lighter one and paired with a low-strength sear connector resulting in lightened trigger pulls to improve a shooter&#x27;s accuracy (like models G34 and G35).
Standard modern semi-automatic pistols are usually double-action (DA), also sometimes known as double-action/single-action (DA/SA). In this design, the hammer or striker may be either thumb-cocked or activated by pulling the trigger when firing the first shot. The hammer or striker is recocked automatically during each firing cycle.

In double-action pistols, the first pull of the trigger requires roughly twice as much pressure as subsequent firings, since the first pull of the trigger also cocks the hammer (if not already cocked by hand). The Beretta 92F/FS is an example of this style of action.

A common mode of carry for DA semi-automatic pistols is with the magazine full, a round chambered, and the gun holstered and uncocked with the external safety unengaged or off. The Taurus PT145 is an example of a DA/SA weapon, as it has no decocker and thus has its striker primed from the moment of chambering and only enters double-action mode if a round fails to fire upon the pin&#x27;s impact; at other times, it operates as a single-action striker-fired firearm.In contrast, a single-action (SA) semi-automatic pistol must be cocked by first operating the slide or bolt, or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually. The M1911 is an example of this style of action. All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first &quot;racked&quot; to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the slide locked back. Then the safety can be applied.

It is generally not a good idea to load a round manually as this can cause excessive wear on the extractor as semi-automatic firearms were designed to have cartridges loaded from the bottom via the magazine.

===Cocking modes===
The normal mode of carrying an SA semi-automatic pistol is condition 1, popularly known as cocked and locked. Condition 1 (a term popularized by Jeff Cooper) refers to having the magazine full, a round chambered, the hammer fully cocked, and the thumb safety engaged or on, at least for right-handed users. For many single-action, semi-automatic pistols, this procedure works well only for right-handed users, as the thumb safety is located on the left side of the pistol and is easily accessible only for those who are holding the pistol in the right hand. Many modern SA semi-automatic pistols have had their safety mechanisms redesigned to provide a thumb safety on both sides of the pistol (ambidextrous), thereby better meeting the needs of left-handed, as well as right-handed users.

Many SA semi-automatic pistols have a hammer position known as &quot;half-cocked&quot;. Squeezing the trigger will not fire the gun when it is in the half-cocked position, and neither will dropping the gun in this state cause an accidental discharge. During World War II, in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, an unofficial and unapproved carry mode for the SA M1911 by left-handed U.S. soldiers in combat was carrying the gun with the magazine full, a round chambered, the action in half-cocked position, and the thumb safety (accessible only to right-handed users) positioned in the off (or ready-to-fire) mode.

The primary advantage of the half-cocked position versus the uncocked position in that particular scenario was added sound suppression (of the click of the weapon being cocked). A secondary advantage was the avoidance of accidental discharges if the gun was accidentally dropped. The half-cock was revised by Colt in the 1970s and subsequently other manufacturers – the hammer will fall from half-cock if the trigger is pulled on most newer 1911 type guns.

==Technology==
A self-loading pistol reloads the chamber with a new round automatically each time the weapon is fired, without additional action being required by the user. For a semi-automatic pistol, this is typically accomplished by recoil operation. In a machine pistol, in contrast, this can be accomplished by blowback, or, less commonly, by gas operation, harnessing gases produced when the gun is fired. The Desert Eagle is a rare example of a semi-automatic pistol that siphons off some of the gases instead of relying on short recoil operation.

A revolver, which uses multiple chambers and a single barrel, and a derringer, which uses multiple chambers and multiple barrels, also fire one round per trigger pull, but achieve this in different ways and as such are not classified as being semi-automatic.

A semi-automatic pistol will fire only one shot per trigger pull, in contrast to a &quot;fully automatic&quot; or machine pistol, which continues to fire as long as the trigger is held or until all rounds have been fired. The Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer (German for &quot;rapid fire&quot;), a modified Mauser C96 pistol, is a notable example of a true machine pistol.

While both types of weapons operate on the same principles, fully automatic weapons must be built more ruggedly to accommodate the heat and stress caused by rapid firing, and it can be difficult (and illegal in most countries) to convert a semi-automatic pistol into a fully automatic mode of fire. A selective-fire action pistol, though, can be converted back and forth by means of a switch, and often includes a burst mode, typically for a three-round burst with each trigger pull. Selective-fire weapons are generally used by specialized law enforcement and security personnel such as SWAT teams, hostage rescue teams, anti-terrorist units, or government bodyguards for heads of state. In the United States, selective-fire weapons are not legally available to civilians unless they live in a state that allows civilian ownership of National Firearms Act or Title II weapons.

==Actions: blowback versus locked breech==
Self-loading automatic pistols can be divided into &quot;blowback&quot; and &quot;locked breech&quot; categories according to their principle of operation. The blowback operating principle is suitable for smaller, lower-powered calibers, such as .32 ACP and .380 ACP, as the resistance of the recoil spring and mass of the slide are sufficient to retard the opening of the breech until the projectile has left the barrel and breech pressure has dropped to a safe level. For more powerful calibers such as the 9 mm Parabellum (9 mm) and .45 ACP, some form of locked-breech is needed to retard breech opening, as an unlocked blowback pistol in these calibers requires a very heavy slide and stiff spring, making them bulky, heavy, and difficult to operate. A somewhat commercially successful blowback pistol design in the more powerful calibers was produced; the Spanish Astra 400 in 9 mm Largo and the similar Astra 600 in 9 mm Parabellum. U.S. manufacturer Hi-Point also produces a line of blowback-operated pistols in several calibers, including 9 mm and .45 ACP. Virtually all other service-caliber pistols are locked-breech designs

==History==
After Hiram Maxim introduced his recoil-powered machine gun in 1883, several gunsmiths set out to apply the same principles to handguns, including Maxim. Maxim&#x27;s designs for smaller firearms using his recoil-powered ideas never went into production.

In the 1880s, other designers worked on self-loading designs. The Salvator Dormus was the first semi-automatic pistol followed closely by the Schönberger-Laumann 1892.

The first model to gain any commercial success was Hugo Borchardt&#x27;s C-93, which, together with the 7.65 mm Borchardt cartridge, had been designed in 1893 and made its public debut in 1894. Borchardt based the principle of the C-93&#x27;s mechanism in large part upon Maxim&#x27;s toggle-lock. The C-93 featured a locking mechanism modeled after the human knee, which is called &quot;Kniegelenk&quot; in German (knee joint). The C-93 proved mechanically reliable but was too large and bulky to receive widespread acceptance. Equipped with a screw-on wooden stock, the C-93 served well as a small pistol carbine.

In 1896, Paul Mauser introduced the first model of his Mauser &quot;Broomhandle&quot; semi-automatic pistol, the C96. This was the first mass-produced and commercially successful pistol to have a large-capacity, staggered-column magazine holding 10 or 20 rounds. Its original cartridge was called 7.63 mm Mauser, which was more powerful but otherwise identical to the 7.65 mm Borchardt. The Mauser was one of the first self-loading pistols used extensively in battle, notably the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. These pistols were made in 7.63 mm Mauser, or 9×25mm Mauser, along with some models eventually being made in 9 mm Parabellum and a small number in .45 ACP for China.

1898 saw the Schwarzlose Model 1898, a semi-automatic pistol invented by Prussian firearm designer Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose. It was chambered for the 7.65×25mm Mauser, but could also shoot the weaker Borchardt ammunition. The Schwarzlose design was most advanced and far ahead of its time, but not widely adopted with less than 1000 pieces being manufactured. Small lots were sold to members of the Russian Social-Democratic Party who were plotting insurrection but were confiscated at the Russian border and issued to the Imperial Russian Frontier Guards.

In Belgium, in 1896, American gun designer John Browning developed self-loading semi-automatic pistols. His models were first manufactured in Europe by the Belgian firm of Fabrique Nationale (FN) and later by Colt in the U.S. Browning&#x27;s first successful design was the Browning M1900. Like Georg Luger&#x27;s work conducted around the same time in Germany, it was designed alongside a in 7.65 mm cartridge, but the 7.65 mm Browning (aka .32 Auto) differs substantially from Luger&#x27;s 7.65 mm Parabellum. Browning went on to design .25, .38, .380, and .45 ACP cartridges for his semi-automatic pistol designs.
Browning must be given credit for developing the type of locked-breech action which is commonly used by the vast majority of modern large caliber semi-automatic pistols. One of Browning&#x27;s most enduring designs was the Colt M1911, which was adopted by the U.S. military as its service pistol and is in active use since 1911 within some U.S. special forces and Marine units, albeit in modernized forms (the M45A1 Pistol is a prime example). Browning also co-designed the FN Browning Hi-Power, announced in 1922, during the last years of his life, working on this design until his death in 1926. This was a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol capable of holding 13 rounds in the magazine (plus one chambered).

The next notable design was the 7.65 mm Luger by Georg Luger, which although successful in its function, nonetheless failed to have adequate stopping power and failed to win widespread acceptance. In 1902, Luger&#x27;s subsequent and similar P08 in 9 mm Parabellum overcame the problem of inadequate stopping power and featured a greatly improved Borchardt-type &quot;Kniegelenk&quot; (&quot;knee-joint&quot;) locking mechanism. Unlike Browning&#x27;s locked-breech design, the barrel in a &quot;Kniegelenk&quot; design does not tip up and down while the gun is fired, thereby theoretically improving shooting accuracy. Luger&#x27;s P.08 was adopted by the German military and served as their standard sidearm in World War I.

During World War II, Germany was the first nation to adopt a double-action pistol, the Walther P38, which could be carried loaded (with a cartridge chambered) and ready to fire without the risk of an accidental discharge if dropped. The P38 also used Luger&#x27;s 9 mm Parabellum cartridge. Revolvers were still issued by various major powers, but their use was decreasing. Though the British firm Webley &amp; Scott had developed several adequate self-loading pistols, one of which was adopted by the (normally unarmed) British police in 1911 and by the Royal Navy and Royal Marines before the First World War, revolvers were generally preferred by most British military. In the Soviet Union, the TT pistol replaced the Nagant M1895 revolver during the war. In the United States, the M1911A1 was adopted as the standard military sidearm. Both Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson produced revolvers chambered for the same .45 ACP ammunition used in the M1911A1, because of the great demand for handguns and the need to adopt a common cartridge for use in both semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.

After World War II, most nations eventually adopted 9 mm Parabellum caliber pistols employing some variant of Browning&#x27;s locked-breech design for their standard-issue military pistols. The most popular early choice was the FN Browning Hi-Power mentioned above; another popular model was the locked-breech Walther P38 because of its many safety features. Over the course of the postwar 20th century, additional popular semi-automatic pistols were introduced, including the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 59, Beretta 92, CZ 75, Glock, SIG Sauer P226, Walther P88, Heckler &amp; Koch USP, Kel-Tec P-11, and Kel-Tec P-32, among many other models.

The almost universal trend since the 20th century has been for semi-automatic pistols to replace revolvers for military use, although the transition has been slower in police and civilian use. , revolvers are mainly used in jurisdictions that permit their use for civilian self-defense, hunting, plinking, and target practice. Semi-automatic pistols are by far the most popular for concealed carry by civilians, primary handguns for police and military use, backup guns for police use, and where the usual five or six shots of a revolver are deemed inadequate.

<doc id="460103" wikidata="Q882854" url="?curid=460103" title="William H. Murray">
<text>William Henry Davis &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray (November 21, 1869 – October 15, 1956) was an American educator, lawyer, and politician who served as the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, a U.S. Congressman from Oklahoma, and as the 9th Governor of Oklahoma. He was a Southern Democratic member of the Democratic Party who opposed the New Deal and supported racial segregation.

Murray started his political career with several failed runs for political office in his home state of Texas before moving to Indian Territory where he married Mary Alice Hearrell Murray, the niece of Chickasaw Nation Governor Douglas H. Johnston. Although not American Indian, he was appointed by Johnston as the Chickasaw delegate to the 1905 Convention for the proposed State of Sequoyah and later he was elected as a delegate to the 1906 Oklahoma Constitutional Convention for the proposed state of Oklahoma. He served as the president of both constitutional conventions.

Murray was elected as a representative and the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives after statehood. He also was elected as U.S. Representative (D-Oklahoma), serving between 1913 and 1917.

In the 1920s, he traveled South America attempting to start a colony. He eventually negotiated a contract for a colony with the Bolivian government under President Bautista Saavedra in 1922, but the colony, Aguairenda, was largely unsuccessful. President Hernando Siles eventually cancelled the colony&#x27;s lease in 1928 after it failed to become profitable and Murray returned to Oklahoma.

After returning to Oklahoma, he was elected the ninth governor of Oklahoma, serving from 1931 to 1935. During his tenure as governor in years of the Great Depression, he established a record for the number of times he used the National Guard to perform duties in the state and for declaring martial law at a time of unrest.

In his later life, Murray published a three-volume memoir and several books which contained racist and antisemitic claims. Historian Reinhard H. Luthin described his populist campaign tactics and rhetoric as demagoguery. His son, Johnston Murray, was later elected Governor of Oklahoma.

==Early life, education and family==
William Henry Davis Murray was born on November 21, 1869, in Collinsville, Texas. He was born to Uriah Dow Thomas Murray, a grist mill worker, and Bertha Elizabeth (Jones). Uriah Murray was born in Tennessee in 1839, moved to Texas in 1852, and was descended from Scottish immigrants. He had two older brothers: John Shade Murray and George Thomas Murray. He had a younger sister and brother who died in infancy. His mother died when he was two years old and in 1873 his father remarried to Mollie Green, a widow from Montague, Texas.

After the marriage, Murray moved with his father and brothers to Montague, Texas. Uriah opened a grocery store and butcher shop and had seven more children with Mollie Green. On September 18, 1881, he ran away from home with his two older brothers. He worked picking cotton, chopping wood, and as a bricklayer before attending public school in Keeter. Murray attended College Hill Institute in Springtown, Texas, and started selling books to pay for school. He graduated from College Hill with a teaching degree in 1889 and began teaching in a public school in Parker County, Texas. During this time he attended a Campbellite church, but was not particularly religious.

===Early career in Texas===
Murray became politically active and joined the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and the Democratic Party, and was a vocal critic of the People&#x27;s Party. In 1890, he was a delegate to Texas State Democratic Convention. In 1891, he wrote for &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s World&quot;, a Dallas newspaper. In 1892, he ran the Texas Senate against Oscar Branch Colquitt and George Taylor Jester, coming in third in the Democratic primary. In late 1893, he launched &quot;The Corsicana Daily News&quot; and &quot;The Navarro County News&quot; with his brother George. In 1894, he again lost a race for the Texas Senate to Colquitt.

After reading the law and passing the Texas bar exam in 1897, he moved to Fort Worth, Texas and began practicing law. He later worked as a writer for the &quot;Fort Worth Gazette&quot;. He was a skilled orator and campaigned for James Stephen Hogg when the latter ran for Governor of Texas.

==Indian Territory==
On March 28, 1898, Murray moved to Tishomingo, the capital of the Chickasaw Nation in the Indian Territory (now eastern Oklahoma), where he quickly became a political and legal advisor to Douglas H. Johnston, the Governor of the Chickasaw Nation. After he married Johnston&#x27;s niece Mary Alice Hearrell Murray on July 19, 1899, he was allowed to practice in Chickasaw courts and started a law practice with Chickasaw Senator M. V. Cheadle. The couple had five children, including Johnston Murray.

He acquired his nickname &quot;Alfalfa&quot; around 1902 while working as a political operative for Palmer S. Moseley, gubernatorial candidate for the Oklahoma Territory. Murray frequently toured to give talks to local farmers about politics and farming. He often referred to a large tract of alfalfa which he cultivated. Arthur Sinclair, who heard one of his speeches, reported to the editor of the Tishomingo &quot;Capital-Democrat&quot; that he had just seen &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; deliver one of his finest speeches. The name stuck with Murray for the rest of his life.

=== Sequoyah and Oklahoma constitutional conventions ===
In 1905, tribal governments in Indian Territory organized a convention to create a constitution for the proposed State of Sequoyah. Governor Johnston appointed Murray to represent the Chickasaw at the convention in Muskogee. Of the six delegates at the convention, four were Native Americans; Murray and Charles N. Haskell were the only non-tribal, European Americans. The delegates drafted a constitution, which in a referendum was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of the Five Tribes.

Trying to avoid another state that might be dominated by Democrats (because of the Five Civilized Tribes&#x27; origin in the Southeast and their histories of slave-holding and alliance with the Confederacy in the Civil War), President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, opposed separate statehood for Sequoyah. Roosevelt insisted that the Indian and Oklahoma territories had to be admitted as one state – Oklahoma.

In response to Congress&#x27;s passage of the Enabling Act in 1906, the people of the two territories held a joint convention. Murray was elected as the delegate for District 104, which included Tishomingo. At the convention in Guthrie, Murray worked closely with Robert L. Williams and again with Charles N. Haskell. They became lifelong friends and political allies. He was the president of the Guthrie Convention.

Murray was elected by the delegates in 1906 as the President of the Constitutional Convention. During the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. Murray fired all African American clerks and white janitors and rehired them with the white workers as clerks and the African American workers as janitors. He kept Haskell close to him; one newspaper reported the latter was the &quot;power behind the throne&quot;. Together, the two men controlled the convention, gradually shifting power away from the president and vice-president of the convention, Pleasant Porter (Creek) and Green McCurtain (Choctaw). The Oklahoma Constitution produced under their guidance was substantially based on elements of the Sequoyah Constitution.

The proposed constitution included white-supremacist and segregationist causes strongly supported by Murray. President Roosevelt objected to these clauses and obtained their deletion before the constitution was submitted to Congress. The US Congress admitted Oklahoma to the Union as the 46th state on November 16, 1907.

==Oklahoma politics==
===Speaker of the Oklahoma House===
With the state constitution in place, elections were held in 1907 for offices of the new state government. Murray was elected as a state representative and, after being admitted to office, as the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. His ally Charles Haskell was elected as the state&#x27;s first governor.

As a speaker, Murray often opposed the progressive work of Kate Barnard, Commissioner of Charities and Corrections, supported anti-corporate legislation, and pushed for Jim Crow laws similar to those in southern states to limit the rights of African Americans.
&quot;We should adopt a provision prohibiting the mixed marriages of negroes with other races in this State, and provide for separate schools and give the Legislature power to separate them in waiting rooms and on passenger coaches, and all other institutions in the State … As a rule they are failures as lawyers, doctors and in other professions…I appreciate the old-time ex-slave, the old darky – and they are the salt of their race – who comes to me talking softly in that humble spirit which should characterize their actions and dealings with the white man&quot;.

Murray also supported the creation of five agricultural high schools that later became junior colleges. Four were named after his friends and the fifth was named after himself. Some of these junior colleges still live on as the modern day Cameron University, Connors State College, and Murray State College. Murray left the state legislature after one term and did not seek re-election in 1908.

===1910 and 1918 gubernatorial campaigns and United States Congress===

In 1910, Murray ran for governor but lost in the Democratic primary to Lee Cruce. In 1912, Murray lead the Oklahoma delegation to the 1912 Democratic National Convention, where he supported Woodrow Wilson. Also that year, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives representing Oklahoma&#x27;s at-large congressional seat. During his first term he opposed the Federal Reserve Act. He won re-election in 1914, but lost in 1916. He ran in the 1918 Oklahoma gubernatorial election and lost the Democratic primary.

===Bolivia colony===
Murray first visited South America in early 1919, seeing Panama, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay. He was considering starting a colony of Americans decided on the sparsely settled Gran Chaco. Murray believed &quot;Anglo-Saxon and Germanic races&quot; should settle the area. Murray purchased 500,000 acres at 10 cents per acre with the requirement he settle 200 American families on the land. Between December 1919 and March 1920, he signed up 271 families for his colony. United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing warned Murray that the border dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay made the area he was settling particularly dangerous, but Murray continued his plan until Paraguay built a fort across the river from his claim. Murray returned $50,000 to colonists who had signed up and lost about $5,000 of his own money.

In July 1921, he met with President Augusto Leguia of Peru and negotiated a 240,000 acre colony where he planned to settle 160 families. The Peruvian government promised to build a road provide access to the land. However, the road was never built and Murray abandoned the colony.

In 1922, he negotiated with Bautista Saavedra&#x27;s government for a colony in Bolivia, this time in the Tarija Department twelve miles north of Yacuiba. He received 42,000 acres under a 99-year lease for $1,800. He agreed to settle 25 families by December 31, 1925, and the colony had its export taxes waived. While Saavedra supported the colony, Flores Adolfo from the Tarija Department argued against the colony being built on traditional Indian lands in his district. Proponents of the colony advocated it as a buffer between Paraguay and was approved by the Bolivian Congress in 1923.

Colonists were required to follow the laws of Bolivia and a code of laws personally written by Murray. Amongst Murray&#x27;s laws were a ban on brothels and saloons, a requirement to build a poultry shed within two years, a law that Murray owned all agriculture equipment, and a requirement he must personally approve all land transfers. Any change to the laws required a majority vote and Murray&#x27;s consent. He barred colonists who were members of labor unions, socialists, Republicans, or born outside the United States. 41 families signed up with 15 leaving on May 4, 1924. About 80 colonists boarded the &quot;Oroya&quot; in New Orleans before sailing through Havana, the Panama Canal, to Antofagasta, Chile. The caravan then traveled by rail to Tartagal and then on foot to the Tarija Department through the Andes Mountains. The group arrived at Aguairenda, the colony site, on June 18, 1924.

The colonists immediately discovered much of the best land in the area was already leased by local Indigenous people. Colonists, mostly living in the school run by the local Catholic mission, were dissatisfied with the colony&#x27;s poor living conditions. Most colonists left by the end of 1924 and Murray returned home in June 1925 to recruit more colonists. Later that year he shifted to trying to recruit Indians from their village at El Palmer. With the shift in strategy, the colony grew to nearly 400 and ran Bolivia&#x27;s first cotton gin. Conflict in the Bolivian Legislature led President Hernando Siles to demand he create a profitable cotton colony or relinquish his concession. His lease was cancelled on August 6, 1928, and Murray transitioned to raising cattle before finally leaving Aguairenda on July 24, 1929. He returned to Oklahoma on August 24, 1929.

===Governor of Oklahoma===
After attending a &quot;Constitutional Convention Reunion&quot; in 1929, Murray announced another campaign for governor on his wife&#x27;s birthday: January 9, 1930. The primary election included candidates such as A. S. J. Shaw, Martin E. Trapp, Everette B. Howard, and Frank M. Bailey. He advanced to a runoff (the first after the state approved a runoff election law) alongside Frank Buttram. During the runoff campaign, &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;, the Altus &quot;Times-Democrat&quot;, and &quot;Farmer-Stockman&quot; all opposed Murray&#x27;s campaign with &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot;&#x27;s Edith Cherry Johnson writing especially harsh columns accusing him of demagoguery. At the state Democratic convention, Murray tightened his control over the party and secured a party resolution encouraging a boycott of &quot;The Daily Oklahoman&quot; and the &quot;Times-Democrat&quot;. The &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; criticized the Democratic Party&#x27;s boycott as &quot;un-Democratic and un-American.&quot;

Murray won the Democratic nomination, defeating Buttram, the son of a tenant farmer and oil millionaire. He easily defeated Republican Ira Hill, a former Rough Rider, in the November election. His campaign slogan, at a time of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, railed against &quot;The Three C&#x27;s – Corporations, Carpetbaggers, and Coons&quot;.
====Tenure====
Murray was inaugurated as the ninth Governor of Oklahoma on January 12, 1931, and filled state jobs with many of his political allies and members of the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention. During his campaign for governor, he promised to crack down on corruption and favoritism for the rich, to abolish half the clerk jobs at the State House, to appoint no family members, to reduce the number of state-owned cars from 800 to 200, never to use convict labor to compete with commercial labor, and not to abuse the power of pardon. Once in office, he appointed wealthy patrons and 20 of his relatives to high office, purchased more cars, used prisoners to make ice for sale and clean the capitol building, and violated several other campaign promises. When the State Auditor pointed out that 1,050 new employees had been added to the state payroll, Murray simply said, &quot;Just damned lies&quot;. For each abuse of power, Murray claimed a mandate from &quot;the sovereign will of the people&quot;.

During his tenure, he clashed with Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction John Vaughn over his proposed education reforms. He ordered an investigation into William Bizzell alleging the University of Oklahoma suffered from &quot;flagrant immorality and corruption. Bizzell was charged, but charges were later dropped. He fired the presidents for Central State College, Langston University, Southeastern State College, Northwestern State College, Northeastern Oklahoma Junior College, and Murray State College.

=====National Guard use=====
Due to the severity of the depression, Murray relied on the Oklahoma National Guard to enforce the state&#x27;s laws through the use of martial law. Murray did this in spite of impeachment threats from the Oklahoma Senate. During his tenure as governor, Murray called out the Guard and charged them with duties ranging from policing ticket sales at University of Oklahoma football games to patrolling the oil fields. He also used the national guard to enforce segregation and prevent Black families from moving into predominantly white neighborhoods.

Murray also used the Guard during the &quot;Toll Bridge War&quot; between Oklahoma and Texas. A joint project to build a free bridge across the Red River on U.S. Highway 75 between Durant, Oklahoma and Denison, Texas turned into a major dispute when the Governor of Texas blocked traffic from entering his state on the new bridge. The Red River Bridge Company of Texas owned the original toll bridge and had a dispute over its purchase deal. Murray sent the Guard to reopen the bridge in July 1931. Texas had to retreat when lawyers determined that Oklahoma had jurisdiction over both banks of the river.

Murray used the Guard to reduce oil production in the hopes of raising prices. Because of the vast quantity of newly opened wells in Texas and Oklahoma, oil prices had sunk below the costs of production. Murray and three other governors met in Fort Worth, Texas to demand lower production. When the Oklahoma producers did not comply, on August 4, 1931, Murray called out the Guard, declared martial law, and ordered that some 3,000 oil wells be shut down.

By the end of his administration in 1935, Murray had used the National Guard on 47 occasions and declared martial law more than 30 times. As the state constitution prevented governors from succeeding themselves in office, Murray could not run for reelection and left office on January 15, 1935.
=====Response to Great Depression and opposition to New Deal=====
He faced the harsh problems of the Great Depression. Under the previous Governor, William J. Holloway, the state government had accumulated a deficit of over $5,000,000 in its effort to encourage jobs and provide welfare. Mass unemployment, mortgage foreclosures, the deficit, and bank failures haunted Murray&#x27;s administration. In 1931, the legislature appropriated $600,000 for emergency necessities. Through money collected from state employees, businessmen, and his own salary, Murray financed programs to feed Oklahoma&#x27;s poor. No federal relief program had yet been instituted. Murray became a national leader for the victims of the Depression, and called for a national council for relief to be held at Memphis, Tennessee in June 1931.

The government of Oklahoma faced failure, not only because of the massive deficit, but because many of Oklahoma&#x27;s citizens could not pay their debts. To speed the collection of funds, at Murray&#x27;s urging the Legislature created the Oklahoma Tax Commission. This three-member commission was responsible for the collection and administration of taxes, licenses and fees from all citizens. The new agency established safeguards against tax evasion and helped to stem the drain on the state&#x27;s tax revenue. In 1933, he supported the abolition of Oklahoma&#x27;s state property tax, leaving that tax revenue for local governments.

By 1934, he was an anti-New Dealer.

===1932 presidential campaign===
In August 1931, Murray launched a campaign for the 1932 United States presidential election in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. His slogan was &quot;Bread, butter, bacon, and beans&quot;. He testified in front of the United States Congress in January 1932 on the effects of the Great Depression in Oklahoma and dominated the 1932 Oklahoma Democratic State Convention, earning the Oklahoma Democratic Party&#x27;s support for his campaign. He railed against Wall Street and demanded cash bonuses for veterans.

He campaigned against Franklin Delano Roosevelt claiming he suffered from syphilis. Huey Pierce Long, Jr., the former governor of Louisiana and U.S. senator, recalled visiting Murray in his hotel room at the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago:

&quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; was very gracious … While we talked at length, he dwelt upon the virtue in the possible candidacies of everybody except Franklin Roosevelt and himself, even suggesting me as a candidate. He understood the favorite son game. I soon saw that I was fencing with a past master in politics. Had I listened to him very long, he would have been at work to make a favorite son candidate out of me. I was then moving Heaven and earth to keep down other favorite son candidates. … Favorite son moves were the most dangerous things we had to fight. …
He was introduced at the 1932 Democratic National Convention by Henry S. Johnston and received little support outside the Oklahoma delegation.

===1938 gubernatorial and 1942 senate campaigns===
In 1938, Murray ran for governor, and lost in the Democratic primary. Later that year, he tried to run for the United States Senate as an Independent, but his nominating petitions were rejected. In 1940, he ran again for the United States House of Representatives against William C. Rogers on isolationism and a new old age pension without tax increases. In 1942, he ran for the Senate again and lost in the Democratic primary.

==Later life and death==
His wife, Mary Alice Hearrell Murray, died in Oklahoma City on August 28, 1938. Her body lay in state in the Oklahoma Capitol on the afternoon of August 29, 1938; she was the first woman to receive the honor. She was buried in Tishomingo the following day.

After his retirement, Murray became widely known for his radical racist, antisemitic, and conspiracy views. Murray supported Strom Thurmond&#x27;s insurgent Dixiecrat bid for the presidency against Harry S. Truman and Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. In 1948, he chaired a Dixiecrat state convention in Oklahoma.

Murray&#x27;s son, Johnston Murray, had followed his father into Democratic Party politics. The senior Murray administered the oath of office to his son in 1951 after he was elected as the state&#x27;s fourteenth governor.

He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1951.

Murray did not live long past his son&#x27;s governorship. He died on October 15, 1956, of a stroke and pneumonia. He is buried in Tishomingo.

==Legacy and honors==
* Murray State College of Agriculture and Applied Science, is named in William Murray&#x27;s honor. The community college is located in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.
* Alfalfa County, Oklahoma and Murray County, Oklahoma are named in his honor.
* Lake Murray is named in his honor.
* Lake Murray State Park is named in his honor.
* The Alfalfa Bill Century Bike Ride is an annual fundraiser in Johnston County. 
* The William H. Murray bridge, more commonly known as Pony Bridge, is officially named after Murray.

=== Removal of honors ===
In June 2020, Murray Hall and North Murray Hall at Oklahoma State University were &quot;un-named&quot; and a search for new names began.

===Antisemitism and racism===
In the 21st century, Murray&#x27;s legacy has drawn criticism from historians, such as William Savage Jr, because he supported racist and antisemitic policies, and because he published segregationist books. He supported the passage of the first Jim Crow laws in Oklahoma and he advocated the deportation of Jewish people to Madagascar.

<doc id="460105" wikidata="Q15708861" url="?curid=460105" title="Red-billed hornbill">
<text>The red-billed hornbills are a group of hornbills found in the savannas and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are now usually split into five species, the northern red-billed hornbill (&quot;Tockus erythrorhynchus&quot;), western red-billed hornbill (&quot;T. kempi&quot;), Tanzanian red-billed hornbill (&quot;T. ruahae&quot;), southern red-billed hornbill (&quot;T. rufirostris&quot;) and Damara red-billed hornbill (&quot;T. damarensis&quot;), but some authorities consider the latter four all subspecies of &quot;Tockus erythrorhynchus&quot;.

==Description==

This group of conspicuous birds have mainly whitish underparts and head, grey upperparts, long tails, and a long curved red bill which lacks a casque. The sexes are similar, but the female has a smaller bill. They are generally large, at long, but the entire group is considered one of the smaller hornbills.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
During incubation, the female lays three to six white eggs in a tree hole that has been converted to a nest, which is blocked off with a plaster of mud, droppings and fruit pulp, with her inside, where she remains for a time after the eggs are hatched. The nest is built by both parents. Once the mother is inside the nest, there is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food gathered from the outside habitat, to the mother and the chicks. When the chicks and the female are too big for the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall, leaving the chicks inside for their continued protection from predators. Then both parents continued to feed the chicks.

===Nesting===
The female red-billed hornbill protects her young against intruders by building a wall across the opening of her nest. She then seals herself in and brings up her chicks in the enclosed space.

===Feeding===
They are omnivorous, taking and eating insects, fruit, seeds and even small rodents. They feed mainly on the ground and will form flocks outside the breeding season.

<doc id="460106" wikidata="Q430402" url="?curid=460106" title="Johnston Murray">
<text>Johnston Murray (July 21, 1902 – April 16, 1974) was an American lawyer, politician, and the 14th governor of Oklahoma from 1951 to 1955. He was a member of the Democratic Party. In 1956, Murray switched parties and joined the Republican Party. 

Murray was the first Native American to be elected as governor in the United States but he was not an enrolled member of any nation. Murray&#x27;s mother, Mary Alice Hearrell Murray, was a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation. His father, William H. Murray, by virtue of his marriage to Hearrell in 1899, also became a citizen of the nation under Chickasaw law. The elder Murray was an advisor to Governor Douglas H. Johnston of the Chickasaw Nation, and later served in numerous political offices after Oklahoma was admitted as a state. He served as the ninth governor of Oklahoma (1931–1935).

As governor 20 years later, Johnston Murray attempted to reduce state spending but was blocked by state legislators, although they were part of the Democratic majority. The state constitution prohibited a second succeeding term. His second wife Willie Murray ran for governor in 1954. She failed to win. They broke up in a bitter public divorce proceeding, which began a few months later. The divorce was final in 1956.

Murray later married Helen Shutt. They moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked for an oil well servicing company and later a limousine service. 

After returning to Oklahoma City, Murray formed a law partnership with Whit Pate in February 1960. He ran for Oklahoma State Treasurer in 1962, but finished last in the four-man Democratic primary field.

He later worked for the remainder of his career as a consulting attorney for the Oklahoma Department of Welfare. Both he and his father were buried in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.

==Early life and education==
Murray was born July 21, 1902, in the mansion of the Chickasaw Nation&#x27;s Governor at Emet, Johnston County, Indian Territory. His mother, Mary Alice Hearrell Murray, was one-eighth Chickasaw and enrolled as a citizen in the nation. She was the niece of Douglas H. Johnston, the noted Chickasaw Governor for whom her husband William H. Murray was then working as a legal advisor. The senior Murray later served both with the 1905 convention that drafted a constitution for the State of Sequoyah, and as president of the 1906 convention that drafted Oklahoma&#x27;s constitution prior to its admission. Following state and national offices, he was elected in 1930 as the ninth Governor of Oklahoma, serving 1931-1935.

Johnston Murray was one of five children. Growing up in a doubly prominent political family, the younger Murray was educated in the public schools of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, the former capital of the Chickasaw Nation. He attended college at the Murray State School of Agriculture (now Murray State College), graduating in 1924.

Unlike his mother, Johnston Murray never chose to enroll as a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation. When elected as state governor, Murray was the first person of Native American in the United States to hold a gubernatorial office. His status is controversial among some Chickasaw because he was not a citizen.

In 1923, Johnston Murray married Marion Draughon of Sulphur, Oklahoma. They had one child together before getting divorced six years later.

==Early career==
After college, Murray traveled to Bolivia with his father and brothers and their families from Oklahoma. They were trying to establish a private colony, Aguairenda, there to develop a large ranching operation. They lived there for four years working on this project, but did not receive sufficient support from the government. 

When Murray returned to Oklahoma, he worked in oil and gas fields, rising to the role of plant manager.

Murray divorced his wife Marion in 1929. He married again in 1933, to Willie Roberta Emerson. She was a concert pianist and known for her drive and ambition.

==Political career==
Murray joined and became active in the Democratic Party, which dominated state politics. In 1940 he was elected as chairman of the Oklahoma Electoral College, and he served as a member of the Electoral College in 1948. He had returned to graduate school, and in 1947 received his law degree from Oklahoma City University School of Law.

Murray also served as Democratic chair of Oklahoma&#x27;s 8th congressional district and as chair of local political groups in Kay and Oklahoma counties. He served as chair of the Oklahoma Election Board and secretary of the Oklahoma Land Commission.

===Governor of Oklahoma===
Through these activities Johnston Murray had increased his own name recognition, and was also known as the son of the well-known, flamboyant politician and ninth governor of the state, William H. Murray. Johnston Murray was elected Governor of Oklahoma in November 1950 and sworn into office on January 21, 1951. His 81-year old father, &quot;Alfalfa Bill&quot; Murray, administered the oath of office.

Murray&#x27;s main campaign theme had been to reduce spending by the state government and reduce taxes. His program included continuing to consolidate schools to improve education (begun under his predecessor, Governor Roy J. Turner), changing the &quot;ad valorem&quot; tax to return more of the property taxes to local school districts, and expanding highway and toll road systems.

Murray received an honorary degree of Doctor of Law on 7 July 1952 from Sequoia University, which had established legal headquarters in Oklahoma at the time. 

Although working with a Democratic-majority legislature, Murray vetoed forty bills in four years, the highest number in forty years of Oklahoma politics. He had some notable successes: he was the first Oklahoma governor to be elected as Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference. He funding of the Turner Turnpike, which had been authorized by the legislature in 1947 and was completed in 1953, during his administration. He was instrumental in the state purchase of fairgrounds in Oklahoma City. In 1954 Murray toured Central and South American countries on behalf of the United States Information Service. He also served as chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission.

== Johnston and Willie ==
Murray&#x27;s wife and first lady of Oklahoma, Willie Murray, was noted for her charm and intelligence. She also had ambition and drive. Her first action after Murray&#x27;s inauguration was to open the governor&#x27;s mansion to public visitors every Thursday. She welcomed up to 3,000 people weekly, who lined up at the door for entrance.

Being in office resulted in new tensions between Murray and his wife, and he began to chafe against their differences. Willie complained that he drank too much. He responded that she was too bossy. According to a 2015 account, he reportedly said during his tenure, “Damn it, I got elected, not her.”

The state constitution prohibited successive terms in the governor&#x27;s office, so Murray could not run again in 1954. Before his term was up, his wife Willie Murray announced that she would run for the office in 1954. The campaign was considered a farce. When she was the first state-wide candidate to campaign for office by helicopter, one reporter wrote that the helicopter, &quot;... was the only thing that got off the ground.&quot;

After the 1954 election, Murray filed for divorce. Willie fought back, asking for separate maintenance and alleging grounds of adultery and public drunkenness by him. Their brawl went public. Murray asked for another chance; she named another woman as co-respondent, and published letters from Murray declaring his intention to divorce. He said these were lies. Their divorce on grounds of incompatibility was made final in 1956. His settlement included making a $75,000 payment to Willie, deeding her the family&#x27;s home in Oklahoma City and a Ford automobile, and giving her a copy of the movie of her gubernatorial campaign. Willie also got the last word. When Murray announced that he had changed his political affiliation and supported Republican Dwight Eisenhower for President in 1956, Willie reportedly said, “He never has been much of a Democrat.”

==Later years and death==
Murray married a third time, to Helen Shutt in 1956. He lived and worked for a period in Fort Worth, Texas, where he worked for an oil well servicing firm, and then a limousine service.

After returning to Oklahoma City, Murray set up a law partnership with Whit Pate in 1960. He ran for the Democratic nomination for State Treasurer in 1962, but Murray finished last in the four-man primary, gaining 18.24% of the vote (77,881 votes).

Murray later served as a consulting attorney with the Oklahoma Department of Public Welfare until his death on April 16, 1974, 8 days after a surgery for a ruptured abdominal blood vessel. He is buried in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, where both his parents were also buried.

<doc id="460110" wikidata="Q2250405" url="?curid=460110" title="Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy">
<text>The Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy is a trilogy of novels by American writer Robert Anton Wilson consisting of Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat: The Universe Next Door (1979), Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat II: The Trick Top Hat (1980), and Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat III: The Homing Pigeons (1981), each illustrating a different interpretation of quantum physics. They were collected into an omnibus edition in 1988.

Wilson is also co-author of &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (1975), and &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; is a sequel of sorts, re-using several of the same characters and carrying on many of the themes of the earlier work.

The name Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat comes from a thought experiment in quantum mechanics. The first book, &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot;, takes place in different universes in accord with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics; in the second, &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, characters are unknowingly connected through non-locality, i.e., having once crossed paths they are joined in quantum entanglement; and the third book, &quot;The Homing Pigeons&quot;, places characters in an &quot;observer-created universe&quot; in which consciousness causes the collapse of the wavefunction.

Taking place in Unistat, which is the novel&#x27;s parallel to the United States, the novels have intertwining plots involving a wide array of characters, including:

* Epicene Wildeblood, a.k.a. Mary Margaret Wildeblood, a transsexual woman who throws great parties
* Frank Dashwood, president of Orgasm Research
* Markoff Chaney, a prankster
* Hugh Crane, a.k.a. Cagliostro the Great, a mystic and magician
* Furbish Lousewart V, author and President of Unistat
* Marvin Gardens, author and cocaine addict
* Eve Hubbard, scientist and alternate President of Unistat

==Series summary==
In &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot;, the President of Unistat is Furbish Lousewart V; in that universe, a terrorist organization known as Purity of Essence (named after General Ripper&#x27;s obsession in the film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;) threatens to detonate nuclear devices in major cities all over Unistat. Also mirroring &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Unistat has an automated device that will send nuclear missiles to Russia in the event of such an attack. Russia has a similar device to bomb China, and so on.

In &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, President Hubbard, promotes a scientific approach to the improvement of life: she offers rewards to anyone who can design a robot to do their job or develop methods to prolong life. Eventually Unistat becomes a Utopia. She makes the whole law system into three different laws: victimless crimes, which have no punishment; crimes against property, which involve debt and payment; and serious crimes, such as murder, which result in being sent to Hell, a place like jail but not quite. It&#x27;s encased in laser shielding and is like a primitive world all its own. It is, in fact, the State of Mississippi. The original Pocket Books edition of &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot; contains many passages, some sexually explicit, that are not included in later editions, including the Dell softcover. Much of this material first appeared in Wilson&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;The Sex Magicians&quot;, published as pornography by Sheffield House in 1973.

The third volume, &quot;The Homing Pigeons&quot;, features President Kennedy, although it has very little to do with the President. Near the end of the book it keeps switching universes, some of which contain President Kennedy, others which contain President Lousewort, and still others in which Hubbard is the president. Like &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, &quot;The Homing Pigeons&quot; also has material in the Pocket Books edition that is not in later editions. Unlike &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, however, the material that was cut out did not contain particularly sexually explicit content.

The main plots throughout these books are many. One follows Markoff Chaney, a midget, and his pranks played on the world that continuously screws him over. Most of his pranks are played on Dr. Dashwood, of Orgasm Research. However, the most important plot line follows the path of one Hugh Crane which may or may not be this Universe&#x27;s Hagbard Celine; a character that is an obvious representation of Wilson himself.

Another follows an &quot;Ithyphallic Eidolon&quot;, a penis removed from a transsexual woman named Epicene (post-surgery, Mary Margaret) Wildebloode. She puts it on display on her mantelpiece, where it gets stolen. It passes through the vicinity of almost every character in the series at least once.

There are dozens of conspiracy theories, strange loops, satire and paranoia included within those pages. In addition, there are numerous references to other works and occasional outright appropriation of characters from them (including cameos by Captain Ahab and Lemuel Gulliver, among others). Many of the character names are either puns (&quot;Bertha van Ation,&quot; referring to the 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Juan Tootrego&quot;) or references to historical personages (Blake Williams refers to the poet William Blake, Francis Dashwood&#x27;s name refers to Sir Francis Dashwood).

==Tanstagi==

&quot;Tanstagi&quot;, an acronym standing for &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Such Thing As Government Interference&quot;, is the motto of the Invisible Hand Society, an originally fictional organization invented in the &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot;. The acronym was deliberately intended as a reference to Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s TANSTAAFL principle.

The Tanstagi principle is meant to imply that the invisible hand of the free market applies to government as well. In other words, contrary to traditional ideas of laissez-faire capitalism, government interference in the free market is impossible, since governments are inextricably a part of the market as a whole. &#x27;Government&#x27; is not a separate institution—it is a word used to describe the actions of a large number of individuals subject to the same (at least qualitatively) pressures as everyone else. Both of these ideas are part of what is known as &#x27;economic Taoism.&#x27;

While it was first introduced in a novel, people claiming to be members or know of chapters of the Invisible Hand Society have occasionally appeared in editorial pages and on the Internet.

==Language and invented slang==
The &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat Trilogy&quot; is a fictional story, with much interpersonal dialogue between characters. This dialogue frequently makes use of slang words invented by the author, as a substitute for words that were, in the 1970s, typically taboo to speak about in modern western culture. In case a censorship case was brought against the book, Wilson made use of the names of Supreme Court Justices as &quot;stand ins&quot; for certain words. Examples include &quot;Potter Stewarting&quot;, an expression used as a substitute for a common word that refers to the act of copulation, and &quot;Burgering&quot;, referring to the act of voiding one&#x27;s bowels (referring to Chief Justice of the United States from 1969 to 1986, Warren E. Burger), etc.

==Reception==
Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #2 and commented that &quot;It deals with uncertainty, sub-nuclear physics; Oriental philosophy, violence, sex and nuclear war. If this description seems confusing to you, you will be more confused after reading the novel. Purchase it; you will either love it or despise it.&quot;

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat II: The Trick Top Hat&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #10 and commented that &quot;Wilson is not a writer for the unware; the &quot;Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; series is immensely enjoyable, but requires a reader who will think. Aficionados of space opera need not apply.&quot;

Greg Costikyan reviewed &quot;Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat III: The Homing Pigeons&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #11 and commented that &quot;&quot;Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat III&quot; proves once again that Wilson is one of the best and most interesting writers of whom science fiction can boast.&quot;

<text>A dance film (also known as screen dance) is a movie in which dancing is used to reveal inspirational challenges and the central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns. In such films, the creation of choreography typically exists only in film or video. At its best, dance films use filming and editing techniques to create twists in the plotline, multiple layers of reality, and emotional or psychological depth.

Dance film is also known as the cinematic interpretation of existing dance works, originally created for live performance. When existing dance works are modified for the purposes of filming this can involve a wide variety of film techniques. Depending on the amount of choreographic and/or presentational adjustment an original work is subjected to, the filmed version may be considered as dance for camera. However, these definitions are not agreed upon by those working with dance and film or video.

== Examples ==

Britain&#x27;s DV8 Physical Theatre, founded by Lloyd Newson, is well known for its film versions of staged works. The reworking of &quot;Enter Achilles&quot; (1995) for film in 1996 is a seminal example of Dance for camera. Recently acclaimed works include &quot;The Cost of Living&quot;.

Australia&#x27;s The Physical TV Company, directed by Richard James Allen and Karen Pearlman, is well known for creating original works that are a sophisticated meeting of the possibilities of cinema with those of dance. Dance films such as &quot;Rubberman Accepts The Nobel Prize&quot; (2001), &quot;No Surrender&quot; (2002), and &quot;Down Time Jaz&quot; (2003) are differing examples of the possibilities of this approach involving comedy, visual effects, drama, and animation.

The Machinima work by Chris Brandt: &#x27;Dance, Voldo, Dance&#x27; which uses computer game characters within the game &quot;Soulcalibur&quot; to act out a live, choreographed dance. Two players simultaneously performed the dance piece using game controllers. The work existed as a live performance on screen, and has since been edited and distributed on the internet as a video work.

The Mitchell Rose&#x27;s &quot;Deere John&quot;, part of his &quot;Modern Daydreams&quot; suite created with BodyVox artistic directors Jamey Hampton and Ashley Roland, that features a man doing a pas de deux with a 22-ton John Deere Excavator.

Flor Cósmica (1977), Pola Weiss Álvarez&#x27;s video, presented at the ninth International VideoArt Meeting at the Carrillo Gil Museum.

The British choreographer and film maker Liz Aggiss has made several dance films, including the multi-award-winning &quot;Motion Control&quot; (2002), commissioned by BBC Dance for Camera. In 2012, on ARTE TV, she gave an interview in which she talked about screen dance and its ability to place the camera anywhere in relation to the dancer&#x27;s body. &quot;Motion Control&quot; featured &#x27;a glammed up Aggiss, fixed to the spot in nameless, enclosed space, and the camera diving and circling around here. The camera lunges at speed towards the centre of her body like a ravenous carnivorous plant, and Aggiss battles against it with all the wiles of a performer.&#x27;

Billy Cowie, who collaborated with Aggiss from 1982 to 2003, is a pioneer of 3D Dance films, shown as installations in galleries. His works include &quot;In the Flesh&quot;, &quot;Tango de Soledad&quot;, &quot;Cinco Retratos&quot; and &quot;Jenseits&quot;.

<doc id="460121" wikidata="Q888281" url="?curid=460121" title="Bob Taft">
<text>Robert Alphonso Taft III (born January 8, 1942) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 67th governor of Ohio from 1999 to 2007. A member of the Taft political dynasty and Republican Party, Taft previously served in the Ohio House of Representatives, then as Hamilton County commissioner, and as Ohio Secretary of State under governor George Voinovich. He is a son of Senator Robert Taft Jr., a grandson of Senate majority leader Robert A. Taft, and a great-grandson of President William Howard Taft.

Taft was born in Boston and raised in Cincinnati. His first public office was representing the 65th district in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1977 to 1981. He then served as commissioner for Hamilton County from 1981 to 1990. Taft ran for lieutenant governor in 1986 but was unsuccessful. After that, he was elected Secretary of State of Ohio in 1990 and was reelected in 1994. Taft won the 1998 Ohio gubernatorial election with 50 percent of the vote and became governor in January 1999. In his first term, he had high approval ratings and was easily reelected in 2002, defeating his opponent by over 600,000 votes.

In August 2005, as a result of the Coingate scandal, Taft was indicted with four misdemeanors related to him receiving undisclosed gifts and accepting illegal campaign contributions, making him the first Ohio governor charged with a crime while in office. He pleaded no contest to the charges and was fined $4,000. Despite his fallout from the conviction, Taft continued to serve as governor until his second term expired in January 2007. After leaving office, Taft worked for the University of Dayton, beginning August 15, 2007.

==Personal background==
Taft was born in 1942 in Boston, to U.S. Senator Robert Taft Jr. and Blanca Duncan Noel. Bob&#x27;s paternal grandfather was U.S. Senate Majority Leader Robert Alphonso Taft Sr.; his patrilineal great-grandfather was U.S. President and Chief Justice of the United States William Howard Taft; and his patrilineal great-great-grandfather was Attorney General and Secretary of War Alphonso Taft.

He was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he attended the Cincinnati Country Day School through the ninth grade and graduated from The Taft School. At Yale University, he was a member of the Yale Political Union, and graduated with a B.A. in government in 1963. From 1963 to 1965, he served as a Peace Corps volunteer, teaching in Tanzania. He later attended the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, receiving an M.A. in government in 1967. In 1976, he received his Juris Doctor from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.

==Early political career==
Taft was elected as a Republican to the Ohio House of Representatives and served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1977 to 1981, and then was Hamilton County commissioner from 1981 to 1990. He ran for Lieutenant Governor of Ohio on the ticket with Jim Rhodes in 1986, but was unsuccessful. In 1990, he was elected Ohio Secretary of State, defeating incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. He was re-elected in 1994, defeating Democratic candidate Dan Brady.

==Campaigns for Governor==
===1998 campaign===

In December 1996, Taft announced he would run for Governor of Ohio, becoming the first candidate to enter the race. He had been preparing for his run since 1995, raising money and securing the endorsement of term-limited incumbent George Voinovich. It was reported that a deal was made in 1990 that the state Republican Party would clear the field for Voinovich and in trade, they would clear it for Taft in 1998, but both men denied any deal taking place. Taft won the May 5, 1998 primary to become the Republican nominee. He then defeated Democrat Lee Fisher, the former Ohio Attorney General, in the November 3 general election with 50 percent of the vote. He was sworn in for his first term on January 11, 1999.

===2002 campaign===

In January 2002, it was reported that the governor had raised nearly 6 million dollars for his reelection campaign. Taft had high approval ratings going into the election (near 70 percent according to some polls), and experts predicted he would easily win. In the November 5 general election, Taft defeated Democrat Tim Hagan by nearly 20 points, 58%-38%. He was sworn in for his second term on January 13, 2003.

==Governor of Ohio (1999–2007)==

===Third Frontier===
The Third Frontier program, started under the Taft administration, as of 2009 was considered an enormous success in modernizing Ohio&#x27;s 21st century economy. The program focuses on issuing funding for research, development, and commercialization projects to the biomedical, alternative energy, and the advanced propulsion industries and institutions, among others. Between 2003 and 2008 it dispersed $681 million, resulting in a $6.6 billion economic impact return and 41,300 jobs.

===Governor&#x27;s Cup awards===
During Taft&#x27;s tenure, Ohio was awarded the Governor&#x27;s Cup twice, in 2003 and 2006. The award, selected by Site Selection Magazine, is given to the state that attracts the most business developments over $1 million, creates over 50 jobs, or constructs over 20,000 new square feet of business area during the course of a year. The honor is deemed as being considered the best state in the country for business development, attraction, and capital investment.

===Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine===
In 2003, the state awarded $19.4 million for the creation of the Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine. Taft personally delivered the award to the institution in Cleveland. The state awarded another $8 million in 2006 from their Biomedical Research Research and Commercialization Program, which the Taft administration contributed to creating through the Third Frontier program. By 2009, the center had become recognized as a regional leader and had spun off four companies, conducted 51 clinical trials, treated over 250 patients with adult stem cells, and treated over 60 patients with other cell therapies.

===Education===
When the Taft administration took over, the state was faced with an education crisis as nearly half of students were failing mandatory tests and were attending failing districts. Taft&#x27;s &quot;Rebuilding Ohio Schools&quot; was an ambitious project that would pour $10 billion over 12 years into new school construction. The Taft administration ultimately presided over the largest increase in education funding in state history. According to the U.S. Department of Education, Ohio student scores increased during Taft&#x27;s tenure, including 4th and 8th grade math scores every period, with Ohio students scoring above the national average every period in every subject. The number of high school graduates increased, and for the 2006-2007 school year Ohio produced the most advanced percentage of 8th grade science students in the country.

Taft signed legislation creating the Ohio Educational Choice Scholarship Pilot Program, which extended choice to students in failing schools, and the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, which extended grants to 11,000 new students.

===Tort reform===
In January 2003, Taft signed Ohio Senate Bill 281 into law, which limited non-economic damages in medical injury lawsuits. The bill limited non-economic damages to $350,000 and imposed a statute of limitations. Taft then signed Ohio Senate Bill 80, introduced by Sen. Steve Stivers, into law in January 2005, which placed further caps on lawsuit awards in general.

===Veterans affairs===
In December 2000, Taft signed House Bill 408, which designated Interstate 76 as the &quot;Military Order of the Purple Heart Memorial Highway&quot;. In July 2001, he signed legislation to permit school districts to award high school diplomas to veterans of World War II from the United States who were called into service before obtaining their diploma. In November 2001, with the ensuing War on Terror set to begin, Taft signed Ohio Senate Bill 164, called the Military Pay Bill, into law. The bill protected the benefits of state employees called into full-time active service. In 2003, he signed Ohio Senate Bill 47, introduced by Sen. Steve Stivers, which provided additional time to soldiers on active duty to pay their property taxes, interest free. In 2004, he signed legislation renaming the &quot;Michael A. Fox Highway&quot; to the &quot;Butler County Veterans Highway&quot;, and proclaimed November to be &quot;Hire a Veteran Month&quot; in Ohio.

In 2005, Taft signed legislation creating the Military Injury Relief Fund, which allowed taxpayers to donate a portion of their tax refund to help fund grants for injured veterans. He successfully lobbied, along with others, in 2006 to have the Royal Netherlands Air Force join the Ohio Air National Guard in training missions in Springfield. Taft signed numerous other pieces of legislation extending benefits to service members, and in 2006 was honored with the National Guard Association of the United States&#x27; Charles Dick Medal of Merit, in which the press release stated &quot;Taft fought to ensure that Ohio&#x27;s Soldiers, Airmen and their families were
cared for in all aspects of their service, and presided over an unprecedented expansion of state
benefits for Guardmembers and their families.&quot; Ohio&#x27;s adjuntant general Maj. Gen. Gregory L. Wayt stated about Taft that &quot;he epitomizes what a commander-in-chief of a National Guard should be. During his term he
has stood strong with the National Guard.&quot;

His wife, Hope, started the &quot;On the Ohio Homefront&quot; initiative, which is an online database of businesses and charities that provide discounts and services catered toward veterans.

===Highway construction===

In 2003, Taft unveiled his &quot;Jobs and Progress Plan&quot;, which was a $5 billion, 10-year agenda to improve Ohio&#x27;s highways and roads. Among the notable projects were the $97 million Wilmington Bypass project, the $1 billion Cleveland Inner Belt project, and the $220 million Veterans&#x27; Glass City Skyway in Toledo.

===Taxes===
In 2003, Taft signed legislation enacting the largest tax increase in state history, a temporary two-year, 1% sales tax which generated $2.9 billion in revenue during the national recession. In 2005, Taft signed major tax reform, including a 21% personal income tax cut over five years, a reduction of the sales tax by 0.5%, elimination of the corporate franchise tax over five years, and the elimination of the personal tangible property tax over four years. The legislation also included nominal tax credit increases, including $50 for personal and dependent exemptions, and $88 in deductions for deposits made into Ohio Medical Savings Accounts. In 2006, Taft signed Substitute House Bill 49, which provided a 25% tax credit for historic rehabilitation projects.

===Alternative energy and Energy Action Plan===
In 2001, Taft, along with other state leaders, met in Cleveland to unify in calling on the U.S. Congress to grant a funding request for the NASA Glenn Research Center, which was researching projects that included alternative and more efficient energy, and to designate NASA Glenn for the leadership role in biotechnology research. In 2005, Taft mandated that the Ohio Department of Transportation use of B20 biodiesel and of E85 ethanol per year, while selecting flex-fuel vehicles for new purchases. ODOT had been using alternative fuels since 1999, and owned 193 flex-fuel vehicles when this announcement was made. Taft also mandated that ethanol tanks be constructed at all new ODOT facilities. Later in 2005, Taft urged the U.S. Congress to extend tax credits to those who install fuel cell electricity stations. As part of the Ohio Third Frontier program, $100 million in grants had already been issued for the research of fuel cells.

In early 2006, Taft announced his &quot;Energy Action Plan&quot;, which included doubling the use of E85 ethanol in state fleets from to 60,000, increasing the use of biodiesel in state fleets by annually, while mandating the purchase of flex-fuel only vehicles for the state fleet, and allocating $3.6 million from the Energy Loan Fund to make state buildings energy efficient. The plan also called for $25 million from the Energy Loan Fund to be set aside over five years for wind turbine producing companies, and to set aside a grant of 1.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by wind energy. Taft called for a pilot program to create jet fuel from coal, moving Ohio&#x27;s geological information on fossil fuel sources to digital formats, and reaffirming the state&#x27;s commitment to FutureGen, a clean coal initiative.

Between 1998 and 2007, Ohio&#x27;s green industry sector grew at the fourth highest rate in the country, 7.3%.

===Great Lakes initiatives===
Taft spent considerable time during his administration promoting the Great Lakes, which included lobbying the U.S. Congress for funding devoted to restoration projects, and signing pacts that included 8 Great Lakes states and 2 Canadian provinces to preserve the area. These pacts included &quot;The Strategy to Restore and Protect the Great Lakes&quot;, which called for a $20 billion investment, cleanup, and renewal of the lakes, &quot;The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Sustainable Water Resources Agreement&quot;, which aimed to prevent new damage to the region, and &quot;The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact&quot;. In 2001, Taft agreed to &quot;Annex 2001&quot;, an addition to the Great Lakes Charter. In 2008, he joined the Board of Directors of the Alliance for the Great Lakes to help promote effective implementation of the Compact.

===Amy&#x27;s Law===
In May 2005, Taft signed House Bill 29, also known as Amy&#x27;s Law into law, tightening restrictions on bond for suspects accused of domestic violence.

=== Concealed carry ===
In February 2006 Taft vetoed legislation passed by both houses of the Ohio General Assembly removing the &#x27;Plain Sight&#x27; provision from the state&#x27;s concealed carry law. The bill would have also kept &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; from publishing the names and home addresses of licensees. Nevertheless, this provision passed into law when the General Assembly overrode his veto, the first veto override in Ohio in over 30 years.

=== Spending and economy ===

Taft was criticized during his tenure for permitting state spending and state taxes to rise. Critics also argued that Taft was responsible for the lagging Ohio economy during that time period, despite federal trade policies that were out of his control, resulting in the loss of 13,432 employment positions to international trade alone in 2006, and 71,242 employment positions lost overall between 1995 and 2006. Those figures are based on the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program figures, which has stringent standards that do not count all the employment positions truly lost to international trade.
=== Capital punishment ===
Taft presided over the reintroduction of capital punishment in Ohio. During his term, 24 people were put to death by lethal injection, which made Ohio the first outside the South by number of performed executions. Taft, however, granted one commutation.

=== Controversies ===

==== &quot;Naral v. Taft&quot; ====
Taft was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2005, &quot;NARAL v. Taft&quot;, over his decision to allow &quot;Choose Life&quot; license plates to be sold by the state to raise funds for pregnancy crisis centers and adoption centers. They were considered by the American Civil Liberties Union to be &quot;viewpoint discrimination&quot;, thus unconstitutional. The district court dismissed the ACLU&#x27;s lawsuit, and they later withdrew their appeal from the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.

====Coingate====

In 1996, the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly passed a law that struck the requirement that the Ohio state government invest solely in bonds. Various fund managers and other brokers then scrambled to offer their services.

During Taft&#x27;s Tenure, the Ohio Bureau of Workers&#x27; Compensation (BWC) invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by Republican Party supporters who had made large campaign contributions to senior Ohio Republican officials. One was a rare coin investment fund run by Tom Noe which attracted particular scrutiny since two coins worth more than $300,000 were reportedly lost.

Further investigation into GOP operative Noe revealed that coins backed by state investments worth $10–$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for. Tom Noe was convicted of running a criminal enterprise, the theft of $13 million from the fund, and of keeping a second set of books to cover for it.

The Ohio Bureau of Workers&#x27; Compensation (BWC) ultimately invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials.

Taft&#x27;s conviction was grounds under the Ohio Constitution for impeachment and removal from office by the Ohio General Assembly; however, impeachment proceedings did not occur and Taft remained in office until the end of his second term.

====Criminal golf games====
In 2001, a ruling by the Ohio Ethics Commission made clear that any free rounds of golf paid for by lobbyists which were valued over $75 were to be disclosed. Taft stated he was not aware of the opinion until 2005 after news reports surfaced about the Coingate scandal. In a 2003 questionnaire for a possible appointment to the Ohio Turnpike Commission, Thomas Noe, at the center of the Coingate investigation, indicated to Taft he was not doing business with the state, although he had been. Taft personally notified the commission of possible disclosure failures, and offered his cooperation in correcting the issues in voluntarily triggering an investigation.

On August 17, 2005, Taft was charged with four criminal misdemeanors stemming from his failure to disclose golf outings paid for by lobbyists, as well as some undisclosed gifts. The Associated Press reported the total value of at least 52 undisclosed gifts as about US$5,800, they included:
# Two undisclosed gifts including golf with coin dealer Thomas Noe, a Republican fundraiser then under investigation, and later convicted, for his handling of a $50 million investment of state money in rare coins, and diverting $2 million to personal use. Taft claimed of Tom Noe that &quot;He fooled people from one end of Ohio to the other.&quot; (&quot;See Coingate scandal.&quot;)
# Six undisclosed gifts including golf outings with political strategist Curt Steiner and Robert Massie, president of chemical information services giant CAS, worth $700. Taft later lobbied the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against expanding scientific directories that would compete with CAS.
# Undisclosed gifts including dinner and Columbus Blue Jackets hockey tickets from Jerry Jurgeson, chief executive officer of Nationwide Insurance
# A book and artwork from the consul general of the People&#x27;s Republic of China worth $100
# A photograph and framed medal from the Defense Supply Center worth $85
# A portfolio and clothing worth $119 from the Youngstown/Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce.

This was the first time an Ohio governor has ever been charged with a crime while in office.

At his arraignment in Franklin County Municipal Court in Columbus on August 18, Taft pleaded no contest and was fined $4,000 plus court costs. Judge Mark Froehlich also ordered Taft to apologize to the people of Ohio as well as state employees. Taft was quoted after sentencing stating &quot;I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology, and I hope the people will understand that these mistakes, though major and important mistakes, were done unintentionally, and I hope and pray they will accept my apology.&quot; During the sentencing it was noted that Taft had a 30-year unblemished record as a public official.

In addition to the criminal sanctions, Taft was issued a public reprimand by the Ohio Supreme Court on December 27, 2006 for accepting and failing to report gifts and golf outings worth more than $6,000. This reprimand was attached to Taft&#x27;s license to practice law in Ohio.

After the fallout from his conviction, Taft called for a ban on executive-level government officials from accepting gifts of any amount from lobbyists.

===Job approval===
At the beginning of his governorship in 1999, Taft had an approval rating of 49 percent. His approval rating had reached 63 percent by November 1999, and 69 percent by November 2001. By May 2002, his approval rating had fallen to 59 percent, but by July it had recovered to 62 percent. Going into the 2002 gubernatorial election, Taft had approval ratings in the high 60s.

Shortly after beginning his second term in January 2003, his approval rating fell to 40 percent, with disapproval at 48 percent. By May 2003, his disapproval rating grew to 50 percent, a level unseen for an Ohio governor in 20 years. Taft&#x27;s sudden dip in approval ratings was likely due to Ohio&#x27;s lagging economy and tax increases.

In early 2004, Taft&#x27;s approval rating showed signs of recovery at 47 percent. In early 2005, when the Coingate scandal was revealed, Taft&#x27;s approval rating slumped to 34 percent, which was at the time the second lowest approval rating found for an Ohio governor. In late 2005, after his conviction for his involvement in the scandal, polls found the governor had an approval rating of just 15 percent—the lowest approval rating ever found for an Ohio governor. Other polls found that Taft&#x27;s approval rating was even lower at 6.5 percent, according to Zogby, giving him quite possibly the lowest polled approval rating ever by a United States politician. A SurveyUSA poll that same month gave Taft a rating of 18 percent. In a response, a spokesman for Taft told the Associated Press, &quot;the governor doesn&#x27;t govern by the polls, he governs by good public policy and making a difference for Ohioans&quot;. A late-2005 article in &quot;Time&quot; named Taft as one of the three worst governors in the country.

During 2006, Taft&#x27;s final year in office, his approval hovered in the low-to-mid 20s. Taft&#x27;s unpopularity contributed to major Democratic gains in the 2006 election, including the defeat of Republican Ken Blackwell by Democrat Ted Strickland in the race to replace Taft as governor. In polling conducted by Quinnipiac University in December 2006, Taft left the governorship with an approval rating of only 16 percent.

==Post-gubernatorial activities==
After Taft left the governorship, he and his wife made a trip to Tanzania in February 2007 where he had served as a Peace Corps volunteer. Taft said the trip was invigorating and that the buildings where he taught and lived 40 years earlier were still there.

Taft joined the University of Dayton in August 2007 as a distinguished research associate for educational excellence. His job is to help the university launch the Center for Educational Excellence, which encourages students to study science, technology, engineering, and math. &quot;We&#x27;ve got to figure out how to get more students in college, and that&#x27;s a challenge that I really look forward to.&quot; Thomas Lasley II, dean of the School of Education and Allied Professions, stated Taft was the first professional who refused his salary offer for being too high. Lasley was quoted &quot;I think the more people have gotten to know him [Taft] the more they realize he is a very ethical individual&quot;.

In November 2008, he joined the Board of Directors of the Alliance for the Great Lakes to help advance Great Lakes education and policy initiatives, such as the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin Water Resources Compact, started during his tenure as Chairman of the Council of Great Lakes Governors.

, he is on the board of directors for Battelle for Kids, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to moving education forward for students by supporting the educators who work with them every day.

Taft is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Family==
The Taft family has been involved in Republican politics for over a century. Bob Taft&#x27;s patrilineal great-great-grandfather Alphonso Taft was Secretary of War, Attorney General, and an Ambassador. His patrilineal great-grandfather William Howard Taft was President and Chief Justice of the United States; patrilineal great-grandmother Helen Louise &quot;Nellie&quot; Taft was First Lady. Paternal grandfather Robert Alphonso Taft, Sr. and father Robert Alphonso Taft, Jr. were both U.S. Senators. First cousin William Howard Taft IV acted as Secretary of Defense for two months in 1989. Uncle William Howard Taft III was an Ambassador. His patrilineal great-granduncle Charles Phelps Taft was a U.S. Representative from Ohio and, for a time, an owner of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Patrilineal great-great-great-grandfather Peter Rawson Taft I was a member of the Vermont legislature. Other prominent relatives include Seth Chase Taft, Charles Phelps Taft II, Peter Rawson Taft II, Henry Waters Taft, Walbridge Smith Taft, and Horace Dutton Taft. Kingsley Arter Taft was a U.S. Senator from Ohio and Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court.

==Legacy==
The Taft Coliseum at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, was renamed in honor of Taft on July 28, 2010.

<text>Marshall Clement &quot;Mark&quot; Sanford Jr. (born May 28, 1960) is an American politician and author who served as the U.S. representative for South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1995 to 2001 and from 2013 to 2019, and as the 115th governor of South Carolina from 2003 to 2011. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Sanford was first elected to Congress in 1994. He represented South Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. He decided against running for a fourth term in the house and instead focused on running in the 2002 gubernatorial election. In the election, he defeated Democratic incumbent Jim Hodges with 52% of the vote. Sanford ran for reelection in 2006, defeating businessman Tommy Moore with 55% of the vote. As governor, Sanford attempted to reject $700 million in stimulus funds for South Carolina from the federal Recovery Act passed in 2009, but the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that only the state legislature—not the governor—had the authority to accept or decline the funds.

In June 2009, after having disappeared from the state for nearly a week, Sanford publicly revealed that he had engaged in an extramarital affair. He had led his staff to believe that he was going hiking on the Appalachian Trail, but actually went to visit his mistress, Maria Belén Chapur, in Argentina. Although the scandal made national headlines, leading to his censure by the South Carolina General Assembly and his resignation as chair of the Republican Governors Association, Sanford did complete his second term as governor.

Sanford ran for Congress again in a 2013 special election for his old seat. He won the election and served in Congress from 2013 to 2019. He lost his 2018 reelection bid in a Republican primary. In September 2019, Sanford announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. He dropped out of the race on November 12, 2019.

==Early life and family==
Marshall Clement Sanford Jr. was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Marshall Clement Sanford, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and Margaret Elise &quot;Peggy&quot; Pitz. His family was fairly well-to-do, but slept in the same room to conserve electricity. Before his senior year of high school, Sanford moved with his family from Fort Lauderdale to the Coosaw Plantation near Beaufort, South Carolina. Sanford attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America.

Sanford received a Bachelor of Arts degree in business from Furman University in 1983 and a Master of Business Administration degree from Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia in 1988.

Sanford married Jenny Sullivan in November 1989. The couple had four sons.

Sanford founded Norton and Sanford Real Estate Investment, a leasing and brokerage company, in 1992.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1995–2001)==
===Elections===

;1994
In 1994, Sanford entered the Republican primary for the Charleston-based 1st Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. The seat had come open after four-term Republican incumbent Arthur Ravenel declined to seek re-election in his ultimately unsuccessful run for governor. Despite having never run for office before, Sanford finished second in a crowded primary behind Van Hipp Jr., a former George H. W. Bush administration official and former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. Sanford defeated Van Hipp in the runoff. He then easily defeated Democratic state representative Robert A. Barber Jr. in the November general election, winning by 66.3% to 32.4%.

;1996–1998
Sanford was unopposed by Democratic candidates in 1996 and 1998. In 1996, he beat Joseph Innella of the Natural Law Party by 96.36% to 3.55%. He beat Innella again in 1998, this time by 91% to 8.9%.

===Tenure===
While in Congress, Sanford was recognized as its most fiscally conservative member by the Cato Institute. He was also recognized by Citizens Against Government Waste, as well as the National Tax Payers Union, for his efforts to rein in government spending and reduce the national deficit. He garnered a lifetime rating of 92 from the American Conservative Union.

He was known for voting against bills that otherwise received unanimous support. For example, he voted against a bill that preserved sites linked to the Underground Railroad. He voted against pork barrel projects even when they benefited his own district; in 1997, he voted against a defense appropriations bill that included funds for Charleston&#x27;s harbor. Seeing himself as a &quot;citizen-legislator&quot;, he did not run for reelection in 2000, in keeping with a promise to serve only three terms in the House.

==Governor of South Carolina (2003–2011)==
===2002 election===

In 2002, just before announcing he would run for governor, Sanford joined the Air Force Reserve. He entered the gubernatorial election of 2002; he first defeated Lt. Gov. Bob Peeler in the Republican primary and then defeated the Democratic incumbent, Jim Hodges, in the general election, by a margin of 53% to 47% to become the 115th governor of South Carolina. In accordance with South Carolina law, Sanford was elected separately from the state&#x27;s Republican lieutenant governor, Andre Bauer. Sanford and Bauer&#x27;s wins gave the Republicans full control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction.

===First term===
In 2003, after becoming governor, Sanford attended two weeks of training with the Air Force Reserve in Alabama with his unit, the 315th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron. While in training in 2003, Sanford did not transfer power to Bauer, saying he would be in regular contact with his office, and would transfer authority in writing only if he were called to active duty.

Sanford sometimes had a contentious relationship with the South Carolina General Assembly, even though it was dominated by his party for his entire tenure. During his administration, governmental power was largely held by three members of the General Assembly: Senators Hugh Leatherman and Glenn F. McConnell and House Speaker Bobby Harrell. The Republican-led state House of Representatives overrode 105 of Sanford&#x27;s 106 budget vetoes on May 26, 2004. The following day, Sanford brought live pigs, who subsequently defecated on the House floor, into the House chamber as a visual protest against &quot;pork projects.&quot;

Sanford rejected the Assembly&#x27;s entire budget on June 13, 2006. Had this veto stood, the state government would have shut down on July 1. He explained his veto as being the only way to get the cuts he desired, and that using the line-item veto would have been inadequate as well as impossible. However, in a special session the following day, both houses dismissed Sanford&#x27;s call for reform by overriding his veto–effectively restoring their original budget.

In 2003, Sanford sought to reform the state&#x27;s public college system. Sanford has criticized these schools as focusing too much on separately creating research institutions and not on educating the young adults of South Carolina. Sanford also suggested that they combine some programs as a means of curbing tuition increases. The schools did not respond positively to this suggestion, however, causing Sanford to remark that &quot;if any institution ultimately feels uncomfortable with our push toward coordination, they can exit the system and go private.&quot;

Sanford&#x27;s first term included other controversies. A &quot;Time&quot; magazine article in November 2005, critical of Sanford, said that some &quot;fear his thrift has brought the state&#x27;s economy to a standstill.&quot;

According to Survey USA, Sanford&#x27;s approval ratings ranged from 47% to 55% during 2006.

===2006 election===

His campaign for re-election in 2006 began by Sanford winning the June 13 Republican Primary over Oscar Lovelace, a family physician from Prosperity, with 65% of the vote to Lovelace&#x27;s 35%. His Democratic competitor in the November elections was state senator Tommy Moore, whom Sanford beat by A landslide margin of 55%–45%. Ultimately, Sanford left his first House stint with a 55% approval rating.

On Election Day, Sanford was not allowed to vote in his home precinct because he did not have his voter registration card. He was obliged to go to a voter registration office to get a new registration card. &quot;I hope everybody else out there is as determined to vote as I was today&quot;, he said. Sanford&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license had a Columbia address, but Sanford was trying to vote at his home precinct in Sullivan&#x27;s Island. According to WAGT in Augusta, Georgia (whose service area includes part of South Carolina) Sanford declared that it would be his last campaign.

===Second term===
In dissent with the Republican Party of South Carolina, Sanford opposed the faith-based license plates his state offers, marketed largely to the state&#x27;s conservative evangelical citizens. After the law to passed without his signature, he wrote: &quot;It is my personal view that the largest proclamation of one&#x27;s faith ought to be in how one lives his life.&quot; The Base Load Review act which ultimately led to the Nukegate scandal, the largest business failure in South Carolina&#x27;s, was also passed without Sanford&#x27;s signature.

After the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (known as the stimulus), which Sanford strongly opposed and publicly criticized before and after its passage by Congress and presidential signing, Sanford initially indicated he might not accept all of the funds allotted by the spending law to South Carolina. He was criticized by many Democrats and some moderate Republicans, both in his state and outside it, who noted South Carolina&#x27;s 9.5% unemployment rate (one of the highest in the country) and complained that Sanford was not doing enough to improve economic conditions in his state, which could be alleviated by the stimulus money. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, suggested that if Sanford or other governors rejected their portion of stimulus funds, he would be happy to take them instead.

On March 11, 2009, Sanford became the first United States governor to formally reject a portion of the federal stimulus money earmarked by Congress for the state of South Carolina. Sanford compromised to accept the federal money on condition that the state legislature provide matching funds to pay down the South Carolina state debt.

Sanford persuaded state legislator Nikki Haley to run as his successor, and campaigned on her behalf.

===2009 disappearance and extramarital affair===

From June 18 until June 24, 2009, the whereabouts of Sanford were unknown to the public, his wife, and the State Law Enforcement Division (which provides security for all South Carolina governors). The mystery surrounding Sanford&#x27;s whereabouts garnered nationwide news coverage; his absence was first reported by Jim Davenport of the Associated Press. Lieutenant Governor André Bauer announced that he could not &quot;take lightly&quot; that Sanford&#x27;s staff had not communicated with him &quot;for more than four days, and that no one, including his own family, knows his whereabouts.&quot;

Before his disappearance, Sanford told his staff that he would be hiking on the Appalachian Trail. While he was gone, he did not answer 15 cell phone calls from his chief of staff; he also failed to call his family on Father&#x27;s Day.

Reporter Gina Smith of &quot;The State&quot; (the daily newspaper of Columbia, South Carolina) intercepted Sanford when he arrived at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport on a flight from Argentina. Several hours later, after learning that evidence of his true whereabouts was being swiftly discovered by the media, Sanford held a news conference during which he admitted to adultery. In emotional interviews with the Associated Press over two days, Sanford said he would die &quot;knowing that I had met my soul mate.&quot; Sanford also said that he &quot;crossed the lines&quot; with a handful of other women during 20 years of marriage, but not as far as he did with his mistress. &quot;There were a handful of instances wherein I crossed the lines I shouldn&#x27;t have crossed as a married man, but never crossed the ultimate line&quot;, he said.

On June 25, &quot;La Nación&quot;, a Buenos Aires newspaper, identified Sanford&#x27;s mistress as María Belén Chapur, a 43-year-old divorced mother of two with a university degree in international relations who lived in Buenos Aires. Earlier, &quot;The State&quot; published details of e-mails between Sanford and a woman only identified as &quot;Maria&quot;. Sanford met Chapur at a dance in Uruguay in 2001 and admitted that a more intimate relationship with her had begun in 2008.

Sanford&#x27;s wife had become aware of her husband&#x27;s infidelities approximately five months before the scandal broke, and the two had sought marriage counseling. Jenny Sanford said that she had requested a trial separation about two weeks before his disappearance.

Sanford told reporters that months before his affair became public, he had sought counsel at a controversial religious organization called The Family, of which he became a member when he was a representative in Washington, D.C. from 1995 to 2001.

According to Survey USA, Sanford&#x27;s approval ratings in South Carolina after his admission of infidelity (6-24-09) showed that &quot;60% think the governor should resign. 34% feel he should remain in office.&quot;

====Impeachment proceedings====
On August 25, state representatives Nathan Ballentine and Gary Simrill met with Sanford and warned him that the state legislature would impeach him if he did not resign. Ballentine, an ally of Sanford&#x27;s, said afterward, &quot;I told him the writing is on the wall. ...he could put an end to it all, but if he doesn&#x27;t, members of the House will take things into their hands.&quot; Sanford still declined to resign.

On August 28, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reported that Republican lawmakers in South Carolina were &quot;laying plans&quot; for a special legislative session on whether to impeach Sanford. Two bills of impeachment were being prepared, with bipartisan support in the state legislature.

On October 23, 2009, two impeachment resolutions were introduced, but were blocked by Democrats in the South Carolina legislature. A month later, the resolution was successfully introduced and it was announced that an &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee would begin drafting articles of impeachment starting on November 24. Meanwhile, the Ethics Commission formally charged Sanford with 37 violations.

On December 3, during its third public hearing on the matter, the &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee unanimously voted to remove the vast majority of charges from the investigation, stating that they did not warrant &quot;overturning an election.&quot; On December 9, the committee voted 6–1 against impeachment, stating that the legislature had better things to do.

====Censure====
On December 15, 2009, the South Carolina House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to censure Sanford. The full South Carolina House of Representatives passed the resolution by a vote of 102–11 in January 2010.

====Other fallout from scandal====
Sanford resigned as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association following the disclosure of his affair. He was swiftly succeeded by Mississippi governor Haley Barbour. In a June 29 email to members of his political action committee, Sanford said he had no intention of resigning as governor.

After his affair was revealed in June 2009, Sanford said: &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public money were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness. To be very clear: no public money was ever used in connection with this.&quot; After a Freedom of Information Act request was filed, Sanford eventually chose to reimburse taxpayers for expenses he had incurred one year earlier with his mistress in Argentina. He said, &quot;I made a mistake while I was there in meeting with the woman who I was unfaithful to my wife with. That has raised some very legitimate concerns and questions, and as such, I am going to reimburse the state for the full cost of the Argentina leg of this trip.&quot; On August 9, 2009, the AP reported that Sanford may have violated state law by other inappropriate use of state planes, including using a state plane to get a haircut.

After telling &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine that her husband was having a &quot;midlife crisis,&quot; Sanford&#x27;s wife, Jenny Sanford, moved out of the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion with the couple&#x27;s four sons, returning to the family home on Sullivan’s Island. On December 11, 2009, she announced that she was filing for divorce, calling it a &quot;sad and painful process.&quot; The divorce was finalized in March 2010. A stipulation within the divorce papers required that while on the Sanford family&#x27;s Coosaw plantation, &quot;no airplanes will be flown at children.&quot; The papers also noted that Sanford liked to &quot;unwind&quot; by digging holes on the property with his hydraulic excavator.

In August 2012, Sanford became engaged to Chapur. The engagement was subsequently broken off in September 2014.

In September 2014, Mark and Jenny Sanford agreed on mediation over an argument arising from their divorce. Jenny Sanford unsuccessfully petitioned the judge to require that Sanford undergo a psychiatric exam and take parenting and anger management classes. Judge Daniel Martin Jr. ordered the parties to take the issues to mediation within 30 days.

===Veto record===
During his 2003-2011 gubernatorial term, Sanford vetoed 278 bills, 213 (77%) of which were overridden by the legislature.

==Hiatus from politics (2011–2012)==

Following completion of his term as governor in January 2011, Sanford moved to his family farm in Beaufort County, South Carolina, and later moved to a condominium in Charleston, South Carolina. He has described this as a very quiet and spiritual time, and developed a Buddhist/Christian life approach including a daily quiet time, practicing mindfulness, and emphasizing everyone&#x27;s &#x27;shared human experience.&#x27;

In October 2011, Sanford was hired as a paid political contributor for Fox News Channel.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2019)==
===Elections===
====2013 special election====

In December 2012, CNN reported that Sanford was considering a bid to retake his congressional seat. The previous holder, fellow Republican Tim Scott, had been appointed to the United States Senate by Governor Nikki Haley after the resignation of Senator Jim DeMint. On December 22, 2012, Sanford sent an email to supporters, confirming rumors that he intended to run for Congress in 2013.

During his prior years as a representative on Capitol Hill, he was often identified as an ally of libertarian/conservative Ron Paul while they served in the House together.

Sanford formally launched his bid for Congress in early 2013. He quickly became a front-runner in a crowded field of 16 Republican candidates, because of his name recognition. On April 2, 2013, Sanford won his Republican House primary runoff against Curtis Bostic, a former Charleston County Councilman.

On April 17, 2013, the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled support from the Sanford campaign in the wake of revelations that Jenny Sanford had filed a trespassing complaint against him on February 4. According to the complaint, Jenny Sanford had caught her former husband sneaking out of her home in Sullivan&#x27;s Island, without her knowledge of his presence, using his cellphone as a flashlight. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, neither Mark nor Jenny Sanford may come to the other&#x27;s house without permission—a condition Jenny Sanford alleged that Mark Sanford had flouted on numerous occasions despite Jenny Sanford filing a &quot;no trespass&quot; letter with the Sullivan&#x27;s Island Police Department. In a statement, Mark Sanford admitted that he had gone to the house to watch the second half of Super Bowl XLVII with his son. He claimed to have tried to contact Jenny beforehand but was unable to do so. Jenny Sanford filed the complaint the next morning. Several Republican operatives said that they were upset Sanford had known about this complaint for some time and failed to disclose it.

Sanford was endorsed by FreedomWorks, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, U.S. representative and House speaker John Boehner, state senator Tom Davis, former South Carolina state treasurer Thomas Ravenel, perennial candidate Ben Frasier, former U.S. representative from Texas Ron Paul, and U.S. senator from Kentucky Rand Paul. On May 1, 2013, U.S. senator and former U.S. representative Tim Scott and U.S. senator Lindsey Graham endorsed Sanford. Pornographer Larry Flynt also endorsed him, saying &quot;His open embrace of his mistress in the name of love, breaking his sacred marriage vows, was an act of bravery that has drawn my support.&quot;

On May 7, 2013, Sanford was once again elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 54.04% of the vote, defeating economist and author Elizabeth Colbert Busch.

====2014====
Sanford was unopposed for re-election in 2014.

====2016====
In 2016, Sanford was renominated by the Republican Party for another Congressional term, defeating his sole primary opponent, state representative Jenny Horne, with 55.61% of the vote, and in the November general election was re-elected by a margin of 58.56% to a total of 36.83% for his major opponent, Dimitri Cherry, who was nominated on the lines of the Democratic, Working Families and Green Parties, as South Carolina is one of the states practicing electoral fusion. (Other candidates received approximately 4.6% of the vote.)

====2018====
Sanford was criticized by President Donald Trump via Twitter for being &quot;very unhelpful,&quot; and &quot;nothing but trouble&quot; hours before polls closed on the day of the June 12th Republican primary. Trump also endorsed state representative Katie Arrington as the Republican nominee for Sanford&#x27;s seat. Arrington defeated Sanford in the Republican primary by garnering 50.5% of the vote, to Sanford&#x27;s 46.5%. Sanford became the second Republican to lose renomination to the House of Representatives in the 2018 election cycle.

After his loss, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mark Sanford of South Carolina found out the hard way, in his surprise primary defeat&quot; that &quot;having a conservative voting record is less important than demonstrating total loyalty to Mr. Trump.&quot; On November 6, 2018, Democrat Joe Cunningham was elected as his successor, defeating Arrington in an upset election. Sanford became a teaching fellow at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics after the 2018 election.

===Tenure===
Sanford was sworn in on May 15, 2013.

On June 5, 2014, Sanford introduced the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4803; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the data and methods that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses to classify personnel as law enforcement officers and to reclassify, as necessary, any staff of the Office of Inspection that are currently misclassified according to the results of that review. Sanford said that &quot;even though there are federal standards in place that lay out how employees qualify for higher wages, the Transportation Security Administration pays some of their employees more for jobs they&#x27;re not doing. That wouldn&#x27;t make sense anywhere outside of government and our bill would help fix that problem by clarifying those employees&#x27; responsibilities.&quot; According to Sanford, accurately reclassifying employees who do not spent at least 50 percent of the time on law enforcement activities and putting them on an accurate pay scale would save the government $17 million a year.

Sanford posted lengthy remarks on his Facebook page on September 12, 2014, regarding Jenny Sanford&#x27;s &quot;legal machinations surrounding the custody of their children.&quot; His remarks on Facebook on that date were longer than the total of all his 2014 speeches on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Despite the fact that Sanford supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, he became &quot;one of the president&#x27;s most eloquent critics&quot; early in Trump&#x27;s tenure, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. According to NPR, &quot;Sanford hasn&#x27;t been shy at voicing his disgust with Trump and his distaste for the president&#x27;s brash style of politics and frequent bending of the truth.&quot; In a February 2017 interview, Sanford said that Trump &quot;at some level... represents the antithesis, or the undoing, of everything I thought I knew about politics, preparation and life.&quot; According to an analysis by &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, only four Republican House members voted less frequently with Trump than Sanford.

Sanford criticized President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods were devised. He stated that &quot;I&#x27;m hearing a voice of concern that things are moving from weird to reckless in their view. And that even if you&#x27;re going to enact this policy, the way in which it was done just seems bizarre.&quot; In early 2017, Sanford signed a letter urging Congress to request Donald Trump&#x27;s tax returns so that they could be reviewed in a closed session of Congress to determine whether they could be released to the public. In his 2018 re-election campaign ads, Sanford boasted of having voted with the president &quot;89 percent of the time.&quot; He also expressed support for Trump&#x27;s wall on the US-Mexico border.

On May 4, 2017, Sanford voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act.

==Involvement in presidential elections==
===2008===
In 2006, before the midterm elections, some commentators discussed the possibility of Sanford running for president. He said that he would not run, and claimed that his re-election bid would be his last election, win or lose. After Super Tuesday in 2008, Sanford received some mention as a potential running mate for the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, John McCain. Sanford publicly aligned himself with McCain in a March 15, 2008, piece in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Likening the presidential race to a football game at halftime, Sanford noted that he &quot;sat out the first half, not endorsing a candidate...But I&#x27;m now stepping onto the field and going to work to help John McCain. It&#x27;s important that conservatives do the same.&quot;

On January 11, 2008, shortly before the South Carolina presidential primaries (R Jan 19, D Jan 26), Sanford published a guest column in the Columbia newspaper &quot;The State&quot;. In the article, &quot;Obama&#x27;s Symbolism Here&quot;, Sanford wrote, &quot;I won&#x27;t be voting for Barack Obama for president&quot;, but noted the &quot;historical burden&quot; borne by South Carolinians on the topic of race. He advised voters in South Carolina to take note of the symbolism of Obama&#x27;s early success, with the knowledge that South Carolina was a segregated state less than fifty years earlier, and discouraged voting either for or against Obama on the basis of his race.

On a January 18, 2008 interview with CNN&#x27;s Wolf Blitzer, Sanford discussed his Obama article. Wolf Blitzer asked, &quot;Give us your mind-set. Why did you think it was so important to write this piece right now at this critical moment?&quot; Sanford responded, &quot;Well, it plays into a larger conversation that we&#x27;re having as a family of South Carolinians on, in fact, the [constitutional] structure of our government.&quot; Blitzer also showed Sanford clips of recent comments made by John McCain and Mike Huckabee about the Confederate battle flag and asked Sanford, &quot;All right, two different positions, obviously. Who&#x27;s right in this?&quot; Sanford responded, &quot;Well, it depends who you talk to.&quot; Sanford elaborated that &quot;if you were to talk to the vast majority of South Carolinians, they would say that we do not need to be debating where the Confederate flag is or is not.&quot;

Sanford attracted derision in the liberal blogosphere and among pundits and analysts on the left for a gaffe during an interview with CNN&#x27;s Blitzer on July 13, 2008, when he had difficulty answering a question about differences between Senator McCain and incumbent President George W. Bush on economic policy. &quot;I&#x27;m drawing a blank, and I hate when I do that, especially on television&quot;, joked Sanford.

===2012===
As early as January 2008, there had been anticipation that Sanford would run for President in 2012, and online support groups had sprung up on social networks like Facebook for a Sanford ticket.

At the time, the governor neither ruled out nor expressly hinted at a run. Further boosting Sanford&#x27;s profile in advance of a potential candidacy, he was elected as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2008 and was cited by Michael S. Steele, the chairman of the Republican Party as one of four &quot;rising stars&quot; in the GOP (alongside governors Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Sarah Palin of Alaska) in February 2009. Sanford also received early support for a presidential run from the Republican Liberty Caucus.

On February 22, 2009, Sanford declined to rule out a possible presidential bid in 2012, though he professed to have no current plans to run for national office.

&quot;Washington Post&quot; blogger Chris Cillizza said that the revelation of the extramarital affair in June 2009 ended Sanford&#x27;s chances of being a serious candidate in 2012.

On January 4, 2010, Sanford stated, &quot;If there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s abundantly clear, it&#x27;s that I ain&#x27;t running for president,&quot; and indicated that he would enter the private sector after his last 11 months as governor.

===2016===
Sanford endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

===2020 presidential campaign===

On July 16, 2019, Sanford confirmed that he was interested in challenging Trump for the presidency in 2020, citing &quot;his alarm over the nation&#x27;s finances&quot; as a reason for doing so. He said he would decide on a potential candidacy by September 2, 2019, but postponed it at the last minute because of Hurricane Dorian. On September 8, 2019, he formally launched his campaign and declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;.

On November 12, 2019, Sanford announced that he was suspending his campaign.
