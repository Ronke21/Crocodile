<text>The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement ( , , also called Völkism) was a Pan-German ethno-nationalist movement active from the late 19th century through the dissolution of the Third Reich in 1945, with remnants in the Federal Republic of Germany afterwards. Erected on the idea of &quot;blood and soil&quot;, inspired by the one-body-metaphor (&quot;Volkskörper&quot;, &quot;ethnic body&quot;; literally &quot;body of the people&quot;), and by the idea of naturally grown communities in unity, it was characterized by organicism, racialism, populism, agrarianism, romantic nationalism and – as a consequence of a growing exclusive and ethnic connotation – by antisemitism from the 1900s onward. &quot;Völkisch&quot; nationalists generally considered the Jews to be an &quot;alien people&quot; who belonged to a different &quot;Volk&quot; (&quot;race&quot; or &quot;folk&quot;) from the Germans.

The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement was not a homogeneous set of beliefs, but rather a &quot;variegated sub-culture&quot; that rose in opposition to the socio-cultural changes of modernity. The &quot;only denominator common&quot; to all &quot;Völkisch&quot; theorists was the idea of a national rebirth, inspired by the traditions of the Ancient Germans which had been &quot;reconstructed&quot; on a romantic basis by the adherents of the movement. This proposed rebirth entailed either &quot;Germanizing&quot; Christianity or the comprehensive rejection of Christian heritage in favor of a reconstituted pre-Christian Germanic paganism. In a narrow definition, the term is used to designate only groups that consider human beings essentially preformed by blood, or by inherited characteristics.

The &quot;Völkischen&quot; are often encompassed in a wider Conservative Revolution by scholars, a German national conservative movement that rose in prominence during the Weimar Republic (1918–1933). During the period of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis believed in and enforced a definition of the German &quot;Volk&quot; which excluded Jews, the Romani people, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, homosexuals, and other &quot;foreign elements&quot; living in Germany. Their policies led to these &quot;undesirables&quot; being rounded up and murdered in large numbers, in what became known as the Holocaust.

== Translation ==
The adjective &quot;Völkisch&quot; () is derived from the German word &quot;Volk&quot; (cognate with the English &quot;folk&quot;), which has overtones of &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;race&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot;. While &quot;Völkisch&quot; has no direct English equivalent, it could be loosely translated as &quot;ethno-nationalist&quot;, &quot;ethnic-chauvinist&quot;, &quot;ethnic-popular&quot;, or, closer to its original meaning, as &quot;bio-mystical racialist&quot;.

If &quot;Völkisch&quot; writers used terms like &quot;Nordische Rasse&quot; (&quot;Nordic race&quot;) and &quot;Germanentum&quot; (&quot;Germanic peoples&quot;), their concept of &quot;Volk&quot; could, however, also be more flexible, and understood as a &quot;Gemeinsame Sprache&quot; (&quot;common language&quot;), or as an &quot;Ausdruck einer Landschaftsseele&quot; (&quot;expression of a landscape&#x27;s soul&quot;), in the words of geographer Ewald Banse.

The defining idea which the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement revolved around was that of a &quot;Volkstum&quot;, literally the &quot;folkdom&quot; or the &quot;culture of the &quot;Volk&quot;&quot;. Other associated German words include &quot;Volksboden&quot; (the &quot;Volk&#x27;s essential substrate&quot;), &quot;Volksgeist&quot; (the &quot;spirit of the &quot;Volk&quot;&quot;), &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (the &quot;community of the &quot;Volk&quot;&quot;), as well as &quot;Volkstümlich&quot; (&quot;folksy&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot;) and &quot;Volkstümlichkeit&quot; (the &quot;popular celebration of the &quot;Volkstum&quot;&quot;).

== Definition ==
The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement was not unified but rather, according to Petteri Pietikäinen, &quot;a cauldron of beliefs, fears and hopes that found expression in various movements and were often articulated in an emotional tone&quot;. According to historian Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, &quot;Völkisch&quot; denoted the &quot;national collectivity inspired by a common creative energy, feelings and sense of individuality. These metaphysical qualities were supposed to define the unique cultural essence of the German people.&quot; Journalist Peter Ross Range writes that &quot;&quot;Völkisch&quot; is very hard to define and almost untranslatable into English. The word has been rendered as popular, populist, people&#x27;s, racial, racist, ethnic-chauvinist, nationalistic, communitarian (for Germans only), conservative, traditional, Nordic, romantic – and it means, in fact, all of those. The &quot;völkisch&quot; political ideology ranged from a sense of German superiority to a spiritual resistance to &#x27;the evils of industrialization and the atomization of modern man,&#x27; wrote military historian David Jablonsky. But its central component, said Harold J. Gordon, was always racism.

&quot;Völkisch&quot; thinkers tended to idealize the myth of an &quot;original nation&quot;, that still could be found at that time in the rural regions of Germany, a form of &quot;primitive democracy freely subjected to their natural elites.&quot; The notion of &quot;people&quot; (&quot;Volk&quot;) subsequently turned into the idea of a &quot;racial essence&quot;, and &quot;Völkisch&quot; thinkers referred to the term as a birth-giving and quasi-eternal entity—in the same way as they would write on &quot;the Nature&quot;—rather than a sociological category.

The movement combined sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore, local history and a &quot;back-to-the-land&quot; anti-urban populism. &quot;In part this ideology was a revolt against modernity&quot;, Nicholls remarked. As they sought to overcome what they felt was the malaise of a scientistic and rationalistic modernity, &quot;Völkisch&quot; authors imagined a spiritual solution in a &quot;Volk&quot;″s essence perceived as authentic, intuitive, even &quot;primitive&quot;, in the sense of an alignment with a primordial and cosmic order.

== History ==
=== Origins in the 19th century ===
The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement emerged in the late 19th century, drawing inspiration from German Romanticism and the history of the Holy Roman Empire, and what many saw as its harmonious hierarchical order. The delayed unification of the German-speaking peoples under a single German Reich in the 19th century is cited as conducive to the emergence of the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement. The Volk were convinced that they were renouncing the ideals of the Enlightenment. 

Despite the previous lower-class connotation associated to the word &quot;Volk&quot;, the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement saw the term with a noble overtone suggesting a German ascendancy over other peoples. Thinkers led by Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), Ludwig Woltmann (1871–1907) and Alexis Carrel (1873–1944) were inspired by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in advocating a &quot;race struggle&quot; and a hygienist vision of the world. They had conceptualized a racialist and hierarchical definition of the peoples of the world where Aryans (or Germans) had to be at the summit of the white race. The purity of the bio-mystical and primordial nation theorized by the &quot;Völkisch&quot; thinkers then began to be seen as having been corrupted by foreign elements, Jewish in particular.

=== Before World War I ===
The same word &quot;Volk&quot; was used as a flag for new forms of ethnic nationalism, as well as by international socialist parties as a synonym for the proletariat in the German lands. From the left, elements of the folk-culture spread to the parties of the middle classes.

Although the primary interest of the Germanic mystical movement was the revival of native pagan traditions and customs (often set in the context of a quasi-theosophical esotericism), a marked preoccupation with purity of race came to motivate its more politically oriented offshoots, such as the &quot;Germanenorden&quot; (the Germanic or Teutonic Order), a secret society founded at Berlin in 1912 which required its candidates to prove that they had no &quot;non-Aryan&quot; bloodlines and required from each a promise to maintain purity of his stock in marriage. Local groups of the sect met to celebrate the summer solstice, an important neopagan festivity in &quot;völkisch&quot; circles (and later in Nazi Germany), and more regularly to read the Eddas as well as some of the German mystics.

Not all folkloric societies with connections to Romantic nationalism were located in Germany. The &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement was a force as well in Austria. Meanwhile, the community of Monte Verità (&#x27;Mount Truth&#x27;) which emerged in 1900 at Ascona, Switzerland is described by the Swiss art critic Harald Szeemann as &quot;the southernmost outpost of a far-reaching Nordic lifestyle-reform, that is, alternative movement&quot;.

=== Weimar Republic ===
The political agitation and uncertainty that followed World War I nourished a fertile background for the renewed success of various &quot;Völkisch&quot; sects that were abundant in Berlin at the time, but if the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement became significant by the number of groups during the Weimar Republic, they were not so by the number of adherents. A few &quot;Völkische&quot; authors tried to revive what they believed to be a true German faith (&quot;Deutschglaube&quot;), by resurrecting the cult of the ancient Germanic gods. Various occult movements such as ariosophy were connected to &quot;Völkisch&quot; theories, and artistic circles were largely present among the &quot;Völkischen&quot;, like the painters Ludwig Fahrenkrog (1867–1952) and Fidus (1868–1948). By May 1924, essayist Wilhelm Stapel perceived the movement as capable of embracing and reconciling the whole nation: in his view, &quot;Völkisch&quot; had an idea to spread instead of a party programme and were led by heroes — not by &quot;calculating politicians&quot;. Scholar Petteri Pietikäinen also observed &quot;Völkisch&quot; influences on Carl Gustav Jung.

== Influence on Nazism ==

The &quot;völkisch&quot; ideologies were influential in the development of Nazism. Indeed, Joseph Goebbels publicly asserted in the 1927 Nuremberg rally that if the populist (&quot;völkisch&quot;) movement had understood power and how to bring thousands out in the streets, it would have gained political power on 9 November 1918 (the outbreak of the SPD-led German Revolution of 1918–1919, end of the German monarchy). Nazi racial understanding was couched in &quot;völkisch&quot; terms, as when Eugen Fischer delivered his inaugural address as Nazi rector, &quot;The Conception of the Völkisch state in the view of biology&quot; (29 July 1933). Karl Harrer, the Thule Society member most directly involved in the creation of the DAP in 1919, was sidelined at the end of the year when Hitler drafted regulations against conspiratorial circles, and the Thule Society was dissolved a few years later. The &quot;völkisch&quot; circles handed down one significant legacy to the Nazis: In 1919, Thule Society member Friedrich Krohn designed the original version of the Nazi swastika.

In January 1919, the Thule Society was instrumental in the foundation of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP), which later became the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP), commonly called the Nazi Party. Thule Society members or visiting guests of the Thule Society who would later join the Nazi Party included Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart and Karl Harrer. Notably, Adolf Hitler was never a member of the Thule Society and Rudolf Hess and Alfred Rosenberg were only visiting guests of the Thule Society in the early years before they came to prominence in the Nazi movement. After being appointed Chairman of the NSDAP in 1921, Hitler moved to sever the party&#x27;s link with the Thule Society, expelling Harrer in the process; the Society subsequently fell into decline and was dissolved in 1925.

== Modern usage in Heathenry ==

In Heathenry, the terms &quot;Völkisch,&quot; &quot;neo-völkisch,&quot; or the anglicisation &quot;folkish,&quot; are used both as endonyms and exonyms for groups that believe that the religion is intimately connected to a perceived biological race, which they often describe as &quot;Northern European,&quot; or more specific groupings such as &quot;English.&quot; These classifications are typically held to be self-evident by folkish Heathens, despite the academic consensus that race is a cultural construct. Folkish groups often use ethnonationalist language and maintain that only members of these racial groupings can legitimately adhere to the religion, holding the pseudoscientific view that &quot;gods and goddesses are encoded in the DNA of the descendants of the ancients.&quot;

In online media, folkish Heathens often express a belief in a threat from racial mixing, which is often blamed on the socio-political establishment, sometimes arguing their racial exclusivity is a result of the threat other ethnic groups pose to white people or due to explicit white supremacist ideologies. It has been noted that while the groups typically state an aim to revive Germanic paganism, their views regarding the centrality of race have origins instead in 19th-century thinking. The Odinic Rite states that while prevention of ethnic mixing was not a stance taken by heathens prior to Christianisation, it is needed now to maintain &quot;racial integrity&quot; and prevent &quot;crossed allegiances.&quot; The Odinic Rite and the Odinist Fellowship profess an apolitical stance, although academic Ethan Doyle White characterises their ideologies as the &quot;extreme right.&quot;

As of 2021, 32 neo-völkisch organizations in the United States are designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, with the largest being the Asatru Folk Assembly.

Active groups that are identified by scholars, institutions, or themselves openly include:
* Artgemeinschaft (Germany)
* Asatru Folk Assembly (United States)
* Odinia International (United States)
* Odinic Rite (United Kingdom, United States, Canada)
* Odinist Fellowship (United Kingdom)
* Vigrid (Norway)
* Woden&#x27;s Folk (United Kingdom)
* Wolves of Vinland (United States)
* Wotansvolk (United States)

Inactive groups that are identified by scholars, institutions, or themselves openly include:
* Heathen Front (Norway)

<text>The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World is a book by L. Fletcher Prouty, a former colonel in the US Air Force, first published by Prentice-Hall in 1973.

==Publication history==
After initial publication in 1973, Prentice-Hall republished &quot;The Secret Team&quot; in 1992 and 1997. The book was published again in 2008 and 2011 by Skyhorse Publishing, the latter edition including an introduction by Jesse Ventura.

The book was offered for sale by the Church of Scientology through their &quot;Freedom&quot; magazine, during the time when Prouty was a senior editor of the magazine.

==Reception==
In &quot;Studies in Intelligence,&quot; an official journal and flagship publication of the Central Intelligence Agency, Walter Pforzheimer described reading the book as &quot;like trying to push a penny with one&#x27;s nose through molten fudge.&quot; Despite what he grants as Prouty&#x27;s &quot;considerable background and knowledge,&quot; he says the book is punctuated by &quot;faulty recollections&quot; and &quot;unwarranted conclusions.&quot; In a later issue, a staff writer provides a retrospective of books reviewed in &quot;Studies in Intelligence&quot; and wonders aloud &quot;whether word ever got back to [Prouty].&quot;

&quot;Washington Monthly&quot; magazine noted that &quot;marvelous anecdotes about the CIA&#x27;s dirty-trick department are accompanied by a troubling overstatement best suggested by the subtitle, &quot;The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World.&quot;

Assassination researcher and former Office of Strategic Services officer Harold Weisberg was less than enthusiastic about Prouty&#x27;s book. He was particularly turned off by the claim that Daniel Ellsberg was a CIA agent: &quot;He hemmed and hawed a bit on this when confronted with an unequivocal denial made by E. to Fred Graham and to Prouty by phone. Thus he loses the legitimate point.&quot;

<doc id="460378" wikidata="Q504969" url="?curid=460378" title="Alessandro Moreschi">
<text>Alessandro Moreschi (11 November 1858 – 21 April 1922) was an Italian chorister of the late 19th century and the only castrato to make solo recordings.

==Early life==
Alessandro Moreschi was born on 11 November 1858 to Luigi Lorenzo Moreschi (1840–1897) and Rosa Maria Potelli, a Roman Catholic family in the town of Monte Compatri in the Papal States, near Frascati (Lazio). It is possible that he was born with an inguinal hernia, for which castration was still thought to be a cure in 19th-century Italy. Another possibility is that he was castrated later, around 1865, which would have been more in line with the centuries-old practice of castrating vocally talented boys well before puberty. In any case, much later in life, he referred to his enjoyment of singing as a boy in the chapel of the Madonna del Castagno, just outside his native town.

==Early career==

It seems likely that Moreschi&#x27;s singing abilities came to the notice of Nazareno Rosati, formerly a member of the Sistine Chapel choir, who was acting as a scout for new talent, and took him to Rome around 1870. Moreschi became a pupil at the Scuola di San Salvatore in Lauro, where he was taught by Gaetano Capocci, &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the Papal basilica of St John Lateran. In 1873, aged only fifteen, he was appointed First Soprano in the choir of that basilica, and also became a regular member of the groups of soloists hired by Capocci to sing in the &quot;salons&quot; of Roman high society. His singing at such &quot;soirées&quot; was vividly described by Anna Lillie de Hegermann-Lindencrone, the American wife of the Danish Ambassador to the Holy See:
In 1883, Capocci presented a special showcase for his &quot;protégé&quot;: the first performance in Italy of the oratorio &quot;Christus am Ölberge&quot; by Beethoven, in which Moreschi sang the demanding &quot;coloratura&quot; role of the Seraph. On the strength of this performance, he became known as &quot;l&#x27;Angelo di Roma&quot;, and shortly after, having been auditioned by all the members of the Sistine Chapel Choir, he was appointed First Soprano there, a post he held for the next thirty years.

==Sistine Chapel choir==

Moreschi&#x27;s Director at the Sistine was Domenico Mustafà, himself once a castrato soprano, who realised that Moreschi was, amongst other things, the only hope for the continuation of the Sistine tradition of performing the famous setting of the &quot;Miserere&quot; by Gregorio Allegri during Holy Week. When Moreschi joined the Sistine choir, there were still six other castrato members, but none of them was capable of sustaining this work&#x27;s taxing soprano &quot;tessitura&quot;. Moreschi&#x27;s talent occasionally led to &quot;behaviour [that] was often capricious enough to make him forget a proper professional bearing, as on the occasion after a concert when he paraded himself among the crowd like a peacock, with a long, white scarf, to be congratulated ...&quot;

The Sistine Chapel Choir was run on centuries old traditional lines with a strict system of hierarchies. In 1886, the senior castrato, Giovanni Cesari, retired, and it was probably then that Moreschi took over as &quot;Direttore dei concertisti&quot; (Director of soloists). In 1891 Moreschi took his turn as &quot;segretario puntatore&quot;, being responsible for the day-book of the choir&#x27;s activities, and the following year was appointed &quot;maestro pro tempore&quot;, a largely administrative post concerned with calling choir meetings, fixing rehearsals, granting leave of absence and the like. During this year, Alessandro was also responsible for overseeing the choir&#x27;s correct performance of its duties in the Sistine Chapel. Artistically speaking, the job involved choosing soloists and in developing repertoire. This period was one of disruption within the Sistine choir&#x27;s organisation as well as Catholic church music at large as the reforming movement known as Cecilianism, which had originated in Germany, began to influence Rome. Its calls for the Church&#x27;s music to return to the twin bases of Gregorian chant and the polyphony of Palestrina threatened both the repertoire and the practice of the Sistine Chapel. Mustafà also appointed Lorenzo Perosi as joint Perpetual Director, a 26-year-old priest from Tortona in Piedmont and a supporter of Cecilianism. Moreschi was a witness to the struggles between the two movements, but was also involved in secular matters: on 9 August 1900, at the express request of the Italian royal family, he sang at the funeral of the recently assassinated king, Umberto I, despite the Papacy still having no formal contact with the unified Italian secular state, which it regarded as a usurper.

In the spring of 1902, in the Vatican, Moreschi made the first of his recordings for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company of London. He made additional recordings in 1904 with seventeen tracks total. During this time, Mustafà retired in 1903 and a few months later Pope Leo XIII, a strong supporter of Sistine tradition, died. His successor was Pope Pius X, a powerful advocate of Cecilianism. Among the pontiff&#x27;s first official acts was the promulgation of the &quot;motu proprio&quot;, &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot; (&quot;Amidst the Cares&quot;) on St Cecilia&#x27;s Day, 22 November 1903, stating: &quot;Whenever ... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.&quot; Moreschi and his few remaining colleagues were to be pensioned and replaced by boys. 

Officially, Alessandro was a member of the Sistine choir until Easter 1913 (at which date he qualified for his pension after thirty years&#x27; service), and remained in the choir of the Cappella Giulia of St Peter&#x27;s, Rome until a year after. Around Easter 1914 he met Viennese musicologist Franz Haböck, author of &quot;Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst&quot; (The Castrati and their Art of Singing, published in Berlin in 1927), who had planned to cast Moreschi in concerts reviving the repertoire of the great eighteenth-century castrato Farinelli. However, Moreschi (now fifty-five years old) no longer had the required high soprano range, and had never had the necessary virtuoso operatic training.

==Retirement and death==
In retirement, Moreschi lived in an apartment at 19 Via Plinio near the Vatican, where he died at the age of 63, possibly of pneumonia. His funeral Mass was a large and public affair in the church of San Lorenzo in Damaso, and was conducted by Perosi, who, in spite of his antipathy towards castrati, felt a &quot;great friendship which bound them together&quot;. Moreschi was buried in the family vault in the Cimitero del Verano, the &quot;city of the dead&quot; not far from Rome&#x27;s Tiburtina station. His colleague Domenico Salvatori lies in the same tomb.

==Appearance and personality==
According to Haböck, &quot;Moreschi&#x27;s external appearance differs little from that usual for a singer. He is of medium or rather small stature. His likeable face is completely beardless; his chest remarkably broad and powerful. His speaking voice has a metallic quality, like a very high-speaking tenor. His voice and demeanour make a youthful impression, reinforced by his lively conversation, which add to the altogether charming picture that the singer presents.&quot;

==Recordings==
All of Moreschi&#x27;s recordings were made in Rome in two sets of recording sessions for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company. The first series of recordings was made on 3 and 5 April 1902 by Will and Fred Gaisberg. Eighteen usable sides by the members of the Sistine Chapel Choir were captured on wax, four of them solos by Moreschi. Decades later, Fred Gaisberg recalled making these historic first recordings in the Vatican: &quot;Selecting a great salon with walls covered with Titians, Raphaels, and Tintorettos, we mounted our grimy machine right in the middle of the floor.&quot; The second set of recordings was made in Rome in April 1904, under the direction of W. Sinkler Darby. CDs on the Opal and Pearl labels reproduce the recordings.

==Critical opinion==

Critical opinion is divided about Moreschi&#x27;s recordings, some say they are of little interest other than the novelty of preserving the voice of a castrato, and that Moreschi was a mediocre singer, while others detect the remains of a talented singer unfortunately past his prime by the time of recording, as Moreschi was in his mid-forties. Still, others feel that he was a very fine singer, and that much of the &quot;difficulty&quot; in listening to Moreschi&#x27;s recordings stems from changes in taste and singing style between times. His vocal technique can certainly seem to grate upon modern ears, but many of the seemingly imperfect vocal attacks, for example, are in fact grace notes, launched from as much as a tenth below the note – in Moreschi&#x27;s case, this seems to have been a long-standing means of drawing on the particular acoustics of the Sistine Chapel itself. The dated aesthetic of Moreschi&#x27;s singing, involving extreme passion and a perpetual type of sob, often sounds bizarre to the modern listener, and can be misinterpreted as technical weakness or symptomatic of an aging voice.

The standard of his recordings is certainly variable; Moreschi recorded two versions of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Crucifixus&quot;. In the first, Moreschi&#x27;s first side from his first recording session in 1902, he sings off key, and continues to do so for several bars. Whatever modern opinion may be of his recordings, the enthusiastic applause of his colleagues attests to their appreciation on at least one occasion, as can be heard at the end of his rendering of Tosti&#x27;s song &quot;Ideale&quot;.

The best-known piece Moreschi recorded is the Bach/Gounod &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (though the Sistine Chapel choir recorded Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Ave verum corpus&quot;, Moreschi&#x27;s voice is not individually audible).

<text>The Yukon New Democratic Party (YNDP; ) is a social democratic political party in the Yukon, Canada. It is the provincial section of the federal New Democratic Party.

The Yukon NDP first formed the government of the territory under the leadership of Tony Penikett from 1985 to 1992, and under the leadership of Piers McDonald from 1996 to 2000. The party&#x27;s current leader is Kate White. The NDP sat as official opposition to the current Yukon Party government in the Yukon Legislative Assembly until May 2006. In the 2006 Yukon election later that year, the three incumbent New Democrat Members of the Legislative Assembly were reelected, but the party failed to win any additional seats and remained in third place behind the five members of the Yukon Liberal Party and the ten member Yukon Party majority government.

In January 2009, the NDP were reduced to two seats: Todd Hardy (Whitehorse Centre) and Steve Cardiff (Mount Lorne), after the Party&#x27;s third member, John Edzerza, resigned to sit as an independent. Edzerza later rejoined the Yukon Party, for which he had originally been elected in the 2002 Yukon election.

Hardy died in July 2010, reducing the NDP to a single seat. On November 12, a by-election was called for his riding of Whitehorse Centre on December 13, which was won by the Party leader Hanson. Cardiff was killed in a car crash on July 7, 2011, again reducing the party to one seat in the legislature entering the 2011 election.

In the 2011 election, the Yukon NDP under Elizabeth Hanson elected six MLAs to form the territory&#x27;s Official Opposition. The NDP was the only party to see an increase in its share of the popular vote over the 2006 Yukon election. In the 2016 election, the NDP was reduced to two seats and third party status.

In May 2019, Kate White the incumbent MLA for Takhini-Kopper King was acclaimed as the new party leader, replacing Hanson. In the 2021 election, the Yukon NDP under White won three seats. On April 23, the incumbent Liberals were sworn in with a minority government. On April 28, the NDP announced that they had entered into a formal confidence and supply agreement with the Liberals.

<doc id="460395" wikidata="Q7343227" url="?curid=460395" title="Robert Crowley (CIA)">
<text>Robert Trumbull Crowley (July 13, 1924October 8, 2000) was an officer in the Central Intelligence Agency beginning in 1947, achieving the rank of assistant director for clandestine operations, second in command of the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations, which was in charge of covert operations.

A native of Chicago, Illinois and graduate of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, he served in the US Army in the Pacific theater during World War II. While at West Point, Crowley played for the Army Black Knights men&#x27;s soccer program, where he was an NSCAA First-Team All-American in 1948. After the war, he remained in the United States Army Reserve, retiring with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1986.

==&quot;The New KGB: Engine of Soviet Power&quot;==
Crowley co-authored &quot;The New KGB: Engine of Soviet Power&quot; with William R. Corson. Released in 1985, the book asserts that the KGB took control of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union. 

==Sources==
Crowley was a source for David Wise&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;Molehunt&quot;. Journalist, conspiracy theorist, forger, and holocaust denier Gregory Douglas claimed to have conducted a series of interviews with Crowley in 1993, later published in 2013 in his book &quot;Conversations with the Crow.&quot; Douglas wrote that Crowley euphemistically told him the CIA had assassinated Indian Prime Minister Shastri, as well as Indian nuclear scientist Homi Bhabha thirteen days apart in 1966 in order to thwart the Indian nuclear programme. The Indian media reported on these claims largely unquestioned.

<text>The Pinar del Río Province is one of the 15 provinces of Cuba. It is at the western end of the island of Cuba. The capital and largest city is Pinar del Río (191,081 pop. in 2022).

==Geography==
The Pinar del Río province is Cuba&#x27;s westernmost province and contains one of Cuba&#x27;s three main mountain ranges, the Cordillera de Guaniguanico, divided into the easterly Sierra del Rosario and the westerly Sierra de los Órganos. These form a landscape characterised by steep sided limestone hills (called mogotes) and flat, fertile valleys. One such topographic feature, the Viñales Valley, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The northern coast opens to the great Gulf of Mexico, and is lined by the Colorados Archipelago, a string of cays and isles developed on a reef barrier. The westernmost point of Cuba, Cabo San Antonio, is located on the Guanahacabibes Peninsula, which is a National Park and a Biosphere Reserve.

==History==
The city was founded by the Spanish as &quot;Nueva Filipinas&quot; (New Philippines) in response to an influx of Asian laborers coming from the Philippine Islands to work on tobacco plantations and the city was renamed Pinar del Río in 1774. The province was founded in 1879.

In 1851 the filibustering Lopez Expedition landed in the province in an effort to seize control of the island, but were defeated by the Spanish Army and their leaders executed.

==Economy==
Ever since tobacco was discovered by European colonists, the region has relied heavily on tobacco farming, with Pinar del Río producing 70% of Cuba&#x27;s crop, used to make the famed Cuban cigars that are so prized overseas. Tobacco is grown and harvested in the province, and shipped to Havana where they are rolled into cigars and exported. The best tobacco, used for more expensive cigar brands, is grown in the flat lands of San Juan y Martínez.

===Tourism===
Tourism is also an important part of the province&#x27;s economy. Though the town of Pinar del Río (the provincial capital) has some places of cultural and historical interest (such as the Cathedral of San Rosendo, a 19th-century construction), most attractions are to be found in rural or natural settings. A major destination is the Viñales Valley, a karstic depression located in the Sierra de los Organos, north of the town of Viñales. Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999 because of its natural beauty and the traditional agricultural techniques which continue to be used in the cultivation of tobacco and other crops there, the valley is a popular hiking and rock climbing location.

Many of the valley&#x27;s surrounding hills are dotted with caves which may be explored by visitors and spelunking has become another popular activity in the province (a particularly interesting cave is the Cueva de los Portales, beside the Río Caiguanabo, where Che Guevara set up his staff headquarters and dormitory as commander of the Western Army during the Cuban Missile Crisis).

Accommodations in and near Viñales have also grown in number in response to growing tourism in the region. In addition to &quot;casas particulares&quot; (licensed bed and breakfasts in private residences), there are a number of hotels some kilometers from the town.

Another major tourist destination in the province was Las Terrazas, a unique model village located 20 kilometer northeast of Soroa and, from 2011, part of the new Artemisa Province. Surrounded by mountains, the village was founded in 1971 as part of rural development and reforestation project which spans . As in other parts of the province, there are several hiking trails which weave through the surrounding mountains. Some companies offer guided hiking tours on a daily basis (in some areas, in fact, a guide is mandatory).

With around 30 diving sites, Pinar del Río is also considered one of Cuba&#x27;s premier scuba diving destinations. Cayo Levisa, about two kilometers offshore, is known for its copious black coral and excursions to this cay are afforded by tour agencies based in the province. Another hugely popular location is María la Gorda beach, which boasts many nearby dive sites (as close as from the beach).

An increasing number of tourists also visit the San Diego hot springs, in search of the health benefits reportedly afforded by the warm sulfur-rich waters there. An additional spectrum of health-related services has also become available at this spa, including massages and mud baths.

== Municipalities ==

&quot;Source: Population from 2022 estimates.&quot; &quot;Area from 1976 municipal re-distribution.&quot;

Until 2011 the municipalities of Bahía Honda, Candelaria and San Cristóbal were part of the province. After the split of La Habana Province into the new provinces of Artemisa and Mayabeque, the three &quot;municipios&quot; joined Artemisa.

<text>Bertram Wagstaff Mills (August 1873 – 16 April 1938) was a British circus owner originally from Paddington, London, who ran the Bertram Mills Circus. His circus became famous in the UK for its Christmas shows at Olympia in West London televised in 1938, 1946 and 1947. His troupe was the last to perform with live animals on the Drury Lane Theatre stage.

==Early life==
Born in August 1873, Bertram was the son of Halford Mills of Paddington, London, an undertaker and the owner of the Reformed Funeral Company, a coach-building works, and the &quot;Undertakers Journal&quot;. Halford Mills was described as a &quot;pioneer of embalming&quot;. Bertram was brought up on two small farms at Chalfont St. Giles (which his father owned for the purpose of sending his horses there to rest), where he developed his passion for horseback riding.

He left school aged 15 and started washing down the coaches for the family business, which was started by his grandfather (who used to be an evangelical preacher). Within a year, he was driving a four-in-hand from London to Oxford wearing a cornflower in his morning coat, for which he later became recognised.

== Career ==
He continued working for the family firm until the outbreak of World War I, when he joined and served with the Royal Army Medical Corps, rising to the rank of captain.

On leaving the army, he became interested in the &quot;Wilkins and Young Circus&quot;. He made a wager with a friend that he could form a circus company and within a year be as good as they were. He did just that, thus the &quot;Bertram Mills International Circus&quot; was formed.

The circus very quickly became a household name, and the annual Christmas event became especially well-known. He made a point of inviting orphans to see the shows free. By 1930 (its heyday would last for the next 30 years, when it was the best and most famous live show), he had inaugurated a touring circus, which became unique amongst British circuses, always appearing at Olympia for the Christmas season. VistaScreen released three different series of stereoviews featuring the circus.

The guest lists indicate the show&#x27;s renown; the royal family, who were great supporters, attended every year, and Winston Churchill and similar dignitaries were also annual guests.

== Personal life and family ==
Bertram Mills married his wife, Ethel (d. 1960), in 1901. They were parents of a daughter and two sons, Bernard Notley and Cyril Bertram Mills. After their father&#x27;s death on 16 April 1938 aged 64, both Bernard and Cyril took over running the Bertram Mills Circus, sustaining its success until the early 1960s, when it was finally disbanded due to widespread television viewing. Cyril Mills served with MI5 during World War II and was the spymaster who controlled Juan Pujol Garcia, codenamed &quot;Garbo&quot;.

Bertram Mills was cremated (his father had been one of the first three undertakers to offer this service in London) and is buried with his wife at Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England.

<doc id="460408" wikidata="Q640534" url="?curid=460408" title="Faisal–Weizmann agreement">
<text>The Faisal–Weizmann agreement was signed by Emir Faisal, the third son of Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi, King of the short-lived Kingdom of Hejaz, and Chaim Weizmann, President of the Zionist Organization on 3 January 1919. Signed two weeks before the start of the Paris Peace Conference, it was presented by the Zionist delegation alongside a March 1919 letter written by T. E. Lawrence in Faisal&#x27;s name to American Zionist leader Felix Frankfurter as two documents to argue that the Zionist plans for Palestine had prior approval of Arabs.

The agreement was presented to Faisal in his room at the Carlton Hotel on 3 January in English, which Faisal could not read, and its contents were translated and explained to Faisal by Lawrence. Faisal signed the document in the same meeting, without consulting his advisors awaiting him in a separate room, but added a caveat in Arabic next to his signature, such that Faisal considered the agreement as conditional on Palestine being within the area of Arab independence. The Zionist Organization submitted the agreement to the Paris Peace Conference without the caveat.

Israeli historian Yoav Gelber described the agreement as &quot;of propaganda value only&quot;, since it quickly became clear that Faisal&#x27;s conditions would not be met.

==Background: status of Palestine==
At the time the agreement was made, there had preceded it (apart from the Balfour Declaration) the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, the Sykes–Picot Agreement, the Hogarth message, the Bassett Letter, the Declaration to the Seven and the Anglo-French Declaration. Of these, the Sykes–Picot Agreement had been made public by the Bolsheviks and the Declaration to the Seven as well as the Anglo-French Declaration were also public documents. The Sykes–Picot Agreement had called for an &quot;Arab State or a Confederation of Arab States ... under the suzerainty of an Arab chief&quot;. The French and British also proposed an international administration in the &quot;brown area&quot; (an area including Jerusalem, similar to and smaller than Mandate Palestine), the form of which was to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other Allies, &quot;and the representatives of the Shereef of Mecca&quot;.

Henry McMahon had exchanged letters with Faisal&#x27;s father Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca in 1915, in which he had promised Hussein control of Arab lands with the exception of &quot;portions of Syria&quot; lying to the west of &quot;the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo&quot;. Palestine lies to the southwest of these areas and wasn&#x27;t explicitly mentioned. That modern-day Lebanese region of the Mediterranean coast was set aside as part of a future French Mandate. After the war the extent of the coastal exclusion was hotly disputed. Hussein had protested that the Arabs of Beirut would greatly oppose isolation from the Arab state or states, but did not bring up the matter of Jerusalem or Palestine. Between 1916 and 1920, the British government interpreted these commitments as including Palestine in the Arab area. However, in the 1922 Churchill White Paper they argued instead that Palestine had been excluded.

On the basis of McMahon&#x27;s assurances the Arab Revolt began on 5 June 1916. However, the British and French also secretly concluded the Sykes–Picot Agreement on 16 May 1916. This agreement divided many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas and allowed for the internationalisation of Palestine. Hussein learned of the agreement when it was leaked by the new Russian government in December 1917, but was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from Sir Reginald Wingate, High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British government&#x27;s commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.

Following the publication of the Balfour Declaration the British had dispatched Commander David George Hogarth to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing the message that the &quot;political and economic freedom&quot; of the Palestinian population was not in question. Hogarth reported that Hussein &quot;would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain&quot;. According to Isaiah Friedman, Hussein was not perturbed by the Balfour Declaration and on 23 March 1918, in &quot;Al Qibla&quot;, the daily newspaper of Mecca, attested that Palestine was &quot;a sacred and beloved homeland of its original sons&quot;, the Jews; &quot;the return of these exiles to their homeland will prove materially and spiritually an experimental school for their [Arab] brethren.&quot; He called on the Arab population in Palestine to welcome the Jews as brethren and cooperate with them for the common welfare. Whereas Kedourie (as well as Friedman) have argued that Hussein accepted the Balfour Declaration, Charles D.Smith has argued that both Friedman and Kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards in order to reach their conclusions. while Schneer says that historians have spilled oceans of ink tracing the initial reactions of Hussein and his sons to the Balfour Declaration without settling the debate, noting that Hussein considered Palestine to be Arab land.

Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British Declaration to the Seven and the Anglo-French Declaration, the latter promising &quot;the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations&quot;.

==Prelude to the agreement==

Weizmann first met Faisal in June 1918, during the British advance from the South against the Ottoman Empire in World War I. As leader of an impromptu &quot;Zionist Commission&quot;, Weizmann traveled to southern Transjordan for the meeting. Weizmann had assured Faisal that &quot;the Jews did not propose to set up a government of their own but wished to work under British protection, to colonize and develop Palestine without encroaching on any legitimate interests&quot;. Antonius commented in 1938 that: &quot;The combined effect of those assurances had been to induce in him a belief that there was nothing either in the Zionist aspirations as such or in the policy professed by the British Government in regard to their fulfilment that would interfere with Arab political and economic freedom in Palestine&quot;.

Weizmann&#x27;s intended purpose was to forge an agreement between Faisal and the Zionist movement to support an Arab Kingdom and Jewish settlement in Palestine, respectively. The wishes of the Palestinian Arabs were to be ignored, and, indeed, both men seem to have held the Palestinian Arabs in considerable disdain. In the event, Weizmann and Faisal established an informal agreement under which Faisal would support close Jewish settlement in Palestine while the Zionist movement would assist in the development of the vast Arab nation that Faisal hoped to establish.

After concerns were expressed by Cecil regarding draft proposals put forward by the Advisory Committee on Palestine (chaired by Herbert Samuel), Balfour suggested to Weizmann that &quot;it would be very helpful indeed if the Zionists and Feisal could act unitedly and reach an agreement on certain points of possible conflict.&quot; Weizmann and Faisal met again on 11 December 1918, while both were in London preparing their statements for the upcoming peace conference in Paris.

Three weeks prior to signing the agreement, on 12 December 1918, Faisal was quoted in &quot;The Times&quot;, in a piece which Ali Allawi writes was &quot;no doubt instigated by Lawrence and the Foreign Office&quot;:
The two main branches of the Semitic family, Arabs and Jews, understand one another, and I hope that as a result of interchange of ideas at the Peace Conference, which will be guided by ideals of self-determination and nationality, each nation will make definite progress towards the realization of its aspirations. Arabs are not jealous of Zionist Jews, and intend to give them fair play and the Zionist Jews have assured the Nationalist Arabs of their intention to see that they too have fair play in their respective areas. Turkish intrigue in Palestine has raised jealousy between the Jewish colonists and the local peasants, but the mutual understanding of the aims of Arabs and Jews will at once clear away the last trace of this former bitterness, which, indeed, had already practically disappeared before the war by the work of the Arab Secret Revolutionary Committee, which in Syria and elsewhere laid the foundation of the Arab military successes of the past two years.

Two days prior to the agreement, on 1 January 1919, Faisal&#x27;s delegation submitted a statement to the Peace Conference, and a further memorandum was submitted on 29 January. The statement referred to the goal to &quot;unite the Arabs eventually into one nation&quot;, defining the Arab areas as &quot;from a line Alexandretta – Persia southward to the Indian Ocean&quot; (1 January) or &quot;from the line Alexandretta – Diarbekr southward to the Indian Ocean&quot; (29 January). The latter memorandum described boundaries of any new states as &quot;matters for arrangement between us, after the wishes of their respective inhabitants have been ascertained&quot; in a reference to US President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s policy of self determination.

==Signing==
They signed the written agreement, which bears their names, on 3 January 1919. Faisal was not explicitly authorised by his father to enter into such an agreement, with his instructions from his father limited to the requirement that he accept only fulfilment of the previous British promises for Arab independence; the caveat was added as a result. The next day, Weizmann arrived in Paris to head the Zionist delegation to the Peace Conference.

=== Text of the agreement ===
Agreement Between Emir Feisal and Dr. Weizmann

3 January 1919

His Royal Highness the Emir Feisal, representing and acting on behalf of the Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz, and Dr. Chaim Weizmann, representing and acting on behalf of the Zionist Organization, mindful of the racial kinship and ancient bonds existing between the Arabs and the Jewish people, and realizing that the surest means of working out the consummation of their natural aspirations is through the closest possible collaboration in the development of the Arab State and Palestine, and being desirous further of confirming the good understanding which exists between them, have agreed upon the following:

Articles:

Given under our hand at London, England, the third day of January, one thousand nine hundred and nineteen

Chaim Weizmann Feisal Ibn-Hussein

=== Main points of the agreement ===
* The agreement committed both parties to conducting all relations between the groups by the most cordial goodwill and understanding, to work together to encourage immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale while protecting the rights of the Arab peasants and tenant farmers, and to safeguard the free practice of religious observances. The Muslim Holy Places were to be under Muslim control.
* The Zionist movement undertook to assist the Arab residents of Palestine and the future Arab state to develop their natural resources and establish a growing economy.
* The boundaries between an Arab State and Palestine should be determined by a Commission after the Paris Peace Conference.
* The parties committed to carrying into effect the Balfour Declaration of 1917, calling for a Jewish national home in Palestine.
* Disputes were to be submitted to the British Government for arbitration.

Weizmann signed the agreement on behalf of the Zionist Organization, while Faisal signed on behalf of the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz.

===Faisal&#x27;s caveat===
Faisal conditioned his acceptance on the fulfillment of British wartime promises to the Arabs, who had hoped for independence in a vast part of the Ottoman Empire. He appended to the typed document a hand-written statement, next to which Lawrence added a slightly inaccurate translation:

The date of 4 January referred to in the caveat is either a mistake or refers to a document unknown to historians. Allawi interprets Faisal as referring to his memorandum submitted on 1 January.

==Subsequent discussions==
===Paris Peace Conference===
Faisal submitted his written proposals to the Conference on 27 January. A draft memorandum that Lawrence had brought at Faisal&#x27;s request to Stephen Bonsal of the American delegation shortly after the Zionists had made their initial presentation, according to Bonsal&#x27;s memoirs, stated very different views from the agreement with Weizmann:
If the views of the radical Zionists, as presented to the Peace Conference, should prevail, the result will be a ferment, chronic unrest, and sooner or later civil war in Palestine. But I hope I will not be misunderstood. I assert that we Arabs have none of the racial or religious animosity against the Jews which unfortunately prevail in many other regions of the world. I assert that with the Jews who have been seated for some generations in Palestine our relations are excellent. But the new arrivals exhibit very different qualities from those &quot;old settlers&quot; as we call them, with whom we have been able to live and even co-operate on friendly terms. For want of a better word I must say that new colonists almost without exception have come in an imperialistic spirit. They say that too long we have been in control of their homeland taken from them by brute force in the Dark Ages, but that now under the new world order we must clear out; and if we are wise we should do so peaceably without making any resistance to what is the fiat of the civilised world.

Faisal made his appearance before the Supreme Council on 6 February and, in a further sign that his Zionist sympathy might be wavering, suggested that &quot;Palestine, in consequence of its universal character, be left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned&quot;.

The Zionists written submission was made on 3 February with their appearance before the Supreme Council on 27 February.

===&quot;Le Matin&quot; interview===
A 1 March interview by &quot;Le Matin&quot; quoted Faisal as saying:
This feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about Palestine, our neighbor. That the unhappy Jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country, our humanity rejoices given that they are placed under a Muslim or Christian government mandated by The League of Nations. If they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region, I foresee very serious dangers. It is to be feared that there will be a conflict between them and the other races. 

===Frankfurter correspondence===

Although Allawi states that Faisal had been misquoted he says that the &quot;Le Matin&quot; interview resulted in difficulties with the Zionists leading to a meeting between Faisal and Frankfurter followed by Lawrence drafting of a letter to Felix Frankfurter, President of the Zionist Organization of America, on 3 March 1919, signed by Faisal:
&quot;The Arabs, especially the educated among us, look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our deputation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist Organization to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper.&quot;
Frankfurter replied on 5 March &quot;..These aims are now before the Peace Conference as definite proposals by the Zionist Organisation. We are happy indeed that you consider these proposals &#x27;moderate and proper,&#x27; and that we have in you a staunch supporter for their realisation.&quot;

====Controversy====
When the letter was tabled at the Shaw Commission in 1929, Rustam Haidar spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had &quot;no recollection that he wrote anything of the sort&quot;. In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: &quot;finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country&quot;. Awni Abd al-Hadi, Faisal&#x27;s secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: &quot;I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe this letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion.&quot; According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its &quot;contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then may or may not have been induced to sign it&quot;, since it ran counter to Faisal&#x27;s other public and private statements at the time.

Mack notes that Frankfurter reprinted the letter in the October 1930 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; Monthly, vouched for its authenticity, commenting &quot;Prince Feisal&#x27;s letter was a document prepared under the most responsible conditions&quot; and that although Faisal objected to interpretations that understood his letter to mean consent to Zionist policy, he did not disavow its authorship.

==Failure of the agreement==
===Syrian National Congress and Kingdom of Syria===

In October 1918, British and Arab forces had captured Damascus during the Arab Revolt and Faisal formed a government. In May 1919, elections were held for the Syrian National Congress. On 2 July 1919 the Congress in a memorandum presented to the King-Crane Commission completely opposed any migration to Palestine and the latter not to be separated from Syria. According to C.D. Smith, the Syrian National Congress had forced Faisal to back away from his tentative support of Zionist goals. At this point, the agreement could be seen as a dead letter. On 7 March 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of Arab Kingdom of Syria (Greater Syria).

In April 1920, the San Remo conference gave France the mandate for Syria, which led to the Franco-Syrian War. In the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920, the French were victorious and Faisal was expelled from Syria after which he contended that the conditions he appended were not fulfilled and the agreement therefore moot. According to contemporaries, including Gertrude Bell and Lawrence, the French, with British support, betrayed Faisal and the Arab cause rendering the treaty invalid.

===Hussein&#x27;s views===
St. John Philby, a British representative in Palestine, later stated that Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca and King of Hejaz, on whose behalf Faisal was acting, had refused to recognize the agreement as soon as it was brought to his notice.

==Disclosure of the agreement==
The agreement was first disclosed to the public in 1936.

It was noted by UNSCOP that &quot;To many observers at the time, conclusion of the Feisal-Weizmann agreement promised well for the future co-operation of Arab and Jew in Palestine&quot;, and further referring to the 1937 report of the Palestine Royal Commission which noted that &quot;Not once since 1919 had any Arab leader said that co-operation with the Jews was even possible&quot; despite expressed hopes to the contrary by British and Zionist representatives.
UNSCOP did not regard the agreement as ever being valid, although Weizmann asserted that the treaty should be considered valid while at the same time agreeing that Faisal had the right to void it after losing Syria to the French.

<text>Matanzas () is one of the provinces of Cuba. Major towns in the province include Cárdenas, Colón, Jovellanos and the capital of the same name, Matanzas. The resort town of Varadero is also located in this province.

Among Cuban provinces, Matanzas is one of the most industrialized, with petroleum wells, refineries, supertanker facilities, and 21 sugar mills to process the harvests of the fields of sugarcane in the province.

==Geography==
The second largest in Cuba, Matanzas province is largely flat, with its highest point (Pan de Matanzas) at only 380m above sea level.

The north-western coast is largely rocky, with a few beaches, while the north-eastern coast has numerous small cays of its coast (part of Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago), and scrubland and mangroves near the shoreline. Cuba&#x27;s northernmost point is located in on Hicacos Peninsula.

The southern coast has one of Cuba&#x27;s most distinctive features: an enormous marsh, Ciénaga de Zapata that covers both the southern part of the province and the Zapata Peninsula. East of the peninsula lies the Bay of Pigs, the site of the failed US backed invasion.

== Municipalities ==
From 1976 to 2010 Matanzas was sub-divided into 14 municipalities.
Starting from 2011, the municipality of Varadero was abolished and merged to Cárdenas. Thus Matanzas now has 13 municipalities.

<text>Cienfuegos () is one of the provinces of Cuba. The capital city of the province is also called Cienfuegos and was founded by French settlers in 1819.

==Overview==

Until 2011, Cienfuegos was the smallest province in Cuba (excluding the city of Havana and the Isla de la Juventud) with an economy almost entirely dedicated to the growing and processing of sugar. Sugar mills and sugarcane plantations dot the landscape. There are waterfalls in the sierra of the province.

Scuba diving off Cienfuegos province is extremely popular both with tourists and locals. There are numerous underwater caves, and well over 50 dive sites in the province.

The provinces of Cienfuegos, Sancti Spíritus, and Villa Clara were once all part of the now defunct province of Santa Clara.

<text>Sancti Spíritus () is one of the provinces of Cuba. Its capital is the identically named Sancti Spíritus. Another major city is Trinidad.

==Geography==
The southern coast of the province is flat, but the western portion of Sancti Spíritus province is mountainous. The southeast has numerous mangroves and swamps. The northern coast contains significant wetlands and protected areas such as the Bay of Buena Vista and the Caguanes National Park.

The largest man-made reservoir in Cuba, the Embalse Zaza, is in Sancti Spíritus province.

==History==
During the 17th century, both Dutch and British pirates attempted to take control of what is today Sancti Spíritus province, but with little success, as the Spanish garrison held them off. From 1660 to 1680, Trinidad was plagued by pirates from Jamaica and Tortuga, and on two occasions, pirates razed the city.

The provinces of Cienfuegos, Sancti Spíritus, and Villa Clara were once all part of the now defunct province of Las Villas.

==Economy==

Tourism is a big earner for the province, with most of the tourism centered on the old city of Trinidad, a World Heritage-listed city which has dozens of colonial buildings (and almost no 20th-century architecture), dating back to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.

Francisco Iznaga, a Basque landowner in the western portion of Cuba during the first thirty years of the colonization of Cuba, was elected Mayor of Bayamo in 1540. Iznaga was the originator of a powerful lineage which finally settled in Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, the location of the Torre Iznaga. His descendants fought for the independence of Cuba and for annexation to the U.S., from 1820 to 1900.

In the area, as with most of Cuba, sugar cane and cattle are important commodities. Large surfaces are irrigated in the farmland between Zaza Reservoir, Zaza River, and Jatibonico River in La Sierpe region. Some tobacco and rice are also grown.

<text>Camagüey () is the largest of the provinces of Cuba. Its capital is Camagüey. Other towns include Florida and Nuevitas.

==Geography==
Camagüey is mostly low lying, with no major hills or mountain ranges passing through the province. Numerous large cays (including what used to be one of Fidel Castro&#x27;s favourite fishing spots; the Archipiélago Jardines de la Reina) characterize the southern coasts, while the northern coast is lined by Jardines del Rey of the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago.

Sandy beaches are found on both coasts also, and despite a large potential for tourism, the province has seen little development in that area with the exception of Santa Lucía beach, on the province&#x27;s North coast.

==Economy==
The economy of the Camagüey province is primarily cattle and sugar (in the north and south) farming, and the province is known for its cowboy culture, with rodeos frequently held. The capital city also has one of the few breweries on the island.

<text>Stephen Henry Lewis (born November 11, 1937) is a Canadian politician, public speaker, broadcaster, and diplomat. He was the leader of the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party for most of the 1970s.

During many of those years as leader, his father David Lewis was simultaneously the leader of the federal New Democratic Party. After politics, he became a broadcaster on both CBC Radio and Toronto&#x27;s Citytv. In the mid-1980s, he was appointed as Canada&#x27;s United Nations ambassador, by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He quit in 1988 and worked at various United Nations agencies during the 1990s. In the 2000s, he served a term as the United Nations&#x27; special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa. In 2003, he gained investiture into the Order of Canada. He was also a distinguished visiting professor at Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University).

==Early life and education==
Lewis was born in Ottawa, Ontario, on November 11, 1937, to Sophie Lewis (née Carson) and David Lewis. His parents gave him the Hebrew name &quot;Sholem&quot;, a Yiddish derivation of the Hebrew word &quot;shalom&quot;, which means peace, because he was born on Armistice Day. From the time he was born, and through his early childhood, his father was the national secretary of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the predecessor party to the NDP. When his family moved to Toronto in 1950, he attended secondary school first at Toronto&#x27;s Oakwood Collegiate Institute, and then his final three years of high school at Harbord Collegiate Institute. In 1956, he entered the University of Toronto (UofT) where he became a member of the Hart House debating committee, and on 14 November 1957, debated the senator and future American president, John F. Kennedy, on the question, &quot;Has the United States failed in its responsibilities as a world leader?&quot; The Senator narrowly beat the Hart House team 204–194. Lewis&#x27;s performance was considered the highlight of the event, while Kennedy&#x27;s was flat according to many members in the audience like John Brewin. He spent his third year of university at the University of British Columbia (UBC) before spending his final undergraduate year back at UofT, where he failed to write his final examinations. He went to law school twice in the early 1960s, dropping out of both UofT and UBC&#x27;s programs.

==Political career==
He left his studies in the 1960s and took up a clerical position with the Socialist International, where he received an invitation to a conference in Ghana. He attended, and instead of returning to Canada, spent more than a year working, traveling, and teaching in various places in Africa. He recalled in his 2005 Massey Lectures that the relatively brief sojourn would be a key influence on his life, especially after the turn of the new millennium.

He came back to Canada at the instigation of Tommy Douglas, and in 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of Donald C. MacDonald, Lewis was elected leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party. His initial experience at the helm in the 1971 provincial election was a disappointment, with the party slipping from 20 seats to 19.

A radical left wing group nicknamed The Waffle had gained prominence, with one of its leaders, James Laxer, winning one-third of the vote when he ran to be leader of the federal NDP in 1971. Lewis felt that The Waffle was threatening the credibility and stability of the party and supported a movement against the group in June 1972 on the basis that it was a &quot;party within a party&quot;.

In 1974, Lewis supported the Elliot Lake miners and advocated to Ontario Premier Bill Davis for the creation of the Royal Commission on the Health and Safety of Workers in Mines. The commission&#x27;s recommendations led to the creation of the &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Act&quot; in 1979.
Lewis led a strong campaign during the 1975 election with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted issues such as rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis told the story of a different Ontarian in trouble, making a case that this was because of the lack of adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in freefall and in the course of the campaign Premier William Davis was forced to commit his party to bringing in rent control and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a minority government. Lewis&#x27; NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the Ontario Liberal Party to become the Official Opposition. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.

The next election, in 1977, proved to be a disappointment. The growth of support for the NDP stalled, and while the Tories were kept to a minority, the NDP failed to make any gains. The party was reduced to 33 seats and lost its status as Official Opposition to the Liberals. In 1978, a frustrated Lewis stepped down as party leader and as a Member of Provincial Parliament.

After leaving politics, Lewis served as an arbitrator with the Ontario Ministry of Labour and was a commentator on TV station CITY-TV&#x27;s CityPulse News and CKEY radio in Toronto and appeared nationally with Dalton Camp and Eric Kierans as part of a weekly political panel on Peter Gzowski&#x27;s CBC Radio show, &quot;Morningside&quot;. He would return to the &quot;Morningside&quot; panel in the late 1980s. In 1982, Lewis won the Gordon Sinclair Award from ACTRA for his commentary on CKEY.

==Diplomatic and academic career==
After working for several years as a labour mediator, columnist and broadcaster, in 1984 Lewis was appointed Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Lewis served at the post until 1988.

From 1995 to 1999, Lewis was deputy director of UNICEF. From 2001 until 2006, he worked as United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa. In this role, he drew attention to the HIV/AIDS crisis and convinced leaders and the public that they have a responsibility to respond. He has been widely praised for his effectiveness in this role. In 2005 he adapted his Massey Lectures in a book titled &quot;Race Against Time&quot;, where he describes the disjuncture between what the international community promises and their actions in responding to the pandemic in Africa.

In May 2006, Lewis joined the Faculty of Social Sciences at McMaster University as a scholar-in-residence. Also in 2006, he was elected a senior fellow of Massey College in the University of Toronto. In 2009, Lewis strongly criticized Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s assertion that condom use only makes the AIDS crisis worse.

==Stephen Lewis Foundation==
Lewis is chair of the board of the Stephen Lewis Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps people affected and infected by HIV/AIDS in Africa.

In October 2009, to raise money for the foundation, Lewis helped with a campaign to dare Canadians to do something for Africa called A Dare to Remember. The campaign saw Lewis, along with musician k-os, Federal NDP leader Jack Layton, Olympic gold medalist Duff Gibson and many other Canadians, performing various dares for the event. He faced his own personal fears as part of the campaign, and sang live on CBC&#x27;s The Hour with the band the Arkells.

==AIDS-Free World==
In 2007, Stephen Lewis and long-time colleague Paula Donovan co-founded &quot;AIDS-Free World&quot;, a non-profit organization that advocates for more effective global responses to HIV and AIDS.

As a preventative HIV/AIDS strategy, Lewis has made a somewhat controversial call for male circumcision when African boys receive the first of two UN-administered measles vaccination shots, so that their recovery progress can be monitored at the time of the second vaccination. Many studies have been conducted into the role circumcision can play in reducing the spread of HIV.

==Personal==
Stephen Lewis is the son of former federal NDP leader David Lewis and the grandson of Moishe Lewis (1888–1950), an activist in the Jewish Bund in Russia and the Jewish Labour Committee in Montreal.

Lewis has three siblings. Two of them were active and high-ranking officials within the Ontario NDP during the 1980s and 1990s: Michael Lewis was the secretary, and Janet Solberg was the president. His second sister is Nina Lewis-Libeskind, the wife and partner of world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind.

Lewis is married to journalist Michele Landsberg. Their son is broadcaster Avi Lewis, who married journalist and author Naomi Klein. Their daughters are Ilana Naomi Landsberg-Lewis and Jenny Leah Lewis; Ilana serves as executive director of the Stephen Lewis Foundation.

In 2021, Lewis publicly revealed that he is undergoing experimental treatment for inoperable abdominal cancer, which recurred three years after surgery for an earlier occurrence of the disease.

==Honours==
For his humanitarian work in Africa and the United Nations, the governor general of Canada appointed Lewis a Companion of the Order of Canada on October 10, 2002. His investiture into the order was held on October 23, 2003. He delivered the annual Massey Lecture in 2005, and it was published in book form under the title &quot;Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa&quot;. The book consists of five lectures that depict the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, critically examining the international community&#x27;s passivity as a contributing factor.

In 2006, two new secondary schools in the Toronto area were named after Lewis: Stephen Lewis Secondary School in Mississauga and Stephen Lewis Secondary School in Vaughan. The Mississauga school has a focus on educating students on issues relating to social justice and global citizenship to enhance the Ontario Curriculum.

In 2007, Lewis received the World Citizenship Award from the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, as well as the Health and Human Rights Leadership Award from Doctors of the World-USA. Lewis was also invested as a Knight Commander of the Most Dignified Order of Moshoeshoe by King Letsie III of Lesotho.

In 2010, Forbes magazine, in conjunction with their 2010 list of &quot;World&#x27;s Most Powerful People&quot;, asked the feminist playwright Eve Ensler to identify Worlds&#x27; Most Powerful Feminists. She named Stephen Lewis as one of her top seven.

In 2013, The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto presented Stephen Lewis with the Bonham Centre Award, recognizing his contribution to the advancement and education of human rights issues surrounding sexual education.

Lewis has 33 honorary degrees, 32 from Canadian institutions. This is one of the largest number held by any Canadian.

Cattle are also grazed in the province.

== History ==
Las Tunas was part of the Oriente province, until that province was divided into five smaller provinces in 1975. 

In the same year, a large development program was started to modernize the town of Las Tunas and connect it by road to Havana.

<text>Holguín () is one of the provinces of Cuba, the third most populous after Havana and Santiago de Cuba. It lies in the southeast of the country. Its major cities include Holguín (the capital), Banes, Antilla, Mayarí, and Moa.

The province has a population of slightly over one million people. Its territory exceeds , 25 percent of which is covered by forest.

==History==

Christopher Columbus landed in what is believed to have been today&#x27;s Holguín province on October 27, 1492. He declared that it was &quot;the most beautiful land human eyes had ever seen&quot;.

The Holguín province was established in 1978, when it was split from the Oriente region.

==Economy==
Like much of Cuba, Holguín&#x27;s economy is based around sugarcane, though other crops such as corn and coffee, as well as mining, are also large earners for the province.

A large nickel plus cobalt processing plant with shipping facilities was built in Moa, using foreign investment, much of it from Canada. Chromium, iron and steel plants dot the province as well.

Tourism has only recently begun to be developed, offering beach resorts in the outskirts of the region, with a number of hotels around the Guardalavaca area, Playa Esmeralda, Playa Yuraguanal, Playa Blanca, Playa Pesquero, and Cayo Saetia. The Cuchillas del Toa Biosphere Reserve, Sierra Cristal National Park and Alejandro de Humboldt National Park are partly located in the province. Gibara is a little visited historical port located west of the main Guardalavaca resorts. Recently a large number of tourists are reported to have visited the city and its rich culture and beauty. Direct flights to Canada and Europe from Holguin airport limit transfer time to around 1 hour to most resorts on the Costa Holguinera. Canadians and Europeans share the coral beaches with Cubans.

==Municipalities==
Holguín is divided into 14 municipalities:

<text>Granma is one of the provinces of Cuba. Its capital is Bayamo. Other towns include Manzanillo (a port on the Gulf of Guacanayabo) and Pilón.

==History==
The province takes its name from the yacht &quot;Granma&quot;, used by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro to land in Cuba with 82 guerrillas on December 2, 1956; until 1976 the area formed part of the larger Oriente Province. The American who sold the guerillas the secondhand yacht in Mexico apparently had named it &quot;Granma&quot; (&quot;Granma&quot;, more usually &quot;Grandma&quot;, is an affectionate term for a grandmother) after his grandmother.
The name of the vessel became an icon for Cuban communism.

The province is full of reminders of the Cuban Revolution, and of the Cuban Wars of Independence; plaques in the mountain commemorate the 1959 struggle against Fulgencio Batista. Other sites, unmarked, include archaeological digs, the sites of several palenques, and the fortified hamlets of escaped slaves. In 2005 Hurricane Dennis destroyed the site of Castro&#x27;s headquarters at La Plata. There are numerous abandoned gold, silver, and manganese mine sites.

At the 2018 parliamentary election, Granma was the province with the highest proportion of votes recorded for the full list.

On 12 April 2020, Veguitas, a town in Gramna Province, recorded a temperature of . This is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Cuba.

==Economy==
The majority of the revenue comes from coffee grown in the forested and mountainous regions of the province. During the coffee harvest soldiers may set up roadblocks to ensure the delivery of the coffee to the government and not to the black market.

<text>A Bug&#x27;s Life (stylized in all lowercase) is a 1998 American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It is Pixar&#x27;s second feature-length film, following &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995). The film was directed by John Lasseter, co-directed by Andrew Stanton, and produced by Darla K. Anderson and Kevin Reher, from a screenplay written by Stanton, Donald McEnery, and Bob Shaw, and a story conceived by Lasseter, Stanton, and Joe Ranft. It stars the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Hayden Panettiere. In the film, a misfit ant named Flik looks for &quot;tough warriors&quot; to save his ant colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. However, the &quot;warriors&quot; he brings back are a troupe of Circus Bugs. The film&#x27;s plot was initially inspired by Aesop&#x27;s fable &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;.

Production on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; began shortly after the release of &quot;Toy Story&quot; in 1995. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar&#x27;s animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film &quot;Antz&quot;, which was released the month prior.

&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 14, 1998, and was released in the United States on November 25. It received positive reviews for its animation, story, humor, and voice acting. It became a commercial success, having grossed $363 million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on DVD, and has been released multiple times on home video.

==Plot==

A colony of ants, led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta, lives in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as &quot;Ant Island&quot;. Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of grasshoppers, led by Hopper.

One day, Flik, a courageous but clumsy inventor ant, inadvertently destroys the food offering with his grain harvester. Hopper discovers this, and demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off.

Flik travels to &quot;the city&quot;, a heap of trash under a trailer. Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony after their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Atta&#x27;s younger sister Dot from the bird, gaining the ants&#x27; respect. At Flik&#x27;s request, the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being &quot;warriors&quot;, thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants&#x27; hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants&#x27; superior numbers, warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line.

The ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs&#x27; old supervisor, P.T. Flea, arrives, seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover; the ants exile Flik and the Circus Bugs, and desperately try gathering food for a new offering. Hopper returns, sees the mediocre offering, and takes over the island. He then demands the ants&#x27; own winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterward. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.

After the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T., who is also fooled, sets the bird on fire. Realizing the deception, Hopper has Flik publicly beaten and proclaims the ants are lowly life forms who live only to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper and his brother Molt away.
The ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik, who lures Hopper to the real bird&#x27;s nest. Believing the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts it, until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks.

With the anthill now at peace, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants. Flik and Atta become a couple, and proceed to send Hopper&#x27;s affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess. The ants celebrate their victory and congratulate Flik as a hero. They then bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.

==Production==
===Development===

During the summer of 1994, Pixar&#x27;s story department began turning their thoughts to their next film. The storyline for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio&#x27;s head story team; other films such as &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;WALL-E&quot; were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop&#x27;s fable &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film &quot;The Grasshopper and the Ants&quot;. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled &quot;Army Ants&quot;, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.

As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for &quot;Toy Story&quot; in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title &quot;Bugs&quot;. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of &quot;Toy Story&quot; was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.

===Writing===
In &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;, a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story&#x27;s main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.

Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the red ant, and changed him into the character Flik. The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton. The characters &quot;Tuck and Roll&quot; were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade. Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.

===Casting===
The voice cast was heavy with television sitcom stars of the time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from &quot;NewsRadio&quot;), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from &quot;Spin City&quot;), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from &quot;Frasier&quot;) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;). Joe Ranft, member of Pixar&#x27;s story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter&#x27;s wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.

For Hopper, the film&#x27;s villain, Lasseter&#x27;s top choice was Robert De Niro, who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.

&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; was the final film appearance of actor Roddy McDowall, who played Mr. Soil, dying shortly before the film&#x27;s theatrical release.

===Art design and animation===
It was more difficult for animators during the production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; than that of &quot;Toy Story&quot;, as Pixar&#x27;s computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators, Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen, to assist with directing and reviewing the animation. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Wall of Death&quot;. Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was &quot;less likely to change&quot;. After Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect&#x27;s perspective, two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, dubbed the &quot;Bugcam&quot;. Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect&#x27;s-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from &quot;Microcosmos&quot; (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.

The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. While &quot;Toy Story&quot; focused heavily on Woody and Buzz Lightyear, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film&#x27;s larger needs. The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. The story&#x27;s scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film&#x27;s two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual &quot;universal ants&quot;. Each one of these &quot;universal ants&quot; would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. It was partly based on Reeves&#x27;s invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.

The animators also employed subsurface scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s—to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot; (1997), was attached alongside &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; in its theatrical release.

===Feud between Pixar and DreamWorks===
During the production of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks&#x27; Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar&#x27;s Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney&#x27;s film division, had left the company in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks&#x27; acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar&#x27;s contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI&#x27;s first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called &quot;Antz&quot;. By this time, Pixar&#x27;s project was well known within the animation community. Both &quot;Antz&quot; and &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess&#x27;s hand by saving their society. Whereas &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; relied chiefly on visual gags, &quot;Antz&quot; was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of &quot;Antz&quot; was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar&#x27;s film was more accessible to children.

Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on &quot;Toy Story&quot; at the Universal lot&#x27;s Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg&#x27;s judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas. Lasseter had high hopes for &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. He told various friends, &quot;If this hits, it&#x27;s going to be like space movies after &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot; for computer animation companies. Lasseter later recalled, &quot;I should have been wary. Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.&quot;

When the trades indicated production on &quot;Antz&quot;, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him if it was true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg&#x27;s story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed &quot;Antz&quot; came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg&#x27;s executives, as the person responsible for the &quot;Antz&quot; pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was &quot;out to get him&quot; and Lasseter felt that he was cannon fodder in Katzenberg&#x27;s fight with Disney. For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney&#x27;s board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled &quot;Bugs&quot; to open the same week as &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, which was then intended to be DreamWorks&#x27; first animated release. Lasseter relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt let down by Katzenberg.

Katzenberg moved the opening of &quot;Antz&quot; from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar&#x27;s release. David Price writes in his 2008 book &quot;The Pixar Touch&quot; that a rumor, &quot;never confirmed&quot;, was that Katzenberg had given PDI &quot;rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have &quot;Antz&quot; ready first, despite Pixar&#x27;s head start&quot;. Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of &quot;Antz&quot; if Jobs and Disney would move &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; so that it did not compete with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. Jobs believed it &quot;a blatant extortion attempt&quot; and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar&#x27;s rescue by making the deal for &quot;Toy Story&quot;, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. Katzenberg said, &quot;I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you&#x27;re allowing them to use you to screw me.&quot; He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could slow down production on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put &quot;Antz&quot; on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.

As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Lasseter publicly dismissed &quot;Antz&quot; as a &quot;schlock version&quot; of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen &quot;Antz&quot;, told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. &quot;The bad guys rarely win,&quot; Jobs told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In response, DreamWorks&#x27; head of marketing Terry Press stated, &quot;Steve Jobs should take a pill.&quot; Despite the successful box office performances of both films, tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by Randy Newman. Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on October 27, 1998. The album&#x27;s first track is a song called &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; written and performed by Newman, while all the other 19 tracks are orchestral cues. Although the album was out of print physically in the United States during the 2000s, in June 2018 Universal Music Japan announced that a re-mastered edition would be released on October 3, 2018, along with other soundtrack albums from the Walt Disney Records pre-2018 catalogue. The album is also available for purchase on iTunes. The time duration is 47 minutes and 32 seconds.

==Release==

A few days before the world premiere, the film was screened at Camp David as the movie theater in the White House was under renovation. A day after the screening, the crew visited the Oval Office in the White House.

The film&#x27;s world premiere was on November 14, 1998, at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles. It opened at the El Capitan on November 20, 1998 before opening nationwide on November 25.

A teaser trailer for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; was attached to the screenings of &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. As with other films such as &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot;, &quot;The Siege&quot; and &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, moviegoers bought tickets for the sole purpose of seeing the trailer and leaving before the film started. Within a few weeks into the film&#x27;s theatrical release, new outtakes were added to the theatrical prints. Because the film is animated, no actual outtakes exist; they are animated specifically for the outtakes sequence.

===Home media===
&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; was the first home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer. Every frame of animation was converted from the film&#x27;s computer data, as opposed to the standard analog film-to-videotape transfer process. This allowed for the film&#x27;s DVD release to retain its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. The DVD was released on April 20, 1999, alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard 1.33:1 &quot;fullscreen&quot; format. The film&#x27;s fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely &quot;reframing&quot; the film shot by shot; more than half of the film&#x27;s footage was modified by Pixar animators to fit within the film&#x27;s aspect ratio. Several characters and objects were moved closer together to avoid being cut out of frame. The film&#x27;s VHS release was the best-selling VHS in the United Kingdom, with 1.76 million units sold by the end of the year. On August 1, 2000, these editions were re-released on VHS and DVD under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection banner.

On May 27, 2003, a 2-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD was released. This THX-certified DVD release once again gives the option of viewing the film in Widescreen or Full Frame. The second disc features numerous bonus features, such as a set-top game and a &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; featurette.

On May 19, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, and then on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; grossed $371,940 at the El Capitan in its first five days before expanding nationwide. The film grossed a record $45.7 million during the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, including $33.3 million for the three-day weekend, ranking first at the box office, beating out &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;. Its five-day Thanksgiving opening gross surpassed the previous record holder held by &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;. This record was surpassed by &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; the following year. With a total gross of $12.5 million, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; achieved the second-highest first two-day Thanksgiving gross, behind &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;. It managed to retain the top position in its second weekend, making $17.1 million and outgrossing &quot;Psycho&quot;. During its third weekend, the film&#x27;s number one spot was taken by &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, but it still overperformed &quot;Jack Frost&quot; while earning $11.1 million.

In its first international weekend, the film grossed $3.2 million from 5 countries, setting record openings for an animated film in Australia ($1.6 million) and Thailand ($400,000), with the latter surpassing &quot;Mulan&quot;. Furthermore, it made $2 million during its opening weekend in Mexico, which was the country&#x27;s second-highest at the time, after &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

By late December 1998, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; had earned over $100 million. Altogether, several in-year 1998 films combined with &quot;Titanic&quot; pulled $7 billion in North America, propelling the film industry to a record year at the box office.

In February 1999, the film also had a record opening for an animated film in the United Kingdom with an opening weekend gross of £4.2 million ($6.9 million), surpassing &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Upon opening, it beat &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and &quot;Stepmom&quot; to reach the number one spot. The film would remain so for five weeks until it was overtaken by &quot;Patch Adams&quot; in its sixth weekend. It also made $556,000 in the Philippines, which was the country&#x27;s second-highest for an animated film, behind &quot;The Lion King&quot;. In Japan, the film ended &quot;Armageddon&quot;″s 13-week-long run in the number one spot, earning $1.7 million.

At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $200.4 million in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3 million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;Antz&quot;, which earned $171.8 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of based on reviews and an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; is a rousing adventure that blends animated thrills with witty dialogue and memorable characters – and another smashing early success for Pixar.&quot; Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 77 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps &quot;Antz&quot; in numerous ways.&quot; James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying &quot;&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, like &quot;Toy Story&quot;, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing &quot;Will &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; suffer by coming out so soon after &quot;Antz&quot;? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. &quot;Antz&quot; may even help business for &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, writing &quot;What &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar.&quot; Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, stating &quot;&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; is one of the great movies – a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level&quot;.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B, saying &quot;&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; may be the single most amazing film I&#x27;ve ever seen that I couldn&#x27;t fall in love with.&quot; Paul Clinton of &quot;CNN&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; is a perfect movie for the holidays. It contains a great upbeat message ... it&#x27;s wonderful to look at ... it&#x27;s wildly inventive ... and it&#x27;s entertaining for both adults and kids.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and compared the movie to &quot;Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (with a little of another art-film legend, Federico Fellini, tossed in),&quot; where &quot;As in &quot;Samurai&quot;, the colony here is plagued every year by the arrival of bandits.&quot; On the contrary, Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Clever as it is, the film lacks charm. One problem: too many bugs. Second, bigger world for two purposes: to feed birds and to irk humans.&quot;

===Accolades===

&quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; won a number of awards and numerous nominations. The film won the inaugural Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film (tied with &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;) as well as the award for Best Family Film. It also won the Satellite Award for Best Animated Film and the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition by Randy Newman. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.

===Legacy===
In the years since its release, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; has been regarded by critics and fans to be a Pixar film that, in contrast to its successors, has become largely forgotten by audiences. While recognized as solidifying Pixar&#x27;s success, the film has been seen as the studio&#x27;s sophomore slump in the wake of the critically successful &quot;Toy Story&quot;, and inhibited by being released directly before the equally revered &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. Pixar&#x27;s feud with DreamWorks as a result of &quot;Antz&quot; has also been regarded as a factor in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;″s legacy.

Critics have generally ranked &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; to be one of Pixar&#x27;s weaker releases; while it has been seen as &quot;charming&quot;, as well as an &quot;ambitious&quot; film with pioneering animation for its time, others have described it as &quot;adequate&quot;, and appealing more to a younger demographic. Nonetheless, the film&#x27;s characters, voice acting, and humor have received lasting praise.

==Media and merchandise==
===Attached short film===

The film&#x27;s theatrical and video releases include &quot;Geri&#x27;s Game&quot;, an Academy Award winning Pixar short made in 1997, a year before this film was released.

===Video game===

A game, based on the film, was developed by Traveller&#x27;s Tales and Tiertex Design Studios and released by Sony Computer Entertainment, Disney Interactive, THQ and Activision for various systems. The game&#x27;s storyline was similar to the film&#x27;s, with a few changes. However, unlike the film, the game received mixed reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, the PlayStation version 51.90% and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 2.7/10, concluding that it was &quot;obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game.&quot; IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 6.8/10, praising the presentation and sound by stating &quot;It was upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name with cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects&quot; but again criticized the gameplay by saying the controls were &quot;sluggish with stuttering framerate and tired gameplay mechanics&quot;, while they gave the PlayStation version a 4/10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic.

==== Other game appearances ====
Flik and Hopper appear in the mobile game &quot;Disney Heroes: Battle Mode&quot;. Flik was added in Update 3.6. Hopper was added soon after.

In the city-building video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, Flik, Atta, Dot, Hopper and Heimlich were added as playable characters, along with the attractions It’s Tough to be a Bug! and Tuck and Roll&#x27;s Drive &#x27;Em Buggies, during a limited-time Event in 2024 with a storyline set sometime after Hopper was caught by the bird and before the Circus Bugs left Ant Island.

==Theme park attractions==
Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom includes the 3D show &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot;, which also existed at Disney California Adventure from 2001 to 2018.
The Disney California Adventure nighttime show &quot;World of Color&quot; features a segment that includes Heimlich the Caterpillar from the film.

===Former theme park attractions===
From 2002 to 2018, A Bug&#x27;s Land was an area of Disney California Adventure that was inspired by the film.

<text>Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace (1 April 1875 – 10 February 1932) was a British writer of sensational detective, gangster, adventure, and sci-fi novels, plays and stories.

Born into poverty as an illegitimate London child, Wallace left school at the age of 12. He joined the army at age 21 and was a war correspondent during the Second Boer War for Reuters and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Struggling with debt, he left South Africa, returned to London and began writing thrillers to raise income, publishing books including &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1905). Drawing on his time as a reporter in the Congo, covering the Belgian atrocities, Wallace serialised short stories in magazines such as &quot;The Windsor Magazine&quot; and later published collections such as &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1911). He signed with Hodder and Stoughton in 1921 and became an internationally recognised author.

After an unsuccessful bid to stand as Liberal MP for Blackpool (as one of David Lloyd George&#x27;s Independent Liberals) in the 1931 general election, Wallace moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a script writer for RKO. He died suddenly from undiagnosed diabetes, during the initial drafting of &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933).

Wallace was such a prolific writer that one of his publishers claimed that a quarter of all books in England were written by him. As well as journalism, Wallace wrote screen plays, poetry, historical non-fiction, 18 stage plays, 957 short stories and over 170 novels, 12 in 1929 alone. More than 160 films have been made of Wallace&#x27;s work.

In addition to his work on &quot;King Kong&quot;, he is remembered as a writer of &quot;the colonial imagination&quot;, for the J. G. Reeder detective stories, and for the &quot;Green Archer&quot; serial. He sold over 50 million copies of his combined works in various editions and &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1997 describes him as &quot;one of the most prolific thriller writers of [the 20th] century&quot;. Although the great majority of his books are out of print in the UK, they are still read in Germany. A 50-minute German TV documentary was made in 1963 called &quot;The Edgar Wallace Story&quot;, which featured his son Bryan Edgar Wallace.

== Life and work ==

=== Ancestry and birth ===
Wallace&#x27;s great-grandfather was entertainer James Henry Marriott, and his grandmother was actress Alice Marriott. Wallace was born at 7 Ashburnham Grove, Greenwich, to actors Richard Horatio Marriott Edgar (1847–1894) and Mary Jane &quot;Polly&quot; Richards, née Blair (born 1843).

Wallace&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family had been in show business, and she worked in the theatre as a stagehand, usherette, and bit-part actress until she married in 1867. Her husband, Captain Joseph Richards, was born in 1838; he was from an Irish family. He and his father John Richards were both Merchant Navy captains, and his mother Catherine Richards came from a mariner family. Joseph died at sea in 1868, leaving his pregnant wife destitute. After the birth of Wallace&#x27;s older sibling, his mother returned to the stage, assuming the stage name &quot;Polly&quot; Richards. In 1872, she met and joined the Marriott family theatre troupe, managed by Alice Marriott, her husband Richard Edgar, and her three adult children (from earlier liaisons), Grace, Adeline and Richard Horatio Marriott Edgar.

Wallace&#x27;s parents had a &quot;broom cupboard&quot; style sexual encounter during an after-show party. Discovering she was pregnant, his mother invented a fictitious obligation in Greenwich that would last at least half a year and obtained a room in a boarding house where she lived until her son&#x27;s birth, on 1 April 1875. During her confinement she had asked her midwife to find a couple to foster the child. The midwife introduced Wallace&#x27;s mother to her close friend, Mrs Freeman, a mother of ten children, whose husband George Freeman was a Billingsgate fishmonger. On 9 April 1875, his mother took Wallace to the semi-literate Freeman family, and made arrangements to visit often.

=== Childhood and early career ===
Wallace, then known as Richard Horatio Edgar Freeman, had a happy childhood and a close bond with 20-year-old Clara Freeman, who became a second mother to him. By 1878, his mother could no longer afford the small sum she had been paying the Freemans to care for her son and, instead of placing the boy in the workhouse, the Freemans adopted him. His mother never visited Wallace again as a child. His foster-father George Freeman was determined to ensure Richard received a good education, and for some time Wallace attended St. Alfege with St. Peter&#x27;s, a boarding school in Peckham, but he played truant and then left full-time education at the age of 12.

By his early teens, Wallace had held down numerous jobs such as newspaper-seller at Ludgate Circus near Fleet Street, milk-delivery boy, rubber factory worker, shoe shop assistant, and ship&#x27;s cook. A plaque at Ludgate Circus commemorates Wallace&#x27;s first encounter with the newspaper business. He was dismissed from his job on the milk run for stealing money. In 1894, he became engaged to a local Deptford girl, Edith Anstree, but broke the engagement and enlisted in the infantry.

Wallace registered in the British Army under the name Edgar Wallace, after the author of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Lew Wallace. At the time the medical records register him as having a 33-inch chest and being stunted from his childhood spent in the slums. He was posted to South Africa with the West Kent Regiment, in 1896. He disliked army life but managed to arrange a transfer to the Royal Army Medical Corps, which was less arduous but more unpleasant, and so transferred again to the Press Corps, which he found suited him better.

=== 1898–1918 ===

Wallace began publishing songs and poetry, much inspired by Rudyard Kipling, whom he met in Cape Town in 1898. Wallace&#x27;s first book of ballads, &quot;The Mission that Failed!&quot;, was published that same year. In 1899, he bought his way out of the forces and turned to writing full time. Remaining in Africa, he became a war correspondent, first for Reuters and then the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (1900) and other periodicals during the Boer War.

In 1901, while in South Africa, Wallace married Ivy Maude Caldecott (1880?–1926), even though her father Reverend William Shaw Caldecott, a Wesleyan missionary, was strongly opposed to the marriage. The couple&#x27;s first child, Eleanor Clare Hellier Wallace, died suddenly from meningitis in 1903, and the couple returned to London soon afterwards, deeply in debt.

In London, Wallace worked for the &quot;Mail&quot; and began writing detective stories in a bid to earn quick money. A son, Bryan Edgar Wallace, was born in 1904 followed by a daughter, Patricia, in 1908. In 1903, Wallace met his birth mother Polly, whom he had never known. Terminally ill, 60 years old, and living in poverty, she came to him to ask for money and was turned away. Polly died in the Bradford Infirmary later that year.

Unable to find any backer for his first book, Wallace set up his own publishing company, Tallis Press, which issued the sensational thriller &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1905). Despite promotion in the &quot;Mail&quot; and good sales, the project was financially mismanaged, and Wallace had to be bailed out by the &quot;Mail&quot; proprietor Alfred Harmsworth, who was anxious that the farrago might reflect badly on his newspaper. Problems were compounded when inaccuracies in Wallace&#x27;s reporting led to libel suits being brought against the &quot;Mail&quot;. Wallace was fired in 1907, the first reporter ever to be fired from the paper, and he found no other paper would employ him, given his reputation. The family lived continuously in a state of near-bankruptcy, Ivy having to sell her jewellery for food.

During 1907, Edgar travelled to the Congo Free State, to report on atrocities committed against the Congolese under King Leopold II of Belgium and the Belgian rubber companies, in which up to 15 million Congolese were killed. Isabel Thorne, of the &quot;Weekly Tale-Teller&quot; penny magazine, invited Wallace to serialise stories inspired by his experiences. These were published as his first collection &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1911), a best seller. Later , in 1935 it was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Paul Robeson. Wallace went on to publish 11 more similar collections (102 stories). They were tales of exotic adventure and local tribal rites, set on an African river, mostly without love interest as this held no appeal for Wallace. His first 28 books and their film rights he sold outright, with no royalties, for quick money. Critic David Pringle noted in 1987: &quot;The &quot;Sanders&quot; Books are not frequently reprinted nowadays, perhaps because of their overt racism&quot;.

The period from 1908 to 1932 was the most prolific of Wallace&#x27;s life. Initially, he wrote mainly in order to satisfy creditors in the UK and South Africa. However, his books&#x27; success began to rehabilitate his reputation as a journalist, and he began reporting from horse racing circles. He wrote for the &quot;Week-End&quot; and the &quot;Evening News&quot;, became an editor for &quot;Week-End Racing Supplement&quot;, started his own racing papers &quot;Bibury&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;R. E. Walton&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and bought many racehorses of his own. He lost many thousands gambling, and despite his success, spent large sums on an extravagant lifestyle he could not afford.

During 1916, Ivy had her third and last child by Edgar, Michael Blair Wallace, and filed for divorce in 1918.

=== 1918–1929 ===

Ivy moved to Tunbridge Wells with the children, and Wallace drew closer to his secretary Ethel Violet King (1896–1933), daughter of banker Frederick King. They married in 1921; their daughter Margaret Penelope June (known as Penny Wallace) was born in 1923.

Wallace began to take his fiction writing career more seriously and signed with publishers Hodder and Stoughton in 1921, organising his contracts, instead of selling rights to his work piecemeal in order to raise funds. This allowed him advances, royalties, and full scale promotional campaigns for his books, which he had never before had. The publisher aggressively advertised him as a celebrity writer, &quot;King of Thrillers&quot;, known for this trademark trilby, cigarette holder, and yellow Rolls-Royce. He was said to be able to write a 70,000 word novel in three days and plough through three novels at once, and the publishers agreed to publish everything he wrote as fast as he could write it. In 1928, it was estimated that one in four books being read in the UK had come from Wallace&#x27;s pen. He wrote across many genres including science fiction, screen plays, and a non-fiction ten-volume history of the First World War. All told, he wrote over 170 novels, 18 stage plays, and 957 short stories, and his works were translated into 28 languages. The critic Wheeler Winston Dixon suggests that Wallace became somewhat of a public joke for this prodigious output.

Wallace served as chairman of the Press Club, which continues to present an annual Edgar Wallace Award for excellence in writing. Following the great success of his novel &quot;The Ringer&quot;, Wallace was appointed chairman of the British Lion Film Corporation in return for giving British Lion first option on all his output. Wallace&#x27;s contract gave him an annual salary, a substantial block of stock in the company, a large stipend from everything British Lion produced based on his work, plus 10% of British Lion&#x27;s overall annual profits. Additionally, British Lion employed his elder son, Bryan E. Wallace, as a film editor. By 1929, Wallace&#x27;s earnings were almost £50,000 per annum (equivalent to about £2 million in current terms). He also invented at this time the Luncheon Club, bringing together his two greatest loves: journalism and horse-racing.

=== Firsts ===
Wallace was the first British crime novelist to use policemen as his protagonists, rather than amateur sleuths as most other writers of the time did. Most of his novels are independent stand-alone stories; he seldom used series heroes, and when he did he avoided a strict story order, so that continuity was not required from book to book.

On 6 June 1923, Edgar Wallace became the first British radio sports reporter, when he made a report on The Derby for the British Broadcasting Company, the newly founded predecessor of the BBC.

=== Ivy&#x27;s death ===
Wallace&#x27;s ex-wife Ivy was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1923, and though the tumour was successfully removed, it returned terminally by 1925, and she died in 1926.

=== &quot;The Canker In Our Midst&quot; ===
Wallace wrote a controversial article in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 1926 entitled &quot;The Canker In Our Midst&quot; about paedophilia and the show business world. Describing how some show business people unwittingly leave their children vulnerable to predators, it linked paedophilia with homosexuality and outraged many of his colleagues, publishing associates, and business friends including theatre mogul Gerald du Maurier. Biographer Margaret Lane describes it as an &quot;intolerant, blustering, kick-the-blighters-down-the-stairs&quot; type of essay, even by the standards of the day.

=== Politics, emigration to the U.S., and screenwriting ===
Wallace became active in the Liberal Party and contested Blackpool in the 1931 general election as one of a handful of Independent Liberals, who rejected the National Government, and the official Liberal support for it, and strongly supported free trade. He also bought the &quot;Sunday News&quot;, edited it for six months, and wrote a theatre column, before it closed. In the event, he lost the election by over 33,000 votes. He went to America, burdened by debt, in November 1931. Around the same time, he wrote the screenplay for the first sound film adaptation of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1932), produced in England by Gainsborough Pictures.

He moved to Hollywood and began working as a &quot;script doctor&quot; for RKO. His later play, &quot;The Green Pack&quot;, opened to excellent reviews, boosting his status even further. Wallace wanted to get his own work on Hollywood celluloid, and so he adapted books such as &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; and &quot;Mr J G Reeder&quot;. In Hollywood, Wallace met Stanley Holloway&#x27;s scriptwriter, Wallace&#x27;s own half-brother Marriott Edgar. Wallace&#x27;s play &quot;On the Spot&quot;, written about gangster Al Capone, would prove to be the writer&#x27;s greatest theatrical success. It was described by Jack Adrian as &quot;arguably, in construction, dialogue, action, plot and resolution, still one of the finest and purest of 20th-century melodramas&quot;. It launched the career of Charles Laughton, who played the lead Capone character Tony Perelli.

== Death and aftermath ==

=== Death ===
In December 1931, Wallace was assigned work on the RKO &quot;gorilla picture&quot; (&quot;King Kong&quot;, 1933) for producer Merian C. Cooper. By late January, however, he was beginning to suffer sudden, severe headaches and was diagnosed with diabetes. His condition deteriorated within days. Violet booked passage to California on a liner out of Southampton, but received word that Edgar had slipped into a coma and died of the disease, combined with double pneumonia, on 10 February 1932 in North Maple Drive, Beverly Hills. The flags on Fleet Street&#x27;s newspaper offices flew at half-mast, and the bell of St. Bride&#x27;s tolled in mourning. His body was returned to England and he was buried at Little Marlow Cemetery, Fern Lane, Buckinghamshire, not far from his UK country home, Chalklands, in Bourne End.

=== Aftermath ===
Despite his later success, Wallace had amassed massive debts, some still remaining from his years in South Africa, many to racing bookies. The large royalties from his greatly popular works allowed the estate to be settled within two years.

Violet Wallace outlived her husband by only 14 months. She died suddenly in April 1933, aged 33, while the estate was still deep in debt.

== Legacy ==

Violet Wallace&#x27;s own will left her share of the Wallace estate to her daughter Penelope (1923–1997), herself an author of mystery and crime novels, who became the chief benefactor and shareholder. Penelope married George Halcrow in 1955. The couple ran the Wallace estate, managing her father&#x27;s literary legacy and starting the Edgar Wallace Society in 1969. The work is continued by Penelope&#x27;s daughter, also named Penelope. The Society has members in 20 countries. The literary body is currently managed by the London agency A.P. Watt.

Wallace&#x27;s eldest son Bryan Edgar Wallace (1904–1971) was also an author of mystery and crime novels. In 1934, Bryan married Margaret Lane (1907–94), also a writer. Lane&#x27;s biography of Edgar Wallace was published in 1938

The &quot;Edgar Wallace Mystery Magazine&quot; was a monthly digest-size fiction magazine specializing in crime and detective fiction. It published 35 issues from 1964 to 1967. Each issue contained original works of short crime or mystery fiction as well as reprints by authors like Wallace, Chekhov, Steinbeck, and Agatha Christie.

More than 160 films and several radio adaptations have been made based on Wallace&#x27;s work. Wallace also has a pub named after him in Essex Street, off Strand in London.

== Writing ==

=== Method ===
Wallace narrated his words onto wax cylinders (the dictaphones of the day) and his secretaries typed up the text. This may be why he was able to work at such high speed and why his stories have narrative drive. Many of Wallace&#x27;s successful books were dictated like this over two or three days, locked away with cartons of cigarettes and endless pots of sweet tea, often working pretty much uninterrupted in 72 hours. Most of his novels were serialised in segments but written in this way. The serialised stories that were instead written piecemeal have a distinctly different narrative energy, not sweeping up the reader on the story wave.

Wallace rarely edited his own work after it was dictated and typed up, but sent it straight to the publishers, intensely disliking the revision of his work with other editors. The company would do only cursory checks for factual errors before printing.

Wallace faced widespread accusations that he used ghost writers to churn out books, though there is no evidence of this, and his prolificness became something of a joke, the subject of cartoons and sketches. His &quot;three day books&quot;, reeled off to keep the loan sharks from the door, were unlikely to garner great critical praise and Wallace claimed not to find literary value in his own works.

=== Themes and critique ===
Wallace characters such as District Commissioner Sanders can be taken to represent the values of colonial white supremacy in Africa, and now viewed by many critics as deeply racist and paternalistic. His writing has been attacked by some for its conception of Africans as stupid children who need a firm hand. Sanders, for example, pledges to bring &quot;civilisation&quot; to &quot;half a million cannibal folk&quot;. George Orwell called Wallace a &quot;bully worshipper&quot; and &quot;proto-fascist&quot;, though many critics conceived Wallace more as a populist writer who wrote for the market of the time. Selling over 50 million copies of his works, including 170 novels, Wallace was very much a populist writer, and was dismissed by the &quot;literati&quot; as such.

Q. D. Leavis, Arnold Bennett and Dorothy L Sayers led the attack on Wallace, suggesting he offered no social critique or subversive agenda at all and distracting the reading public from better things. Trotsky, reading a Wallace novel whilst recuperating on his sickbed in 1935, found it to be &quot;mediocre, contemptible and crude ... [with no] shade of perception, talent or imagination.&quot; Critics Steinbrunner and Penzler stated that Wallace&#x27;s writing is &quot;slapdash and cliché-ridden, [with] characterization that is two dimensional and situations [that] are frequently trite, relying on intuition, coincidence, and much pointless, confusing movement to convey a sense of action. The heroes and villains are clearly labelled, and stock characters, humorous servants, baffled policemen, breathless heroines, could be interchanged from one book to another.&quot; &quot;The Oxford Companion to the Theatre&quot; asserts, however, that &quot;In all his works [Wallace] showed unusual precision of detail, narrative skill, and inside knowledge of police methods and criminal psychology, the fruits of his apprenticeship as a crime reporter&quot;.

Wallace did not use plot formulae, unlike many other thriller writers. The critic Wheeler Winston Dixon maintains that Wallace covered a wide variety of perspectives and characterisations, exploring themes such as feminist self-determination (&quot;Barbara on her Own&quot; 1926, &quot;Four-Square Jane&quot; 1929, &quot;The Girl from Scotland Yard&quot; 1926), upsetting peerage hierarchies (&quot;Chick&quot;, 1923), science fiction (&quot;The Day of Uniting&quot;, 1926), schizophrenia (&quot;The Man Who Knew&quot;, 1919) and autobiography (&quot;People&quot;, 1926).

=== Science fiction ===
Edgar Wallace enjoyed writing science fiction but found little financial success in the genre despite several efforts. His constant need for income always brought him back to the more mundane styles of fiction that sold more easily. &quot;Planetoid 127&quot;, first published in 1924 but reprinted as late as 2011, is a short story about an Earth scientist who communicates via wireless with his counterpart on a duplicate Earth orbiting unseen because it is on the opposite side of the Sun. The idea of a &quot;mirror Earth&quot; or &quot;mirror Universe&quot; later became a standard subgenre within science fiction. The story also bears similarities to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s hard science fiction story &quot;Wireless&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s other science fiction works include &quot;The Green Rust&quot;, a story of bio-terrorists who threaten to release an agent that will destroy the world&#x27;s corn crops, &quot;1925&quot;, which accurately predicted that a short peace would be followed by a German attack on England, and &quot;The Black Grippe&quot;, about a disease that renders everyone in the world blind. His last work of science fiction and the only one widely remembered today is the screenplay for &quot;King Kong&quot;.

=== &quot;King Kong&quot; ===

Out of the many scripts he penned for RKO, Merian C. Cooper&#x27;s &quot;gorilla picture&quot; had the most lasting influence, becoming the classic &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933).

Wallace wrote the initial 110-page first draft for &quot;The Beast&quot; (the film&#x27;s original title) over five weeks, from late December 1931 to January 1932. In all, there were three draft versions, another titled &quot;Kong&quot;. &quot;Kong&quot; was rejected as the film&#x27;s title because it was too similar to another Cooper film, &quot;&quot;, released in 1927, and because it sounded Chinese. Wallace suggested the title &quot;King Ape&quot;. His diary described the writing process for this draft: Cooper fed aspects of the story in conferences and phone conversations; Wallace then executed Cooper&#x27;s ideas, the latter approving the developing script on a sequence-by-sequence basis. While working on the project, Cooper also screened various recent films for Wallace to put him in the right mindset, including &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931). One of Cooper&#x27;s main aspirations with the story was to use as much footage of an abandoned RKO picture with a similar premise, &quot;Creation&quot;, as possible. He showed Wallace the fragments that were to be reused in the current script.

Although the draft was incomplete, Wallace only made minor revisions to it, each at Cooper&#x27;s request. In late January, Wallace was hospitalized, and by 10 February, he was dead, leaving Cooper without a screenwriter. The fragmentary nature of Wallace&#x27;s script meant that the main dialogue-free action of the film (the jungle sequences) would have to be shot first, both as insurance and as a showreel for the board of RKO.

In &quot;My Hollywood Diary&quot;, Edgar Wallace wrote about the reception of his screenplay: &quot;Cooper called me up last night and told me that everybody who had read &#x27;Kong&#x27; was enthusiastic. They say it is the best adventure story that has ever been written for the screen.&quot; Wallace had high expectations for the film: &quot;I am certain that &#x27;Kong&#x27; is going to be a wow.&quot;

His screenplay begins with Denham and the party at the island, called &quot;Vapour Island&quot; by Wallace because of the volcanic emissions. Ann Darrow is called Shirley Redman in this early version. Jack Driscoll is also referred to as John Lanson or Johnny, and Captain Englehorn is much more domineering. Danby G. Denham is a promoter and a P. T. Barnum type showman who is looking for a giant ape to bring back to Madison Square Garden or the Polo Grounds to exhibit as a sideshow. The movie retains the Barnum theme when Denham, who evolved into Carl Denham in the Rose and Creelman treatment, refers to Kong as &quot;the eighth wonder of the world&quot;, echoing Barnum&#x27;s style of hyping acts. Wallace created the major characters, their relationships, and their role in the overall plot. He also created the story&#x27;s beauty and the beast theme.

In his original screenplay, the crew of the boat consists of escaped convicts who kidnap Shirley. After a dinosaur attacks and wrecks their boat, they find refuge on the island. In a tent, a convict tries to rape Shirley. Kong appears, rescues Shirley and takes her away to his cave. Wallace says in a notation on the script that Kong is 30 feet tall, thus establishing Kong as a giant ape. John and the remaining convicts then go after Shirley, using a log to cross a ravine. Kong attacks them which leads to their deaths as the log crashes down the ravine. Kong fights and kills a triceratops. Dinosaurs and pterodactyls attack Kong and the party. Kong takes Shirley to his hideout in the mountains, and Jack rescues her. Using gas bombs, the expedition knocks out Kong.

Kong is brought back to New York and put in a cage. Shirley is attacked by lions and tigers let loose on purpose by Senorita. Kong kills the cats and whisks Shirley away. He climbs the Empire State Building where airplanes shoot at him. Cooper sent Wallace an internal memo from RKO suggesting that John dissuade the police from shooting Kong because of the danger to Shirley: &quot;Please see if you consider it practical to work out theme that John attempts single handed rescue on top of Empire State Building if police will let off shooting for a minute.&quot; Kong is finally killed when lightning strikes the flag pole he is hanging on to. Early publicity stills for the movie have the title as &quot;Kong&quot; and &quot;by Edgar Wallace&quot; and show a lightning storm and flashes of lightning as envisioned by Wallace.

In his version, a small ape peeling a rose prefigured Kong&#x27;s peeling away Shirley&#x27;s clothes. His treatment also included an underwater scene from the attacking dinosaur&#x27;s point of view as it approached a capsized boat.

However, his 110-page script was merely the first rough draft, not a final and completed shooting script.

After Wallace&#x27;s death, Ruth Rose was brought in to work on the document he had started. She happened to be Schoedsack&#x27;s wife and was able to translate the expectations of the producers into the final script. She added the ritual scene on Skull Island to replace Wallace&#x27;s original idea of the attempted rape of Ann Darrow. Rose also added the opening scenes of the movie in which the main characters and plot are introduced. James Ashmore Creelman, who worked on the screenplay for &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, a film that Wallace was in discussions to write for at the time of his death, was also brought in to tidy up the script. The job of Rose and Creelman was to rework Wallace&#x27;s original screenplay and replace scenes that failed to translate as expected.

The original Wallace screenplay was published in the 2013 book &quot;Ray Harryhausen – The Master of the Majicks, Volume 1: Beginnings and Endings&quot; by Mike Hankin. In 2023, the original Wallace screenplay was published in &quot;KONG: An Original Screenplay by Edgar Wallace&quot; edited by Stephen Jones.

That original screenplay is analysed and discussed in &quot;The Girl in the Hairy Paw&quot; (1976), edited by Ronald Gottesman and Harry Geduld, and by Mark Cotta Vaz, in the preface to the Modern Library reissue of &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005).

In December 1932, Wallace&#x27;s story and screenplay for &quot;King Kong&quot; were &quot;novelised&quot; or transcribed by Delos W. Lovelace, a journalist and author himself who knew Cooper from when they worked on a newspaper, and appeared in book form under the title &quot;King Kong&quot;. Lovelace based the transcription largely on the Ruth Rose and James A. Creelman screenplay. This &quot;novelization&quot; of &quot;King Kong&quot;, attributed to Wallace, Cooper, and Lovelace, was originally published by Grosset and Dunlap. The book was reissued in 2005 by the Modern Library, a division of Random House, with an introduction by Greg Bear and a preface by Mark Cotta Vaz, and by Penguin in the US. In the UK, Victor Gollancz published a hardcover version in 2005. The first paperback edition had been published by Bantam in 1965 in the US and by Corgi in 1966 in the UK. In 1976, Grosset and Dunlap republished the novel in paperback and hardcover editions. There were paperback editions by Tempo and by Futura that year as well. In 2005, Blackstone Audio released a spoken-word version of the book as an audiobook on CD with commentary by Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, and Ray Harryhausen, among others. Harryhausen stated that he had read the original screenplay by Wallace. There were also German and Czech versions of the novel in 2005.

On 28 October 1933, &quot;Cinema Weekly&quot; published the short story &quot;King Kong&quot;, credited to Edgar Wallace and Draycott Montagu Dell (1888–1940). Dell had known Wallace as both worked for British newspapers. This can be called a &quot;story-ization&quot; of the Wallace and Cooper story which relied on the Rose and Creelman screenplay, but which like the Wallace treatment, begins at the island. Both Wallace and Cooper had signed a contract which allowed them to develop the story in a book or short story or serial form. Walter F. Ripperger also wrote a two-part serialization of the Wallace and Cooper story in &quot;Mystery&quot; magazine titled &quot;King Kong&quot; in the February and March issues in 1933.

=== West Germany ===
In 1959 Danish production company Rialto Film on behalf of West German distributor Constantin Film made &quot;The Fellowship of the Frog&quot; into a movie. The initial success prompted Rialto Film to establish a German subsidiary, securing the rights to most of Wallace&#x27;s novels, and producing an additional 38 movies until 1972. During the time Wallace&#x27;s eldest son Bryan as well had 10 of his novels adapted into movies by West Berlin-based production company CCC-Filmkunst. Both series were set in contemporary UK but filmed entirely in Western Germany and West Berlin. Although panned by critics the movies garnered a following with occasional reruns on German TV.

In 2004, Oliver Kalkofe produced the movie &quot;Der Wixxer&quot;, an homage to the popular black and white Wallace movies. It featured many well known comedians. In 2007, Kalkofe produced a sequel &quot;&quot;.

There are more of Wallace&#x27;s books still in print in Germany than elsewhere and his work has consistently remained popular there.

<doc id="460444" wikidata="Q314776" url="?curid=460444" title="Ghulam Ishaq Khan">
<text>Ghulam Ishaq Khan (20 January 1915 – 27 October 2006), commonly known by his initials GIK, was a Pakistani bureaucrat, politician and statesman who served as the seventh President of Pakistan from 1988 to 1993. He previously served as Chairman of the Senate from 1985 to 1988 under president Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, and was sworn in shortly after Zia&#x27;s death.

Raised in Bannu, Khan graduated from Peshawar University and entered the Indian Civil Service, opting for Pakistan after the independence in 1947. Appointed the first chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority by President Ayub Khan in 1961, Ghulam Ishaq also served as Finance Secretary from 1966 to 1970. A year later, he was appointed Governor of the State Bank by President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, before being made Defence Secretary in 1975, assisting with Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb programme. He was retained by President Zia-ul-Haq as Finance Minister in 1977, overseeing the country&#x27;s highest GDP growth average. Elected Chairman of the Senate in 1985, Khan was elevated to the presidency after Zia&#x27;s death in an air crash on 17 August 1988. He was elected president on 13 December, as the consensus candidate of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad and Pakistan People&#x27;s Party.

The oldest person to serve as president, Ghulam Ishaq Khan played a hawkish role against Communist Afghanistan, while relations with the United States deteriorated following the Pressler amendment. Domestically, Khan&#x27;s term faced challenges: ethnic riots flared in Karachi, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto accused him of frustrating her government as part of an alliance with conservative opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and the post-Zia military establishment. Khan invoked the Eighth Amendment and dismissed Benazir&#x27;s government after just 20 months, on charges of rampant corruption and misgovernance. Sharif was elected Prime Minister in 1990, but Khan dismissed his government on similar charges three years later. The Supreme Court overturned the dismissal, but the gridlock ultimately led to both men resigning in 1993. He was the founder of his namesake Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute.

Retiring from public service, Khan served as rector of the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in his native province, dying from pneumonia in 2006. He is viewed contentiously by Pakistani historians; he is credited with personal austerity, but criticized for wielding an autocratic presidency that ousted two governments.

==Early life and education==
Ghulam Ishaq Khan was born in Ismail Khel, a rural locality on the outskirts of Bannu District, both villages in the North-West Frontier Province of the British Indian Empire, now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan. He was a Pashtun of the Bangash tribe. His family remains active in politics; his son-in-law is former federal minister Anwar Saifullah Khan while another son-in-law is former Sindh minister and advisor, Irfanullah Khan Marwat. A granddaughter of his, Samar Haroon Bilour, was married to Haroon Bilour of the ANP and another to Omar Ayub Khan, the grandson of former military dictator Ayub Khan and son of politician Gohar Ayub Khan.

After his schooling in Bannu, Khan first attended the Islamia College before making transfer to Peshawar University. He obtained double BSc, in Chemistry and in Botany.

Initially looking for a university job, Khan joined the Indian Civil Service in 1941, serving in various provincial assignments on behalf of British India. After independence in 1947, Khan opted for Pakistan and was assigned to the bureaucracy of the provincial government of North-West Frontier Province in 1947. He took over the provincial secretariat as the secretary of the irrigation department, which he held until 1955.

==Initial public service==
In 1956, Khan was appointed in the provincial government of Sindh as the Home Secretary, but was later appointed Secretary of Department of Development and Irrigation by the Sindh government. In 1958, he was elevated to federal government level, and assigned to the secretariat control of the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), an appointment approved by the President Ayub Khan. Since 1958, Khan had been serving on the Board of Governors of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), before being elevated to chairman in 1961. As Chairman, he played a vital role in the construction and financial development of Mangla Dam and Warsak Dam.
In 1966, Khan left the chairmanship to be appointed as the Federal Finance Secretary to the Government of Pakistan until 1970, which he relinquished to incoming Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After Pakistan&#x27;s loss to India in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Khan was called to administer all retail and commercial services pertaining to the national economy tattered by war. In 1971, Bhutto appointed him Governor of State Bank of Pakistan when he was tasked to formulate and administer monetary and credit policy in accordance with Government policy with influence of socialism. In the latter position, he questioned the wisdom of many of the economic policies of then-Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who was keen to intensify his nationalization and socialist influence in the financial institutions that marked the slow down of the economy.

==Defence Secretary (1975–77)==
In 1975, Prime Minister Bhutto transferred him from Governor of the State Bank to the Ministry of Defence as Defence Secretary. It was a fortuitous move in that it brought him into close contact with the Pakistani military establishment and enabled him to closely manage the nuclear weapons program. Though an unusual assignment for a financial expert, this appointment made him a powerful bureaucrat in the country. During that time, Khan became closer to General Zia-ul-Haq and had later coveted for General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s appointment as the chief of army staff.

As Defence Secretary, he helped manage Pakistan&#x27;s atomic bomb project and had been directly associated with the program. Khan was a vehement support of the program and saw it as a &quot;national priory&quot;. He backed the advocacy of theorist Abdul Qadeer Khan and helped establishing the Engineering Research Laboratories in Kahuta. He headed the Uranium Coordination Board (UCB) which consisted of AGN Kazi, Munir Ahmad and Agha Shahi. Khan recommended S A Nawab for the Hilal-i-Imtiaz medal in recognition of Nawab&#x27;s work in establishing Khan Research Laboratories. Later, in the 1980s Khan helped consolidate the efforts at ERL under Lt. Gen. Zahid Ali Akbar as its first military director. He approved the survey by field officer, Brigadier Akbar in 1976. Khan also helped secure the funds for the ERL and lobbying for General Akbar&#x27;s promotion as the Engineer-in-Chief in 1980. Khan cemented close relations with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Munir Ahmad Khan, and remained Qadeer Khan&#x27;s staunch loyal.

His involvement and support earned him the nickname &quot;Mr Nuke&quot; by the U.S. diplomats, while the new media dubbed him as &quot;Baba Atom Bomb&quot;. On the contrary, Khan did not have the directorial role in the atomic bomb program until Munir Ahmad Khan retired. However, he maintained complete logistic and operational control over ERL project from the time of its inception using Major General S A Nawab who reported to Ghulam Ishaq at the Ministry of Defence. After Munir Ahmad Khan took retirement from Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), President Ghulam Ishaq Khan eventually consolidated the entire program under the civic-military control, and supervised the classified projects of the program.

==Minister of Finance (1977–85)==
After Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was ousted in a staged coup d&#x27;état in 1977, Khan played a crucial role in the event of stabilizing chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq, in Bhutto&#x27;s capacity. After meeting with the military leadership at the JS HQ, Khan reportedly marked that: &quot;this action was going to harm the country, but since it could not be reversed, they should do their best to salvage whatever they could.&quot; He was immediately elevated as Finance Minister by General Zia-ul-Haq, who acted as the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). A team of economic experts and technocrats were assembled in the management of Khan, giving him the authority over the Planning Commission, Economic Coordination Committee, and Executive Committee of the Space Research Council. Khan worked towards controlling the national economy while harnessing the damaged Private sector. In 1977, Khan endorsed General Haq&#x27;s bid for becoming the President of Pakistan, who tightened the grip of martial law in the country.

In the 1980s, Khan backed the implementation of the economic Islamization by introducing the risk-free interest rate system as well as establishing the corporatization in the industrial sector. Khan managed the revenue collection and provided the modern shape in the state–owned enterprises (SOEs) that were established in a nationalization in the 1970s. His policies and economic expertise ultimately resulted in the improvement in GDP and GNP progress, helping Pakistan&#x27;s economy become among the fastest-growing in South Asia.

He maintained his ties with the nuclear society and gave strong priority for the nuclear deterrence as channelling financial funds for the development of the atomic bomb projects. Khan gave tax free status to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). In 1983, Khan was among the invited secret dignitaries who witnessed the first Cold fission test, Kirana-I; along with attendees General Zahid Ali , General KM Arif , AVM MJ O&#x27;Brian ), and Munir Ahmad . In 1984, Khan supported the referendum for Islamization held by President Zia.

==Senate Chairman (1985–88)==
After the non-partisan general elections held in 1985, Khan was succeeded by Mahbub ul Haq– an economist. Khan decided to participate in the upcoming indirect senate elections as an independent. In 1985, he became the Chairman of the Senate and remained intact in that capacity until 1988.

After the controversial and mysterious aviation accident occurred in Bahawalpur, Khan appeared on national television and announced the death of General Zia-ul-Haq. According to the Constitution of Pakistan, Khan was the second in the line of succession to the President of Pakistan. However, General Mirza Aslam Beg called out for the general elections in 1988. Until the elections, Khan served as an acting president in accordance with the Constitutional rules of succession.

==President of Pakistan (1988–93)==

Reaching the mutual understanding with the leftist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Khan participated in presidential elections on a PPP platform. Khan secured 608 votes in the elections, competing against four other candidates; he was also supported by the conservative IDA led by Nawaz Sharif. At the time of assuming the office of president, he became the oldest president of Pakistan.

As president, Khan was marred with political struggle with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who attempted for pushing the bill to reverse the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan. Furthermore, Khan was in a conflict with Prime Minister Bhutto in two areas; the appointment of the military chiefs of staff and the Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Khan consolidated his position in controlling the nuclear deterrence program, keeping all the control over its direction. Problems arose when Prime Minister Bhutto made contact with Munir Ahmad and Abdul Qadeer Khan over the program&#x27;s direction, which frustrated Khan. Economic growth slowed down and introduction of the US Embargo on Pakistan caused a great economic panic in the country. In the 1990s, Khan and Bhutto failed to arrest the 30% fall in the value of ₨. from 21 to 30 to the US $.

Khan struggled to control the law and order in the country after witnessing the Soviet troops&#x27; withdrawal from Afghanistan. Although, he maintained an ally of the United States.

===Judicial and military appointments===
Soon after assuming the presidency, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan&#x27;s conflict arise with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s invalid and inappropriate appointments in nation&#x27;s court system, which were primarily political rather than meeting merit. Many of Benazir government&#x27;s recommendations for judicial appointments were voided and the judicial appointments made by the President himself became a controversial issue in the nation.

The appointments of chiefs of staff in the command of the military was another issue where the President Khan was in conflict with the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1989. President Khan also confirmed Admiral Yastur-ul-Haq Malik as the Chief of Naval staff and raised no objections.

Although, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan confirmed the nomination of Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey as Chairman joint chiefs and General Mirza Aslam Beg as chief of army staff in 1988, President Khan notably used his presidential powers to retain Admiral Sirohey as Chairman joint chiefs and defused any attempts made by Prime Minister Bhutto for General Beg as the new chairman joint chiefs to control the military.

In 1990, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan reportedly denied the term extension of General Mirza Aslam Beg despite Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s urging. He also raised objections and further vetoed the appointment of Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul, former DG ISI, as Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan Army. Instead, he favoured appointing General Asif Nawaz as Chief of Army Staff. On the advice of Prime Minister Sharif, he confirmed Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze as Chief of Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force.

===Dismissal of Bhutto and Sharif governments===
As economic and law and order crises deepened, Khan used the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan to dismiss Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government over corruption charges and deteriorating law and order situation and called fresh elections. After holding the general elections in 1993, he supported Nawaz Sharif as the Prime Minister and his IDA government.

Problems with Sharif arose with the issue of reversing the Eighth Amendment when Sharif tried to pass the bill. Eventually, he used the same Amendment to dismiss Sharif&#x27;s government on similar charges. However, Sharif retaliated by bringing a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. President Khan&#x27;s attempt to use the Eighth Amendment was deemed illegal by the Court and Sharif was reinstated as the Prime Minister. The political deadlock persisted and after the joint intervention of the judiciary and the military, both Khan and Sharif were forced to resign.

==Philanthropy, retirement and death==
In 1988, Khan founded the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, which runs programmes in engineering, science and technology. The university was established with the financial support from the BCCI. He invited A Q Khan who took the professorship of physics and delegated Asghar Qadir, a PAEC mathematician, to take professorship in mathematics.

He again negotiated with the PPP for the presidency but eventually dropped as a candidate in favour of Farooq Leghari in general elections held in 1993. He retired from the national politics and avoided contact with international and domestic news media. He died on 27 October 2006, after a bout of pneumonia.

<doc id="460445" wikidata="Q3179649" url="?curid=460445" title="Joanna Dark">
<text>Joanna Dark is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; video game series. She debuted in the Nintendo 64 first-person shooter &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; and is a player character in all the games of the series. Outside of video games, Joanna appears as the lead character in all the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; novels and comic books. Joanna is an operative for the fictional Carrington Institute, where she was given the code name &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; in honor of her flawless performance in training tests.

Joanna Dark was originally devised by video game designer Martin Hollis, who found inspiration in a number of fictional heroines such as FBI agent Dana Scully from television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, the eponymous femme fatale of the film &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, and Motoko Kusanagi from Manga/Anime &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; among others. Her &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; model was redesigned by manga artist Wil Overton. Joanna Dark is among Rare&#x27;s most well known characters and has been featured in several &quot;top lists&quot; by the gaming media.

==Character design==
Joanna Dark was originally devised by Martin Hollis, the director and producer of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, before he left Rare in 1998. Hollis explained that the suggestion of having a female lead in a first-person shooter was inspired by Kim Kimberly, the protagonist of the first two games in the &quot;Silicon Dreams&quot; trilogy by Level 9 Computing, where the player experiences the shock of discovering that they are a woman fairly late in the first game. He also felt that there should be more games with female leads. According to him, &quot;Having just made a game starring a man it seemed logical to create one around a woman.&quot;

Joanna&#x27;s design was influenced by a number of fictional heroines, including the seductive spy Agent X-27 in the 1930s film &quot;Dishonored&quot;, FBI agent Dana Scully from &quot;The X-Files&quot; television series, and the eponymous femme fatale of the film &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, whom Hollis describes as &quot;iconic, heroic, independent, vulnerable and very damaged.&quot; Her haircut and facial features were modelled after actress Winona Ryder. Although the name &quot;Joanna Dark&quot; alludes to the French pronunciation of historical figure Joan of Arc as &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, game designer David Doak explained that the name &quot;Joanna&quot; was conceived before any reference was noticed. Hollis revealed that they &quot;wanted her to be quite normal, not with supermodel looks, perhaps a little androgynous.&quot; Joanna is worn different attire throughout the game, a decision to make her &quot;intrinsically fashionable&quot;. A black dress Joanna wears has an image of a dragon from &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. In &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, she was voiced by Eveline Fischer, a video game music composer who worked at Rare.

In &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, Joanna was redesigned by manga artist Wil Overton. Overton added more distinctive elements, including a star tattoo on the left side of her neck, a blonde streak in her hair, and a choppy outline to her hairstyle. Her hair was also changed from short and red to shoulder-length and orange. Hollis stated that while he liked the new concept work, he could not imagine why she would wear the orange. According to him, &quot;It is uncharacteristic. Quite apart from the practical problem of being a beacon for bullets—Secret Agents don’t wear orange for good reason.&quot; Process for her character design went through several alterations. Images of the initial concept were met with much derision among the fans who criticized Joanna&#x27;s new manga-like appearance. In response, the developers chose to tone down some of the more stylized aspects of the design, eventually arriving at a more realistic appearance. For the cancelled sequel &quot;Perfect Dark Core&quot;, Dark was altered to fit the game&#x27;s realistic atmosphere, being described as a &quot;smoking, flirting&quot; version.

==Appearances==
===In video games===
Joanna&#x27;s first appearance is in the Nintendo 64 title &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, released in 2000. In the game, Joanna is an operative for the fictional Carrington Institute, where she was given the code name &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; in honor of her flawless performance in training tests. On her first mission, she is sent to extract a dataDyne defector. In the process, she uncovers a conspiracy between world&#x27;s biggest corporation dataDyne and a group of Skedars, extraterrestrials who have established an interstellar war against another alien race known as the Maians. The conspirators plan to steal a megaweapon from a crashed spacecraft on the Earth&#x27;s ocean floor and use it against the Maian homeworld. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Skedar also intend to test fire the weapon on Earth, destroying it in the process. With the help of a Maian bodyguard, Joanna manages to locate the megaweapon and destroy it. Afterward, she helps the Maians launch a counterattack against the Skedar homeworld, eliminating their High Priest, thereby issuing a devastating blow to morale.

Joanna returns in a Game Boy Color game, which is set one year prior to the Nintendo 64 title. Having completed her training successfully and earned the trust of Institute&#x27;s leader Daniel Carrington, Joanna is sent to the South American jungle, where she must destroy an illegal cyborg manufacturing facility. In the process, she witnessed an aircraft being shot down and made a note of the co-ordinates. As a result, she is ordered to investigate the crash site, where she eventually discovers that the wreckage belonged to the Skedar. In retaliation, the Institute is stormed by a dataDyne strike team to destroy any clues of the conspiracy, but Joanna ultimately stops it.

The 2005 prequel &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; takes place three years before the events of the Nintendo 64 game, where Joanna is a bounty hunter working with her father Jack. On their first mission, they rescue a scientist named Zeigler from the hands a Triad crime lord based out of Hong Kong. Zeigler discovered an ancient artifact in Africa which endows individuals with superhuman powers, hinted to have been built by the Maians. However, Zeigler is killed shortly after and Jack is captured by dataDyne, who too are interested in the artifact. Joanna later manages to rescue him from the palace of Zhang Li, the secretive founder of dataDyne, but Jack is eventually killed by Zhang Li&#x27;s daughter, Mai Hem. Joanna then finds her goals coinciding with those of the Carrington Institute. Taking advantage of their resources, Joanna avenges her father&#x27;s death by killing Mai Hem and later Zhang Li, who used the artifact on himself.

===In other media===
Joanna Dark is the primary protagonist in the &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; novels and comic books. In the first novel, &quot;Initial Vector&quot;, which is set six months after &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot;, Joanna finds herself living in the Carrington Institute grounds and must learn to trust Daniel Carrington, as well as uncovering a conspiracy that may influence on dataDyne&#x27;s new CEO election. The second novel, &quot;Second Front&quot;, follows Joanna as she attempts to stop a clandestine group of hackers responsible for some major accidents that allowed dataDyne to take over involved corporations. &quot;Janus&#x27; Tears&quot;, a six-issue American comic book which is set between both novels, focuses on Joanna&#x27;s attempts to unmask a mole in the Carrington Institute&#x27;s Los Angeles office.

==Promotion and reception==
In 2000, American model Michele Merkin portrayed the character in commercials and in-store promotions for the Nintendo 64 game cartridge. In 2001, Blue Box Toys produced a 12-inch action figure based on her appearance in the N64 game. The figure came with several in-game weapons and was available in two looks—one dressed in a body armor suit and the other in a black leather jumpsuit.

Joanna Dark is among Rare&#x27;s most well-known characters. In 2007, Tom&#x27;s Games included her on the list of the 50 greatest female characters in video game history, calling her &quot;all three Charlie&#x27;s Angels rolled into one&quot; and stating she should be played by Jessica Biel. In 2008, Spike featured Joanna Dark as sixth on their list of &quot;The Top Video Game Vixens&quot;, and &quot;The Age&quot; ranked her as the 20th greatest Xbox character of all time even as her &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; &quot;may not have been the greatest entry for&quot; her as opposed to the first game for the Nintendo consoles. In 2013, Scott Marley of &quot;Daily Record&quot; ranked her as the third most attractive female video game character. In 2015, &quot;Thanh Niên&quot; ranked this &quot;perfect spy&quot; as the fifth most sexy female video game character. The website &quot;GamingBolt&quot; named Joanna&#x27;s animated look in &quot;Perfect Dark Zero&quot; as fifth on their list of &quot;Worst Video Game Character Designs That Were Totally Disliked By Gamers&quot;, stating that the change &quot;did nothing for her character&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; elected Joanna Dark the 14th coolest videogame character, adding &quot;[w]hen James Bond goes to sleep, he dreams of being Joanna Dark.&quot; In 2013, Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed her as one of &quot;15 Kick-Ass Women in Videogames&quot;, asserting that &quot;Joanna was a standout heroine in a genre that trends, even now, toward hyper-masculinity.&quot; Despite this, Joanna was also criticized by &quot;Trigger Happy&quot; author Steven Poole, who described her character design as &quot;a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft&quot;, and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters. &quot;Complex&quot; considered Joanna one of the greatest heroines in video game history, praising her down-to-earth role in the original game. In 2018, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; editors stated that Joanna was one of their most wanted characters for the crossover fighting video game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; In 2021, Chris Morgan of &quot;Yardbarker&quot; described Joanna as one of &quot;the most memorable characters from old school Nintendo games&quot;.

<doc id="460446" wikidata="Q148669" url="?curid=460446" title="Ida Lupino">
<text>Ida Lupino (4 February 1918 – 3 August 1995) was a British actress, director, writer, and producer. Throughout her 48-year career, she appeared in 59 films and directed eight, working primarily in the United States, where she became a citizen in 1948. She is widely regarded as the most prominent female filmmaker working in the 1950s during the Hollywood studio system. With her independent production company, she co-wrote and co-produced several social-message films and became the first woman to direct a film noir, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker,&quot; in 1953.

Among Lupino&#x27;s other directed films, the best known are &quot;Not Wanted&quot; (1949), about unwed pregnancy (she took over for a sick director and refused directorial credit); &quot;Never Fear&quot; (1950), loosely based upon her own experiences battling paralyzing polio; &quot;Outrage&quot; (1950), one of the first films about rape; &quot;The Bigamist&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (1966). Her short yet immensely influential directorial career, tackling themes of women trapped by social conventions, usually under melodramatic or noir coverings, is a pioneering example of proto-feminist filmmaking.

As an actress, Lupino&#x27;s best known films are &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1939) with Basil Rathbone; &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940) with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart; &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941) with Bogart; &quot;The Sea Wolf&quot; (1941) with Edward G. Robinson and John Garfield; &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1941) with Louis Hayward; &quot;Moontide&quot; (1942) with Jean Gabin; &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1943); &quot;Deep Valley&quot; (1947) with Dane Clark; &quot;Road House&quot; (1948) with Cornel Wilde and Richard Widmark; &quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; (1956) with Dana Andrews and Vincent Price; and &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; (1972) with Steve McQueen.

Lupino also directed more than 100 episodes of television shows in a variety of genres, including westerns, supernatural tales, situation comedies, murder mysteries, and gangster stories. She was the only woman to direct an episode of the original &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; series (&quot;The Masks&quot;), and the only director to star in an episode (&quot;The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine&quot;).

==Early life and family==

Lupino was born at 33 Ardbeg Road in Herne Hill, London, to actress Connie O&#x27;Shea (also known as Connie Emerald) and music hall comedian Stanley Lupino, a member of the theatrical Lupino family, which included Lupino Lane, a song-and-dance man. Her great-grandfather, George Hook, changed his name to Lupino. Her father, a top name in musical comedy in the UK, encouraged her to perform at an early age. He built a backyard theatre for Lupino and her sister Rita (1921–2016), who also became an actress and dancer. Lupino wrote her first play at age seven and toured with a travelling theatre company as a child. By the age of ten, Lupino had memorised the leading female roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. After her childhood training for stage plays, Ida&#x27;s uncle Lupino Lane assisted her in moving towards film acting by getting her work as a background actress at British International Studios.

She wanted to be a writer, but to please her father Lupino enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She excelled in a number of &quot;bad girl&quot; film roles, often playing prostitutes. Lupino did not enjoy being an actress and felt uncomfortable with many of the early roles she was given. She felt that she was pushed into the profession due to her family history.
==Career==

===Actress===

Lupino made her first film appearance in &quot;The Love Race&quot; (1931) and the following year, aged 14, she worked under director Allan Dwan in &quot;Her First Affaire&quot;, in a role for which her mother had previously tested. She played leading roles in five British films in 1933 at Warner Bros.&#x27; Teddington studios and for Julius Hagen at Twickenham, including &quot;The Ghost Camera&quot; with John Mills and &quot;I Lived with You&quot; with Ivor Novello. She said of her early roles &quot;My father once said to me: &#x27;You&#x27;re born to be bad&#x27;, and it was true. I made eight films in England before I came to America, and I played a tramp or a slut in all of them&quot;.

Dubbed &quot;the English Jean Harlow&quot;, she was discovered by Paramount in the 1933 film &quot;Money for Speed&quot;, playing a good girl/bad girl dual role. Lupino claimed the talent scouts saw her play only the sweet girl in the film and not the part of the prostitute, so she was asked to try out for the lead role in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1933). When she arrived in Hollywood, the Paramount producers did not know what to make of their sultry potential leading lady, but she did get a five-year contract. While at Paramount, Lupino played the lead in a stage production of &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; at the Paramount Studio Theatre.

Lupino starred in over a dozen films in the mid-1930s, working with Columbia in a two-film deal, one of which, &quot;The Light That Failed&quot; (1939), was a role she acquired after running into the director&#x27;s office unannounced, demanding an audition. After this breakthrough performance as a spiteful cockney model who torments Ronald Colman, she began to be taken seriously as a dramatic actress. As a result, her parts improved during the 1940s, and she jokingly referred to herself as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Bette Davis&quot;, taking the roles that Davis refused.

Mark Hellinger, associate producer at Warner Bros., was impressed by Lupino&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Light That Failed&quot;, and hired her for the femme-fatale role in the Raoul Walsh-directed &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; (1940), opposite stars George Raft, Ann Sheridan and Humphrey Bogart. The film did well and the critical consensus was that Lupino stole the movie, particularly in her unhinged courtroom scene. Warner Bros. offered her a contract which she negotiated to include some freelance rights. She worked with Walsh and Bogart again in &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), where she impressed critic Bosley Crowther in her role as an &quot;adoring moll&quot;. 

Her performance in &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1943) won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. She starred in &quot;Pillow to Post&quot; (1945), which was her only comedic leading role. Although in demand throughout the 1940s, she arguably never became a major star although she often had top billing in her pictures, above actors such as Humphrey Bogart, and was repeatedly critically lauded for her realistic, direct acting style.

She often incurred the ire of studio boss Jack Warner by objecting to her casting, refusing poorly written roles that she felt were beneath her dignity as an actress, and making script revisions deemed unacceptable by the studio. As a result, she spent a great deal of her time at Warner Bros. suspended. In 1942, she rejected an offer to star with Ronald Reagan in &quot;Kings Row&quot;, and was immediately put on suspension at the studio. Eventually, a tentative rapprochement was brokered, but her relationship with the studio remained strained. After the drama &quot;Deep Valley&quot; (1947) finished shooting, neither Warner Bros. nor Lupino moved to renew her contract and she left the studio in 1947. She then appeared for 20th Century Fox as a nightclub singer in the film noir &quot;Road House&quot;, performing her musical numbers in the film. She starred in &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot; in 1951, and may have taken on some of the directing tasks of the film while director Nicholas Ray was ill.

===Director, writer and producer – The Filmakers Inc.===
While on suspension, Lupino had ample time to observe filming and editing processes, and she became interested in directing. She described how bored she was on set while &quot;someone else seemed to be doing all the interesting work&quot;, and said &quot;It&#x27;s so much more fun. Creating it yourself, not just parading in front of a camera&quot;.

She and her then-husband, producer and writer Collier Young, formed an independent company, The Filmakers Inc., to &quot;produce, direct, and write low-budget, issue-oriented films&quot;. It was formed in 1948 with Lupino as vice-president, Collier Young as president, and screenwriter Malvin Wald as treasurer. The Filmakers produced 12 feature films, six of which Lupino directed or co-directed, five of which she wrote or co-wrote, three of which she acted in, and one of which she co-produced. The Filmakers&#x27; mission was to make socially conscious films, encourage new talent, and bring realism to the screen. Their goal was to tell “how America lives” through independent B pictures shot in two weeks for less than US$200,000 with a creative &quot;family&quot;, &quot;the ring of truth&quot; emphasized by fact-based stories – a combination of &quot;social significance&quot; and entertainment. In short, low-budget pictures, they explored virtually taboo subjects such as rape in &quot;Outrage&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Bigamist&quot; (1953). The latter received rave reviews at the time of release, with Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;Filmakers&#x27; best offering, to date&quot;. Lupino&#x27;s best-known directorial effort, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;, a 1953 RKO release, is the only film noir from the genre&#x27;s classic period directed by a woman.

Her first directing job came unexpectedly in 1949 when director Elmer Clifton suffered a mild heart attack and was unable to finish &quot;Not Wanted&quot;, a film Lupino co-produced and co-wrote. Lupino stepped in to finish the film without taking directorial credit out of respect for Clifton. Although the film&#x27;s subject of out-of-wedlock pregnancy was controversial, it received a vast amount of publicity, and she was invited to discuss the film with Eleanor Roosevelt on a national radio program.

&quot;Never Fear&quot; (1949), a film about polio, which she had personally experienced at age 16 , was her first director&#x27;s credit. The film was noticed by Howard Hughes, who was looking for suppliers of low-budget feature films for distribution by his recently acquired RKO Pictures. Hughes agreed to put up financing and distribute The Filmakers&#x27; next three features through RKO, leaving The Filmakers total control over the content and the production of the films.
After producing four more films about social issues, including &quot;Outrage&quot; (1950), a film about rape (while this word is never used in the movie), Lupino directed her first hard-paced, all-male-cast film, &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; (1953), making her the first woman to direct a film noir.
Lupino once called herself a &quot;bulldozer&quot; to secure financing for her production company, but she referred to herself as &quot;mother&quot; while on set. The back of her director&#x27;s chair was labeled &quot;Mother of Us All&quot;. Her studio emphasized her femininity, often at the urging of Lupino herself. She said of her refusal to renew her contract with Warner Bros. &quot;I had decided that nothing lay ahead of me but the life of the neurotic star with no family and no home.&quot; She made a point to seem non-threatening in a male-dominated environment, stating, &quot;That&#x27;s where being a man makes a great deal of difference. I don&#x27;t suppose the men particularly care about leaving their wives and children. During the vacation period, the wife can always fly over and be with him. It&#x27;s difficult for a wife to say to her husband, come sit on the set and watch.&quot;

Although directing became Lupino&#x27;s passion, she continued acting to make enough money to make her own productions. She became a wily low-budget filmmaker, reusing sets from other studio productions and talking her physician into appearing as a doctor in the delivery scene of &quot;Not Wanted&quot;. She used what is now called product placement, placing Coca-Cola, United Airlines, Cadillac, and other brands in her films, such as &quot;The Bigamist.&quot; She was acutely conscious of budget considerations, planning scenes in pre-production to avoid technical mistakes and retakes, and shooting in public places such as MacArthur Park and Chinatown to avoid set-rental costs. She joked that if she had been the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Bette Davis&quot; as an actress, she had now become the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Don Siegel&quot; as a director.

The Filmakers production company ceased operations in 1955, and Lupino turned almost immediately to television, directing episodes of more than thirty US TV series from 1956 through 1968. She also directed a feature film in 1965, the Catholic schoolgirl comedy &quot;The Trouble With Angels&quot;, released in 1966, starring Hayley Mills and Rosalind Russell; this was Lupino&#x27;s last theatrical film as a director. She also continued acting, going on to a successful television career throughout the 1960s and 1970s.
===Television===
Lupino&#x27;s career as a director continued through 1968. Her directing efforts during these years were almost exclusively for television productions such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Honey West&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

After the demise of The Filmakers, Lupino continued working as an actress until the end of the 1970s, mainly in television. Lupino appeared in 19 episodes of &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot; from 1952 to 1956, an endeavor involving partners Charles Boyer, Dick Powell and David Niven. From January 1957 to September 1958, Lupino starred with her then-husband Howard Duff in the sitcom &quot;Mr. Adams and Eve&quot;, in which the duo played husband-and-wife film stars named Howard Adams and Eve Drake, living in Beverly Hills, California. Duff and Lupino also co-starred as themselves in 1959 in one of the 13 one-hour installments of &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; and an episode of &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; in 1960. Lupino guest-starred in numerous television shows, including &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; (1954), &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959), &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; (1963–64), &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1963–65), &quot;Batman&quot; (1968), &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1969), &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1969–70), &quot;The Wild, Wild West&quot; (1969), &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; (1971), &quot;Columbo: Short Fuse&quot; (1972), &quot;Columbo: Swan Song&quot; (1974) in which she plays Johnny Cash&#x27;s character&#x27;s zealous wife, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (1974), &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; (1975), &quot;Police Woman&quot; (1975), and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1977). Her final acting appearance was in the 1979 film &quot;My Boys Are Good Boys&quot;.

Lupino has two distinctions with &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; series, as the only woman to have directed an episode (&quot;The Masks&quot;) and the only person to have worked as both actor for one episode (&quot;The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine&quot;), and director for another.

==Themes==
Lupino&#x27;s Filmakers movies deal with unconventional and controversial subject matter that studio producers would not touch, including out-of-wedlock pregnancy, bigamy, and rape. She described her independent work as &quot;films that had social significance and yet were entertainment ... based on true stories, things the public could understand because they had happened or been of news value.&quot; She focused on women&#x27;s issues for many of her films and she liked strong characters, &quot;[Not] women who have masculine qualities about them, but [a role] that has intestinal fortitude, some guts to it.&quot;

In the film &quot;The Bigamist&quot;, the two women characters represent the career woman and the homemaker. The title character is married to a woman (Joan Fontaine) who, unable to have children, has devoted her energy to her career. While on one of many business trips, he meets a waitress (Lupino) with whom he has a child, and then marries her. Marsha Orgeron, in her book &quot;Hollywood Ambitions&quot;, describes these characters as &quot;struggling to figure out their place in environments that mirror the social constraints that Lupino faced&quot;. However, Donati, in his biography of Lupino, said &quot;The solutions to the character&#x27;s problems within the films were often conventional, even conservative, more reinforcing the 1950s&#x27; ideology than undercutting it.&quot;

Ahead of her time within the studio system, Lupino was intent on creating films that were rooted in reality. On &quot;Never Fear&quot;, Lupino said, &quot;People are tired of having the wool pulled over their eyes. They pay out good money for their theatre tickets and they want something in return. They want realism. And you can&#x27;t be realistic with the same glamorous mugs on the screen all the time.&quot;

Director Martin Scorsese noted that, &quot;As a star, Lupino had no taste for glamour, and the same was true as a director. The stories she told in &quot;Outrage&quot;, &quot;Never Fear&quot;, &quot;Hard, Fast and Beautiful&quot;, &quot;The Bigamist&quot; and &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot; were intimate, always set within a precise social milieu: she wanted to &quot;do pictures with poor, bewildered people, because that&#x27;s what we are.&quot; Her heroines were young women whose middle-class security was shattered by trauma – unwanted pregnancy, polio, rape, bigamy, parental abuse. There&#x27;s a sense of pain, panic and cruelty that colors every frame.&quot;

Lupino rejected the commodification of female stars, and as an actress she resisted becoming an object of desire. She said in 1949, &quot;Hollywood careers are perishable commodities&quot;, and sought to avoid such a fate for herself.

==Personal life==
=== Health ===
Lupino was diagnosed with polio in 1934. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the outbreak of polio within the Hollywood community was due to contaminated swimming pools. She recovered and eventually directed, produced, and wrote many films, including a film loosely based upon her travails with polio titled &quot;Never Fear&quot; in 1949, the first film that she was credited for directing (she had earlier stepped in for an ill director on &quot;Not Wanted&quot; and refused directorial credit out of respect for her colleague). Her experience with the disease gave her the courage to focus on her intellectual abilities over simply her physical appearance. In an interview with &quot;Hollywood&quot;, she said, &quot;I realized that my life and my courage and my hopes did not lie in my body. If that body was paralyzed, my brain could still work industriously...If I weren&#x27;t able to act, I would be able to write. Even if I weren&#x27;t able to use a pencil or typewriter, I could dictate.&quot; Film magazines from the 1930s and 1940s, such as &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;, frequently published updates on her condition. Lupino worked for various nonprofit organizations to raise funds for polio research.

Lupino&#x27;s interests outside the entertainment industry included writing short stories and children&#x27;s books, and composing music. Her composition &quot;Aladdin&#x27;s Suite&quot; was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra in 1937. She composed it while recovering from polio in 1935.

===Politics and religion===
She became an American citizen in June 1948 and she supported the presidency of John F. Kennedy. She was Catholic.

===Marriages===
Lupino was married and divorced three times. She married actor Louis Hayward in November 1938. They separated in May 1944 and divorced in May 1945.

Her second marriage was to producer Collier Young on 5 August 1948. They divorced in 1951. When Lupino filed for divorce in September that year, she was already pregnant from an affair with future husband Howard Duff. The child was born seven months after she filed for divorce from Young.

Lupino&#x27;s third and final marriage was to actor Howard Duff, whom she wed on 21 October 1951. Six months later, they had a daughter, Bridget, on 23 April 1952. They separated in 1966 and divorced in 1983.

She petitioned a California court in 1984 to appoint her business manager, Mary Ann Anderson, as her conservator due to poor business dealings from her prior business management company and her long separation from Howard Duff.

==Death==
Lupino died from a stroke while undergoing treatment for colon cancer in Los Angeles on 3 August 1995, at the age of 77. Her memoirs, &quot;Ida Lupino: Beyond the Camera&quot;, were edited after her death and published by Mary Ann Anderson.

==Influences and legacy==

Lupino learned filmmaking from everyone she observed on set, including William Ziegler, the cameraman for &quot;Not Wanted&quot;. When in preproduction on &quot;Never Fear&quot;, she conferred with Michael Gordon on directorial technique, organization, and plotting. Cinematographer Archie Stout said of Ms. Lupino, &quot;Ida has more knowledge of camera angles and lenses than any director I&#x27;ve ever worked with, with the exception of Victor Fleming. She knows how a woman looks on the screen and what light that woman should have, probably better than I do.&quot; Lupino also worked with editor Stanford Tischler, who said of her, &quot;She wasn&#x27;t the kind of director who would shoot something, then hope any flaws could be fixed in the cutting room. The acting was always there, to her credit.&quot;

Author Ally Acker compares Lupino to pioneering silent-film director Lois Weber for their focus on controversial, socially relevant topics. With their ambiguous endings, Lupino&#x27;s films never offered simple solutions for her troubled characters, and Acker finds parallels to her storytelling style in the work of the modern European &quot;New Wave&quot; directors, such as Margarethe von Trotta.

Film critic Ronnie Scheib, who issued a Kino release of three of Lupino&#x27;s films, likens Lupino&#x27;s themes and directorial style to directors Nicholas Ray, Sam Fuller, and Robert Aldrich, saying, &quot;Lupino very much belongs to that generation of modernist filmmakers.&quot; On whether Lupino should be considered a feminist filmmaker, Scheib states, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Lupino was concerned with showing strong people, men or women. She often said that she was interested in lost, bewildered people, and I think she was talking about the postwar trauma of people who couldn&#x27;t go home again.&quot;

Martin Scorsese calls Lupino&#x27;s thematic film work &quot;essential,&quot; noting that &quot;What is at stake in Lupino&#x27;s films is the psyche of the victim. [Her films] addressed the wounded soul and traced the slow, painful process of women trying to wrestle with despair and reclaim their lives. Her work is resilient, with a remarkable empathy for the fragile and the heart-broken.&quot;

Author Richard Koszarski noted Lupino&#x27;s choice to play with gender roles regarding women&#x27;s film stereotypes during the studio era: &quot;Her films display the obsessions and consistencies of a true auteur... In her films &quot;The Bigamist&quot; and &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;, Lupino was able to reduce the male to the same sort of dangerous, irrational force that women represented in most male-directed examples of Hollywood film noir.&quot;

Lupino did not consider herself a feminist, saying, &quot;I had to do something to fill up my time between contracts. Keeping a feminine approach is vital – men hate bossy females ... Often I pretended to a cameraman to know less than I did. That way I got more cooperation.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; writer Carrie Rickey, though, holds Lupino up as a model of modern feminist filmmaking: &quot;Not only did Lupino take control of production, direction, and screenplay, but [also] each of her movies addresses the brutal repercussions of sexuality, independence and dependence.&quot; By 1972, Lupino said she wished more women were hired as directors and producers in Hollywood, noting that only very powerful actresses or writers had the chance to work in the field. She directed or costarred a number of times with young, fellow British actresses on a similar journey of developing their American film careers like Hayley Mills and Pamela Franklin.

Actress Bea Arthur, best remembered for her work in &quot;Maude&quot; and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, was motivated to escape her stifling hometown by following in Lupino&#x27;s footsteps and becoming an actress, saying, &quot;My dream was to become a very small blonde movie star like Ida Lupino and those other women I saw up there on the screen during the Depression.&quot;

<doc id="460448" wikidata="Q17104916" url="?curid=460448" title="List of diving hazards and precautions">
<text>Divers face specific physical and health risks when they go underwater with scuba or other diving equipment, or use high pressure breathing gas. Some of these factors also affect people who work in raised pressure environments out of water, for example in caissons. This article lists hazards that a diver may be exposed to during a dive, and possible consequences of these hazards, with some details of the proximate causes of the listed consequences. A listing is also given of precautions that may be taken to reduce vulnerability, either by reducing the risk or mitigating the consequences. A hazard that is understood and acknowledged may present a lower risk if appropriate precautions are taken, and the consequences may be less severe if mitigation procedures are planned and in place.

A hazard is any agent or situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards remain dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, and when a hazard becomes active, and produces undesirable consequences, it is called an incident and may culminate in an emergency or accident. Hazard and vulnerability interact with likelihood of occurrence to create risk, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a specific hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of a specific activity. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. The assessed risk of a dive would generally be considered unacceptable if the diver is not expected to cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Commercial diving operations tend to be less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, who are less constrained by occupational health and safety legislation.

Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving are associated with certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.

Statistics show diving fatalities comparable to motor vehicle accidents of 16.4 per 100,000 divers and 16 per 100,000 drivers. Divers Alert Network 2014 data shows there are 3.174 million recreational scuba divers in America, of which 2.351 million dive 1 to 7 times per year and 823,000 dive 8 or more times per year. It is reasonable to say that the average would be in the neighbourhood of 5 dives per year.

Born in Farnworth, near Bolton, Lancashire, Maclean was the eldest son of John Maclean, a cordwainer originally of Tiree in the Inner Hebrides, and his wife Agnes Macmillan. His younger brother was Sir Ewen Maclean.
Maclean practiced as a solicitor with practices in Cardiff and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, London. A member of the Presbyterian Church of England, he was vice-president of the Cardiff Free Church Council in 1902–3, and also worked closely with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. He was a last-minute choice as one of the Liberal Party candidates in Bath at the 1900 general election, but was defeated at the polls. At the 1906 general election, he stood again and was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for the constituency. Whilst an MP, he voted in favour of the 1908 Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Bill.

He lost his seat at the January 1910 general election, but moved constituency at the December 1910 general election and was returned for Peebles and Selkirk, a seat he held until 1918. He then represented Peebles and South Midlothian between 1918 and 1922, losing in the 1922 United Kingdom general election, and then the Northern Division of Cornwall between 1929 and 1932.

Maclean was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1916, and was knighted in 1917. He was Leader of the Liberal Parliamentary Party from 1918 to 1920, as the leader of the Liberal Party, H. H. Asquith had lost his seat in the House of Commons. For those two years he also served as Leader of the Opposition, while Labour had no official leader and Sinn Féin had proclaimed the Irish Republic and the First Dail.

Towards the end of his life, Maclean joined the National Government headed by Ramsay MacDonald. He served as President of the Board of Education from 1931 to 1932.

He died from cardiovascular disease on 15 June 1932 at the age of sixty-eight.

==Family==

Maclean married Gwendolen Margaret Devitt (26 September 1880 – 23 July 1962), daughter of Andrew Devitt (1850–1931) and Jane Dales Morrison (1856–1947), on 2 October 1907. They are buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Penn, Buckinghamshire, together with their eldest son, Ian. The diplomat and spy, Donald Duart Maclean, was another of his sons; his ashes are also buried there. The couple also had two more sons and a daughter.

<text>Diving activities are the things people do while diving underwater. People may dive for various reasons, both personal and professional. While a newly qualified recreational diver may dive purely for the experience of diving, most divers have some additional reason for being underwater. Recreational diving is purely for enjoyment and has several specialisations and technical disciplines to provide more scope for varied activities for which specialist training can be offered, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving. Several underwater sports are available for exercise and competition.

There are various aspects of professional diving that range from part-time work to lifelong careers. Professionals in the recreational diving industry include instructor trainers, diving instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters, dive guides, and scuba technicians. A scuba diving tourism industry has developed to service recreational diving in regions with popular dive sites. Commercial diving is industry related and includes civil engineering tasks such as in oil exploration, offshore construction, dam maintenance and harbour works. Commercial divers may also be employed to perform tasks related to marine activities, such as naval diving, ships husbandry, marine salvage or aquaculture. Other specialist areas of diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. They can perform roles including direct combat, reconnaissance, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines, bomb disposal or engineering operations.

In civilian operations, police diving units perform search and rescue operations, and recover evidence. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service, sea rescue or lifeguard unit, and this may be classed as public safety diving. There are also professional media divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record the underwater world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve the underwater environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists.

The choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.

==Diving procedures==

The standard procedures and activities essential to safe diving in the chosen diving mode, using the chosen diving equipment, and in the chosen diving environment are inherently part of the activities of a dive. Monitoring the dive profile, gas supplies, decompression status, relative positions of the divers and communication associated with these are all standard operating procedures. Contingency procedures associated with the diving mode, equipment and foreseeable diversions from the dive plan may also be necessary. These activities may be considered as occurring in the background, as in most cases they are not the reason for the dive.

===Navigation===
Navigation is a common activity during dives. Diver navigation, termed &quot;underwater navigation&quot; by scuba divers, is a set of techniques—including observing natural features, the use of a compass, and surface observations—that divers use to navigate underwater. Free-divers do not spend enough time underwater for navigation to be important, and surface supplied divers are limited in the distance they can travel by the length of their umbilicals and are usually directed from the surface control point. On those occasions when they need to navigate they can use the same methods used by scuba divers. When it is critical for safety to return to a specific place, a distance line is generally used. This may be laid and left in place for other divers, or recovered on the return leg. Use of distance lines is standard in penetration diving, where the divers cannot ascend directly to the surface at all times, and it is possible to lose track of the route out to .

===Searches===

Searches are a fairly common diving activity, and may be the primary purpose of the dive, part of a more complex activity plan, or incidental. Underwater searches are procedures to find a known or suspected target object or objects in a specified search area under water. A search method attempts to provide full coverage of the search area, by using a search pattern, which should completely cover the search area without excessive redundancy or missed areas.

===Operation of special equipment===

A diver propulsion vehicle is a type of diving equipment sometimes used by scuba divers to increase range underwater. Range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, and the battery power of the DPV. Time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice. DPVs have recreational, scientific and military applications.

==Exploration==

There is often an element of exploration in diving activity, as it is common to dive in an unfamiliar place. This exploration may be casual or focused on gathering information which can be shared or recorded and published for use by others. A large part of the waters accessible to divers remains virtually unknown, and has not been surveyed or mapped in detail, and in many cases, has not yet been visited by divers. Exploration has been identified as one of the major motivations for recreational diving, but it is mostly casual and seldom results in recorded reports which can be of use to others.

==Underwater work==

Underwater work is usually done by professional divers who are paid for their work. The procedures are often regulated by legislation and codes of practice as it is an inherently hazardous occupation and the diver works as a member of a team. Due to the dangerous nature of some professional diving operations, specialized equipment such as an on-site hyperbaric chamber and diver-to-surface communication system is often required by law, and the mode of diving for some applications may be regulated.

There are several branches of professional diving, the best known of which is probably commercial diving and its specialised applications. There are also applications in scientific research, marine archaeology, fishing and aquaculture, public service, law enforcement, military service, media work and diver training. Specialist training may be required for some aspects of this work.

===Commercial diving===
Commercial diving may be considered an application of professional diving where the diver engages in underwater work for industrial, construction, engineering, maintenance or other commercial purposes which are similar to work done out of the water, and where the diving is usually secondary to the work.

====Offshore diving====

Commercial offshore diving, sometimes shortened to just offshore diving, generally refers to the branch of commercial diving, with divers working in support of the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry. The work in this area of the industry includes maintenance of oil platforms and the building of underwater structures. In this context &quot;&quot; implies that the diving work is done outside of national boundaries. Technically it also refers to any diving done in the international offshore waters outside of the territorial waters of a state, where national legislation does not apply. Most commercial offshore diving is in the exclusive economic zone of a state, and much of it is outside the territorial waters. The type of work includes tasks such as wellhead completion, submarine pipeline monitoring and inspection, assembly of manifolds and work on moorings, including rigging, lifting, and assembly of components.

====Salvage diving====

Salvage diving is the diving work associated with marine salvage, the recovery of all or part of ships, their cargoes, aircraft, and other vehicles and structures which have sunk or fallen into water. In the case of ships it may also refer to repair work done to make an abandoned or distressed but still floating vessel more suitable for towing or propulsion under its own power. The recreational/technical activity known as wreck diving is generally not considered salvage work, though some recovery of artifacts may be done by recreational divers.

Most salvage diving is commercial or military work, depending on the diving contractor and the purpose for the salvage operation, Similar underwater work may be done by divers as part of forensic investigations into accidents, in which case the procedures may be more closely allied with underwater archaeology than the more basic procedures of advantageous cost/benefit expected in commercial and military operations.

====Hazmat diving====

Hazmat diving generally refers to the presence of hazardous materials in the diving environment, but some classes of underwater work are inherently in a hazardous materials environment, including nuclear diving and sewer diving.

====Underwater inspection====

Inspection of underwater structures, installations, and sites is a common professional diving activity, applicable to planning, installation, and maintenance phases, but the required skills are often specific to the application. Much use is made of video and still photographic evidence, and live video to allow direction of the inspection work by the supervisor and topside specialists. Inspections may also involve surface preparation, often by cleaning, and non-destructive testing.

====Potable water diving====
Potable water diving is diving inside a tank that is used for potable water. This is usually done for inspection and cleaning tasks. A person who is trained to do this work may be described as a potable water diver. The risks to the diver associated with potable water diving are related to the access, confined spaces and outlets for the water. The risk of contamination of the water is managed by isolating the diver in a clean dry-suit and helmet or full-face mask which are decontaminated before the dive.

====Ships husbandry====

Ships husbandry is all aspects of maintenance, cleaning, and general upkeep of the hull, rigging, and equipment of a ship. It may also be used to refer to aspects of maintenance which are not specifically covered by the technical departments. The term is used in both naval and merchant shipping, but &#x27;naval vessel husbandry&#x27; may also be used for specific reference to naval vessels. Underwater ships husbandry includes hull cleaning, inspection, and some kinds of repair work.

====Underwater construction====

Underwater construction is industrial construction in an underwater environment. There is often, but not necessarily, a significant component of commercial diving involved. It is a part of the marine construction industry.
Concrete work is a common component of underwater construction, and may involve site clearing and preparation by suction dredging, airlifting, high pressure and abrasive waterjetting, in-water surface cleaning using brushcarts, shuttering and formwork, bagwork, and setup of reinforcement. Underwater concrete placement may be by tremie, pumped concrete, skip placement, or toggle bags.
Concrete repair, and assembly of pre-cast components often involves grouting. Other work may include fitting fixing bolts by drilling and core drilling, pipe installation (outfalls), pipeline support and protection, using mattresses for ballast and scour protection, and underwater welding.

====Underwater mining and mineral extraction====
*Underwater mining
*Diamonds off the Orange River mouth
*Amber in the Baltic sea (historical)
*Gold in rivers
===Military diving===

Underwater divers may be employed in any branch of an armed force, including the navy, army, marines, air force and coast guard.
Scope of operations includes: search and recovery, search and rescue, hydrographic survey, explosive ordnance disposal, demolition, underwater engineering, salvage, ships husbandry, reconnaissance, infiltration, sabotage, counterinfiltration, underwater combat and security.

Clearance diving, the removal of obstructions and hazards to navigation, is closely related to salvage diving, but has a different purpose, in that the objects to be removed are not intended to be recovered, just removed or reduced to a condition where they no longer constitute a hazard or obstruction. Many of the techniques and procedures used in clearance diving are also used in salvage work.

Submarine rescue is the process of locating a sunk submarine with survivors on board, and bringing the survivors to safety. This may be done by recovering the vessel to the surface first, or by transferring the trapped personnel to a rescue bell or deep-submergence rescue vehicle to bring them to the surface. Submarine rescue may be done at pressures between ambient at depth, and sea level atmospheric pressure, depending on the condition of the disabled vessel and the equipment used for the rescue. Associated diving work may include preparing the submarine for access by a rescue bell or rescue submersible, if the depth allows human intervention. Recent developments tend to favour the use of remotely operated vehicles dedicated to this application.

===Public service===


Public safety diving is underwater diving conducted as part of law enforcement and search and rescue. Their work includes underwater rescue, underwater recovery and underwater investigation conducted by divers working for or under the authority of municipal, state or federal agencies. These divers are typically members of police departments, sheriff&#x27;s offices, fire rescue agencies, search and rescue teams or providers of emergency medical services. Public safety divers differ from recreational, scientific and commercial divers who can generally plan the date, time, and location of a dive, and dive only if the conditions are conducive to the task. Public safety divers respond to emergencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and may be required to dive in the middle of the night, during inclement weather, in zero visibility &quot;black water,&quot; or in waters polluted by chemicals and biohazards. Much of their work involves Underwater searches.

Police diving is a branch of professional diving carried out by police services. Police divers are usually sworn police officers, and may either be employed full-time as divers or as general water police officers, or be volunteers who usually serve in other units but are called in if their diving services are required. The duties carried out by police divers include rescue diving for underwater casualties and search and recovery diving for evidence and bodies.

===Scientific===
Scientific diving is the use of underwater diving techniques by scientists to perform work underwater in the direct pursuit of scientific knowledge. Scientific divers are normally qualified scientists first and divers second, who use diving equipment and techniques as their way to get to the location of their fieldwork. The direct observation and manipulation of marine habitats afforded to scuba-equipped scientists have transformed the marine sciences generally, and marine biology and marine chemistry in particular. Underwater archeology and geology are other examples of sciences pursued underwater. Some scientific diving is carried out by universities in support of undergraduate or postgraduate research programs, and government bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the UK Environment Agency carry out scientific diving to recover samples of water, marine organisms and sea, lake or riverbed material to examine for signs of pollution.

Activities are widely varied and may include visual counts and measurements of organisms in situ, collection of samples, underwater surveys, photography, videography, video mosaicing, benthic coring, coral coring, and deployment, maintenance and retrieval of scientific equipment. Surveys include site surveys, geological surveys, baseline and monitoring ecological surveys, which may involve the use of transect and quadrat methodology. A bibliographic analysis of papers published between 1995 and 2006 that have been supported by scientific diving shows that diving supports scientific research through efficient and targeted sampling. Activities include collection of specimen organisms and biological samples, observing and recording animal behaviour, quantitative surveys, &quot;in situ&quot; measurements, impact studies, ecological analyses, evaluation of techniques, mapping underwater areas, profiling geology, and deploying and retrieving underwater equipment.

===Media and entertainment===
Media diving is underwater diving in support of the media industries, including the practice of underwater photography and underwater cinematography and underwater videography outside of normal recreational interests. Media diving is often carried out in support of television documentaries featuring underwater photography or footage. Media divers are normally highly skilled camera operators who use diving as a method to reach their workplace, although some underwater photographers start as recreational divers and move on to make a living from their hobby. Equipment in this field is varied with scuba and surface supplied equipment used, depending on requirements, but rebreathers are often used for wildlife related work as they are normally quiet, release few or no bubbles and allow the diver a lengthy bottom time with a reduced risk of frightening off the subject.

===Tourism===

Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism. The diving activity most associated with work in the diving tourism industry is leading dives.
Dive leader is the title of an internationally recognised recreational diving certification for the occupation of &quot;dive guide&quot;, which is a specialist underwater application of &quot;tour guide&quot;. Several other titles are also used, including &quot;Divemaster&quot;. This is a role that includes organising and leading recreational dives, particularly in a professional capacity,

===Diver training===
Diver training is the set of processes through which a person learns the necessary and desirable skills to safely dive underwater within the scope of the diver training standard relevant to the specific training programme. Most diver training follows procedures and schedules laid down in the associated training standard, in a formal training programme, and includes practical skills training in the safe use of the associated equipment in the specified underwater environment, and assessment of the required skills and knowledge deemed necessary by the certification agency to allow the newly certified diver to dive within the specified range of conditions at an acceptable level of risk. Practical training and assessment of skills largely occurs underwater, in the presence of a diving instructor, who is responsible for the safety of the trainee while under instruction or assessment.

===Aquaculture, fishing and harvesting of organisms underwater===
Aquaculture is the controlled cultivation (&quot;farming&quot;) of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. lotus). involves cultivating freshwater, brackish water and saltwater populations under controlled or semi-natural conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. There are many underwater activities associated with aquaculture which can be done by divers, including monitoring stock health and fish pen maintenance.

Spearfishing is a method of fishing that involves impaling the fish with a straight pointed object such as a spear, gig or harpoon. It has been deployed in artisanal fishing throughout the world for millennia. Modern spearfishing usually involves the use of underwater swimming gear and slingshot-like elastic powered spearguns or compressed gas powered pneumatic spearguns, which launch a tethered underwater projectile to strike the target fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish. Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling or scuba diving techniques.

Abalone, lobster, sea urchins and various other marine invertebrates can be collected by hand or with the assistance of hand tools while diving.

Pearl hunting is the activity of recovering pearls from wild molluscs, usually oysters or mussels, in the sea or freshwater. Pearl hunting was prevalent in the Persian Gulf region and Japan for thousands of years. On the northern and north-western coast of Western Australia pearl diving began in the 1850s, where the term also covers diving for nacre or mother of pearl found in what were known as pearl shells. In most cases the pearl-bearing molluscs live at depths where they are not manually accessible from the surface. Historically the molluscs were retrieved by freediving, When the standard diving suit became available it was applied to pearl hunting.

Sponge diving, is diving to collect soft natural sponges for human use as personal cleaning tools. It is one of the oldest known underwater diving activities, dating back to classical times, and was also originally a freediving activity which later made use of the standard diving helmet.

==Recreational activities==
Professional diving is done where the job is, but recreational divers have the freedom to choose where they dive, based on convenience, cost, their chosen underwater activities, and the characteristics of the environment at the available dive sites. Many recreational divers dive mainly in their home waters, but others will travel to sites where their preferences are more likely to be available.

Scuba diving tourism is the industry based on servicing the requirements of recreational divers at destinations other than where they live. It includes aspects of training, equipment sales, rental and service, guided experiences and environmental tourism.

Motivations to travel for scuba diving are complex and may vary considerably during the diver&#x27;s development and experience. Participation can vary from once off to multiple dedicated trips per year over several decades. The popular destinations fall into several groups, including tropical reefs, shipwrecks and cave systems, each frequented by its own group of enthusiasts, with some overlap. Temperate and inland open water reef sites are generally dived by people who live relatively nearby.

Shark tourism is a form of eco-tourism that allows people to dive with sharks in their natural environment. This benefits local shark populations by educating tourists and through funds raised by the shark tourism industry. People can get close to the sharks by freediving or scuba diving or by entering the water in a protective cage for more aggressive species.

===Scuba activities===


There are many recreational diving activities, and several equipment and environmental specialties which require skills additional to those provided by the entry level courses, These skills were originally developed by trial and error, but training programmes are offered by most diver training agencies for the convenience of the diver, and profit for the agency, or in the case of club oriented systems, for the overall benefit of the club community: 
*Cave and cavern diving is underwater diving in water-filled caves. It may be done as an extreme sport, a way of exploring flooded caves for scientific investigation, or for the search for and recovery of divers lost as a result of one of these activities. The equipment used varies depending on the circumstances, but almost all cave diving is done using scuba equipment, often in specialised configurations with redundancies. Recreational cave diving is generally considered to be a type of technical diving due to the lack of a free surface during large parts of the dive, and often involves planned decompression stops. A distinction is made by recreational diver training agencies between cave diving and cavern diving, where cavern diving is deemed to be diving in those parts of a cave where the exit to open water can be seen by natural light. An arbitrary distance limit to the open water surface may also be specified.
*Muck diving gets its name from the sediment that lies on the bottom at many dive sites - a frequently muddy or &quot;mucky&quot; environment. Other than muddy sediment, the muck dive substrate may consist of dead coral skeletons, garbage and natural detritus. The visibility is usually less than on the reef or wreck sites of the area. However, the sediment and detritus environment has a different ecology to the reef, and the &quot;muck&quot; substrate can be the habitat for unusual, exotic and juvenile organisms that are not found in the cleaner reef sites.
*Recreational diving is diving for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment, and usually refers to scuba diving for recreational purposes, where the diver is not constrained from making a direct near-vertical ascent to the surface at any point during the dive, and risk is considered low. The equipment used for recreational diving is mostly open circuit scuba, though semi closed and fully automated electronic closed circuit rebreathers may be included in the scope of recreational diving. Risk is managed by training the diver in a range of standardised procedures and skills appropriate to the equipment the diver chooses to use and the environment in which the diver plans to dive. Further experience and development of skills by practice will improve the diver&#x27;s ability to dive safely. Specialty training is made available by the recreational diver training industry and diving clubs to increase the range of environments and venues the diver can enjoy at an acceptable level of risk. Reasons to dive and preferred diving activities may vary during the personal development of a recreational diver, and may depend on their psychological profile and their level of dedication to the activity. Most divers average less than eight dives per year, but some total several thousand dives over a few decades and continue diving into their 60s and 70s, occasionally older. Recreational divers may frequent local dive sites or dive as tourists at more distant venues known for desirable underwater environments.
*Scuba finswimming, officially named &quot;Immersion finswimming with breathing apparatus&quot;, is underwater competitive swimming using mask, monofin and underwater breathing apparatus conducted in a swimming pool. While there are no requirements on how a breathing apparatus is carried, it cannot be exchanged or abandoned during a race. 
*Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the agency-specified limits of recreational diving for non-professional purposes. Technical diving may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to a greater risk of serious injury or death. The risk may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The skills may be developed through appropriate specialised training and experience. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, and multiple gas sources.
*Underwater citizen science is the scientific research and monitoring for projects for which members of the public collect, categorize, transcribe or analyze scientific data. It is an increasingly popular but underutilised collaboration between society and scientific research, in which members of the recreational scuba diving community actively participate in marine data acquisition and recording, largely by way of geolocated photographic observations collected during recreational dives, but also in more structured and long term experimental work.
*Underwater photography is the process of taking photographs while under water. It is usually done while scuba diving, but can also be done while diving on surface supply, or freediving. Underwater photography can be categorised as an art form and a method for recording data. Successful underwater imaging is usually done with specialized equipment and techniques, and it offers unusual and rare photographic opportunities and subjects. 
*Underwater orienteering is a competitive underwater sport that uses recreational open circuit scuba equipment, fins, a compass and a counter meter to measure the distance covered. The competition consists of a set of individual and team events conducted in both sheltered and open water testing the competitors&#x27; speed and accuracy in underwater navigation around accurately surveyed courses marked by buoys.
*Underwater videography is the branch of electronic underwater photography concerned with capturing underwater moving images as a recreational diving, scientific, commercial, documentary, or filmmaking activity. 
*Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom. Some wreck diving involves penetration of the wreckage, making a direct ascent to the surface impossible for a part of the dive.

===Freediving activities===

Freediving is a form of underwater diving that relies on breath-holding until resurfacing rather than the use of breathing apparatus such as scuba gear. Besides the limits of breath-hold, immersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure also have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in freediving. Examples of freediving activities are traditional fishing techniques, competitive and non-competitive freediving, competitive and non-competitive spearfishing and freediving photography, synchronised swimming, underwater football, underwater rugby, underwater hockey, underwater target shooting and snorkeling. There are also a range of &quot;competitive apnea&quot; disciplines; in which competitors attempt to attain great depths, times, or distances on a single breath:
*Aquathlon, also known as underwater wrestling, is an underwater sport, where two competitors wearing masks and fins wrestle underwater in an attempt to remove a ribbon from each other&#x27;s ankle band to win the bout. The &quot;combat&quot; takes place in a square ring within a swimming pool, and is made up of three 30-second rounds, with a fourth round played in the event of a tie. 
*Finswimming is an underwater competitive sport consisting of four techniques involving swimming with the use of fins, either on the water&#x27;s surface using a snorkel and with either a monofins or bifins, or underwater with a monofin. Three of the disciplines are on breath-hold, and one on scuba. Events take place over distances similar to swimming competitions for both swimming pool and venues.
* Recreational hunting and gathering, including non-competitive spearfishing, usually for food.
*Competitive spearfishing is &quot;the hunting and capture of fish underwater without the aid of artificial breathing devices, using gear that depends entirely on the physical strength of the competitor.&quot;
*Underwater football is a two-team underwater sport is played in a swimming pool with snorkeling equipment: (mask, snorkel, and fins). The goal of the game is to manoeuvre (by carrying and passing) a slightly negatively buoyant ball from one side of a pool to the other by players who are completely submerged.
*Underwater hockey (also known as Octopush in the United Kingdom) is a globally played limited-contact sport in which two teams compete to manoeuvre a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the opposing team&#x27;s goal by propelling it with a hockey stick (or pusher). A key challenge of the game is that it is played on breath-hold. 
*Underwater ice hockey is played upside-down underneath the ice on frozen pools or ponds. Participants wear diving masks, fins and wetsuits and use the underside of the frozen surface as the playing area for a buoyant puck. Competitors do not use breathing apparatus, and must surface for air as required.
*Underwater rugby is an underwater team sport. During a match two teams try to score a negatively buoyant ball (filled with saltwater) into the opponents’ goal at the bottom of a swimming pool. It has little in common with rugby football except for the name. 
*Underwater target shooting is combined underwater sport and shooting sport that tests a competitors’ ability to accurately use a speargun in a set of individual and team events conducted in a swimming pool using freediving or Apnoea technique.

==Training and skills development==

The skills of underwater diving include some skills which are only needed in an emergency. These skills should be exercised sufficiently to ensure that if the emergency occurs, the diver is able to deal with it promptly and effectively. Skills practice can be done as part of a dive for other purposes, or in a dive dedicated to maintaining and developing the skills. Divers who do not dive sufficiently often to maintain basic skills may need to do refresher courses or s when returning to active diving. New skills may require dedicated practice to bring them up to a reliable standard.

==Familiarisation with equipment==
New equipment or a modification to equipment configuration may affect the diver&#x27;s ability to operate the equipment or respond effectively to a problem. A common example is checking buoyancy control with a new diving suit, buoyancy compensator, cylinder configuration, or weighting system, or an unfamiliar model of rebreather. Buoyancy testing is done with the cylinders nearly empty, to ensure that the diver can maintain neutral buoyancy at the end of a dive during decompression, even if contingency use has depleted the reserve gas supplies. In many cases, testing new equipment does not require a special dive, as any problems will be noticed immediately, and either fixed or the dive can be safely aborted.

==Response to an emergency==

Both foreseeable and not reasonably foreseeable emergencies can occur during a dive. Dealing with them in some way is necessary, and may involve the diver in self-rescue, the buddy, in assistance to the other buddy, or the safety diver or stand-by diver in assistance to the diver or divers in difficulty. Response to an emergency happening to someone else may lead to public safety diving team involvement. Special circumstances like flooded cave rescues, entrapment in capsized vessels, and rescues from other disasters may involve larger groups.

==Emergency recompression==

In-water recompression (IWR) is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) by returning the diver underwater to help the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a procedure that exposes the diver to significant risk which should be compared with the risk associated with the other available options. Some authorities recommend that it is only to be used when the time to travel to the nearest recompression chamber is too long to save the victim&#x27;s life, others take a more pragmatic approach, and accept that in some circumstances IWR is the best available option. The risks may not be justified for case of mild symptoms likely to resolve spontaneously, or for cases where the diver is likely to be unsafe in the water, but in-water recompression may be justified in cases where severe outcomes are likely, if conducted by a competent and suitably equipped team.

==Classification of underwater diving activities by occupational field==

This is a table of underwater diving activities classified by occupational field and the diving modes usually associated with them. The mode may be dictated by the regulations or codes of practice governing the field of occupation.

<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, nest algebras are a class of operator algebras that generalise the upper-triangular matrix algebras to a Hilbert space context. They were introduced by and have many interesting properties. They are non-selfadjoint algebras, are closed in the weak operator topology and are reflexive.

Nest algebras are among the simplest examples of commutative subspace lattice algebras. Indeed, they are formally defined as the algebra of bounded operators leaving invariant each subspace contained in a subspace nest, that is, a set of subspaces which is totally ordered by inclusion and is also a complete lattice. Since the orthogonal projections corresponding to the subspaces in a nest commute, nests are commutative subspace lattices.

By way of an example, let us apply this definition to recover the finite-dimensional upper-triangular matrices. Let us work in the formula_1-dimensional complex vector space formula_2, and let formula_3 be the standard basis. For formula_4, let formula_5 be the formula_6-dimensional subspace of formula_2 spanned by the first formula_6 basis vectors formula_9. Let

:formula_10

then &quot;N&quot; is a subspace nest, and the corresponding nest algebra of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; complex matrices &quot;M&quot; leaving each subspace in &quot;N&quot; invariant   that is, satisfying formula_11 for each &quot;S&quot; in &quot;N&quot; – is precisely the set of upper-triangular matrices.

If we omit one or more of the subspaces &quot;Sj&quot; from &quot;N&quot; then the corresponding nest algebra consists of block upper-triangular matrices.

==Properties==
* Nest algebras are hyperreflexive with distance constant 1.

<text>Nancy Walker (born Anna Myrtle Swoyer; May 10, 1922 – March 25, 1992) was an American actress and comedian of stage, screen, and television. She was also a film and television director (lending her talents to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, on which she also made several guest appearances). During her five-decade-long career, she had long-running roles as Mildred on &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; and as Ida Morgenstern on several episodes of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and on the spinoff series &quot;Rhoda&quot; as a prominent recurring character.

==Early life==
She was born Anna Myrtle Swoyer in Philadelphia to vaudevillian parents, the elder of two daughters. When she was 10 months old, she made her debut in vaudeville alongside her parents. She decided to become an actress at the age of 10. 

==Acting career==

In 1937, as &quot;Nan Barto&quot;, Walker appeared on the NBC radio programs &quot;Coast to Coast on a Bus&quot; and &quot;Our Barn.&quot; She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in &quot;Best Foot Forward.&quot; The role provided Walker with her film debut, when she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in the 1943 film version, starring Lucille Ball. She also appeared with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland in the second film version of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; (1943). Her next film, &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;, in which she had a featured musical number backed by Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra, &quot;Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet&quot;, ended Walker&#x27;s contract with MGM.

She continued acting throughout the 1940s and 1950s, originating the roles of Hildy Eszterhazy (&quot;I Can Cook, Too!&quot;) in &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944), Yetta Samovar in &quot;Barefoot Boy with Cheek&quot; (1947), and Lily Malloy in &quot;Look, Ma, I&#x27;m Dancin&#x27;!&quot; (1948) on Broadway. She was nominated for a Tony Award in 1956 for her work in the musical revue &quot;Phoenix &#x27;55&quot;, and again in 1960 for her performance in &quot;Do Re Mi&quot;, opposite Phil Silvers.

Walker also starred in the short-lived Broadway musical comedy &quot;Copper and Brass&quot; in 1957, and appeared in the 1958 New York City Center production of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;. For the early 1970s revival of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, she appeared again opposite Silvers, playing the character of Domina. Owing to her television contractual responsibilities, she was unable to transfer with the show to Broadway. Her musical appearances led to record releases, including &quot;I Hate Men&quot; (1959; with Sid Bass and his orchestra, featuring such show tunes as &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot;, and &quot;You Irritate Me So&quot;); the cover featured Walker humorously sticking male dolls with pins.

Dozens of television guest appearances and recurring roles followed, providing her with steady work. Her career spanned five decades and included comedies, dramas, and television variety shows such as &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot;, &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

In the 1960–61 television season, she appeared in two episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot;. In 1970, she secured a recurring role as Emily, the housekeeper, on the television series &quot;Family Affair&quot;, which starred Brian Keith. After five seasons, though, the ratings of &quot;Family Affair&quot; had plummeted opposite NBC&#x27;s popular &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;. The series was canceled at the end of that season.

In 1970, she also made her first appearance playing Ida Morgenstern, the mother of Valerie Harper&#x27;s character Rhoda Morgenstern on the first season of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. The role proved to be ideal for her. The episode that introduced her character, &quot;Support Your Local Mother&quot;, was so well received that it won an Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in a Comedy Series for James L. Brooks and Allan Burns. Walker thereafter became an annual guest star on the show for the next three years. When the MTM spinoff series &quot;Rhoda&quot; premiered in 1974, Walker was a regular cast member in 41 episodes.

From 1971 to 1976, she was a regular on the successful Rock Hudson detective series &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, playing the McMillans&#x27; housekeeper, Mildred. During the first two years of &quot;Rhoda&quot;, Walker was not featured every week, so she was able to shuttle back and forth between the CBS sitcom and the NBC detective series. These two roles brought her seven Emmy Award nominations. In 1976, ABC-TV offered Walker a contract to headline her own series, &quot;The Nancy Walker Show&quot;, which was produced by Norman Lear&#x27;s production company, in which she starred as Nancy Kittredge, a talent agent. Walker appeared on a second-season episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

Before she filmed the first episode of the series, Walker made her only appearance on &quot;Rhoda&quot; for the 1976–77 season. In the season premiere, &quot;The Separation&quot;, Rhoda (Valerie Harper) and her husband Joe (David Groh) decide to separate. Rhoda tries to keep the news from her mother Ida (Walker), since Ida is about to embark on a year-long trip across America with Rhoda&#x27;s father (Harold Gould). Ida learns the truth from Rhoda prior to Ida&#x27;s departure.

One of Walker&#x27;s last major film roles was in the 1976 all-star comedy spoof &quot;Murder by Death&quot;. She continued to remain active in show business until her death, playing Rosie, a New Jersey diner waitress,appearing in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;as Sophia&#x27;s sister Angela, in a series of commercials for Bounty paper towels from 1970 to 1990. She helped make the product&#x27;s slogan, &quot;the quicker picker-upper&quot;, a common catchphrase. She credited the towel commercials with landing her the role of Ida Morgenstern.

In 1990, Walker began starring on the Fox sitcom &quot;True Colors&quot; as Sara Bower, the outspoken mother of Ellen Davis Freeman (Stephanie Faracy), who moves into Ellen&#x27;s household despite having objections to her daughter&#x27;s interracial marriage. In 1990, Walker appeared as herself in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Uneasy Lies the Crown&quot;.

==Directing career==
Walker had guest starred as Rhoda&#x27;s mother Ida Morgenstern in several episodes of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, and continued that role in its spin-off &quot;Rhoda&quot;. After establishing the character, Walker directed some episodes of both series, along with episodes of other situation comedy series.

In 1980, Walker made her feature-film directorial debut, directing disco group The Village People and Olympian Bruce Jenner in the pseudo-biographical musical &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;. The film was a box-office failure, and Walker&#x27;s sole feature-film directorial credit. After the film, she did some stage and television directing, including three episodes of the situation comedy &quot;Alice&quot;.

==Personal life==
Walker was married twice. Her first husband was Gar Moore, whom she wed on August 1, 1948. They divorced within 10 months. She remarried, to musical theater teacher David Craig on January 29, 1951. Craig died in 1998 at the age of 75 from lung cancer.

Walker was also a close friend of actor Montgomery Clift. Biographer Patricia Bosworth stated the two first met in 1948, but did not become good friends until 10 years later, after Clift&#x27;s disfiguring car accident. Bosworth adds that Walker would sustain him as his dearest friend for the rest of his life; their relationship was one of mutual support – whereas most of Clift&#x27;s friends assumed he needed to be looked after, or else left alone, Walker stated, &quot;he needed to be needed&quot;, adding &quot;I liked his face better after the accident; his strength &quot;shone&quot; through.&quot; Clift nicknamed friends for whom he felt particular affection, and he called Walker &quot;Nanny&quot;.

Walker was a Democrat who supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Walker died of lung cancer on March 25, 1992, at age 69, in Studio City, California.

<text>John Julius Cooper, 2nd Viscount Norwich, (15 September 1929 – 1 June 2018), known as John Julius Norwich, was an English popular historian, travel writer, and television personality.

==Biography==
===Youth===
Norwich was born at the Alfred House Nursing Home on Portland Place in Marylebone, London, on 15 September 1929. He was the son of the Conservative politician and diplomat Duff Cooper, later Viscount Norwich, and of Lady Diana Manners, a celebrated beauty and society figure. He was given the name &quot;Julius&quot; in part because he was born by caesarean section. Such was his mother&#x27;s fame as an actress and beauty that the birth attracted a crowd outside the nursing home and hundreds of letters of congratulations. Through his father, he was descended from King William IV and his mistress Dorothea Jordan.

He was educated at Egerton House School in Dorset Square, London, later becoming a boarder at the school when it was evacuated to Northamptonshire before the outbreak of the Second World War. Because his father as Minister of Information was high on the Nazi enemies list of British politicians, Norwich&#x27;s parents feared for their son&#x27;s safety in the event of a German invasion of Britain. In 1940 they decided to send him away after the US ambassador to Britain, Joseph P. Kennedy, offered to bring him to the United States with other evacuee children on board the . He attended Upper Canada College, Toronto, Canada, and spent his holidays with the family of William S. Paley on Long Island in New York. In 1942 he returned to Britain, where he attended Eton College. After the war, he studied at the University of Strasbourg while his father was ambassador to France. He completed his national service in the Royal Navy before taking a degree in French and Russian at New College, Oxford.

===Career===
Joining the British Foreign Service after Oxford, Cooper served in Yugoslavia and Lebanon and as a member of the British delegation to the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. On his father&#x27;s death in 1954, he inherited the title of Viscount Norwich, created for his father, Duff Cooper, in 1952. This gave him a right to sit in the House of Lords, though he lost this right with the House of Lords Act 1999.

In 1964, Norwich left the diplomatic service to become a writer. His subsequent books included histories of Sicily under the Normans (1967, 1970), Venice (1977, 1981), the Byzantine Empire (1988, 1992, 1995), the Mediterranean (2006) and the Papacy (2011), amongst others (see list below). He also served as editor of series such as &quot;Great Architecture of the World&quot;, &quot;The Italian World&quot;, &quot;The New Shell Guides to Great Britain&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Art&quot; and the &quot;Duff Cooper Diaries&quot;.

Norwich worked extensively in radio and television. He was host of the BBC radio panel game &quot;My Word!&quot; for four years (1978–82) and also a regional contestant on &quot;Round Britain Quiz&quot;. He wrote and presented some 30 television documentaries, including &quot;The Fall of Constantinople&quot;, &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days&quot;, &quot;Cortés and Montezuma&quot;, &quot;The Antiquities of Turkey&quot;, &quot;The Gates of Asia&quot;, &quot;Maximilian of Mexico&quot;, &quot;Toussaint l&#x27;Ouverture of Haiti&quot;, &quot;The Knights of Malta&quot;, &quot;Treasure Houses of Britain&quot;, and &quot;The Death of the Prince Imperial in the Zulu War&quot;.

Norwich also worked for various charitable projects. He was the chairman of the Venice in Peril Fund, honorary chairman of the World Monuments Fund, a member of the General Committee of Save Venice, and a vice-president of the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies. For many years he was a member of the Executive Committee of the National Trust, and also served on the board of the English National Opera. Norwich was also a patron of SHARE Community, which provides vocational training to disabled people.

====&quot;Christmas Crackers&quot;====
&quot;Christmas Crackers&quot; were compiled from whatever attracted Norwich: letters and diaries and gravestones and poems, boastful &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entries, indexes from biographies, word games such as palindromes, holorhymes and mnemonics, occasionally in untranslated Greek, French, Latin, German or whatever language they were sourced from, as well as such oddities as a review from the American outdoors magazine &quot;Field and Stream&quot; concerning the republication of &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

His final &quot;Christmas Cracker&quot; was the 49th. It was put together during the early part of 2018 and he corrected the final proofs from his hospital bed before he died on 1 June 2018.

===Personal life===
Norwich&#x27;s first wife was Anne Frances May Clifford, daughter of the Hon. Sir Bede Clifford; they had one daughter, the Hon. Artemis Cooper, a historian, and a son, the Hon. Jason Charles Duff Bede Cooper, an architect. After their divorce, Norwich married his second wife, the Hon. Mary (Makins) Philipps, daughter of The 1st Baron Sherfield.

Norwich was also the father of Allegra Huston, born of his affair with the American ballet dancer Enrica Soma while she was married to the American film director John Huston.

Norwich lived for much of his life in a large detached Victorian house in Warwick Avenue, in the heart of Little Venice in Maida Vale, London, very close to Regent&#x27;s Canal. He died at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in London on 1 June 2018, aged 88.

<doc id="460466" wikidata="Q239354" url="?curid=460466" title="Dymphna">
<text>Dymphna (also Dimpna, Dymfna, Dimfna, Dympna and Dympha, Irish also Damhnait or Davnet) is a Christian saint honoured in Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. According to tradition, she lived in the 7th century and was martyred by her father.

The story of Dymphna was first recorded in the 13th century by a canon of the Church of Aubert of Avranches at Cambrai, France. It was commissioned by Guiard of Laon, the Bishop of Cambrai (1238–1248).

According to oral tradition, the bones of St. Dymphna were discovered and produced a miracle: a dead man was revived after being beaten with her bones. This event was regarded as proof of the miraculous power of her relics. This story could go back to a variation of the Bible story from 2 Kings 13:21, in which a dead man was brought back to life through contact with the bones of the Prophet Elisha.

The author expressly stated that his work was based upon a long-standing oral tradition as well as a persuasive history of miraculous healings of the mentally ill. 

==Name==
Dymphna&#x27;s name (pronounced or ) derives from the Irish (&#x27;poet&#x27;) and suffix (&#x27;little&#x27; or &#x27;feminine&#x27;), therefore meaning &#x27;poetess&#x27;. It is also spelled Dimpna, Dymphnart, Dympna or Damnat; this last spelling is closer to the Irish spelling Damhnait ().

==Story of her life and death==

According to Catholic and Orthodox tradition, Dymphna was born in Ireland in the 7th century. Dymphna&#x27;s father Damon was a petty king of Oriel. Her mother was a devout Christian.

When Dymphna was 14 years old, she consecrated herself to Christ and took a vow of chastity. Shortly thereafter, her mother died. Damon had loved his wife deeply, and in the aftermath of her death his mental health sharply deteriorated. Eventually the king&#x27;s counsellors pressed him to remarry. Damon agreed, but only on the condition that his bride would be as beautiful as his deceased wife. After searching fruitlessly, Damon began to desire his daughter because of her strong resemblance to her mother.
When Dymphna learned of her father&#x27;s intentions, she swore to uphold her vows and fled his court along with her confessor Father Gerebernus, two trusted servants, and the king&#x27;s fool. Together they sailed towards the continent, eventually landing in what is present-day Belgium, where they took refuge in the town of Gheel (now spelled &#x27;Geel&#x27;).

One tradition states that once settled in Geel, Dymphna built a hospice for the poor and sick of the region. However, it was through the use of her wealth that her father would eventually ascertain her whereabouts, as some of the coins used enabled her father to trace them to Belgium. Damon sent his agents to pursue his daughter and her companions. When their hiding place was discovered, Damon travelled to Geel to recover his daughter. Damon ordered his soldiers to kill Gerebernus and tried to force Dymphna to return with him to Ireland, but she resisted. Furious, Damon drew his sword and struck off his daughter&#x27;s head. She was said to have been 15 years old when she died. After Dymphna and Gerebernus were killed, the residents of Geel buried them in a nearby cave. Years later, they decided to move the remains to a more suitable location.

In 1349 a church honouring Dymphna was built in Geel. By 1480, so many pilgrims were coming from all over Europe, seeking treatment for psychiatric disorders that the church housing for them was expanded. Soon the sanctuary for those considered &quot;mad&quot; was again full to overflowing, and the townspeople began taking them into their own homes. Thus began a tradition for the ongoing care of those with psychiatric conditions that has endured for over 500 years and is still studied and admired today. Patients were, and still are, taken into the homes of Geel&#x27;s inhabitants. Never called patients, they are called boarders, and are treated as ordinary and useful members of the town. They are treated as members of the host family. They work, most often in menial labour, and in return, they become part of the community. Some stay a few months, some decades, some for their entire lives. At its peak in the 1930s, over 4,000 &#x27;boarders&#x27; were housed with the town&#x27;s inhabitants.

==Veneration==

The remains of Dymphna were later put into a silver reliquary and placed in a church in Geel named in her honour. The remains of Gerebernus were moved to Xanten, Germany. During the late 15th century the original St. Dymphna Church in Geel burned down. A second &quot;Church of St. Dymphna&quot; was then built and consecrated in 1532. The church still stands on the site where her body is believed to have first been buried.

Dymphna was beheaded on 30 May, although the year of her death is uncertain. A transfer of her relics occurred on 15 May of a subsequent year, the anniversary of which became her primary feast day until the 21st century, when the post-conciliar &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; (the authoritative compendium of feast days for the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church) assigned Dymphna&#x27;s feast to the anniversary of her martyrdom, on 30 May, as listed in the 2004 edition.

Dymphna is known as the Lily of Éire, due to her spotless virtue. She is traditionally portrayed wearing a crown, dressed in ermine and royal robes, and holding a sword. In modern versions she holds the sword awkwardly, as it symbolises her martyrdom, but in the older versions seen on numerous statues and stained glass images, her sword is pricking the neck of a demon; symbolising her title of Demon Slayer. She is also often portrayed holding a lamp, with the chained devil at her feet.

Some modern holy cards portray Dymphna in green and white, holding a book and white lilies.

During the 2022 season, the St Dymphna&#x27;s Church, in Geel, Belgium, commemorated her by hosting an exposition showing the restored altarpiece venerating Dymphna by Goossen Van der Weyden.

==Patronage==

Dymphna is the patron saint of mental illness.

The US National Shrine of St. Dymphna is located inside St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Massillon, Ohio. The shrine was destroyed by a fire in 2015, but reopened in December 2016 and is still open to pilgrims and visitors. St. Dymphna&#x27;s Special School is located in Ballina, County Mayo, Republic of Ireland and operates under the patronage of Western Care Association.

<text>Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari (; 29 May 194020 October 2010) was a Pakistani politician who served as the eighth president of Pakistan from 14 November 1993 until resigning on 2 December 1997. He was the first Baloch to be elected as President.

Born into a Baloch tribal and influential feudal family, Leghari was educated at Aitchison College, the Forman Christian College in Pakistan, and St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford in United Kingdom. Upon return from the UK, he sat for the Civil Services Exam in 1964 and started his career as a civil servant, remained commissioner sargodha division, prior to getting in to politics in 1973 and tenured as Senator representing the Punjab on the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) platform from 1975 to 1977. He contested the 1977 he won the National Assembly Elections on Pakistan People&#x27;s Party ticket and was appointed Minister for Industries. In 1980s, he led demonstrations aimed against President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s administration and successfully ran in general elections held in 1988. From 1990 to 1993, he worked under Benazir Bhutto as her deputy Leader of the Opposition and participated in the 1993 Pakistani general elections.

His credentials and reputation eventually led him to secure a nomination for the presidency by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and was elected as President in 1993. However, he began receiving criticism over the controversial appointments of Senior Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and was implicated in Mehran Bank scandal. Differences began to emerge with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on policy issues in 1995 and he surprisingly dismissed his leader&#x27;s government in 1996. His political ambitions later clashed with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his intervention to retain Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice finally led to his resignation in 1997. He remained active in politics starting his own Political Party &quot;Millat Party&quot; which was party of the &quot;National Alliance&quot; in the 2002 General Elections, the party merged into the PML(Q) in 2004. He returned to the National Assembly in 2008 Elections. Leghari died from a long-term heart illness at the Combined Military Hospital in Rawalpindi on 20 October 2010.

==Biography==

Farooq Leghari was born on 2 May 1940 in Choti Zareen, a village located in Dera Ghazi Khan District, Punjab, British India. The prefix &quot;Sardar&quot;, a title of nobility, added before his name that indicated the &quot;Tumandar&quot; (Chief) of his Leghari Tribe. Leghari&#x27;s family was a Baloch of Punjab and known for its wealth. Many of its members served as hereditary chiefs, and the family has remained active in politics since the British Raj. His mother was a Pashtun from Mardan district; one of his sisters married the son of the Nawab of Kalabagh. Leghari was 185 cm tall. His father, &quot;Nawabzada&quot; Muhammad Khan Leghari and his grandfather &quot;Khan Bahadur Nawab&quot; Sir Muhammad Jamal Khan Leghari were progressive leaders who modernised their tribe. His father took prominent part in the Pakistan Movement and was confined as a political prisoner in 1946. After the partition of India, his father served as minister in the provincial government of Punjab from 1949 until 1955.

Farooq Leghari was initially schooled at the famed Aitchison College in Lahore where he was the &quot;College Prefect&quot; and &quot;Head Boy&quot; and graduated at top of his class winning the coveted &quot;Rivaz Gold Medal&quot; for the &quot;Best Graduating Student&quot; in 1957. He went onto attend the Forman Christian College University where he gained BA with Honours in Economics in 1960. He went to United Kingdom to attend the St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford where he received master&#x27;s degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE).

Leghari was an avid and competitive sportsman and played tennis, captaining the Aitchison College Tennis team and became a regular on the polo field. In 1974, he represented Pakistan as shooter in 7th Asian Games held in Tehran, Iran. Farooq Leghari was the major landowner in the country and owned approximately of land. After the death of Farooq Khan Leghari, his son Jamal Khan Leghari became the 23rd Chief of Leghari tribe.

===Civil service and politics===

Upon returning to Pakistan, he joined the Central Superior Services (CSS) in 1964 and worked as civil servant in East Pakistan before returning to Pakistan. In 1973, he resigned from the civil service and joined the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on the invitation of Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In 1975, he was elected as Senator for Punjab and participated in general elections held in 1977 in the DG Khan constituency. He was appointed Minister of Defence Production and was appointed Secretary-General of the PPP in 1978.

In 1980s, he became known as a leading figure of presiding mass demonstrations against President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s administration and was imprisoned several times by Police. Leghari participated in general elections held in 1988 in DG Khan&#x27;s constituency. He was appointed Minister for Water and Power under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. His term was abruptly ended by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan after his dismissal of Prime Minister Bhutto and successfully defended his constituency in general elections held in 1990. He served as Deputy Leader of the Opposition under Benazir Bhutto, serving in opposition against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

In 1993, he witnessed the resignations of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and joined the caretaker cabinet of caretaker Prime Minister Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi as Finance Minister. During this period, he presided over the 21st Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Karachi from 25 to 29 April 1993. He successfully participated well in general elections held in 1993 and retained his seat in the National Assembly as he was the only PPP member from Dera Ghazi Khan.

Leghari was named and appointed Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 13 November 1993 but soon won the nomination for the presidency.

==President of Pakistan==

His credentials and &quot;clean reputation&quot; as opposed to politicians accused of mass corruption and white collar crimes won him the support from Prime Minister Bhutto and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). He accepted the nomination and ran in the presidential elections against Wasim Sajjad, the Acting President and PML(N) nominee by Nawaz Sharif.

As a result of indirect voting, Leghari received 274 votes in his favour against 168 votes for Wasim Sajjad. On 13 November 1993, Sardar Farooq Leghari was appointed the President of Pakistan for a term of five years. He vowed to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan and expressed his support for Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. However, no bill was ever presented to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. The law and order situation in the country worsened, especially in Karachi where the police operation resulted in various and unaccountable deaths.

In 1994–95, a major scandal was revealed by the sting operation led by the FIA that gained national attention. Known as the Mehrangate, Leghari&#x27;s and Bhutto&#x27;s name was implicated in the corruption scandal in news media. However, the PPP forcefully suppressed the FIA&#x27;s investigations and judicial inquires as well as media coverage. Leghari supported the Bhutto administration&#x27;s internal and foreign policies and staunchly backed Prime Minister Bhutto&#x27;s initiatives at the national level. Leghari met with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Queen Elizabeth when she paid a state visit to Pakistan during his tenure as president.

His political relations with Benazir Bhutto drifted apart over on policy issues concerning the internal politics and judicial nominations for the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 1996. In 1993, Leghari confirmed the nomination of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of Pakistan who was known to be closer to the PPP&#x27;s ideology. In 1994, Prime Minister Bhutto nominated 20 senior judges for the appointment to the Supreme Court; of which, 13 had political relations with the PPP. Some of the nominated judges had not been practised judges and controversial reputations in the law circles. The PPP government began pressuring Chief Justice Shah to dissuade him from taking up to appeals against the nominations. President Leghari backed Chief Justice Shah over the appointment and confirmations that created problems with the Prime Minister Bhutto who saw this as a conspiracy being hatch by the Chief Justice Shah. Notoriety over the confirmations of additional judges in the High Courts further maligned Leghari&#x27;s image as the appointments were seen as &quot;inappropriate.&quot;

The situation with Prime Minister Bhutto further escalated when President Leghari raised issue of senior ministers&#x27; involvement in corruption and Asif Ali Zardari&#x27;s appointment as Investment Minister. Leghari also suspected Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari involvement in controversial murder of Murtaza Bhutto that occurred in 1996, despite Prime Minister Bhutto hinted Leghari&#x27;s involvement. On October–November 1996, there were several meetings between President Leghari and Prime Minister Bhutto to resolve the issue but the two sides used the intelligence community against each other. The economic recession further escalated the situation and President Leghari surprisingly dismissed the Benazir&#x27;s administration using the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution on charges of corruption, economic recession, lawlessness and extra judicial killings.

=== Resignation and post-presidency ===
A caretaker set-up was formed under Acting Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid and general elections were held in 1997 that witnessed the return of Nawaz Sharif with a heavy mandate in all over the country. Prime Minister Sharif decisively removed the Eighth Amendment by approving the Thirteenth Amendment and oversaw its complete effect that ultimately made President Leghari as figurehead. Leghari sought the nomination for the second term but the chances of his re-election were diminished due to PPP&#x27;s dilution in the Parliament.

Problems between Chief Justice Shah and Prime Minister Sharif further escalated when Chief Justice Shah decided to listen to appeals against the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment bills and the PML(N) partisan attacked the Shah&#x27;s court in 1997. President Leghari tried intervened in the matter in support of Chief Justice Shah but this only made it worse for Leghari when Prime Minister Sharif decided to bring the impeachment movement against President Leghari. On 2 December 1997, President Leghari resigned from the presidency to avoid the possible impeachment which also resulted in the resignation of the Chief Justice Shah, also the same year.

His post-presidency marked with his active involvement in politics when he found the Millat Party which entered into a coalition of seven parties, known as the National Alliance, to participate in the general elections held in 2002. The National Alliance won enough seats in the National Assembly to form government as a coalition with the PML(Q) that was supported by President Pervez Musharraf. In 2004, he left his own party and joined the PML(Q) and supported his son, Awais Leghari, becoming the cabinet member. His elder son, Jamal Leghari, was elected as member of Senate on PML(Q) platform.

In 2003, Leghari reportedly remarked that he had dismissed Prime Minister Bhutto after the rules of conducts were violated, while responding to the criticism by the PPP.

<text>Domenico Mustafà (16 April 1829 – 17 March 1912) was an Italian castrato singer, composer and choir director.

==Life==
Domenico Mustafà was born in the comune of Sellano, province of Perugia, and had been castrated due to a bite from a pig.

He became a famous soprano castrato with the Cappella Sistina in the Vatican. He was particularly admired for his performances of Handelian music. At his prime, Mustafà possessed a voice of superior strength and beauty, and he mastered the trills and coloraturas to the utmost perfection. According to Franz Habock, he had a voice &quot;as sweet and pleasant as that of a woman&quot; with a usable range of at least 2 octaves from C4 to C6.

Mustafà was also a composer—among his works were a famous &quot;Miserere&quot; and &quot;Tu es Petrus secundum magnum.&quot; Admitted to the Cappella Sistina in Rome as a chorister in 1848, he soon became famous for his singing, intelligence, and gifts as a composer. In 1855 he made his debut as a composer in a &quot;Miserere&quot; for six voices, with high acclaim. Five years later, in 1860, he was appointed as choir director by the pope Leo XIII.

Being a man of great honour and responsibility, he was eventually nominated as a possible candidate, and finally elected, for the post of &quot;Direttore Perpetuo&quot; of the Sistine Chapel in 1878. However, even before 1878, he was already involved in directing the Chapel after the death of its former director Giuseppe Baini. Also, he was an honoured lifetime member and president of the musical organisation &quot;Società Musicale Romana&quot; in Rome.

He came close to returning to the operatic stage when Richard Wagner considered casting him as Klingsor in &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1882. However, the whole idea was abandoned shortly afterwards due to a role confusion—the emasculated Klingsor was not a castrato, but a eunuch castrated past puberty and thus singing baritone, not soprano.

Domenico Mustafà was also a teacher and he gave music lessons to the famous French soprano Emma Calvé in 1892. Here he taught Calvé to employ her famous &quot;fourth voice&quot;, which was a very high and refined falsetto extending to an unearthly disembodied D6. Calvé, after hearing Mustafà perform the thrill, described it as: &quot;strange, sexless, superhuman, uncanny.&quot;

In person Mustafà was tall and broad, rather plump, very stylish and charismatic in countenance—in older age, he always wore glasses due to his failing sight. In private he was always mild, receptive and talkative—he often used to add a joke or two or an anecdote during a conversation. He was highly praised for his intelligence and deep insights into the musical aspects.

Being a director of the Sistine Chapel, he nevertheless decided to withdraw in 1902 on the grounds of high age—appointing Lorenzo Perosi as his successor for the post of director. This was after 54 years of service in the papal chapel. The resignation was accepted in January 1903, when he left Rome. He then retired to a luxurious villa in Montefalco where he spent the rest of his life, where he was occasionally visited by his friends and relatives.

He died in his home in 1912, and was buried in the cemetery of Montefalco, Umbria, where his large tomb stands to this day. Mustafà&#x27;s role as a director in the Sistine Chapel is considered to be of great importance, and a book about his life was written by Alberto de Angelis and released in 1926. His home villa, &quot;Villa Mustafà&quot;, was turned into a hotel, and is now open to visitors and tourists, serving also as a museum in his memory.

<text>Muhammad Rafiq Tarar (; ; 2 November 1929 – 7 March 2022) was a Pakistani politician and jurist who served as the ninth president of Pakistan from January 1998 until his resignation in June 2001, and prior to that as a senator from Punjab in 1997. Before entering politics, Tarar served as senior justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan from 1992 to 1994 and as the 28th Chief Justice of Lahore High Court from 1989 to 1991.

Tarar was born in Mandi Bahauddin, and graduated with LLB from University of the Punjab in 1951, before starting practice as a lawyer in Lahore High Court the following year. In 1966, he pursued a career as a jurist. Tarar later served as a justice in Pakistan&#x27;s highest courts. After his retirement at 65, he started a political career as a legal advisor to Nawaz Sharif. Tarar became a senator from Punjab in 1997 and the same year nominated as presidential candidate by PML-N, but his nomination paper was rejected by the Acting Chief Election Commissioner. Barrister Ijaz Husain Batalvi assisted by M. A. Zafar and Akhtar Aly Kureshy Advocate, challenged his rejection in Lahore High Court and the Full Bench set aside the rejection order of the Election Commission and he was elected president of Pakistan in the presidential election by a margin of 374 out of 457 votes of the Electoral College.

Tarar assumed office in January 1998 with heavy criticism by opposition especially from former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who accused him of illegally legitimizing dismissal of her government as a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. As head of state, Tarar shifted Pakistan&#x27;s system of government from semi-presidential system to parliamentary democratic system by signing the Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment. He surrendered his reserve power of dismissing the Prime Minister, triggering new elections and dissolving the National Assembly. He also signed the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendment to the constitution that limited the powers of the presidency from executive to a figurehead.

Tarar resigned as President in 2001 in the wake of the 1999 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état. He resisted and did not endorse the 12 October 1999 military coup. He was forced to step down by then Chief Executive Pervez Musharraf and ultimately succeeded by Musharraf through a referendum held in 2002. Twenty months after seizing power in a coup, General Musharraf took the head of state&#x27;s oath and became the fourth military ruler to become president.

==Early life and education==
Muhammad Rafiq Tarar was born in Mandi Bahauddin, British India, on 2 November 1929 to a Tarar family. Tarar was influenced by Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari and he took a part in political sessions of Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam during British colonial rule. In his college years, he was also an activist for the All-India Muslim League and was a follower of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. During the partition of India, Tarar performed voluntary duty as a relief worker in camps set up by the All India Muslim Students Federation for Indian emigrants. He graduated with BA in Islamic Studies from Government Islamia College, Gujranwala in 1949. He acquired LLB degree in 1951 from Punjab University Law College.

==Judicial and political career==
Tarar started a career as a lawyer, soon after completion of his studies. In 1951, he enrolled as a pleader in the Lahore High Court. He started practicing as an advocate in the same court, in later years. He established a Gujranwala-based legal aid firm in 1960s and excelled at advocacy. In 1966, Tarar started a judicial career after he appeared and passed the competitive exams to be elevated as session judge in District Courts. In 1971, he became Chairman of the Punjab Labor Court. Tarar was appointed a judge at Lahore High Court, highest appellate judicial court of Punjab province, in October 1974.
Tarar served in the Lahore High Court as a justice for decades. He was also a member of the Election Commission of Pakistan where he represented Punjab. He was appointed the 28th Chief Justice of Lahore High Court where he served from 1989 to 1991 until his appointment as a judge in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. His appointment was made by then president Ghulam Ishaq Khan with the consent of Supreme Judicial Council. He served as a senior justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan from January 1992 to November 1994. He was also an awaiting candidate of the Chief Justice of Pakistan but he retired earlier on attaining the age of 65 years and started a political career. In 1994, following his retirement from the judiciary, Tarar entered into politics and started a political career as a legal adviser and close aide to then opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. In March 1997, he became a senator and represented Punjab in the upper-house of Pakistan until his resignation in December 1997. He was nominated as the presidential candidate by the PML(N) in the same year and secured a historical victory in the presidential election.

==Presidency (1998–2001)==
===Initial days===
After Farooq Leghari&#x27;s resignation in 1997, he was nominated as a candidate for the president of Pakistan. On 31 December 1997, in an indirect election, Tarar was elected by a huge margin, getting 374 of 457 votes of the Electoral College against Aftab Mirani of PPP (a PML(N)&#x27;s rival) who got 31 votes, and Muhammad Khan Shirani of JUI(S) who got 22 votes. This was the largest margin in such elections. Upon his election, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto delivered a speech in London to the Commonwealth Ethnic Bar Association and criticized his election. She accused him of being dishonest by saying &quot;A former judge [Tarar] who dishonestly legitimized the overthrow of my first government was elected president of Pakistan. This same man stands accused by a former President Farooq Leghari of taking briefcases of money to bribe other judges in the famous 1997 case. The Election Commission rejected Justice Tarar&#x27;s nomination for the presidency. Justice Qayyum, on leave for his mother&#x27;s funeral, rushed back to grant a stay, and Tarar was elected. As for the bribery charges, Tarar, as a former judge, like former generals, is immune to prosecution in real terms.&quot;

===Nuclear Program===
During his tenure as President, Tarar played a significant role in Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program. Advised by his brother, Colonel Muzafar Tarar, Tarar pursued policies aimed at enhancing the country&#x27;s nuclear capabilities. Colonel Tarar&#x27;s insights and expertise, particularly regarding Bhutto&#x27;s nuclear program, became instrumental in guiding Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear policy during their tenure. The successful continuation and advancement of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear program became one of the highlights of their joint efforts. In addition to his contributions to the nuclear program, Tarar focused on issues related to law and order, education, and social welfare during his presidency. He advocated for the strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law, promoting harmony and understanding among different segments of Pakistani society. His family remains influential in the country&#x27;s political landscape. Colonel Tarar served in the Pakistan Army and held various command positions during his military career. Colonel Tarar is renowned for his invaluable contributions to Pakistan&#x27;s national security, particularly in the realm of the nuclear program. Colonel Tarar&#x27;s strategic advice and expertise were pivotal in shaping Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear policy, ensuring the successful continuation and advancement of the program. His insights into Bhutto&#x27;s nuclear art program, shared with President Tarar, played a crucial role in guiding Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear strategy during their tenure. After retiring from the military, Colonel Tarar has been involved in philanthropic activities, supporting initiatives aimed at the welfare of veterans and their families.

===Constitutional reforms===
Upon becoming President, Tarar was an unassuming and merely ceremonial figurehead who kept a low profile, and avoided news media, and he remained a devoted servant and loyalist of the Sharif family. He readily signed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan that limited the powers of the presidency.

The President of Pakistan&#x27;s powers had thus been slowly removed over the years, culminating in the 1997 Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan which removed virtually all remaining reserve powers, making the office almost entirely symbolic in nature as per the true spirit of the Pakistani constitution.

===Resignation===
Tarar did not endorse the 1999 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état by the Pakistani military which elevated General Pervez Musharraf, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, since he was an appointee of Nawaz Sharif. The Pakistani military thus decided not to retain Tarar as the President for his full term of five years, given his partisan attitude. On 21 June 2001, General Musharraf who acted as Chief Executive in capacity, enforced the Legal Framework Order, 2002; Musharraf removed Tarar as he read the paragraph: &quot;Mr. Muhammad Rafiq Tarar has ceased to hold the office of the President with immediate effect.&quot;

==Death==
Tarar retired from politics and settled in Lahore, where he died after a long illness on 7 March 2022, at the age of 92.

<doc id="460478" wikidata="Q7307359" url="?curid=460478" title="Reflexive operator algebra">
<text>In functional analysis, a reflexive [[operator algebra]] &quot;A&quot; is an operator algebra that has enough invariant subspaces to characterize it. Formally, &quot;A&quot; is reflexive if it is equal to the algebra of bounded operators which leave invariant each subspace left invariant by every operator in &quot;A&quot;.

This should not be confused with a reflexive space.

== Examples ==

Nest algebras are examples of reflexive operator algebras. In finite dimensions, these are simply algebras of all matrices of a given size whose nonzero entries lie in an upper-triangular pattern.

In fact if we fix any pattern of entries in an &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix containing the diagonal, then the set of all &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrices whose nonzero entries lie in this pattern forms a reflexive algebra.

An example of an algebra which is &quot;not&quot; reflexive is the set of 2 × 2 matrices

:formula_1

This algebra is smaller than the Nest algebra

:formula_2

but has the same invariant subspaces, so it is not reflexive.

If &quot;T&quot; is a fixed &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix then the set of all polynomials in &quot;T&quot; and the identity operator forms a unital operator algebra. A theorem of Deddens and Fillmore states that this algebra is reflexive if and only if the largest two blocks in the Jordan normal form of &quot;T&quot; differ in size by at most one. For example, the algebra

:formula_3

which is equal to the set of all polynomials in

:formula_4

and the identity is reflexive.

== Hyper-reflexivity ==

Let formula_5 be a weak*-closed operator algebra contained in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), the set of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; and for &quot;T&quot; any operator in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), let

:formula_6

Observe that &quot;P&quot; is a projection involved in this supremum precisely if the range of &quot;P&quot; is an invariant subspace of formula_5.

The algebra formula_5 is reflexive if and only if for every &quot;T&quot; in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;):

:formula_9

We note that for any &quot;T&quot; in &quot;B(H)&quot; the following inequality is satisfied:

:formula_10

Here formula_11 is the distance of &quot;T&quot; from the algebra, namely the smallest norm of an operator &quot;T-A&quot; where A runs over the algebra. We call formula_5 hyperreflexive if there is a constant &quot;K&quot; such that for every operator &quot;T&quot; in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;),

:formula_13

The smallest such &quot;K&quot; is called the distance constant for formula_5. A hyper-reflexive operator algebra is automatically reflexive.

In the case of a reflexive algebra of matrices with nonzero entries specified by a given pattern, the problem of finding the distance constant can be rephrased as a matrix-filling problem: if we fill the entries in the complement of the pattern with arbitrary entries, what choice of entries in the pattern gives the smallest operator norm?

== Examples ==

* Every finite-dimensional reflexive algebra is hyper-reflexive. However, there are examples of infinite-dimensional reflexive operator algebras which are not hyper-reflexive.
* The distance constant for a one-dimensional algebra is 1.
* Nest algebras are hyper-reflexive with distance constant 1.
* Many von Neumann algebras are hyper-reflexive, but it is not known if they all are.
* A type I von Neumann algebra is hyper-reflexive with distance constant at most 2.

<text>Ludhiana () is the most populous city in the Indian state of Punjab. The city has an estimated population of 1,618,879 2011 census and distributed over , making Ludhiana the most densely populated urban centre in the state. It is a major industrial center of Northern India, referred to as &quot;India&#x27;s Manchester&quot; by the BBC. It is also known as the commercial capital of Punjab.

It stands on the old bank of Sutlej River, that is now to the south of its present course. The Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has placed Ludhiana on the 48th position among the top 100 smart cities, and the city has been ranked as one of the easiest cities in India for business according to the World Bank.

== History ==

During the period of Tughlaq dynasty of Delhi Sultanate, a fort was built at modern day Ludhiana. It was captured by Raja Jasrat during his 1421–22 campaign in Punjab. Later, Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling Lodi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The ruling sultan, Sikandar Lodi, dispatched two ruling chiefs, Yusuf Khan and Nihad Khan, to re-assert Lodi control. The two men camped at the site of present Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusuf Khan crossed the Sutlej and established Sultanpur, while Nihad Khan founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota.

The name was originally &quot;Lodi-ana&quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Lodi town&quot;, which has since shifted from &quot;Lodiana&quot; to the present form of Ludhiana. The Lodi Fort, or &quot;Purana Qila&quot;, is the only surviving structure in the city from this period; located in the neighbourhood of Fatehgarh, it was well-maintained under Ranjit Singh and the British after him, but then fell into disrepair. It was declared a state-protected monument in December 2013.

The Semi Centennial Celebration of the American Presbyterian Lodiana Mission was held in Ludhiana from 3–7 December 1884.

Ludhiana&#x27;s Old City includes landmarks like the Lodhi Fort, Daresi Grounds, The Clock Tower, &amp; Sood Family Haveli.
== Geography ==
Ludhiana is located at . It has an average elevation of . Ludhiana City, to its residents, consists of the Old City and the New City. The new city primarily consists of the Civil Lines area which was historically known as the residential and official quarters of the colonial British encampment.

The Old Fort was at the banks of the Sutlej (and now houses the College of Textile Engineering). Legend has it that a tunnel connects it to the fort in Phillaur– although why this should be is debatable, as the Sutlej was the traditional dividing line between the principalities, often occupied by enemy forces (see History section).

The tree of largest natural extraction was the kikar, or &quot;Acacia Indica&quot;, but has been supplanted by the eucalyptus, transplanted from rural Australia in the late 1950s by the Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon.

=== Climate ===
Ludhiana features a relatively dry monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, although bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with three defined seasons; summer, monsoon and winter. Ludhiana on an average sees roughly of precipitation annually. The official weather station for the city is in the compound of the Civil Surgeon&#x27;s Office to the west of Ludhiana.

<text>Viscount Hood, of Whitley in the County of Warwick, is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1796 for the famous naval commander Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Baron Hood. He had already been created a Baronet, of Catherington, in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 20 May 1778, and Baron Hood, of Catherington in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1782.

In 1795, his wife Susannah Linzee was created Baroness Hood, of Catherington in the County of Southampton, in her own right, in the Peerage of Great Britain. They were both succeeded by their son Henry, the second viscount. His grandson, the third viscount, assumed in 1840 by royal licence the additional surname of Tibbits, which was that of his father-in-law. His great-grandson, the sixth viscount, was a diplomat and notably served as Minister at the British Embassy in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and as Deputy Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office between 1962 and 1969. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s nephew, the eighth viscount, who succeeded his father in 1999.

Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport, was the younger brother of the first Viscount Hood. In 1794, he had been created &quot;Baron Bridport&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his great-nephew Samuel Hood, the second son of the second Viscount Hood, who succeeded to the barony on Lord Bridport&#x27;s death in 1814, while the viscountcy became extinct. In 1868, the latter&#x27;s son, the third baron, was again created Viscount Bridport (see this title for later history of these peerages). Also, Alexander Hood, uncle of the first Viscount Hood and first Viscount Bridport, was the ancestor of the Fuller-Acland-Hood Baronets of St Audries and the Barons St Audries. Rear-Admiral Sir Horace Hood, younger son of the fourth Viscount Hood, was also a distinguished naval commander.

The family seat is Loders Court, near Bridport, Dorset.

<doc id="460499" wikidata="Q47564" url="?curid=460499" title="Mediterranean diet">
<text>The Mediterranean diet is a concept first invented in 1975 by the American biologist Ancel Keys and chemist Margaret Keys. The diet took inspiration from the eating habits and traditional food typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy, and formulated in the early 1960s. It is distinct from Mediterranean cuisine, which covers the actual cuisines of the Mediterranean countries, and from the Atlantic diet of northwestern Spain and Portugal. While inspired by a specific time and place, the &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; was later refined based on the results of multiple scientific studies.

This approach emphasizes a plant-based diet, focusing on unprocessed cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. It also includes moderate consumption of fish, dairy products (mostly cheese and yogurt), and a low amount of red meat. Olive oil has been studied as a potential health factor for reducing all-cause mortality and the risk of chronic diseases.

The Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in observational studies. A 2017 review provided evidence that the Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of heart disease and early death. The Mediterranean diet may help with weight loss in obese people. The Mediterranean diet is one of three healthy diets recommended in the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, along with the DASH diet and vegetarian diet.

==Health effects==
A 2017 review found evidence that practice of a Mediterranean diet could lead to reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and early death. A 2018 review showed that practice of the Mediterranean diet may improve overall health status, such as reduced risk of non-infectious diseases, reduced total costs of living, and reduced costs for national healthcare. A 2016 review found similar weight loss as other diets. A 2019 Cochrane review found that there is still uncertainty regarding the effects of Mediterranean‐style diet advice on cardiovascular disease occurrence and risk factors in people both with and without existing cardiovascular disease.

The US 2015–2020 national guidelines devised a &quot;Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern&quot;, assessed against and mirroring the Mediterranean diet patterns and its positive health outcomes. It was designed from the &quot;Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern&quot;, but it contains more fruits and seafood, and less dairy. In the 2020s, research on the Mediterranean diet indicates that a Mediterranean diet may contribute to health.

===Cardiovascular disease===
The Mediterranean diet is included among dietary patterns that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. A 2013 Cochrane review found limited evidence that a Mediterranean diet favorably affects cardiovascular risk factors. A 2013 meta-analysis compared Mediterranean, vegan, vegetarian, low-glycemic index, low-carbohydrate, high-fiber, and high-protein diets with control diets. The research concluded that Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, and high-protein diets are effective in improving markers of risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while there was limited evidence for an effect of vegetarian diets on glycemic control and lipid levels unrelated to weight loss. However, more cautious reviews arose in early 2016, raising concerns about the quality of previous systematic reviews examining the impact of a Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular risk factors. These reviews insisted upon the need for further standardized research, stating that the evidence for possible prevention of cardiovascular disease by the diet was &quot;limited and highly variable&quot;. Reviews in 2016-17 reached similar conclusions about the ability of a Mediterranean diet to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lowering the risk for hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. A Mediterranean diet is recommended as a means of lowering Apolipoprotein B.

The Mediterranean diet is low in saturated fat with high amounts of monounsaturated fat and dietary fiber. One possible factor is the potential health effects of olive oil in the Mediterranean diet. Olive oil contains monounsaturated fats, most notably oleic acid, which is under clinical research for its potential health benefits. The European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies approved health claims on olive oil, for protection by its polyphenols against oxidation of blood lipids and for the contribution to the maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol levels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with oleic acid (Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012 of 16 May 2012). A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that an elevated consumption of olive oil is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke, while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effects. The American Heart Association discussed the Mediterranean diet as a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

A 2023 review found evidence for a reduction of mortality and cardiovascular disease risk in women on a Mediterranean-type diet. A 2024 review highlighted that bioactive compounds found in Mediterranean diet components (such as olive, grape, garlic, rosemary, and saffron) exhibit properties that may contribute to cardiovascular health.

===Diabetes===
In 2014, two meta-analyses found that the Mediterranean diet was associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes, findings similar to those of a 2017 review. The American Diabetes Association and a 2019 review indicated that the Mediterranean diet is a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk of diabetes.

===Cancer===
A meta-analysis in 2008 found that strictly following the Mediterranean diet was correlated with a decreased risk of dying from cancer by 6%. Another 2014 review found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a decreased risk of death from cancer. A 2017 review found a decreased rate of cancer, although evidence was weak. An updated review in 2021 found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with a 13% lower risk of cancer mortality in the general population.

===Weight loss in obesity===
Overweight adults who adopt Mediterranean diets may lose weight by consuming fewer calories.
A 2019 review found that the Mediterranean diet may help obese people lower the quantity and improve the nutritional quality of food intake, with an overall effect of possibly losing body weight.

===Cognitive ability===
A 2016 systematic review found a relation between greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet and better cognitive performance; it is unclear if the relationship is causal.

According to a 2013 systematic review, greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is correlated with a lower risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and slower cognitive decline. Another 2013 systematic review reached similar conclusions, and also found a negative association with the risk of progressing from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer&#x27;s, but acknowledged that only a small number of studies had been done on the topic.

===Major depressive disorder===
There is a correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower risk of depression. Studies on which these correlations are made are observational and do not prove cause and effect.

===Gluten===
As the Mediterranean diet usually includes products containing gluten, such as pasta and bread, increasing use of the diet may have contributed to the growing rate of gluten-related disorders.

==Dietary components==

There are variations of the &quot;Mediterranean diets&quot; in different countries and among the individual populations of the Mediterranean basin, due to ethnic, cultural, economic and religious diversities. The &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; as defined by dietitians generally includes the following components, which are not typical of diets in the Mediterranean Basin:
* High intakes of olive oil (as the principal source of fat), and a plant-based diet: vegetables (including leafy green vegetables, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and peppers), fresh fruits (consumed as desserts or snacks), cereals (mostly whole grains), nuts, and legumes.
* Moderate intakes of fish and other seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products (primarily cheese and yogurt), and red wine.
* Low intakes of red meat, processed meat, refined carbohydrates, and sweets.

These proportions are sometimes represented in the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid. In a diet with roughly this composition, the fat content accounts for 25% to 35% of the total intake of calories, while the amount of saturated fat is, at most, 8% of the calorie content.

Some cuisines of the Mediterranean region are not fully consistent with Mediterranean diet guidelines. For instance, olive oil is not the staple fat in the cuisines of all countries which border the Mediterranean: in northern and central Italy, lard and butter are commonly used in cooking, and olive oil is reserved for dressing salads and cooked vegetables; in both North Africa and the Middle East, sheep&#x27;s tail fat and rendered butter (&quot;samna&quot;) are traditional staple fats.

==Environmental effects==

Consuming a Mediterranean diet or plant-based diet may contribute to improving environmental and agricultural sustainability, possibly due to lower use of dairy products, ruminant meat, and ultra-processed foods. The environmental impact and amount of energy needed to feed livestock exceeds its nutritional value. In a 2014 lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions, researchers found that a Mediterranean-like diet may reduce food production emissions below those of an omnivorous diet for 2050, with a per capita reduction of 30%.

==History and research==
The concept of Mediterranean diet was first publicized in 1975 by the American biologist Ancel Keys and chemist Margaret Keys (a husband and wife team), but failed to gain widespread recognition until the 1990s.

Objective data showing that the Mediterranean diet is healthy originated from results of epidemiological studies in Calabria, Naples and Madrid, confirmed later by the Seven Countries Study first published in 1970, and a book-length report in 1980.

The most commonly understood version of the Mediterranean diet was presented by, among others, Walter Willett and colleagues of the Harvard University School of Public Health since the mid-1990s. The Mediterranean diet is based on a paradox: although the people living in Mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat, they have far lower rates of cardiovascular disease than in countries such as the United States where similar levels of fat consumption are found. A parallel phenomenon is known as the French paradox. By 2011, the Mediterranean diet was included by some authors as a fad diet promoted for losing weight.

Since about 2016, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association have recommended the Mediterranean diet as a healthy dietary pattern that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Health Service also recommends a Mediterranean diet to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

In 2018, the &quot;European Journal of Public Health&quot; questioned the value of the traditional Mediterranean diet due to homogenization of dietary choices and food products in the global economy. Despite this, clinical research activity remained high, with favorable outcomes reported for various disease conditions, such as metabolic syndrome.

<doc id="460502" wikidata="Q7935699" url="?curid=460502" title="Viscount Bolingbroke">
<text>Viscount Bolingbroke is a current title in the Peerage of Great Britain created in 1712 for Henry St John. He was simultaneously made Baron St John, of Lydiard Tregoze in the County of Wilts. Since 1751, the titles are merged with the titles of Viscount St John and Baron St John in the same peerage.
==Family background==
John St John (1585–1648) was the nephew of Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison (1559–1630), lord deputy governor of Ireland from 1616 to 1622, and distant cousin of the Barons St John of Bletsoe, later Earls of Bolingbroke.

==Grants of titles==
===Baronetcy in 1611===
John St John later represented Wiltshire in Parliament and was a strong royalist during the Civil War. On 22 May 1611, he was created a Baronet, of Lydiard Tregoze in Wiltshire, in the Baronetage of England.

===Baronies and viscountcies===
A younger son of John St John, 3rd Baronet, was elected for Wiltshire and Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, as was his son in turn (4th Baronet). In 1716 the latter was created Baron St John, of Battersea in the County of Surrey, and Viscount St John, with remainder to his second son (who inherited) and in default third son, as his eldest son Henry St John had already been created Baron St John, of Lydiard Tregoze, and Viscount Bolingbroke in 1712 (see below). He also represented Wootton Bassett in Parliament. In 1751 his son, the 3rd Viscount, succeeded his uncle as 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke and 2nd Baron St John according to a special remainder in the letters patent.

The titles have remained united since. The son of the &quot;second son&quot; mentioned, the 3rd and 4th Viscount, was elected briefly for Cricklade, Wiltshire. the titles are held by his descendant, the 8th Viscount Bolingbroke and 9th Viscount St John. He lives in New Zealand. As of 28 February 2014, the present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1974.

The titles Baron St John, of Lydiard Tregoze in the County of Wilts, and Viscount Bolingbroke were created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1712 for the politician and orator the Hon. Henry St John, the eldest son of Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John. The peerages were created with remainder to his father and his male heirs. Lord Bolingbroke died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Viscount, who had already succeeded as third Viscount St John in 1749 (see above).

==Family seats and abodes==

An established family seat was, from 1420 until sale in 1943, Lydiard House, Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire.

From 1648 until 1765 the family had a house near to London, namely the forerunner to the wider Battersea Park area, Bolingbroke House, which was then in the county of Surrey. This became the de facto seat of the lord of the manor title inherited from the 1st Baronet from Viscount Grandison, buried there with great pomp in 1648. In 1742 the then Lord Bolingbroke, who, in spite of his attainder, had been enabled to inherit the estate by an act of Parliament, the Henry St John Bolingbroke Restitution Act 1724 (11 Geo. 1. c. 40), lent the manor house to his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd Earl of Marchmont. Later he settled there himself, either in 1743 or early in the following year and there spent the remainder of his life. He was buried in the family vault in Battersea Church in 1751. His nephew and heir Frederick, second Viscount Bolingbroke, sold the Battersea estate about 1763. It was purchased by John Viscount Spencer, created Earl Spencer in 1765.
==Coat of arms==

The heraldic blazon for the armorials of the St John family is: &quot;Argent, on a chief gules two mullets or&quot;. This can be translated as: a white shield with a red rectangle at the top holding two golden stars.

<doc id="460511" wikidata="Q1252107" url="?curid=460511" title="Douglas C-54 Skymaster">
<text>The Douglas C-54 Skymaster is a four-engined transport aircraft used by the United States Army Air Forces in World War II and the Korean War. Like the Douglas C-47 Skytrain derived from the DC-3, the C-54 Skymaster was derived from a civilian airliner, the Douglas DC-4. Besides transport of cargo, the C-54 also carried presidents, prime ministers, and military staff. Dozens of variants of the C-54 were employed in a wide variety of non-combat roles such as air-sea rescue, scientific and military research, and missile tracking and recovery. During the Berlin Airlift it hauled coal and food supplies to West Berlin. After the Korean War it continued to be used for military and civilian uses by more than 30 countries. It was one of the first aircraft to carry the President of the United States, the first being President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II.

==Design and development==

With the looming entry of the United States into World War II, in June 1941 the War Department took over the provision orders for the airlines for the Douglas DC-4 and allocated them to the United States Army Air Forces with the designation C-54 Skymaster. The first, a C-54, flew from Clover Field in Santa Monica, California on 14 February 1942.

To meet military requirements, the first civil production aircraft had four additional auxiliary fuel tanks in the main cabin, which reduced the number of passenger seats to 26. The following batch of aircraft, designated C-54A, were built with a stronger floor and a cargo door with a hoist and winch. The first C-54A was delivered in February 1943. The C-54B, introduced in March 1944, had integral fuel tanks in the outer wings, allowing two of the cabin tanks to be removed. This change allowed 49 seats (or 16 stretchers) to be fitted. The , a hybrid for Presidential use, had a C-54A fuselage with four cabin fuel tanks and C-54B wings with built in tanks to achieve maximum range.

The most common variant was the C-54D, which entered service in August 1944. Based on the C-54B, it was fitted with more powerful R-2000-11 engines. With the C-54E, the last two cabin fuel tanks were moved to the wings which allowed more freight or 44 passenger seats.

Aircraft transferred to the United States Navy were designated Douglas R5D. With the introduction of the Tri-Service aircraft designation system in 1962, all R5Ds were re-designated C-54.

==Operational history==
C-54s began service with the USAAF in 1942, carrying up to 26 passengers, later versions carrying up to 50 passengers. The C-54 was one of the most commonly used long-range transports by the U.S. armed forces in World War II. Of the C-54s produced, 515 were manufactured in Santa Monica, California and 655 were manufactured at Orchard Place/Douglas Field, in unincorporated Cook County, Illinois, near Chicago (later the site of O&#x27;Hare International Airport).

During World War II, the C-54 was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Douglas MacArthur, and Winston Churchill. The American delegates to the Casablanca Conference used the Skymaster. The C-54 was also used by the Royal Air Force, the French Air Force, and the armed forces of at least 12 other nations.

President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, which created the U.S. Air Force, on board &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;, the Presidential VC-54C which is preserved at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. More than 300 C-54s and R5Ds formed the backbone of the US contribution to the Berlin Airlift in 1948. They also served as the main airlift during the Korean War. After the Korean War, the C-54 was replaced by the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II, but continued to be used by the U.S. Air Force until 1972. The last active C-54 Skymaster in U.S. Navy service (C-54Q, BuNo &quot;56501&quot;, of the Navy Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River) was retired on 2 April 1974.

In late 1945, several hundred C-54s were surplus to U.S. military requirements and these were converted for civil airline operation, many by Douglas Aircraft at its aircraft plants. The aircraft were sold to airlines around the world. By January 1946, Pan American Airways was operating their Skymasters on transatlantic scheduled services to Europe and beyond. Trans-Pacific schedules from San Francisco to Auckland began on 6 June 1946. After disposal by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, many C-54s were modified for use in civilian firefighting and air tanker roles. This included fitting tanks inside and under the fuselage and the fitting of dumping and spraying equipment on the wing trailing edges. C-54s continued in this role until the late 1990s.

===Experimental &quot;tank drop&quot; (1943)===
On 9 July 1943, USAAF C-54A 41-37271 crashed in a mid-air collision with a C-40A at Wright Field, Ohio. While para-dropping a Studebaker T-24 Weasel which was slung under the fuselage, the C-54 collided with the C-40A photographic chase plane. Three of the five crew of the C-54A and all five aboard the C-40A were killed. 

===Crashing in the sea (1947)===
On 3 July 1947, US Army Air Forces C-54G &quot;45-519&quot; crashed in the Atlantic 294 mi off Florida after a loss of control caused by turbulence from a storm, killing the six crew.

===Massachusetts crash (1948)===

On 14 May 1948, an army transport plane flying through a rainstorm crashed in Northampton, Massachusetts, killing the three crew members aboard.

===Disappearance (1950)===
On 26 January 1950, a C-54D operated by the United States Air Force disappeared during a flight between Anchorage-Elmendorf Air Force Base (Alaska) and Great Falls Air Force Base (Montana) with a crew of eight and 36 passengers (34 service personnel and two civilians). No trace of the aircraft or its occupants has ever been found.

===Attack===
On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. North Korean fighter aircraft attacked airfields at Kimpo and Seoul, the South Korean capital, destroying one USAF C-54 on the ground at Kimpo Air Base.

===Crashed (1950)===
On 19 September 1950, a U.S. Navy C-54 en route to Korea crashed into the sea approximately one minute after takeoff from Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. The aircraft had 26 personnel aboard including eleven nurses. There were no survivors.

===Crashing in the sea (1951)===
On 31 January 1951, the C-54D with tail number 282 of the Portuguese Military Aeronautics, operated by the Search and Rescue Squadron of the Lajes Air Base, Azores, flying from the Lisbon Airport back to its base, crashed in the Atlantic, when approaching Lajes. All of the 14 people on board (two pilots, nine mechanics and three other military personnel) were killed.

===Berlin corridor attack (1952)===
On 29 April 1952, an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) operating a scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof Airport came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG-15 fighters while passing through one of the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the aircraft, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport. A subsequent inspection of the aircraft&#x27;s damage revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, 11 passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the air corridor at the time of attack.

===Shoot-down by the PRC (1954)===

On 23 July 1954, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster civilian airliner, registration VR-HEU, operated by Cathay Pacific Airways, en route from Bangkok to Hong Kong, was shot and heavily damaged by Chinese PLAAF Lavochkin La-11 fighters off the coast of Hainan Island. The pilot was able to ditch the aircraft, and whilst ten people on board were killed as a result of the attack, another nine were rescued by a USAF Grumman HU-16 Albatross Air-Sea Rescue plane.

===Crashed in Nevada, United States (1955)===

On 17 November 1955, United States Air Force C-54 Flight 9068 crashed into the south eastern flank of 11,916 foot Mount Charleston at approximately the 11,300 foot elevation. The crash occurred at roughly 8:30am during a high wind snowstorm with limited visibility approximately 35 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The airplane was en route to a classified destination referred to as &quot;Watertown&quot; (now known as the Area 51 test site in Nevada) from Burbank, California. There were 14 passengers and air crew on board from the U.S. Air Force, the CIA, and several government contractors who were working on the top secret U-2 spy plane project. There were no survivors and the crash investigation remained classified until 1998.

===Explosion in North Africa (1955)===
On 11 December 1955, the C-54 of the United States Air Force&#x27;s 1700th Air Transport Group, based at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Tex. The transport crashed in the Gomor district near the border, between French and Spanish Morocco. Flying from Wheelus Field in Tripoli to Casablanca, it was believed en route to the United States. Eight United States airmen died when their plane exploded in the rugged Riff Mountains of North Africa.

===Disappearance (1964)===
On 28 March 1964, a C-54A disappeared over the Pacific (about 1120 km west of San Francisco—last reported position: ) on an executive passenger flight from Honolulu International Airport, Hawaii to Los Angeles International Airport, California. The pilot reported a fire in No. 2 engine, which might make it necessary to ditch. Nothing more was heard from the aircraft, nor was any trace of it found despite an extensive search. Three crew and six passengers died in the accident.

==Specifications (C-54G-DO)==

==Notable appearances in media==
A C-54, registration C-FIQM (Buffalo 5-721 (tail 57)), was used as a substitute Lancaster bomber due to its similar top speed and maximum payload, for a recreation of Operation Chastise with its bouncing bomb. It was filmed in the UK documentary &quot;Dambusters: Building the Bouncing Bomb&quot;, Canadian documentary &quot;Dambusters Fly Again&quot;, &quot;Nova&quot; season 39 episode &quot;Bombing Hitler&#x27;s Dams&quot;, and &quot;Ice Pilots NWT&quot; season 3 episode 2 &quot;Dambusters&quot;. The 1950 drama, &quot;The Big Lift&quot; features C-54s flying the Berlin Airlift.

<doc id="460515" wikidata="Q354768" url="?curid=460515" title="Hiroshi Yamauchi">
<text>was a Japanese businessman and the third president of Nintendo, joining the company on 25 April 1949 until stepping down on 24 May 2002, being succeeded by Satoru Iwata. During his 53-year tenure, Yamauchi transformed Nintendo from a hanafuda card-making company that had been active solely in Japan into a multibillion-dollar video game publisher and global conglomerate. He was the great-grandson of Fusajiro Yamauchi, Nintendo&#x27;s first president and founder. Hiroshi Yamauchi owned the Seattle Mariners baseball team from 1992 until his death.

In April 2013, Forbes estimated Yamauchi&#x27;s net worth at $2.1 billion; he was the 13th richest person in Japan and the 491st richest in the world. In 2008, Yamauchi was Japan&#x27;s wealthiest person with a fortune at that time estimated at $7.8 billion. At the time of his death, Yamauchi was the largest shareholder at Nintendo.

== Early life ==
Yamauchi was born in Kyoto to father Shikanojo Inaba and mother Kimi. His father abandoned them both when he was five years old, and his mother was unable to cope as a single parent so she gave him up to her parents. With his grandfather being a business owner, this adoption aligned his future inheritance of what would become Nintendo. He was sent to a preparatory school in Kyoto at age twelve. He planned to study law or engineering, but World War II disrupted his studies. Since he was too young to fight, he was put to work in a military factory. Once the war ended in 1945, Yamauchi went to Waseda University to study law. He married Michiko Inaba. With the absence of Yamauchi&#x27;s father, his grandparents met to arrange the marriage.

==Nintendo career==
=== Early career ===
In 1948, Yamauchi&#x27;s grandfather and president of Nintendo, Sekiryo Kaneda, suffered a stroke. As he had no other immediate successor, he asked Yamauchi to come immediately to Nintendo to assume the job of president. He had to leave his law degree at Waseda University to do so. Yamauchi would only accept the position if he were the only family member working at Nintendo. Reluctantly, Yamauchi&#x27;s grandfather agreed, and died shortly thereafter in 1949. Under the agreement, his older cousin had to be fired. Due to his young age and total lack of management experience, most employees did not take Yamauchi seriously and resented him. Soon after taking over, he had to deal with a strike by factory employees who expected him to cave in easily. Instead, he asserted his authority by firing many long-time employees who questioned his authority. He had the company name changed to Nintendo Karuta and established its new headquarters in Kyoto. Yamauchi led Nintendo in a &quot;notoriously imperialistic style&quot;. He was the sole judge of potential new products, and only a product that appealed to him and his instincts went on the market.

He was the first to introduce the plastic Western playing card into the Japanese market. Western playing cards were still a novelty in Japan and the public associated them with Western-styled gambling games such as poker and bridge. Most gambling activities were technically illegal by default with only the few legally sanctioned exceptions of horse racing, pachinko, and lottery. Therefore, the market for anything which was associated with gambling, including hanafuda, was limited. Yamauchi&#x27;s first &quot;hit&quot; came when he made a licensing agreement with Walt Disney in 1959 for his plastic playing cards. Nintendo targeted its playing cards as a tool for party games that the whole family could enjoy. Disney&#x27;s tie-in was made towards that end. Nintendo&#x27;s Disney playing card was also accompanied by a small, thin booklet with many tutorials for different card games. The strategy succeeded and the product sold an unprecedented 600,000 units in one year, soon gracing Nintendo with the domination of the Japanese playing card market. With this success, Yamauchi once again changed the company name to Nintendo Company Limited and took the company public and became the chairman. He then decided to travel to the U.S. to visit the United States Playing Card Company, the world&#x27;s biggest manufacturer of playing cards. Upon arriving in Cincinnati, Yamauchi was disappointed to see a small-scale office and factory. This led to the realization that card manufacturing was an extremely limited venture.

Upon his return to Japan, Yamauchi decided to diversify the company. Some of the new areas he ventured into included a taxi company called Daiya, a love hotel with rooms rented by the hour (which he reportedly frequented), and individually portioned instant rice. All of these ventures eventually failed and brought the company into the brink of bankruptcy. However, one day, Yamauchi spotted a factory engineer named Gunpei Yokoi playing with a simple extendable claw, something Yokoi made to amuse himself during his break. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop the extendable claw into a proper product. The product was named the Ultra Hand and was an instant hit. It was then that Yamauchi decided to move Nintendo&#x27;s focus into toy making. With an already established distribution system into department stores for its playing cards, the transition was a natural one for Nintendo. Yamauchi created a new department called Games and Setup, manned initially by only Yokoi and another employee who looked after the finances and was situated in a warehouse in Kyoto for the purpose of research and development. Gunpei Yokoi was solely assigned to develop new products. Yokoi utilized his degree in engineering by developing what is now known as electric toys such as the Love Tester and a light gun using solar cells for targets. These electric toys were quite a novelty in the 1960s when most other toys were simple in origin, such as toy blocks or dolls. Eventually, Nintendo succeeded in establishing itself as a major player in the toy market.

Yamauchi realized that technological breakthroughs in the electronic industry meant that electronics could be incorporated into entertainment products since the prices were decreasing. Atari and Magnavox were already selling gaming devices for use with television sets. Yamauchi negotiated a license with Magnavox to sell its game console, the Magnavox Odyssey. After hiring several Sharp Electronics employees, Nintendo launched the Color TV-Game 6 in Japan, which was followed by several revisions and updates of this series.

Yamauchi had Nintendo expand into the United States to take advantage of the growing American arcade market. He hired his son-in-law Minoru Arakawa to head the new American operation. Their Japanese hits such as &quot;Radar Scope&quot;, &quot;Space Fever&quot;, and &quot;Sheriff&quot; did not achieve the same success in the United States, so in 1981 Yamauchi turned to designer Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s pet project, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, which became a smash hit.

Yamauchi infused Nintendo with a unique industrial development process. He instituted three separate research and development units, which competed with one another and aimed for innovation. This system fostered a high degree of both unusual and successful gadgets. Gunpei Yokoi, who headed R&amp;D1, created the first portable LCD video game featuring a microprocessor called the Game &amp; Watch. Although the Game &amp; Watch was successful, Yamauchi wanted something that was cheap enough that most could buy it yet unique enough so that it would dominate the market for as long as possible.

=== Nintendo Entertainment System ===

On July 15, 1983, Nintendo launched its new home video game console, the Nintendo Family Computer (more commonly abbreviated as the Famicom). Yamauchi was so confident with the Famicom that he promised an electronics company one million unit orders within two years. The Famicom easily reached that goal. After selling several million units, Yamauchi realized the importance of the software that ran on the game systems and made sure the system was easy to program. Yamauchi believed that technicians did not create excellent games, but artists did. The Famicom was released in the United States as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in October 1985. Yamauchi, with no engineering or video game background, was the only one deciding which games were to be released. To help spring creativity, he created three research and development groups and allowed them to compete against each other. This caused the designers to work harder to try to get their games approved.

=== Super Nintendo Entertainment System ===

In 1990, the Super Famicom was released in Japan. It was released a year later in North America and in 1992 in Europe, in both regions as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The Super Famicom was sold out within three days in Japan and had gamers camping for days outside shops in hope of getting the next shipment. Nintendo showed major expansion during this period with new plants, R&amp;D facilities and a partnership with Rare. Yamauchi had displayed from the beginning a knack at identifying good games even though he had never played them, and he continued to do so alone until at least 1994. A 1995 article in &quot;Next Generation&quot; reported that Yamauchi, though 68 years old, &quot;remains very much in charge&quot; of Nintendo and called him &quot;The most feared and respected man in the videogame industry&quot;.

In 1995, the Virtual Boy was released but did not sell well. Nevertheless, Yamauchi said at a press conference that he still had faith in it and that the company would continue developing games for it. In the fiscal year ending 31 March 1995, Nintendo achieved revenues of 416 billion yen.

=== Nintendo 64 ===

In 1996, Nintendo released its new, fully 3D capable console, the Nintendo 64. Around this time Yamauchi publicly stated that he wanted to retire but did not think there were any good candidates to succeed him yet. A year later, he announced that he would retire by 2000, regardless of the lack of a good successor, and in particular wanted to end his career with the launch of the 64DD. In 1999, Yamauchi and Nintendo announced their intentions to work on a new system with an IBM Gekko processor and Matsushita DVD technology codenamed Dolphin. This system was named GameCube. Yamauchi talked at E3 about the impact that the release of Xbox would have on the GameCube.

=== GameCube ===

Yamauchi touted the GameCube as a machine designed exclusively to be a video game console, opting not to include media playback. This emphasis towards &quot;performance only&quot; and the creation of hardware that would allow developers to &quot;easily create games&quot; is what Yamauchi believed would set the GameCube apart from its competitors.

Yamauchi also wanted the machine to be the least expensive of its kind, in his belief that people &quot;do not play with the game machine itself. They play with the software, and they are forced to purchase a game machine in order to use the software. Therefore the price of the machine should be as cheap as possible.&quot; Nintendo hence priced the GameCube significantly less expensively than its rivals in the market, although the console&#x27;s games were priced identically to those designed for the competing systems.

=== Post-Nintendo presidency ===
On 24 May 2002, Yamauchi stepped down as president of Nintendo and was succeeded by the head of Nintendo&#x27;s Corporate Planning Division, Satoru Iwata. Yamauchi subsequently became the chairman of Nintendo&#x27;s board of directors. He left the board on 29 June 2005, due to his age, and because he believed that he was leaving the company in good hands. Yamauchi also refused to accept his retirement pension, which was reported to be around $9 to $14 million, believing that Nintendo could put it to better use. He remained Nintendo&#x27;s largest shareholder, and as of 2008 retained a 10% share in Nintendo. He was the 12th richest man in Japan due to his shares in Nintendo since its success with the Wii and Nintendo DS consoles. He donated the majority of the 7.5 billion yen to build a new cancer treatment center in Kyoto. In 2006, he founded Shigureden, a museum of poetry (&quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot;) in Kyoto.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Yamauchi&#x27;s wife Michiko gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Yōko. During the next few years, Michiko had several miscarriages and was often ill. In 1957, she gave birth to another daughter, Fujiko and, shortly after, a son named Katsuhito.

Michiko Inaba died on 29 July 2012, aged 82.
Yamauchi&#x27;s daughter Yōko married Minoru Arakawa, who would later go on to establish the Nintendo of America.

When Yamauchi&#x27;s father, Shikanojō, returned years later to see his son, Yamauchi refused to speak to him. When Yamauchi was close to 30, his half-sister contacted him and informed him that Shikanojō had died of a stroke. At the funeral, he met his father&#x27;s wife and their four daughters whom he never knew existed. He began feeling sorry that he had not taken the opportunity to reconcile with his father when he was still alive. The death of his father changed Yamauchi, and he grieved for months and cried freely. From then on he made regular visits to his father&#x27;s grave.

Yamauchi has been described as a stern man with a single-minded focus on his business. Henk Rogers, founder of The Tetris Company, characterized Yamauchi&#x27;s leadership style as autocratic, stating that &quot;If you ever worked with him and you disagreed with him in a meeting, you were fired. Period. [...] So he was very tough, and when he said something that was the law.&quot; He did not play video games; his sole serious hobby was the strategy board game Go, though Masayuki Uemura, the primary engineer of the original NES, has stated that he also enjoyed hanafuda and would play cards with Nintendo employees at parties. He was ranked a seventh Dan at Go, roughly equivalent to chessmaster. Although another source mentions him as being ranked a sixth Dan.

== Ownership of the Seattle Mariners ==
In 1992, the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball were up for sale and United States Senator Slade Gorton asked Nintendo of America to find a Japanese investor who would keep the club in Seattle. Yamauchi offered to buy the franchise, even though he had never been to a baseball game. Although the owner accepted the offer, then MLB commissioner Fay Vincent and the league&#x27;s ownership committee were strongly opposed to the idea of a non-North American owner and did not approve the deal. However, following the strong support and sentiments of the people of Seattle and press the commissioner formally approved the deal, under the condition that Yamauchi had less than 50% of the vote. After the purchase Yamauchi signed his rights over to Nintendo of America, who would oversee the team on his behalf, such as with Howard Lincoln, who served as team CEO beginning in 1999. In 2000, the club made its first profit of $2.6 million since its acquisition by Yamauchi. Yamauchi never attended a Mariners game in his lifetime.

==Death==
On 19 September 2013, aged 85, Yamauchi died at a hospital following complications of pneumonia. Nintendo released a statement stating that its staff members were mourning the loss of their former president.

<doc id="460516" wikidata="Q234900" url="?curid=460516" title="Linda Darnell">
<text>Linda Darnell (born Monetta Eloyse Darnell; October 16, 1923 – April 10, 1965) was an American actress. Darnell progressed from modelling as a child to acting in theatre and film. At the encouragement of her mother, she made her first film in 1939, and appeared in both lead and supporting roles in big-budget films for 20th Century Fox throughout the 1940s. She co-starred with Tyrone Power in four films, including the classic &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1940). Her biggest commercial success was the controversial &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947), an adaptation of the best-selling novel of the 1940s and Fox&#x27;s biggest hit of 1947. She won critical acclaim for her work in &quot;Summer Storm&quot; (1944), &quot;Hangover Square&quot; (1945), &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1945), &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; (1948), &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949), and &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1950).

==Early life==
Darnell was born in Dallas, Texas, as one of four children (excluding her mother&#x27;s two children from an earlier marriage) to postal clerk Calvin Roy Darnell and the former Margaret &quot;Pearl&quot; Brown. One of her maternal great-grandparents was Cherokee. She was the younger sister of Undeen and the older sister of Monte Maloya and Calvin Roy, Jr.. Her parents were not happily married, and she grew up as a shy and reserved girl in a house of domestic turmoil. Starting at an early age, her mother, Pearl, had big plans for Darnell in the entertainment industry. She believed that Linda was her only child with potential as an actress and ignored the rearing of her other children.

According to her siblings, Darnell enjoyed the limelight and shared her mother&#x27;s dream. Darnell once said, &quot;Mother really shoved me along, spotting me in one contest after another. I had no great talent, and I didn&#x27;t want to be a movie star particularly, but Mother had always wanted it for herself, and I guess she attained it through me.&quot; One elocution teacher recalled: &quot;[Darnell] didn&#x27;t stand out particularly, except that she was so sweet and considerate. In her theater work, she wasn&#x27;t outstanding, but her mother was right behind her everywhere she went.&quot;

Unlike her husband, Pearl had a notorious reputation in the neighborhood of being &quot;aggressive&quot; or &quot;downright mean.&quot; Despite some financial problems, Darnell insisted that she had had a joyful childhood and loving parents. Darnell was a model by the age of 11 and was acting on the stage by the age of 13. She initially started modeling to earn money for the household and performed mostly in beauty contests.

Before leaving school for Hollywood, Darnell was a student at Sunset High School, which she entered in September 1937, majoring in Spanish and art. She did not have a lot in common with her peers and usually spent her time at home as a teen, working under the guidance of her mother. In 1936, she entered the Dallas Little Theater and was cast in the southwestern premiere of &quot;Murder in the Cathedral.&quot; The same year, she was hired as one of the hostesses at the Texas Centennial Exposition.

In November 1937, a talent scout for 20th Century Fox arrived in Dallas looking for new faces. Encouraged by her mother, Darnell met him, and after a few months he invited her for a screen test in Hollywood. Arriving in California alongside Mary Healy and Dorris Bowdon in February 1938, Darnell initially was rejected by film studios and was sent home because she was declared &quot;too young.&quot;

==Career beginnings==
Although originally wanting to become an actress on the stage, Darnell was featured in a &quot;Gateway to Hollywood&quot; talent search and initially landed a contract at RKO Pictures. There was no certainty, though, and she soon returned to Dallas. When 20th Century-Fox offered her a part, Darnell wanted to accept, but RKO was unwilling to release her. Nevertheless, by age 15 she was signed to a contract at 20th Century-Fox and moved to a small apartment in Hollywood all alone on April 5, 1939. With production beginning in April 1939, she was featured in her first film, &quot;Hotel for Women&quot; (1939), which had newspapers immediately hailing her as the newest star of Hollywood. Loretta Young was originally assigned to play the role, but she demanded a salary which the studio would not give her. Darryl F. Zanuck instead cast Darnell &quot;because he felt that the name would advertise her beauty and suggest a Latin quality that matched her coloring.&quot;

Although only 15 at the time, Darnell posed as a 17-year-old and was listed as 19 years old by the studio. According to columnist Louella O. Parsons, Darnell was &quot;so young, so immature and so naive in her ideas&quot; and was very loyal to her boss, Darryl F. Zanuck. Her true age came out later in 1939, and she became one of the few actresses under the age of 16 to serve as leading ladies in films. While working on &quot;Hotel for Women&quot;, Darnell was cast alongside Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert in &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1939) in June 1939. She was later replaced because the studio felt her role was not important enough. In an interview during production of &quot;Hotel for Women&quot;, which lasted until June, Darnell admitted that movie making was not what she expected: &quot;I&#x27;m learning what really hard work is. At home in Dallas I used to sprawl on the lawn and dream about the nice, easy time the screen stars must be having in Hollywood, but the last two months have taught me quite another story.&quot;

Since the beginning of her career at 20th Century-Fox, Darnell had been very positive about her frequent co-star Tyrone Power. In a 1939 interview, she expressed her interest in starring opposite Power in &quot;Johnny Apollo&quot; (1940). Rationalizing why she was not cast, Darnell said: &quot;It&#x27;s a man&#x27;s part and the girl&#x27;s role is only incidental.&quot; Dorothy Lamour was cast, instead. Nevertheless, Darnell had her way. She was assigned to the female lead opposite Power in the light romantic comedy &quot;Day-Time Wife&quot; (1939). Although the film received only slightly favorable reviews, Darnell&#x27;s performance was received positively, with one critic saying: &quot;Despite her apparent youth, [Darnell] turns in an outstanding performance when playing with popular players.&quot; Another critic wrote: &quot;little Linda is not only a breath-taking eyeful, but a splendid actress, as well.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; magazine stated that Darnell appeared to be 22 and was &quot;the most physically perfect girl in Hollywood&quot;. Following the film&#x27;s release, she was cast in the drama comedy &quot;Star Dust&quot; in December 1939. The film was hailed as one of the &quot;most original entertainment idea[s] in years&quot; and boosted Darnell&#x27;s popularity, who was nicknamed &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s loveliest and most exciting star&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Miss Darnell displays a wealth of youthful charm and personality that confirms studio efforts to build her to a draw personality.&quot; Her studio contract had been revised to allow Darnell to earn $200 a week.

==Stardom==
After appearing in several small films, Darnell was cast in her first big-budget film in May 1940, appearing again opposite Tyrone Power in &quot;Brigham Young&quot; (1940), which was shot on location in mid 1940 and was regarded as the most expensive film 20th Century Fox had yet produced. Darnell and Power were cast together for the second time owing to the box office success of &quot;Day-Time Wife&quot;, and they became a highly publicized onscreen couple, which prompted Darryl F. Zanuck to add 18 more romantic scenes to &quot;Brigham Young&quot;. The film&#x27;s director, Henry Hathaway, in later life had only slight memories of Darnell but recalled that &quot;a sweeter girl never lived.&quot; By June 1940, shortly after completing &quot;Brigham Young&quot;, Darnell earned &quot;a weekly salary larger than most bank officials.&quot;

In the summer of 1940, Darnell began working on &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1940), in which she again co-starred as Power&#x27;s sweetheart in a role for which Anne Baxter was previously considered. A big-budget adventure film that was raved over by the critics, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; was a box office sensation and did much to enhance Darnell&#x27;s star status. Afterwards, she was paired with Henry Fonda for the first time in the western &quot;Chad Hanna&quot; (1940), her first Technicolor film. The film received only moderate attention, unlike Darnell&#x27;s next film, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; (1941), which was shot on location in Mexico and in which she was reunited with Power. It was the first film for which she was widely critically acclaimed. Nevertheless, Darnell later claimed that her downfall began after &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;. In an interview she said:
The studio was unable to find Darnell suitable roles. In late 1940, Fox chose her for the main role in &quot;Song of the Islands&quot; (1942), a Hawaiian musical film which eventually starred Betty Grable. After &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, she was set to co-star with Claudette Colbert in &quot;Remember the Day&quot; (1941), but another actress was eventually cast. Meanwhile, she was considered for the female lead in &quot;Swamp Water&quot; (1941), but Anne Baxter was later assigned the role. Darnell was disappointed and felt rejected; she later said: &quot;Right under your very nose someone else is brought in for that prize part you wanted so terribly.&quot; Months passed by without any work, and in August 1941 she was cast in a supporting role in the musical &quot;Rise and Shine&quot; (1941). The film was a setback in her career, and she was rejected for a later role because she refused to respond to Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s advances. Instead, she contributed to the war effort, working for the Red Cross and selling war bonds. She was also a regular at the Hollywood Canteen.

==Professional setbacks==

In early 1942, Darnell filmed &quot;The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, another film that would not do much to advance her career. Meanwhile, she realized that Darryl F. Zanuck had lost interest in her, and she was overlooked for most film roles that suited her. Instead, she was cast in roles that she loathed, including the musical &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; (1942). Zanuck insisted that she take the role, but she was replaced by Ann Rutherford after 12 days of shooting. The press reported that &quot;Linda Darnell and Twentieth Century-Fox aren&#x27;t on the best of terms at the moment.&quot; As a punishment, she was loaned out to another studio for a supporting role in a B movie called &quot;City Without Men&quot; (1943). According to co-star Rosemary DeCamp, Darnell nevertheless was &quot;very polite&quot;, and she was satisfied to work at a studio which did not treat her as a child. In April 1943, she was put on suspension, which meant being replaced in the Technicolor musical film &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; (1943). By this time, Darnell had eloped, which caused Zanuck to be even more furious.
In 1943, she was cast, uncredited, as the Virgin Mary in &quot;The Song of Bernadette&quot;. By late 1943, Darnell was fed up with critics only praising her beauty rather than her acting abilities. Judging her performance in &quot;Sweet and Low-Down&quot; (1944), in which she co-starred with Lynn Bari, one critic of the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; wrote, &quot;Lynn comes off the best because she has more of a chance to shine. Linda just doesn&#x27;t have enough to do—but looks beautiful doing it.&quot; Darnell was reduced to second leads and was overlooked for big-budget productions. Matters changed when she was named one of the four most beautiful women in Hollywood along with Hedy Lamarr, Ingrid Bergman, and Gene Tierney in a 1944 edition of &quot;Look&quot;. Afterwards, the studio allowed her to be loaned out for the lead in &quot;Summer Storm&quot;. Portraying a &quot;seductive peasant girl who takes three men to their ruin before she herself is murdered,&quot; it was a type of role she had never before played. In a later interview, Darnell commented:
I was told that such a violent change of type might ruin my career, but I insisted on taking the chance. [...] This is one picture on which I am setting much store for the future. For eighteen months I did nothing in pictures. I pleaded for something to do, but nothing happened. The character in the Chekhov film is a wild sort of she-devil, which any actress would go miles to play. She&#x27;s devil mostly—at times angelic—and perfectly fascinating to interpret. I&#x27;m counting on my Russian girl to give me a new start.

Released in 1944, the film provided her a new screen image as a pin-up girl. Shortly after, Darnell was again loaned out to portray a showgirl in &quot;The Great John L.&quot;, the first film to feature her bare legs. Darnell complained that the studio lacked recognition of her, which prodded Zanuck to cast her in &quot;Hangover Square&quot; (1945), wherein she played a role she personally had chosen. The film became a great success, and with Darnell&#x27;s triumph assured, she was allowed to abandon her upcoming film, &quot;Don Juan Quilligan&quot; (1945), which would have been another low point in her career. In January 1945, she was added to the cast of the film noir &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1945), which also included Dana Andrews and Alice Faye. Despite suffering from the &quot;terrifying&quot; director Otto Preminger, Darnell completed the film and was praised by reviewers so widely that there was even talk of an Oscar nomination. Because of her success in &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, she was cast opposite Tyrone Power in &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; in December 1945 on the insistence of Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Although she looked forward to the film project, believing it would be her most important to date, she was later replaced by newcomer Jean Peters owing to scheduling conflicts, a decision she resented.

In 1946, Darnell filmed two pictures simultaneously, the expensively budgeted &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; and Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Centennial Summer&quot;. During the release of the latter, she was on location in Monument Valley for the filming of the John Ford Western &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946), playing a role for which she lost 12 pounds. She was assigned to a negligible role by Zanuck, which displeased Ford, who felt that she was not suitable.

==Renewed success==

In 1946, Darnell won the starring role in the highly anticipated movie &quot;Forever Amber&quot;, based on a bestselling historical novel that was denounced as being immoral at that time. The character Amber was so named because of her hair color, and this is the only major film in which Darnell—normally known for her raven hair and somewhat Latin looks—appears as a redhead. It was the most expensive film so far produced by Fox, and publicity at the time compared the novel to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Darnell replaced British actress Peggy Cummins in July 1946 at a cost of $350,000. Because $1 million had already been spent on production costs when Darnell was brought in, the pressure was intense to make the film a financial success. Her casting was a result of a campaign for stronger roles. Regardless, she was surprised to find out that she had been cast, because she had been intensively rehearsing for &quot;Captain from Castile&quot; at the time. Although she had to give up that role and work with Otto Preminger, she was delighted to play the title role and thought she was &quot;the luckiest girl in Hollywood.&quot;
The search for the actress to portray Amber, a beauty who uses men to make her fortune in 17th century England, was modeled on the extensive process that led to the casting of Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. Production demanded a lot from Darnell. She was again put on a diet and was assigned to a voice coach to learn how to speak with an English accent. In addition, she spent hours in fittings for costume changes. Darnell was certain that &quot;Forever Amber&quot; would be her ticket to stardom, and she told reporters:
My first seven years in Hollywood were a series of discouraging struggles for me. For a while it looked as though the Darnell-versus-Hollywood tussle was going to find Darnell coming out second best. The next seven years aren&#x27;t going to be the same.

Darnell worked long hours at the studio during filming, and according to her older sister she started loathing Preminger, which did not ease production. This and the heavy dieting resulted in exhaustion and a serious illness in November 1946. Her shooting schedule lasted until March 1947, and she collapsed on the set twice. &quot;Forever Amber&quot; did not live up to its hype, and although it became a success at the box office, most reviewers agreed that the film was a disappointment. Darnell was disappointed in the film&#x27;s reception; it did not gain her the recognition she desired.

The following year, Darnell portrayed Daphne de Carter in the Preston Sturges&#x27; comedy &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; (1948), also starring Rex Harrison, and was then rushed into production as one of the three wives in the comedy/drama &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949). Darnell&#x27;s hard-edged performance in the latter won her unanimous acclaim and the best reviews of her career. Darnell became one of the most in-demand actresses in Hollywood, and she now had the freedom to select her own roles. She longed for the leading role in the controversial film &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949), but Zanuck feared that her character would be compared to Amber by the audience, and &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; co-star Jeanne Crain was cast instead.

Darnell had been widely expected to win an Academy Award nomination for &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;. When this did not happen, her career began to wane. She was cast opposite Richard Widmark and Veronica Lake in &quot;Slattery&#x27;s Hurricane&quot; (1949), which she perceived as a step down from the level she had reached with &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;, though it did well at the box office.

==Later career==
Aside from her co-starring role opposite Richard Widmark, Stephen McNally and Sidney Poitier in the noir &quot;No Way Out&quot; (1950), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, which she later called &quot;the only good picture I ever made,&quot; her later films were rarely noteworthy, and her appearances were increasingly sporadic. Further hampering Darnell&#x27;s career was the actress&#x27;s alcoholism and weight gain. Her next film was a Western, &quot;Two Flags West&quot; (1950). Due to her allergy to horses, she loathed making Westerns, and in addition to her complaints about her &quot;colorless&quot; role, she disliked her co-stars Joseph Cotten and Cornel Wilde. She was even less enthusiastic about her next film, &quot;The 13th Letter&quot; (1951), which reunited her with Preminger, and she only took the role because it was an unglamorous one. Shortly after its release, she was put on suspension for refusing a role in the film &quot;The Guy Who Came Back&quot; (1951) opposite Paul Douglas and Joan Bennett because it felt &quot;too similar.&quot; She later consented to take on the glamor role, but she refused to bleach her hair for it.

On March 21, 1951, Darnell signed a new contract with 20th Century Fox that allowed her to become a freelance actress. Her first film outside 20th Century-Fox was &quot;The Lady Pays Off&quot; for Universal-International (1951) after Douglas Sirk requested her for the lead role. She was responsible for putting the film behind schedule because on the fifth day of shooting she learned that Ivan Kahn, the man responsible for her breakthrough, had died. After &quot;The Lady Pays Off&quot;, Darnell headed the cast of &quot;Saturday Island&quot; (1952), which was filmed on location in Jamaica in late 1951. There, Darnell fell ill and had to be quarantined for several weeks. Because her contract required her to make one film a year for the studio, she reported to the 20th Century-Fox lot in March 1952 and was cast in the film noir &quot;Night Without Sleep&quot; (1952). It was the only time that she had to live up to this part of her contract, although she was released from it in September 1952.

This news initially excited Darnell because it permitted her to focus on her film career in Europe. She soon realized, though, that the ease and protection enjoyed under contract was gone, and she came to resent 20th Century-Fox and Zanuck:
Suppose you&#x27;d been earning $4,000 to $5,000 a week for years. Suddenly you were fired and no one would hire you at any figure remotely comparable to your previous salary. I thought in a little while I&#x27;d get offers from other studios, but not many came along. The only thing I knew how to do was be a movie star. No one expects to last forever in this business. You know that sooner or later the studio&#x27;s going to let you go. But who wants to be retired at twenty-nine?
Before traveling to Italy for a two-picture deal with Giuseppe Amato, Darnell was rushed into the production of &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; (1952), which—much to Darnell&#x27;s distress—got far behind schedule. She arrived in Italy in August 1952 and started filming &quot;Angels of Darkness&quot; (1954) in February of the next year. The second collaboration proved disastrous, and the next film was never released in the United States. Owing to a delay in the middle of production, she was sent back to Hollywood and there accepted an offer from Howard Hughes to star in RKO&#x27;s 3-D film &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1953), filmed in Mexico. Afterwards, she flew back to Rome to complete &quot;Angels of Darkness&quot;, in which she spoke Italian. Upon returning to New York, she was under the misunderstanding that she would portray the title role in Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954), believing that the role could carry her to dramatic heights. Through trade papers, she learned that Ava Gardner assumed the part.

Because of her then-husband, Philip Liebmann (grandson of Charles Liebmann of Rheingold Breweries), Darnell put her career on hiatus. She returned to 20th Century-Fox in August 1955, by which time the studio had entered the television field. Darnell was eager to appear on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;. In 1958, Darnell appeared in the episode &quot;Kid on a Calico Horse&quot; of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron City&quot; along with a cast of other guest stars, including Edgar Buchanan. That same year, she held the guest-starring role of Dora Gray, first in &quot;The Dora Gray Story&quot;, then reappeared as Mrs. Dora Gray Fogleberry in S1 E39 &quot;The Sacramento Story&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

In addition to television, Darnell returned to the stage. Her last work as an actress was in a stage production in Atlanta in early 1965. (At the time of her death a few months later, she was preparing to perform in another play.)

==Personal life==
Since Darnell was underage when she arrived in Hollywood, she was tutored on set. She planned on attending graduation ceremonies at Sunset High School, but she was excluded from them and instead graduated from University High School in 1941. Her work schedules prohibited her from enrolling in a university. She is a member of the Sunset High School Hall of Fame. 

In 1940, during the shooting of &quot;Star Dust&quot;, Darnell for a short time dated teen idol Mickey Rooney. Her first love was Jaime Jorba, a Hispanic youth whom she met while still in high school. They met again during production of &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, but they drifted apart when Jorba announced he could not marry a girl who was in the public eye. Starting at age 17, Darnell dated her publicity agent, Alan Gordon, whom she allegedly married in a double wedding with Lana Turner and Joseph Stephen Crane on July 17, 1942. The report turned out to be false, and over the years Darnell became known as &quot;filmland&#x27;s most eligible bachelorette.&quot; Up to 1942, she dated Kay Kyser, Eddie Albert, George Montgomery, and Jackie Cooper, among others. At one point, she was set to elope with talent agent Vic Orsatti, only to report later that she was &quot;concentrating on [her] career.&quot;

Although a well-loved figure on the 20th Century-Fox lot among the cast, crew, and lot workers, it was reported that Darnell made only one good friend in Hollywood, actress-singer Ann Miller, whom she met at a Catalina Island benefit. Darnell was very negative about the Hollywood social scene, finding it &quot;nauseating&quot;. During her stay in Hollywood, her relationship with her mother, Pearl, worsened. Her mother was an unpopular figure on the lot because of her overbearing and possessive behavior. In 1940, Pearl accused her husband of having an incestuous relationship with Evelyn, one of her children - he was not Evelyn&#x27;s biological father. Following an intense fight between her parents in 1942, Darnell left home with her younger sister Monte and never returned. Out of spite, Pearl turned to the press, which gained Darnell some bad publicity. 

In 1942, Darnell was plagued with extortion letters from an unknown person threatening her with bodily harm unless $2,000 was paid immediately. The studio asked the FBI to protect the actress, and eventually a 17-year-old high school student was arrested for the crime.

On April 18, 1943, at age 19, Darnell eloped with 42-year-old cameraman Peverell Marley in Las Vegas. Darnell and Marley started seeing each other in 1940, and the press referred to him as her &quot;devoted friend and escort.&quot; Most friends and relatives, including her parents, and 20th Century-Fox disapproved of the marriage, and Darnell was believed to look at Marley more as a father figure than as a romantic interest. Marley was a heavy drinker and introduced Darnell to alcohol in 1944, which eventually led to an addiction and weight problems. Neighbors and acquaintances recalled the drastic change she underwent during this period, becoming hardened and hot-tempered. In 1946, during production of &quot;Centennial Summer&quot;, she repeatedly met with Howard Hughes. Although she initially disavowed gossip regarding an affair, she fell in love with the womanizing millionaire and separated from Marley shortly after finishing &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;. When Hughes announced that he had no desire to marry her, Darnell returned to her husband and cancelled divorce proceedings. Shortly after the reunion, her health worsened due to conditions in the production of &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947). 

Because Darnell and Marley were unable to have children, they adopted a daughter in 1948, Charlotte Mildred &quot;Lola&quot; Marley (born January 5, 1948), the actress&#x27;s only child. She also planned to adopt a boy within a few years, but nothing ever came of it. In mid 1948, she became romantically involved with Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the director of &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot;, and in July 1948 she filed for divorce. Mankiewicz, however, was unwilling to leave his wife for Darnell, and though the affair continued for six years, she returned to her husband. Though she called him the &quot;great love of her life,&quot; Mankiewicz never acknowledged the affair; he only mentioned her to his biographer as a &quot;marvelous girl with very terrifying personal problems.&quot; In 1949, Darnell went into psychotherapy for hostile emotions that she had been building since childhood. Darnell&#x27;s romance with Mankiewicz influenced her personal life. When he left in late 1949 for on-location shooting of &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), Darnell fell into a depression and almost committed suicide. She continued to meet with him occasionally until production of &quot;The Barefoot Contessa&quot; (1954) started. 

On January 25, 1949, Darnell went to court to sue her former business manager, Cy Tanner, for fraud. She testified that he stole $7,250 from her between 1946 and 1947, and Tanner was eventually sent to prison. On July 19, 1950, Darnell reportedly separated from her husband. Marley offered a quiet settlement—without mention of Mankiewicz—for a payment of $125,000. She agreed and lost almost all her money. When she filed for divorce from Marley in 1951, she accused her husband of cruelty, claiming he was &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;critical&quot; towards Darnell and her family. Following a five-minute hearing, Darnell was granted a divorce and custody of Charlotte, while Marley was to pay $75 a month for child support.
In her later life, she dated actor Dick Paxton and had an affair with Italian director Giuseppe Amato. She married brewery heir Philip Liebmann in February 1954. Owing to her lack of interest in him physically, it was agreed that the marriage would be a business arrangement: she was to be his wife in name only and in return he would support her financially. After a while, she grew dissatisfied with this loveless marriage and detested her husband for allowing her to lash out at him as well as cheapening her by buying her lavish presents. In response, Darnell resorted to charity work, opening facilities accommodating 30 girls in the neighborhood of Rome in 1955. Liebmann attempted to save the marriage by adopting a baby named Alfreda, but the marriage ended nevertheless on grounds of incompatibility, and Liebmann kept the girl.

Darnell was married to pilot Merle Roy Robertson from 1957 to 1963. In 1957, she started drinking heavily again, and in November 1958 sank into a depression, but went into rehab, recovering for a while. In 1963, Darnell was granted a divorce from Robertson following an outburst in the courtroom, where she accused her third husband of fathering the baby of a Polish actress. She was promised alimony of $350 monthly until July 15, 1964, and then $250 until September 15, 1967.

==Death==
Darnell died on April 10, 1965, from burns that she had received in a house fire in Glenview, Illinois, early the day before. She had been staying at the home of her former secretary and the secretary&#x27;s daughter and had just received notice from her agent of three possible movie contracts. She was trapped on the second floor of the home by heat and smoke after the fire had started in the living room.

The women urged the secretary&#x27;s daughter to jump from the second-floor window. After her daughter jumped, Darnell&#x27;s secretary stood on the window ledge, calling for help. She had lost track of Darnell and insisted that the firefighters rescue Darnell before she was taken from the window ledge. Darnell was found next to the burning living-room sofa and was transferred to the burn unit at Chicago&#x27;s Cook County Hospital with burns over 80% of her body.

After her death, a man who said that he was Darnell&#x27;s fiancé identified her body. A coroner&#x27;s inquest ruled that Darnell&#x27;s death was accidental and that the fire had begun in or near the living-room sofa and was caused by careless smoking; both adult women were smokers.

Darnell&#x27;s body was cremated; she had wanted her ashes scattered over a ranch in New Mexico, but because of a dispute with the landowners that was not possible. After the remains had been in storage for ten years, her daughter asked that they be interred at the Union Hill Cemetery, Chester County, Pennsylvania, in the family plot of her son-in-law.

==Recognition==
Darnell has a star at 1631 Vine Street in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

<text>Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby ( 28 December 1898 – 19 August 1957) was a Swedish-born American meteorologist who first explained the large-scale motions of the atmosphere in terms of fluid mechanics. He identified and characterized both the jet stream and the long waves in the westerlies that were later named Rossby waves.

==Biography==
Carl-Gustaf Rossby was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the first of five children born to Arvid and Alma Charlotta (Marelius) Rossby. He attended Stockholm University, where he developed his first interest in mathematical physics.
Rossby came into meteorology and oceanography while studying geophysics under Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen in Bergen, Norway, during 1919, where Bjerknes&#x27; group was developing the groundbreaking concepts that became known as the Bergen School of Meteorology, including theory of the polar front.
He also studied at the University of Leipzig and at the Lindenberg Observatory (&quot;Meteorologisches Observatorium Lindenberg&quot;) in Brandenburg where upper air measurements by kite and balloon were researched. In 1921 he returned to Stockholm to join the Meteorological and Hydrographic Office (which later became the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) where he served as a meteorologist on a variety of oceanographic expeditions. While ashore between expeditions, he studied mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm (Filosofie Licentiat, 1925).

In 1925 Rossby was granted a fellowship from the Sweden-America Foundation &quot;to study the application of the polar front theory to American weather&quot;. In the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, DC, he combined theoretical work on atmospheric turbulence with the establishment of the first weather service for civil aviation. In 1928 he became associate professor in the Aeronautics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Shortly after this MIT launched the first department of meteorology in the US. In 1931 he also became a research associate at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. His interests during this time ranged over atmospheric thermodynamics, mixing and turbulence, and the interaction between oceans and the atmosphere.

On 9 January 1939 he became an American citizen and in that same year, assistant director of research at the U.S. Weather Bureau. His appointment as chair of the department of meteorology at the University of Chicago in 1940 began the period in which he turned his attention to large-scale atmospheric motions. He identified and characterized both the jet stream and Rossby waves in the atmosphere.
During World War II, Rossby organized the training of military meteorologists, recruiting many of them to his Chicago department in the post-war years where he began adapting his mathematical description of atmospheric dynamics to weather forecasting by electronic computer, having started this activity in Sweden using BESK. In 1947 he became founding director of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) in Stockholm, dividing his time between there, the University of Chicago and with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. After the war he visited an old friend Professor Hans Ertel in Berlin. Their cooperation led to the mathematical formulation of Rossby waves.
Between 1954 and his death in Stockholm in 1957, he championed and developed the field of atmospheric chemistry. His contributions to meteorology were noted in the December 17, 1956, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. His portrait appeared on the cover of that issue, the first meteorologist on the cover of a major magazine. During this period he considered the effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and its potential warming effect.

<text>Potrzebie (; , the dative/locative case form of the noun , &quot;need&quot;) is a Polish word popularized by its non sequitur use as a running gag in the early issues of &quot;Mad&quot; not long after the comic book began in 1952.

==Origin==
&quot;Mad&quot; editor Harvey Kurtzman spotted the word printed in the Polish language section of a multi-languaged &quot;Instructions for Use&quot; sheet accompanying a bottle of aspirin. Kurtzman, who was fascinated with words he found unusual, decided it would make an appropriate but meaningless background gag. After cutting the word out of the instruction sheet, he made copies and used rubber cement to paste &quot;Potrzebie&quot; randomly into the middle of &quot;Mad&quot; satires.

==Appearances==
&quot;Potrzebie&quot; was first used in a story in &quot;Mad&quot; #11 (May 1954), where it was the exclamation of a character who spoke only in foreign languages and song lyrics, in &quot;Murder the Story&quot;, a parody illustrated by Jack Davis. It was used again in Bernard Krigstein&#x27;s &quot;From Eternity Back to Here!&quot; in &quot;Mad&quot; #12 (June 1954) on an airplane advertising banner. With the same type font, it reappeared in Jack Davis&#x27;s &quot;Book! Movie!&quot; in &quot;Mad&quot; #13 (July 1954), pasted into a panel as the title of an abstract painting seen in the background. In the same issue the word appears as POTS-REBIE, emblazoned on a cauldron in which Robinson Crusoe is roasting a frankfurter. This piece reappeared in one of the earliest &quot;Mad&quot; paperbacks, &quot;Bedside Mad&quot; It was illustrated as a rebus in &quot;Puzzle Pages!&quot; in &quot;Mad&quot; #19 (January 1955). These stories, like others in &quot;Mad&quot; comics, were written by Harvey Kurtzman. Frequent repetition gave it the status of a catch phrase or in-joke among the readership which continues to the present day. In the first &quot;Mad Style Guide&quot;, edited by Bhob Stewart in 1994, the word was made available for display on T-shirts and other licensed &quot;Mad&quot; products. It also sees occasional use as a metasyntactic variable by hackers.
A typical appearance of the word is exemplified by the &quot;Mad&quot; version of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (from &quot;Mad&quot; #43, December 1958), which begins:
:&quot;Whon thot Aprille swithin potrzebie,
:&quot;The burgid prillie gives one heebie-jeebie.

==System of measurement==
In issue 33, &quot;Mad&quot; published a partial table of the &quot;Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures&quot;, developed by 19-year-old Donald E. Knuth, later a famed computer scientist. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of &quot;Mad&quot; issue 26, or 2.2633484517438173216473 mm, although the eighth digit was mistakenly dropped and the thickness appeared as 2.263348517438173216473 mm in the MAD article. A standardization in terms of the wavelength of the red line of the emission spectrum of cadmium is also given, which if the 1927 definition of the Ångstrom is taken for the value of that wavelength, would equal 2.263347539605392 mm.

Volume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in blintz (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of halavah, which is &quot;a form of pie [with] a specific gravity of 3.1416 and a specific heat of .31416&quot;), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average Earth rotation, equal to 1 &quot;clarke&quot;). The system also features such units as &quot;whatmeworry&quot;, &quot;cowznofski&quot;, &quot;vreeble&quot;, &quot;hoo&quot; and &quot;hah&quot;.

According to the &quot;Date&quot; system in Knuth&#x27;s article, which substitutes a 10-clarke &quot;mingo&quot; for a month and a 100-clarke &quot;cowznofski&quot;, for a year, the date of October 29, 2007, was originally rendered as &quot;Cal 7, 201 C.M.&quot; (for Cowznofsko Madi, or &quot;in the Cowznofski of MAD&quot;). The dates are calculated from October 1, 1952, the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as &quot;B.M.&quot; (&quot;Before MAD.&quot;) Later Knuth preferred 0-origin indexing, so October 29, 2007 is now rendered as &quot;Cal 6, 201 C.D.&quot; (for Cowznofsko Dimentii, with &quot;mad&quot; also translated into Latin). The ten &quot;Mingoes&quot; are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)

Google Calculator and WolframAlpha can both perform conversions from the potrzebie system to other units. WolframAlpha uses the originally printed value of a potrzebie, while Google Calculator appears to use a value rounded to 5 significant figures. As such, the two sites may not compute identical results.

<text>The Curtiss C-46 Commando is a low-wing, twin-engine aircraft derived from the Curtiss CW-20 pressurized high-altitude airliner design. Early press reports used the name &quot;Condor III&quot; but the Commando name was in use by early 1942 in company publicity. It was used primarily as a cargo aircraft during World War II, with fold-down seating for military transport and some use in delivering paratroops. Mainly deployed by the United States Army Air Forces, it also served the U.S. Navy/Marine Corps, which called it R5C. The C-46 filled similar roles as its Douglas-built counterpart, the C-47 Skytrain, with some 3,200 C-46s produced to approximately 10,200 C-47s.

After World War II, a few surplus C-46 aircraft were briefly used in their original role as passenger airliners but the glut of surplus C-47s dominated the marketplace and the C-46 was soon relegated to cargo duty. The type continued in U.S. Air Force service in a secondary role until 1968. The C-46 continues in operation as a rugged cargo transport for arctic and remote locations with its service life extended into the 21st century.

==Design and development==
The prototype for what would become the C-46, the Curtiss CW-20, was designed in 1937 by George A. Page Jr., the chief aircraft designer at Curtiss-Wright. The CW-20 was a private venture intended to compete with the four-engined Douglas DC-4 and Boeing 307 Stratoliner by the introduction of a new standard in pressurized airliners. The CW-20 had a patented fuselage conventionally referred to as a &quot;figure-eight&quot; (or &quot;double-bubble&quot;), which enabled it to better withstand the pressure differential at high altitudes. The sides of the fuselage creased at the level of the floor that separated the two portions and shared in the stress of each, rather than supporting itself. The main spar of the wing could pass through the bottom section, which was mainly intended for cargo, without intruding on the passenger upper compartment. A decision to use a twin-engine design instead of a four-engines was considered viable if sufficiently powerful engines were available, allowing for lower operating costs and a less complex structure.

Engineering work involved a three-year commitment from the company and incorporated an extensive amount of wind tunnel testing at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The resultant design was a large, aerodynamically &quot;sleek&quot; airliner, incorporating the cockpit in a streamlined glazed &quot;dome&quot;. The engines featured a unique nacelle tunnel cowl where air was induced and expelled through the bottom of the cowl, reducing turbulent airflow and induced drag across the upper wing surface. After a mock-up was constructed in 1938, Curtiss-Wright exhibited the innovative project as a display in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

The company approached many airlines to obtain their requirements for an advanced airliner. No firm orders resulted, although 25 letters of intent were received, sufficient to begin production. The design of a 24–34 passenger airliner proceeded to the prototype stage as the CW-20 at the St. Louis, Missouri facility with the initial configuration featuring twin vertical tail surfaces. Powered by two R-2600-C14-BA2 Wright Twin Cyclones, the prototype, registered &quot;NX-19436&quot; flew for the first time on 26 March 1940 with test pilot Edmund T. &quot;Eddie&quot; Allen at the controls. After testing, modifications, including the fitting of a large single tail to improve stability at low speeds were made.

The first prototype was purchased by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) to serve as a master for the series and was named C-55. After military evaluation, the sole example was returned to Curtiss-Wright and subsequently re-sold to the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). During testing, General Henry H. &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold became interested in the potential of the airliner as a military cargo transport and on 13 September 1940, ordered 46 modified CW-20As as the &quot;C-46-CU Commando&quot;; the last 21 aircraft in this order were delivered as Model CW-20Bs, called C-46A-1-CU. None of the C-46s purchased by the U.S. military were pressurized and the first 30 delivered to the AAF were sent back to the factory for 53 immediate modifications. The design was then modified to the C-46A, receiving enlarged cargo doors, a strengthened load floor and a convertible cabin that speeded changes in carrying freight and troops. The C-46 was introduced to the public at a ceremony in May 1942, attended by its designer, George A. Page Jr.

A total of 200 C-46As in two batches were ordered in 1940, although only two were actually delivered by 7 December 1941. An important change was made: more powerful c Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 &quot;Double Wasp&quot; engines replaced the Twin Cyclones. By November 1943, 721 modifications had been made to production models, although many were minor, such as fuel system changes and a reduction in cabin windows. Subsequent military contracts for the C-46A extended the production run to 1,454 examples, 40 of which were destined for the U.S. Marine Corps, to be called R5C-1. The military model was fitted with double cargo doors, a strengthened floor and a hydraulically operated cargo handling winch; 40 folding seats were the sole passenger accommodation for what was essentially a cargo hauler. Two C-46 were delivered from Higgins Industries Michoud Factory Field in 1942.

The final large production-run C-46D arrived in 1944–45 and featured single doors to facilitate paratroop drops. Production totaled 1,430 aircraft. Although a one-off XC-46B experimented with a stepped windscreen and more powerful engines, a small run of 17 C-46Es had many of the same features as the XC-46B, along with three-bladed Hamilton-Standard propellers replacing the standard Curtiss-Electric four-bladed units. A last contract for 234 C-46Fs reverted to the earlier cockpit shape but introduced square wing tips. A sole C-46G had the stepped windscreen and square wing tips but the end of the war resulted in the cancellation of any additional orders for the type.

==Operational history==
===Pacific Theater===
Most famous for its operations in the China-Burma-India theater (CBI) and the Far East, the Commando was a workhorse in flying over &quot;The Hump&quot; (as the Himalaya Mountains were nicknamed by Allied airmen), transporting desperately needed supplies to troops in China from bases in India. A variety of transports had been employed in the campaign but only the C-46 was able to handle the wide range of adverse conditions encountered by the USAAF. Unpredictably violent weather, heavy cargo loads, high mountain terrain, and poorly equipped and frequently flooded airfields proved a considerable challenge to the transport aircraft then in service, along with a host of engineering and maintenance nightmares due to a shortage of trained air and ground personnel.

After a series of mechanical problems were controlled if not surmounted, the C-46 proved its worth in the airlift operation despite maintenance headaches. It could carry more cargo higher than other Allied twin-engine transport aircraft in the theater, including light artillery, fuel, ammunition, parts of aircraft and, on occasion, livestock. Its powerful engines enabled it to climb satisfactorily with heavy loads, staying aloft on one engine if not overloaded, though &quot;war emergency&quot; load limits of up to often erased any safety margins. After the troublesome Curtiss-Electric electrically controlled pitch mechanism on the propellers had been removed, the C-46 continued to be employed in the CBI and over wide areas of southern China throughout the war years. Even so, the C-46 was referred to by ATC pilots as the &quot;flying coffin&quot; with at least 31 known instances of fires or explosions in flight between May 1943 and March 1945 and many others missing and never found. Other names used by the men who flew them were &quot;The Whale&quot;, the &quot;Curtiss Calamity&quot;, and the &quot;plumber&#x27;s nightmare&quot;. The C-46&#x27;s huge cargo volume (twice that of the C-47), three times the weight, large cargo doors, powerful engines and long range also made it suitable for the vast distances of the Pacific island campaign. In particular, the U.S. Marines found the aircraft (known as the R5C) useful in their amphibious Pacific operations, flying supplies in and wounded personnel out of numerous and hastily built island landing strips.

===Europe===
Although built in approximately one-third the number as its more famous wartime compatriot, the C-47 Skytrain, the C-46 nevertheless played a significant role in wartime operations, although the aircraft was not deployed in numbers to the European theater until March 1945. It augmented USAAF Troop Carrier Command in time to drop paratroopers in an offensive to cross the Rhine River in Germany (Operation Varsity). So many C-46s were lost in the paratroop drop during Varsity that Army General Matthew Ridgway issued an edict forbidding the aircraft&#x27;s use in airborne operations. Even though the war ended soon afterwards and no further airborne missions were flown, the C-46 may well have been unfairly demonized. The operation&#x27;s paratroop drop phase was flown in daylight at low speeds at very low altitudes by an unarmed cargo aircraft without self-sealing fuel tanks, over heavy concentrations of German 20 mm, 37 mm and larger caliber anti-aircraft (AA) cannon firing explosive, incendiary and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition. By that stage of the war, German AA crews had trained to a high state of readiness; many batteries had considerable combat experience in firing on and destroying high-speed, well-armed fighters and fighter-bombers while under fire themselves. Most, if not all, of the C-47s used in Operation Varsity had been fitted with self-sealing fuel tanks; the C-46s had not. Although 19 of 72 C-46 aircraft were shot down during Varsity, it is not as well known that losses of other aircraft types from AA fire during the same operation were equally as intense, including 13 gliders shot down, 14 crashed and 126 badly damaged; 15 B-24 bombers shot down and 104 badly damaged; 12 C-47s shot down, with 140 damaged.

===Design shortcomings===

Despite its obvious and valuable utility, the C-46 remained a maintenance nightmare throughout its AAF career. The official history of the Army Air Forces summarized its shortcomings,
But from first to last, the Commando remained a headache. It could be kept flying only at the cost of thousands of extra man-hours for maintenance and modification. Although Curtiss-Wright reported the accumulation by November 1943 of the astounding total of 721 required changes in production models, the plane continued to be what maintenance crews around the world aptly described as a &quot;plumber&#x27;s nightmare&quot;. Worse still, the plane was a killer. In the experienced hands of Eastern Air Lines and along a route that provided more favorable flying conditions than were confronted by military crews in Africa and on the Hump route into China, the plane did well enough. Indeed, Eastern Air Lines lost only one C-46 in more than two years of operation. But among the ATC pilots the Commando was known, with good reason, as the &quot;flying coffin&quot;. From May 1943 to March 1945, Air Transport Command received reports of thirty-one instances in which C-46s caught fire or exploded in the air. Still others were listed merely as &quot;missing in flight&quot;, and it is a safe assumption that many of these exploded, went down in flames, or crashed as the result of vapor lock, carburetor icing, or other defects.

During the war years, the C-46 was noted for an abnormal number of unexplained airborne explosions (31 between May 1943 and May 1945) that were initially attributed to various causes. In particular, the fuel system, which was quickly designed, then modified for the new, thirstier Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, was criticized. The cause of the explosions was eventually traced to pooled gasoline from small leaks in the tanks and fuel system, combined with a spark, usually originating from open-contact electrical components. Though many service aircraft suffered small fuel leaks in use, the C-46&#x27;s wings were unvented; if a leak occurred, the gasoline had nowhere to drain, but rather pooled at the wing root. Any spark or fire could set off an explosion. After the war, all C-46 aircraft received a wing vent modification to vent pooled gasoline, and an explosion-proof fuel booster pump was installed with shielded electrical selector switches in lieu of the open-contact type used originally.

===Postwar===

Overall, the C-46 had been successful in its primary role as a wartime cargo transport and had benefited from a series of improvements. Like the C-47/DC-3, the C-46 seemed destined for a useful career as a postwar civilian passenger airliner and was considered for that by Eastern Airlines. However, the high operating costs of the C-46 (up to 50 percent greater than the C-47), soon caused most operators to change their minds and most postwar C-46 operations were limited to commercial cargo transport and then only for certain routes. One of the C-46&#x27;s failings was the prodigious fuel consumption of its powerful engines, which used fuel at a much higher rate than the C-47/DC-3. Maintenance was also more intensive and costlier. Despite these disadvantages, surplus C-46s were used by some air carriers, including Capitol Airways, Flying Tigers, Civil Air Transport and World Airways to carry cargo and passengers. Many other small carriers also eventually operated the type on scheduled and non-scheduled routes. The C-46 became a common sight in South America and was widely used in Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, especially in mountainous areas (where a good climb rate and high service ceiling were required) or to overfly deep jungle terrain where ground transport was impracticable.

C-46 Commandos also went back to war. A dozen surplus C-46&#x27;s were purchased in the United States covertly for use in Israel&#x27;s 1948 war for independence and flown to Czechoslovakia in a circuitous route along South America and then across to Africa. The type&#x27;s long range proved invaluable in flying cargo, including desperately needed dismantled S-199 fighters from Czechoslovakia as well as other weapons and military supplies. On the return flight the C-46&#x27;s would dump bombs out the cargo door on various targets at night, including Gaza, El Arish, Majdal, and Faluja (Egypt and Israel also used C-47s as bombers and transports locally). C-46&#x27;s served in Korea and Vietnam for various U.S. Air Force operations, including supply missions, paratroop drops and clandestine agent transportation. The C-46 was also employed in the abortive U.S.-supported Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The C-46 was not officially retired from service with the U.S. Air Force until 1968.

The type served in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The C-46 played a supporting role in many clandestine operations during the late 1940s and early 1950s, including supply efforts to Chiang Kai-Shek&#x27;s troops battling Mao&#x27;s Communists in China as well as flying cargoes of military and medical supplies to French forces via Gialam Airfield in Hanoi and other bases in French Indochina. The CIA operated its own &quot;airline&quot; for these operations, Civil Air Transport, which was eventually renamed Air America in 1959. An Air America C-46 was the last fixed-wing aircraft flown out of Vietnam [Saigon] at the close of hostilities there. On 29 April 1975, Capt. E. G. Adams flew a 52-seat version, with 152 people on board, to Bangkok, Thailand.

The Japan Air Self-Defense Force used the Commando until at least 1978. The Republic of China Air Force operated the C-46 up until 1982 before it was retired. Although their numbers began to dwindle, C-46s continued to operate in remote locations and could be seen in service from Canada and Alaska to Africa and South America. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Canadian airline Lamb Air operated several C-46s from their bases in Thompson and Churchill, Manitoba. One of the largest C-46 operators was Air Manitoba, whose fleet of aircraft featured gaudy color schemes for individual aircraft. In the 1990s, these aircraft were sold to other owner/operators. Between 1993 and 1995, Relief Air Transport operated three Canadian registered C-46s on Operation Lifeline Sudan from Lokichoggio, Kenya. These aircraft also transported humanitarian supplies to Goma, Zaire and Mogadishu, Somalia from their base in Nairobi, Kenya. One of the aircraft (C-GIXZ) was lost near Lokichoggio while the remaining two (C-GTXW &amp; C-GIBX) eventually made their way back to Canada. These two aircraft were then operated as freighters for First Nations Transportation in Gimli, Manitoba but the airline later ceased operations with one aircraft sold to Buffalo Airways and the other tied up in receivership. According to First Nations Transport, as of Jan 2016, the latter aircraft (C-GIBX) was claimed to be airworthy with two new engines and available for sale with the fire bottles and props needing updates. The other former First Nations Transportation C-46 (C-GTXW) flew for Buffalo Airways until it was scrapped in 2015. Two aircraft of the same type (C-GTPO and C-FAVO) continue to be used by the same carrier primarily in Canada&#x27;s Arctic. They have been featured on the Ice Pilots NWT television show. Prices for a used C-46 in 1960 ranged from £20,000 for a C-46F conversion, to £60,000 for a C-46R.

<text>The Heart Sūtra is a popular sutra in Mahāyāna Buddhism. In Sanskrit, the title translates as &quot;The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom&quot;.

The Sutra famously states, &quot;Form is emptiness (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;), emptiness is form.&quot; It has been called &quot;the most frequently used and recited text in the entire Mahayana Buddhist tradition.&quot; The text has been translated into English dozens of times from Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan, as well as other source languages.

==Summary of the sutra==
In the sutra, Avalokiteśvara addresses Śariputra, explaining the fundamental emptiness (śūnyatā) of all phenomena, known through and as the five aggregates of human existence (skandhas): form (rūpa), feeling (vedanā), volitions (saṅkhāra), perceptions (saṃjñā), and mind (vijñāna). Avalokiteśvara famously states, &quot;Form is Emptiness (śūnyatā). Emptiness is Form&quot;, and declares the other skandhas to be equally empty—that is, dependently originated.

Avalokiteśvara then goes through some of the most fundamental Buddhist teachings, such as the Four Noble Truths, and explains that in emptiness, none of these notions apply. This is interpreted according to the two truths doctrine as saying that teachings, while accurate descriptions of conventional truth, are mere statements about reality—they are not reality itself—and that they are therefore not applicable to the ultimate truth that is by definition beyond mental understanding. Thus the bodhisattva, as the archetypal Mahayana Buddhist, relies on the perfection of wisdom, defined in the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; to be the wisdom that perceives reality directly without conceptual attachment, thereby achieving nirvana.

The sutra concludes with the mantra &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;gone, gone, everyone gone to the other shore, awakening, svaha.&quot;

==Popularity and stature==
The Heart Sutra is &quot;the single most commonly recited, copied, and studied scripture in East Asian Buddhism.&quot; It is recited by adherents of Mahayana schools of Buddhism regardless of sectarian affiliation with the exception of Shin Buddhists and Nichiren Buddhists， apart from being recited by Yiguandao believers, whom they also worship Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, known as the &quot;Ancient Buddha of the Southern Seas&quot;.

While the origin of the sutra is disputed by some modern scholars, it was widely known throughout South Asia (including Afghanistan) from at least the Pala Empire period (–1200 CE) and in parts of India until at least the middle of the 14th century. The stature of the Heart Sutra throughout early medieval India can be seen from its title &#x27;Holy Mother of all Buddhas Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom&#x27; dating from at least the 8th century CE (see Philological explanation of the text).

The long version of the Heart Sutra is extensively studied by the various Tibetan Buddhist schools, where the Heart Sutra is chanted, but also treated as a tantric text, with a tantric ceremony associated with it. It is also viewed as one of the daughter sutras of the Prajnaparamita genre in the Vajrayana tradition as passed down from Tibet.

The text has been translated into many languages, and dozens of English translations and commentaries have been published, along with an unknown number of informal versions on the internet.

==Versions==
There are two main versions of the Heart Sutra: a short version and a long version.

The short version as translated by Xuanzang is the most popular version of adherents practicing East Asian schools of Buddhism. Xuanzang&#x27;s canonical text (T. 251) has a total of 260 Chinese characters. Some Japanese and Korean versions have an additional 2 characters. The short version has also been translated into Tibetan but it is not part of the current Tibetan Buddhist Canon.

The long version differs from the short version by including both an introductory and concluding section, features that most Buddhist sutras have. The introduction introduces the sutra to the listener with the traditional Buddhist opening phrase &quot;Thus have I heard&quot;. It then describes the venue in which the Buddha (or sometimes bodhisattvas, etc.) promulgate the teaching and the audience to whom the teaching is given. The concluding section ends the sutra with thanks and praises to the Buddha.

Both versions are chanted on a daily basis by adherents of practically all schools of East Asian Buddhism and by some adherents of Tibetan and Newar Buddhism.

==Dating and origins==
===Earliest Chinese translation===
The earliest version of the Heart Sutra may have been translated by Zhi Qian in 222-250 CE. However because it was already lost by Xuanzang&#x27;s time, its contents are unknown. According to Conze, Kumarajiva&#x27;s (fl 4th century CE) translation of the short version of the Heart Sutra (T250) is the earliest translation of the Heart Sutra; however he believes it should be attributed to one of Kumarajiva&#x27;s disciples. John McRae and Jan Nattier have argued that this translation was created by someone else, much later, based on Kumārajīva&#x27;s &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; (Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom). The earliest extant copy of Kumarajiva&#x27;s translation however, dates only to the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). According to Huili&#x27;s biography, Xuanzang learned the sutra from an inhabitant of Sichuan, and subsequently chanted it during times of danger on his journey to the West (i.e. India). Xuanzang however did not translate the Heart Sutra until some years after his return to China in 649 CE. Xuanzang&#x27;s version of the Heart Sutra (T251) in the Chinese Tripiṭaka is the first extant version to use the title &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; (心經 &quot;xīnjīng&quot;). Fukui Fumimasa has argued that &quot;心經&quot; or Heart Sutra may mean &quot;dhāraṇī sutra&quot;.
This sutra is classified by Edward Conze as belonging to the third of four periods in the development of the Prajñāpāramitā canon, although because it contains a mantra (sometimes called a &quot;dhāraṇī&quot;), it does overlap with the final, tantric phase of development according to this scheme, and is included in the tantra section of at least some editions of the Kangyur. Conze estimates the sutra&#x27;s date of origin to be 350 CE; some others consider it to be two centuries older than that.

===Earliest extant versions and references to the Heart Sutra===
The earliest extant dated text of the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; is a stone stele dated to 661 CE. It was engraved three years before the death of Tripitaka Master Xuanzang and twelve years after its translation, by patrons from Yueyang County adjacent to Chang&#x27;an (today known as Xian) not far from where Xuanzang was doing his translation work at the time. It is part of the Fangshan Stone Sutra and located in Yunju Temple nearby Beijing. The second oldest extant dated text of the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; is another stone stele located at Yunju Temple. It is dated to 669 CE. The third earliest extant dated text of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; is a stone stele dated to 672 CE; formerly believed to be the oldest extant text which now stands in the Beilin Museum, Xian. All of the above stone steles have the same descriptive inscription : &quot;(Tripitaka Master) Xuanzang was commanded by Emperor Tang Taizong to translate the Heart Sutra.&quot;

A palm-leaf manuscript found at the Hōryū-ji Temple is the earliest undated extant Sanskrit manuscript of the Heart Sutra. It is dated to c. 7th–8th century CE by the Tokyo National Museum where it is currently kept.

===Authorship of the Heart Sutra===

====Nattier&#x27;s hypothesis====
According to Conze (1967), approximately 90% of the Heart Sutra is derivable from the larger Sanskrit Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, including the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 25,000 lines), the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 8,000 lines), and the &quot;Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 100,000 lines). 

Nattier (1992) questions the Sanskrit origins of the Heart Sutra. Nattier states that there is no direct or indirect evidence (such as a commentary) of a Sanskrit version before the 8th century, and she dates the first evidence (in the form of commentaries by Xuanzang&#x27;s disciples Kuiji and Woncheuk, and Dunhuang manuscripts) of Chinese versions to the 7th century. Nattier believes that the corroborating evidence supports a Chinese version at least a century before a Sanskrit version. 

Nattier further argues that it is unusual for Avalokiteśvara to be in the central role in a Prajñāpāramitā text. Early Prajñāpāramitā texts involve Subhuti, who is absent from both versions of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot;. The Buddha is only present in the longer version of the Heart Sutra. Nattier claims the presence of Avalokitesvara in the Heart Sutra could be considered evidence that the text is Chinese in origin as Avalokitesvara was never as popular in India. Nattier also points out that the &quot;gate gate&quot; mantra exists in several variations, and is associated with several different Prajñāpāramitā texts.

According to Nattier, only 40% of the extant text of the Heart Sutra is a quotation from the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; (Great Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom), a commentary on the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; written by Nāgārjuna and translated by Kumārajīva; while the rest was newly composed. Based on textual patterns in the extant Sanskrit and Chinese versions of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; and the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, Nattier has argued that the supposedly earliest extant version of the Heart Sutra, translated by Kumārajīva (344-413), that Xuanzang supposedly received from an inhabitant of Sichuan prior to his travels to India, was probably first composed in China in the Chinese language from a mixture of material derived from Kumārajīva&#x27;s Chinese translation of the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot;, and newly composed text (60% of the text). According to Nattier, Xuanzang&#x27;s version of this text (Taisho 251) was later translated into Sanskrit, or properly speaking, back-translated, since part of the sutra was a translation of a Sanskrit text. 

According to Nattier, excluding the new composition, Kumarajiva&#x27;s version of the Heart Sutra (T250) matches the corresponding parts of Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; almost exactly; the other, Xuanzang&#x27;s version (T251) are missing two lines with a number of other differences, including one different line, and differences in terminology. The corresponding extant Sanskrit texts (ie. Heart Sutra and Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 25,000 lines), while agreeing in meaning, differ in virtually every word.

====Criticism of Nattier====
Nattier&#x27;s hypothesis has been rejected by several scholars, including Harada Waso, Fukui Fumimasa, Ishii Kōsei, and Siu Sai Yau, on the basis of historical accounts and comparison with the extant Sanskrit Buddhist manuscript fragments. Harada and Ishii, as well as other researchers such as Hyun Choo and Dan Lusthaus, also argue that evidence can be found within the 7th-century commentaries of Kuiji and Woncheuk, two important disciples of Xuanzang, that undermine Nattier&#x27;s argument. 

Li states that of the Indic Palm-leaf manuscript (patra sutras) or sastras brought over to China, most were either lost or not translated. Red Pine, a practicing American Buddhist, favours the idea of a lost manuscript of the &quot;Large Perfection of Wisdom Sutra&quot; (Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra) with the alternate Sanskrit wording, allowing for an original Indian composition, which may still be extant, and located at the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda.

Harada rejects Nattier&#x27;s claims that the central role of Avalokiteśvara points to a Chinese origin for the Heart Sutra. Harada notes that the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā&quot; (&quot;Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 8,000 lines&quot;), one of the two oldest prajñāpāramitā sutras, also has other speakers than the Buddha, namely Subhuti, Sariputra as well as Ananda. Harada also notes the blending of Prajñāpāramitā and Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhist belief beginning from at least Faxian and Xuanzang&#x27;s time (i.e. 4th - 5th century CE and 7th century CE); and therefore Avalokiteśvara&#x27;s presence in the Heart Sutra is quite natural. Siu also notes that Avalokitesvara&#x27;s presence as the main speaker in the Heart Sutra is justifiable on several basis.

However, the question of authorship remains controversial, and other researchers such as Jayarava Attwood (2021) continue to find Nattier&#x27;s argument for a Chinese origin of the text most convincing explanation.

==Philological explanation of the text==

===Title===

====Historical titles====
The titles of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Heart Sutra all includes the words &quot;hṛdaya&quot; or &quot;heart&quot; and &quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot; or &quot;perfection of wisdom&quot;. Beginning from the 8th century and continuing at least until the 13th century, the titles of the Indic manuscripts of the Heart Sutra contained the words &quot;bhagavatī&quot; or &quot;mother of all buddhas&quot; and &quot;prajñāpāramitā&quot;.

Later Indic manuscripts have more varied titles.

====Titles in use today====
In the western world, this sutra is known as the Heart Sutra (a translation derived from its most common name in East Asian countries). But it is also sometimes called the Heart of Wisdom Sutra. In Tibet, Mongolia and other regions influenced by Vajrayana, it is known as The [Holy] Mother of all Buddhas Heart (Essence) of the Perfection of Wisdom.

In the Tibetan text the title is given first in Sanskrit and then in Tibetan: (&quot;&quot;), ; .

In other languages, the commonly used title is an abbreviation of Prajñāpāramitāhṛdayasūtraṃ : i.e. The Prajñāhṛdaya Sūtra) (The Heart of Wisdom Sutra). They are as follows: e.g. Korean: &quot;Banya Shimgyeong&quot; (); Chinese:&quot;Bo Re Xin Jing&quot;();Japanese:&quot;Hannya Shingyō&quot; (); Vietnamese ().

===Content===
Various commentators divide this text into different numbers of sections. 

====Opening====
In the longer version, there exists the traditional opening &quot;Thus have I heard&quot; and Buddha along with a community of bodhisattvas and monks gathered with the &quot;bodhisattva&quot; of great compassion, Avalokiteśvara, and Sariputra, at Gridhakuta (a mountain peak located at Rajgir, the traditional site where the majority of the Perfection of Wisdom teachings were given). Through the power of Buddha, Sariputra asks Avalokiteśvara for advice on the practice of the Perfection of Wisdom. 

The longer sutra then describes, while the shorter opens with, the liberation of Avalokiteśvara, gained while practicing the paramita of prajña (wisdom), seeing the fundamental emptiness (śūnyatā) of the five skandhas: form (rūpa), feeling (vedanā), volitions (saṅkhāra), perceptions (saṃjñā), and consciousness (vijñāna).

====Form is emptiness====
Avalokiteśvara addresses Śariputra, who was the promulgator of abhidharma according to the scriptures and texts of the Sarvastivada and other early Buddhist schools, having been singled out by the Buddha to receive those teachings. Avalokiteśvara famously states, &quot;Form is empty (śūnyatā). Emptiness is form&quot;, and declares the other skandhas to be equally empty of the most fundamental Buddhist teachings such as the Four Noble Truths and explains that in emptiness none of these notions apply. This is interpreted according to the two truths doctrine as saying that teachings, while accurate descriptions of conventional truth, are mere statements about reality—they are not reality itself—and that they are therefore not applicable to the ultimate truth that is by definition beyond mental understanding.

The specific sequence of concepts listed in lines 12–20 (&quot;...in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, ... no attainment and no non-attainment&quot;) is the same sequence used in the Sarvastivadin &quot;Samyukta Agama&quot;; this sequence differs in comparable texts of other sects. On this basis, Red Pine has argued that the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; is specifically a response to Sarvastivada teachings that, in the sense &quot;phenomena&quot; or its constituents, are real. Lines 12–13 enumerate the five skandhas. Lines 14–15 list the twelve ayatanas or abodes. Line 16 makes a reference to the 18 &quot;dhatus&quot; or elements of consciousness, using a conventional shorthand of naming only the first (eye) and last (conceptual consciousness) of the elements. Lines 17–18 assert the emptiness of the Twelve Nidānas, the traditional twelve links of dependent origination, using the same shorthand as with the eighteen dhatus. Line 19 refers to the Four Noble Truths.

====Reliance on the prajnaparamita====
The bodhisattva, as the archetypal Mahayana Buddhist, relies on the perfection of wisdom, defined in the &quot;Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra&quot; to be the wisdom that perceives reality directly without conceptual attachment thereby achieving nirvana. All Buddhas of the three ages (past, present and future) rely on the Perfection of Wisdom to reach unexcelled complete Enlightenment. 

====Unsurpassed knowledge====
The final lines of the Heart Sutra can be read in two different ways, depending on the interpretation of the character 咒, zhòu, meaning either mantra (&quot;danini&quot;), or &quot;a superlative kind of practical knowledge or incantation (&quot;vidyā&quot;). According to Attwood, &quot;vidyā&quot; may be misunderstood, and the concluding mantra may have been a later addition.

Therefore, the Perfection of Wisdom is the all powerful mantra/knowledge, the great enlightening mantra/knowledge, the unexcelled mantra/knowledge, the unequalled mantra/knowledge, able to dispel all suffering. This is true and not false.

====Conclusion====
The shorter sutra concludes with the mantra: &quot;Gate Gate Pāragate Pārasamgate Bodhi Svāhā&quot; (literally &quot;Gone gone, gone beyond, gone utterly beyond, Enlightenment hail!&quot;). 

In the longer version, Buddha praises Avalokiteśvara for giving the exposition of the Perfection of Wisdom and all gathered rejoice in its teaching. Many schools traditionally have also praised the sutra by uttering three times the equivalent of &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitā&quot; after the end of the recitation of the short version.

===Mantra===
The &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; mantra in Sanskrit is (IAST: &quot;&quot;, IPA: ), meaning &quot;gone, gone, everyone gone to the other shore, awakening, svaha.&quot;

==Buddhist exegetical works==
===China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Vietnam===

Two commentaries of the Heart Sutra were composed by pupils of Xuanzang, Woncheuk and Kuiji, in the 7th century. These appear to be the earliest extant commentaries on the text. Both have been translated into English. Both Kuījī and Woncheuk&#x27;s commentaries approach the Heart Sutra from both a Yogācāra and Madhyamaka viewpoint; however, Kuījī&#x27;s commentary presents detailed line by line Madhyamaka viewpoints as well and is therefore the earliest surviving Madhyamaka commentary on the Heart Sutra. Of special note, although Woncheuk did his work in China, he was born in Silla, one of the kingdoms located at the time in Korea.

The chief Tang Dynasty commentaries have all now been translated into English.

Notable Japanese commentaries include those by Kūkai (9th Century, Japan), who treats the text as a tantra, and Hakuin, who gives a Zen commentary.

There is also a Vietnamese commentarial tradition for the Heart Sutra. The earliest recorded commentary is the early 14th century Thiền commentary entitled &#x27;Commentary on the Prajñāhṛdaya Sutra&#x27; by Pháp Loa.

All of the East Asian commentaries are commentaries of Xuanzang&#x27;s translation of the short version of the Heart Sutra. Kukai&#x27;s commentary is purportedly of Kumārajīva&#x27;s translation of the short version of the Heart Sutra;but upon closer examination seems to quote only from Xuanzang&#x27;s translation.

===India===
Eight Indian commentaries survive in Tibetan translation and have been the subject of two books by Donald Lopez. These typically treat the text either from a Madhyamaka point of view, or as a tantra (esp. Śrīsiṃha). Śrī Mahājana&#x27;s commentary has a definite &quot;Yogachara bent&quot;. All of these commentaries are on the long version of the Heart Sutra. The Eight Indian Commentaries from the Kangyur are (cf first eight on chart):

There is one surviving Chinese translation of an Indian commentary in the Chinese Buddhist Canon. Āryadeva&#x27;s commentary is on the short version of the Heart Sutra.

===Other===
Besides the Tibetan translation of Indian commentaries on the Heart Sutra, Tibetan monk-scholars also made their own commentaries. One example is Tāranātha&#x27;s A Textual Commentary on the Heart Sutra.

In modern times, the text has become increasingly popular amongst exegetes as a growing number of translations and commentaries attest. The Heart Sutra was already popular in Chan and Zen Buddhism, but has become a staple for Tibetan Lamas as well.

===Selected English translations===
The first English translation was presented to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1863 by Samuel Beal, and published in their journal in 1865. Beal used a Chinese text corresponding to T251 and a 9th Century Chan commentary by Dàdiān Bǎotōng () [c. 815 CE]. In 1881, Max Müller published a Sanskrit text based on the Hōryū-ji manuscript along an English translation.

There are more than 40 published English translations of the Heart Sutra from Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, beginning with Beal (1865). Almost every year new translations and commentaries are published. The following is a representative sample.

=== Recordings ===

The &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; has been set to music a number of times. Many singers solo this sutra.

* The Buddhist Audio Visual Production Centre () produced a Cantonese album of recordings of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; in 1995 featuring a number of Hong Kong pop singers, including Alan Tam, Anita Mui and Faye Wong and composer by Andrew Lam Man Chung () to raise money to rebuild the Chi Lin Nunnery. 
* Malaysian Imee Ooi () sings the short version of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; in Sanskrit accompanied by music entitled &#x27;The Shore Beyond, Prajna Paramita Hrdaya Sutram&#x27;, released in 2009.
* Composer and recording artist Robert Gass, with his group On Wings of Song, released &quot;Heart of Perfect Wisdom&quot; in 1990, with two long pieces prominently featuring the &quot;Gate Gate&quot; mantra. This is now available as &quot;Heart of Perfect Wisdom / A Sufi Song of Love&quot;.

* A slightly edited version is used as the lyrics for Yoshimitsu&#x27;s theme in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Tekken Tag Tournament&quot;. An Indian styled version was also created by Bombay Jayashri, titled Ji Project. It was also recorded and arranged by Malaysian singer/composer Imee Ooi. 
* An Esperanto translation of portions of the text furnished the libretto of the cantata &quot;La Koro Sutro&quot; by American composer Lou Harrison.
* The &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; appears as a track on an album of sutras &quot;performed&quot; by VOCALOID voice software, using the Nekomura Iroha voice pack. The album, &quot;Syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism by VOCALOID&quot;, is by the artist tamachang.
* Toward the end of the opera The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs by Mason Bates the character inspired by Kōbun Chino Otogawa sings part of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; to introduce the scene in which Steve Jobs weds Laurene Powell at Yosemite in 1991.
* Part of the Sutra can be heard on Shiina Ringo&#x27;s song , from her studio album Sandokushi (2019)

==Popular culture==
In the centuries following the historical Xuanzang, an extended tradition of literature fictionalizing the life of Xuanzang and glorifying his special relationship with the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; arose, of particular note being the &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (16th century/Ming dynasty). In chapter nineteen of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the fictitious Xuanzang learns by heart the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; after hearing it recited one time by the Crow&#x27;s Nest Zen Master, who flies down from his tree perch with a scroll containing it, and offers to impart it. A full text of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; is quoted in this fictional account.

The 1782 Japanese text &quot;, commonly known as Hoichi the Earless, because of its inclusion in the 1904 book , makes usage of this &quot;Sūtra&quot;. It involves the titular Hoichi having his whole body painted with the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; to protect against malicious spirits, with the accidental exception of his ears, making him vulnerable nonetheless. A filmed adaptation of this story is included in the 1964 horror anthology Kwaidan.

In the 2003 Korean film &quot;Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring&quot;, the apprentice is ordered by his Master to carve the Chinese characters of the sutra into the wooden monastery deck to quiet his heart.

The Sanskrit mantra of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; was used as the lyrics for the opening theme song of the 2011 Chinese television series &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

The 2013 Buddhist film &quot;Avalokitesvara,&quot; tells the origins of Mount Putuo, the famous pilgrimage site for Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva in China. The film was filmed onsite on Mount Putuo and featured several segments where monks chant the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; in Chinese and Sanskrit. Egaku, the protagonist of the film, also chants the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; in Japanese.

In the 2015 Japanese film &quot;I Am a Monk&quot;, Koen, a twenty-four year old bookstore clerk becomes a Shingon monk at the Eifuku-ji after the death of his grandfather. The Eifuku-ji is the fifty-seventh temple in the eighty-eight temple Shikoku Pilgrimage Circuit. He is at first unsure of himself. However, during his first service as he chants the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot;, he comes to an important realization.

Bear McCreary recorded four Japanese-American monks chanting in Japanese, the entire &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot; in his sound studio. He picked a few discontinuous segments and digitally enhanced them for their hypnotic sound effect. The result became the main theme of King Ghidorah in the 2019 film &quot;.&quot;

==Influence on western philosophy==
Schopenhauer, in the final words of his main work, compared his doctrine to the Śūnyatā of the &quot;Heart Sūtra&quot;. In Volume 1, § 71 of &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Schopenhauer wrote: &quot;...to those in whom the will [to continue living] has turned and has denied itself, this very real world of ours, with all its suns and Milky Ways, is — nothing.&quot; To this, he appended the following note: &quot;This is also the Prajna–Paramita of the Buddhists, the &#x27;beyond all knowledge,&#x27; in other words, the point where subject and object no longer exist.&quot;

<text>The Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express was a transport derivative of the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber built during World War II for the United States Army Air Forces. A total of 287 C-87s were delivered by Consolidated Aircraft from its plant in Fort Worth, Texas. 

The plant also developed and delivered a USAAF flight engineer trainer designated the AT-22. Other versions included the AAF C-87A, an executive transport version; and the RY, a United States Navy VIP transport. 

The Navy also ordered the RY-3, a Navy-contracted, single-tail version with an extended fuselage built in San Diego; the AAF also ordered the design under the designation C-87C. Those were cancelled and allotted to a Royal Air Force VIP transport designated the Liberator C.IX.

The C-109 Liberator was a fuel-transport converted from existing B-24s.

==Design and development==
The C-87 was hastily designed in early 1942 to fill the need for a heavy cargo and personnel transport with longer range and better high-altitude performance than the Douglas C-47 Skytrain, the most widely available United States Army Air Forces transport aircraft at the time. Production began in 1942.

The first C-87 prototype was 41–11608. The design included various modifications, including the elimination of gun turrets and other armament along with the installation of a strengthened cargo floor, including a floor running through the bomb bay. The glazed nose of the bombardier compartment of the B-24 was replaced by a hinged metal cap to allow loading the nose compartment, which in the bomber version can only be reached through a crawlspace under the cockpit floor. A cargo door was added to the port side of the fuselage, just forward of the tail, and a row of windows was fitted along the sides of the fuselage.

The C-87 could be fitted with removable seats and racks to carry personnel or litters in place of cargo. In its final configuration, the C-87 could carry between 20 and 25 passengers or of cargo. Because of wartime production bottlenecks and shortages, many C-87 aircraft were fitted with turbosuperchargers producing lower boost pressure and thus unable to sustain power at the same altitudes as those fitted to B-24s destined for combat use, and ceiling and climb rate were accordingly reduced.

===C-87A VIP transport===
In 1942 and 1943, several C-87 aircraft were converted into VIP luxury passenger transports by adding insulation, padded seats, dividers, and other accommodations. The modified aircraft, designated C-87A, could carry 16 passengers. One C-87A, serial &quot;41-24159&quot;, was converted in 1943 to a presidential VIP transport, the &quot;Guess Where II&quot;, intended to carry President Franklin D. Roosevelt on international trips. Had it been accepted, it would have been the first aircraft to be used in presidential service, i.e. the first Air Force One. However, the Secret Service, after a review of the C-87&#x27;s controversial safety record, flatly refused to approve the &quot;Guess Where II&quot; for presidential carriage. The &quot;Guess Where II&quot; was used to transport senior members of the Roosevelt administration and in March 1944, flew Eleanor Roosevelt on a goodwill tour of several Latin American countries.

===XC-87B===
A damaged B-24D, 42-40355, became what is referred to as the XC-87B with an extended fuselage and low-altitude engine packages. This transport, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; as it was known, was later converted to a single tailfin with Privateer-type engine packages. This should not be confused with the cancelled XC-87B project which proposed an armed transport.

==Operational history==
Most C-87s were operated by the U.S. Air Transport Command and flown by formerly civilian crews from U.S. civil transport carriers. The planes were initially used on transoceanic routes too long to be flown by the C-47. After the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942, the C-87 was used for flying war material from India to American and Chinese forces over &quot;The Hump&quot;, the treacherous air route that crossed the Himalayas. When the route was established, the C-87 was the only readily available American transport with high-altitude performance good enough to fly this route while carrying a large cargo load.

The C-87 was plagued by numerous problems and suffered from a poor reputation among its crews. Veteran airline pilot and author Ernest K. Gann, in his 1961 memoir &quot;Fate is the Hunter&quot;, wrote: &quot;They were an evil bastard contraption, nothing like the relatively efficient B-24 except in appearance.&quot; Complaints centered around electrical and hydraulic system failures in extreme cold at high altitudes, a disconcertingly frequent loss of all cockpit illumination during takeoffs, and a flight deck heating system that either produced stifling heat or did not function at all.

The C-87 did not climb well when heavily loaded, a dangerous characteristic when flying out of the unimproved, rain-soaked airfields of India and China; many were lost on takeoff with the loss of just a single engine. Gann&#x27;s book recounts a near-collision with the Taj Mahal after takeoff in a heavily loaded C-87 when full flaps had to be hastily deployed to increase the aircraft&#x27;s altitude to avoid the edifice. The aircraft&#x27;s auxiliary long-range fuel tanks were linked by improvised and often leaky fuel lines that crisscrossed the crew compartment, choking flight crews with noxious gasoline fumes and creating an explosion hazard. The C-87 also had a tendency to enter an uncontrollable stall or spin when confronted with even mild icing conditions, a frequent occurrence over the Himalayas. Gann said they &quot;could not carry enough ice to chill a highball&quot;.

The aircraft could also become unstable in flight if its center of gravity shifted due to improper cargo loading. This longitudinal instability arose from the aircraft&#x27;s hasty conversion from bomber to cargo transport. Unlike a normal cargo transport, which was designed from the start with a contiguous cargo compartment with a safety margin for fore-and-aft loading variations, the bomb racks and bomb bays built into the B-24 design were fixed in position, greatly limiting the aircraft&#x27;s ability to tolerate improper loading. This problem was exacerbated by wartime exigencies and the failure of USAAF Air Transport Command to instruct loadmasters in the C-87&#x27;s peculiarities. The design&#x27;s roots as a bomber are also considered culpable for frequently collapsing nosegear; its strength was adequate for an aircraft that dropped its payload in flight before landing on a well-maintained runway, but it proved marginal for an aircraft making repeated hard landings on rugged unimproved airstrips while heavily loaded.

Despite its shortcomings and unpopularity among its crews, the C-87 was valued for the reliability of its Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, superior speed that enabled it to mitigate significantly the effect of head and cross winds, a service ceiling that allowed it to surmount most weather fronts, and range that permitted its crews to fly &quot;pressure-front&quot; patterns that chased favorable winds. The C-87 was never fully displaced on the air routes by the Douglas C-54 Skymaster and Curtiss C-46 Commando, which offered similar performance combined with greater reliability and more benign flight characteristics. Some surviving C-87 aircraft were converted into VIP transports or flight crew trainers, and several others were sold to the Royal Air Force.

==Accidents and incidents==
The Aviation Safety Network, part of the Flight Safety Foundation, records 150 hull loss accidents involving the C-87 or the C-109 occurring between 1942 and 1964.

On 30 November 1943, a C-87 with a crew of four plus a passenger ran out of fuel flying from Kunming, China to Jorhat, India, when it was blown off-course by strong wind. All five onboard landed near Tsetang, Tibet, and became some of the first Americans to visit Lhasa.

The worst accident took place 25 July 1944. All 27 on board USAAF C.87 &quot;41-11706&quot; were killed when it crashed on Florida Island in the south-west Pacific; the crew were civilian employees of Consairway and the passengers were high-ranking British and American officers, including Royal Air Force Air commodore Isaac John Fitch.

The next year, in July 1945 a Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express operated by the Royal Air Force bound for Manus Island failed to gain altitude after taking off from Sydney&#x27;s now non-existent runway 22, struck trees and crashed into the ground in Brighton-Le-Sands. The aircraft exploded on impact, killing all 12 passengers and crew on board. The victims were from the British, Australian and New Zealand armed forces.

Another notable accident took place on 15 April 1957 when C-87 &quot;XA-KUN&quot;, operated by TAMSA (Transportes Aéreos Mexicanos SA), crashed after take-off from Mérida-Rejon Airport, killing all on board, including the famous Mexican actor and singer Pedro Infante.

<doc id="460533" wikidata="Q1416017" url="?curid=460533" title="Island Line, Isle of Wight">
<text>The Island Line is a railway line on the Isle of Wight which runs along the island&#x27;s east coast and links with . Trains connect at with passenger ferries to , and these ferries in turn connect with the rest of the National Rail network via the Portsmouth Direct Line. The line also connects to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, a heritage railway, at . For much of its length the line runs alongside the A3055, criss-crossing this road by means of the Ryde Tunnel and bridges at Rowborough, Morton Common, Lake Hill and Littlestairs.

==Route==
The line starts at Ryde Pier Head station, which is located at the sea end of Ryde Pier and connects with cross−Solent ferry services to/from operated by Wightlink. The station has an island platform with two platform faces and two tracks, although only the western track (and thus only one platform face) remains in passenger use. From here, the line runs along the pier&#x27;s eastern side towards the shore before reaching Ryde Esplanade station at the other end of the pier. Located north of Ryde&#x27;s town centre, Esplanade station is the busiest of the three stations in the town; it forms part of the town&#x27;s main transport interchange along with the nearby Ryde Bus Station (offering bus services to the rest of the island) and Ryde Hoverport (with cross−Solent hovercraft connections to and from Southsea). The station has one side platform in operation; a second platform, which was converted into a garden in 2015, lies adjacent to the disused track.

Although the line along the pier appears to be a typical double-track line, the eastern track is no longer connected to the rest of the line, having been cut off during the 2021 upgrade works. Prior to that, there was no crossover between the two tracks until immediately south of Esplanade station, meaning they were &quot;de facto&quot; two separate single-track lines, a layout similar to those at , and stations.

South of Esplanade station, both tracks are operational. The line continues as double-track through Ryde via the Ryde Tunnel, bypassing the town centre to the northeast, before it reaches Ryde St John&#x27;s Road station to the east of the town centre. The station has a total of three platforms linked by a footbridge, two of which are in regular use by passenger services. The third platform, while open, is a south-facing bay platform, meaning only the few terminating services can stop there. Adjacent to St John&#x27;s Road station is Ryde depot − the only traction maintenance depot on the line.

The line then leaves Ryde and continues southwards, reducing to single-track immediately north of the next station, . This station is unique on the National Rail network in that there is no public access into or out of the station − it exists purely as an interchange between the Island Line and the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. The station was built in 1991 − the same year that the steam railway was extended to this location. Despite the station&#x27;s name there is no longer an actual junction here, as the two railway lines are not physically connected to each other.

The next station on the line is , which has two platforms connected by a footbridge and a foot crossing at the southern end of the station, as well as a passing loop which allows trains running in opposite directions to pass each other. The original passing loop was closed and lifted in 1988, but was reinstated and brought back into use in 2021 as part of the line improvement programme; the second platform and the footbridge between the two platforms had been mothballed throughout this closure. The line then continues in a southwesterly direction towards Sandown station, which has retained its passing loop; the station&#x27;s two platforms are connected by a subway.

Beyond Sandown, the line is single-track for the remainder of the route. The penultimate station on the line is , opened in 1987, and the line terminates just over a mile later at Shanklin station. Shanklin also used to have a second platform, which is now used as a flowerbed. Until 1966, the line continued further south to and (see &quot;History&quot; below).

The full line, from Ryde Pier Head to Shanklin, is long.

==Services==
As of April 2023, train services on the line run every 30 minutes in each direction between Ryde and Shanklin, calling at all intermediate stations except (usually) Smallbrook Junction. This frequency has been made possible by an additional passing loop installed at during the 2020–2021 upgrade works; prior to the upgrade, services ran at an alternating 20/40-minute frequency.

Smallbrook Junction station is only open on days when the Isle of Wight Steam Railway is operating; when open, the station is served by up to nine trains per day in each direction between 10:30 and 17:00.

==Passenger numbers==

After privatisation, passenger numbers rose steadily from an estimated 1.21million in 1997–1998 to an estimated 1.61million in 2006–2007.

After the merger of the Island Line and South West Trains franchises in 2007, Island Line passenger numbers fell slightly from an estimated 1.61million in 2006–2007 to an estimated 1.53million in 2009–2010. They peaked again at an estimated record 1.67million in 2011–2012, but since then fell to an estimated 1.31million in 2014–2015. This was the lowest annual estimate since 1998–1999, and suggests passenger numbers fell by 22% in four years.

==History==
=== Pre-grouping (1864–1923) ===
The line from to was opened on 23 August 1864, having been built by the Isle of Wight Railway. In 1866, the line was extended through to . The line was originally built as single track throughout, with passing loops provided at Brading, Sandown and Shanklin stations.

In 1880, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) opened a jointly-owned line north from Ryde St John&#x27;s Road. Under the direction of LBSCR Chief Engineer Frederick Banister, the building of the extension included a new tunnel and a third Ryde Pier to enable the line to reach , which provided a connection with the companies&#x27; ferry services. When the LBSC/LSWR joint line opened, it was as a double track section from Ryde St John&#x27;s Road station through to Ryde Pier Head. There was a scissors crossover situated on Ryde Pier to allow trains to access all platforms. Sets of crossovers were installed at St John&#x27;s Road to enable trains to change from the joint line&#x27;s left-hand running to the single-track sections on the Isle of Wight Central Railway&#x27;s Newport line and the Isle of Wight Railway&#x27;s Shanklin line (now known as the Island Line).

=== Southern Railway (1923–1948) ===
Following the Railways Act 1921, the Island Line and the other railways on the Isle of Wight became part of the Southern Railway. In 1926, crossovers and a signalbox were installed at Smallbrook Junction to extend double track operation from St John&#x27;s Road. However, the signalbox was used only in the summer when traffic levels were high. In winter, the two lines from Smallbrook to St. John&#x27;s Road reverted to independent single track operation.

In 1927, the passing loops at Brading and Sandown were connected to form a second section of double track.

===British Rail (1948–1996)===
In 1948, the Southern Railway was nationalised, as part of British Railways, later British Rail. The line from Shanklin to Ventnor closed in April 1966. Steam trains were withdrawn from Ryde Pier on 17 September, and the whole line on 31 December 1966. While the line was closed, the trackbed in Ryde Tunnel was raised to reduce flooding and decrease gradients, the rebuilding of Ryde Pier Head station was completed, and Ryde Esplanade station was also substantially modified. The line reopened in March 1967 following its electrification with a 660V DC third rail system. The rolling stock introduced to the line was former London Underground &#x27;Standard Stock&#x27;, which had been built between 1923 and 1934, and was designated as British Rail Classes 485 and 486. In the 1980s, British Rail was sectorised and the line became part of the Network SouthEast sector. Services on the line were branded as Ryde Rail.

British Rail opened two new stations on the line - Lake in 1987, and Smallbrook Junction in 1991, which links to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway.

The double track between Sandown and Brading, along with the Brading passing loop, were removed in 1988. In 1989, the passenger service was branded as Island Line for the first time, as the name and logo was included on the &quot;new&quot; Class 483 trains&#x27; livery. However, this rebranding did not officially occur until 1994. The Class 483s had been introduced in 1989, and, like their predecessors, were former London Underground stock, dating from 1938.

===Island Line franchise (1996–2007)===
Following the privatisation of British Rail, the rights to run services on the line were put out to tender as a franchise. Uniquely on the National Rail network, the franchise agreement also required the successful bidder to maintain the railway line in addition to the stations and trains. Stagecoach Group were announced as the winner of the franchise and from October 1996 they operated passenger services under the name Island Line Trains.

In 2002, a form of Automatic Train Protection was installed on the line. This involved the refitting of tripcocks on trains and the associated train stop trackside equipment at signals. This system is almost identical to the one originally fitted to the trains when in service on the London Underground, although it is in use only at signals protecting single-track sections of the route.

The Department for Transport designated the line as a community railway in March 2006, under reforms to help boost use of rural and branch lines in the UK rail network.

===South West Trains franchise (2007–2017)===
From February 2007, the Island Line franchise was merged with the South West Trains franchise on the mainland. Stagecoach was announced as the winner of the expanded franchise and operated Island Line as a South West Trains subsidiary. However, the Island Line name was retained, styled as &quot;Island Line Trains&quot;, and was promoted as a separate division on the South West Trains website.

Island Line Trains also repainted stations in a heritage scheme of cream and green, as part of a general station improvement package.

===South Western Railway franchise (since 2017)===
In August 2017, the franchise was taken over by South Western Railway who have maintained the Island Line brand.

=== 2020–2021 upgrade work ===
On 16 September 2019, it was confirmed that £26million would be invested in the Isle of Wight&#x27;s railways. This included the introduction of five Class 484 units built by Vivarail using D78 Stock bodyshells to replace the ageing Class 483 fleet, which had become unreliable to the point that services on the line had to be halved in frequency for around a month. As the new Class 484 trains would sit higher above rail level than the Class 483 they would replace, the track through most stations was expected to be lowered in order to prevent a large vertical difference between the train floor height and the platform height. At stations where this was not possible, platform height was instead due to be raised. The voltage on the third rail was to be raised to 750V DC.

The reinstatement of a long-removed passing loop at Brading was also planned in order to allow trains to run at even half-hourly intervals, with island-based stakeholders including the Isle of Wight Council and Solent Local Enterprise Partnership contributing £1million. The plan as suggested in 2007-8 envisaged the passing loop at Brading replacing that at Sandown, which would have been abandoned along with the remaining double track within Ryde. However, the Programme Manager from South Western Railway has publicly stated that the option of running a 20-minute service will remain after the upgrade which implies that the existing passing points would remain operable. A total of 7,000tonnes of spoil was expected to be removed during the work.

The original plan as announced in September 2019 was that most of the work on the track would take place over the winter of 2020–2021, with a &quot;shuttle&quot; train service planned during this period. Rail services were expected to be replaced by buses between and for 8 weeks in Autumn 2020 while the work was done, with a four-week suspension expected between St John&#x27;s Road and . However, delivery of the upgrade was delayed due to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic. In August 2020, it was announced that instead of two different closure periods, the line would close completely from 4 January until 31 March 2021 for physical upgrades including platform work and the Brading loop. Buses were to replace trains between and Shanklin during the work with a minibus shuttle service to connect Ryde Esplanade to Ryde Pier Head, although the latter was not operated while the catamaran ferry was suspended. The rolling stock was also delayed due to delays at the manufacturer, and the first of the Class 484 trains was delivered in November 2020. In February 2021, it was announced that progress on the upgrade work and on the new trains had been further delayed due to the pandemic, requiring the line to close for six weeks longer than originally announced, meaning trains were not expected to run again until May. Subsequently, problems with software on the new trains delayed their introduction until later in the year. In August 2021, flooding caused damage at 16 sites on Island Line, with 200tonnes of ballast from the mainland needed to carry out repairs. However good progress has been made with the testing of the trains and the infrastructure works are largely complete with only snagging items to deal with. The line reopened on 1 November 2021.

=== 2022–2023 upgrade work ===
Between October 2022 and June 2023, Ryde Pier Head was closed to facilitate a £17 million repair and upgrade to the pier, as it was coming towards the end of its operational life.

Ryde Esplanade is due to be rebuilt, to include a café, a link to Ryde Pier Head, a new waiting hall, a ticket office, an operations room and better staff accommodation. To begin works, the station was closed briefly in March 2023 and works are currently ongoing.

==Future==
A number of suggestions have been made for the future of the railway, which faces long-standing issues such as the cost of maintaining Ryde Pier. Proposals for the route have ranged from total closure something also explored in the 1960s to major rebuilding as light rail.

===Past proposals===
In the mid-1990s it was proposed to reopen the line south of Shanklin, to the original terminus at . Despite the high costs involved, the island&#x27;s MP in 2018 called for feasibility studies on this project and on the prospect of trains running between Ryde and Newport using a mix of the existing heritage railway and a rebuilt section of line between Wooton and Newport.

Other proposals put forward for the future of the railway line have included converting the line to a guided busway, something considered in 2005, and the late 2010s as part of a consultation on the line&#x27;s future. The first plan for a Solent tunnel to connect the island&#x27;s railways to the mainland network was authorised in the early 20th century and although work to build a rail tunnel has never started, this proposal has resurfaced several times in more recent history.

There have also been proposals to rebuild the line as a light rail route at several points, which would potentially allow for extension into Shanklin and other town centres, the most recent being after a 2016 review of the route by transport expert Christopher Garnett commissioned by the Isle of Wight Council. It suggested converting the route with the third rail replaced with overhead lines and the remaining double-track singled with just passing loops provided. It was reported that ten T-69 trams which were built in 1999, and had previously operated on the Midland Metro, could be re-used for this scheme. The Isle of Wight Council&#x27;s Local Transport Plan previously mentioned that any improvements to the railway should ensure compatibility with the currently shelved South Hampshire Rapid Transit scheme. None of these light rail ideas have been progressed.

&quot;The Railway Magazine&quot; reported that a meeting took place on 11 February 2015 which covered a relaxation of public railway regulation and safety standards as well as transferring the line to a Social Enterprise Company. According to &quot;RM&quot;, people present at the meeting included Claire Perry (Rail Minister), Andrew Turner (MP for the Isle of Wight), Nick Finney (Turner&#x27;s transport advisor) and local councillors. News of the meeting gave rise to local controversy.

===2020 Ideas Fund===
On 23 May 2020, the Department for Transport announced that approval had been given to investigate the possible reinstatement of some or all of the tracks between Shanklin and Ventnor and Ryde and Newport. It was one of ten schemes across UK approved for more study under an &quot;Ideas Fund&quot;. The feasibility studies into reopening the two rail routes began in January 2021.

In July 2021, an outline case was submitted by the Isle of Wight Council to the Department for Transport, seeking funding for a £67million project to study the feasibility of restoring the link between the existing Ryde to Shanklin line and the island&#x27;s main town, Newport, running via Blackwater. The trackbed of this line &quot;remains very largely intact&quot;, making it the most viable line. The line, closed in 1956, was once part of a 55-mile network stretching across the island. Newport station was demolished in 1971. If it is approved by the government through the Restoring Your Railway programme, the next stage would entail the authority preparing a more detailed business plan. In June 2022, the Department for Transport posted a Programme Update of the Restore Your Railway (RYR). The Island Line branch line is listed under &#x27;Schemes not progressing to delivery under RYR&#x27;. The Island Line proposal will be given detailed feedback including recommended next steps and alternative routes for consideration as appropriate.

==Rolling stock==
Due to the isolated and rural nature of the Isle of Wight&#x27;s railways, rolling stock has tended to be made up from displaced older vehicles, rebuilt or modified as required. Following the work undertaken during the line&#x27;s closure during the winter of 1966–1967, the ceiling of Ryde Tunnel is too low for standard National Rail vehicle types to clear.

Since the reopening of the line in 1967, former London Underground Tube stock has been used. The initial trains were formed of so-called Standard Stock, made up into four- and three-coach sets (with one spare vehicle, normally kept at Ryde depot), designated &quot;4-VEC&quot; and &quot;3-TIS&quot; in the British Rail Southern Region electric multiple unit classification system. (The classification letters were a pun on the Roman name for the island, &quot;Vectis&quot;) Under the British Railways TOPS rolling stock classification system, these units eventually became Class 485 and Class 486. The cars transferred to the island were built at various dates between 1923 and 1934, and thus maintained a somewhat unwelcome tradition of providing the island&#x27;s railways with among the oldest rolling stock running anywhere on the British railway system.

By 1992, the 485s and 486s had been replaced by newly refurbished London Underground 1938 Stock, designated Class 483 by British Rail. 

In September 2019, it was announced that the entire fleet of 483s would be replaced by Class 484 trains, based on London Underground D78 Stock, during 2020. The stock is maintained at Ryde St John&#x27;s Road depot. The Class 484s entered service in November 2021 after the ten-month works closure of the line, the elderly Class 483s having been withdrawn that January.

==Annual season tickets==
Annual season tickets issued to and from the Island Line&#x27;s stations are issued as Gold Cards. A ticket from Ryde Esplanade to Ryde St Johns Road was, for many years, the cheapest annual ticket in the area; even though many holders of such tickets never use them for the intended journey, the discount obtained over the year (one-third off travel during off-peak hours in the Gold Card area) may amply repay the cost of the ticket. 

When the Gold Card area was extended to include the West Midlands in January 2015, the Ryde ticket was undercut by a similar short-distance ticket between Lichfield City and Lichfield Trent Valley.

<text>The River Rother flows from Empshott in Hampshire, England, to Stopham in West Sussex, where it joins the River Arun. At long, most of the river lies within West Sussex except for the first which lie in Hampshire. The upper river, from its source to Midhurst, has been used to power watermills, with the earliest recorded use being in 1086, when the Domesday survey was conducted. Although none are still operational, many of the buildings which housed the mills still exist, and in some cases, still retain their milling machinery. This upper section is also noted for a number of early bridges, which have survived since their construction in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The lower river, from Midhurst to its junction with the River Arun, has been used for navigation. Boats used the section from the Arun to Fittleworth following improvements made to the Arun in 1615, and after the Arun Navigation was completed in 1790, the Earl of Egremont made the river navigable up to Midhurst by constructing eight locks and some small cuts. The work was completed in 1794, and many of the bridges built at that time still survive. With the opening of the Mid-Sussex Railway branch to Midhurst in 1859, traffic declined, and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s. Pleasure boats continued to be used on the river for many years, and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920. The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936, after an undergraduate pointed out that it was still a public right of way.

The river flows through the South Downs National Park, and is a designated Site of Nature Conservation Importance, in recognition of its value for wildlife. It supports a wide range of fish, and its upper reaches are the only location in Sussex where native white clawed crayfish can be found. The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four gauging stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that large volumes are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.

==History==

Following improvements to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, the construction of the Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an act of Parliament, the (31 Geo. 3. c. 66), which would enable him to improve the Rother. The act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.

The river&#x27;s lower section, below Midhurst, was made navigable by the construction of the &quot;Western Rother Navigation&quot; in 1794. The length of the navigation was of which less than consisted of new cuts, with the rest following the existing channel. It rose through from Stopham to Midhurst by a series of eight locks, and cost £13,300 to build. Traffic consisted of coal transported up-river, with cargoes of timber, corn and Petworth marble in the other direction. A branch connected it to Petworth by the short Petworth Canal, which was long with two locks, and terminated at Haslingbourne to the south of the town. It was opened in 1793, having cost the Earl £5,000 to build, but only lasted for a few years, until a turnpike road was diverted. This made access to Petworth easier, and the canal ceased to be used.

Unlike many canals, where navvies were brought into the neighbourhood to carry out the work, the earl employed local men on the project, most of them already employed by him, and a clergyman praised him for this when writing in 1808, as it led to much less disruption, but provided increased income for those who worked on the scheme. Wages rose from 8 or 9 shillings (40-45p) per week to 14 or 15 shillings (70-75p). During his life, the earl invested some £100,000 in waterways, some in his native county of Sussex, but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth. Between 1802 and 1831, the average income from the canal was around £550 per year. Competition arrived in 1859, when the Mid-Sussex Railway opened a line from Horsham through Pulborough to Petworth. Traffic declined, and by the 1880s, the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats, although it was not officially abandoned until 1936.

===Closure===
Despite the navigation being closed, a guide to Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called &quot;A New Oarsman&#x27;s Guide&quot;, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.

In 1887, part of the river bank near Todham Lock, which bordered the Cowdray estate of the Earl of Egmont, had collapsed, and the earl suggested that Lord Leconfield of Petworth, a successor to the Earl of Egremont, should pay for its repair. After some disagreement, a compromise was reached, under which the bank was repaired and a floodgate was fitted at the upper end of the lock, with both men paying half of the cost. Lord Leconfield assumed that when the Arun Navigation finally obtained an Act of Abandonment in 1896, his responsibilities for the maintenance of the River Rother had ended. However, in 1903 heavy rain and floods destroyed the floodgate and part of the adjacent weir, resulting in river levels though the 8th Earl of Egmont&#x27;s estate dropping by . The earl, Augustus Arthur Perceval, issued a writ against Lord Leconfield for damages. The case was heard in the High Court, at which it was agreed that the navigation was now useless, but that the two men would share the costs of rebuilding the floodgate, after which responsibility for its maintenance would pass to the earl, who could also dredge the river above the lock.

P. Bonthron, who published a book entitled &quot;My Holidays on Inland Waterways&quot; in 1916, described a journey down the river that he had made with friends in 1908, in a boat hired from William Port at Midhurst. They reached Arundel on the River Arun after two days, from where the boat was sent back to Midhurst by train. Another account of a similar journey made in 1914 by Eleanor Barnes and a friend appeared in &quot;As the Water Flows&quot;, first published in 1920, which described canoe journeys on the rivers of southern England made by her over a period of seven or eight years. The warrant of abandonment was obtained jointly by the estates at Petworth and Cowdray after an Oxford undergraduate called Roger Sellman pointed out that the river was still officially a right of way, and that anyone could therefore offer to pay the appropriate tolls to use a boat on it, and expect the owners to rebuild the locks. The powers of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 25) were invoked to declare that the navigation was no longer necessary, and despite objections from the River Arun Catchment Board and a canoe club, the warrant was granted on 15 April 1936. However, the Environment Agency noted in 2003 that although there used to be navigation rights on the river, &quot;the existing status of the navigation is unknown.&quot;

==Hydrology==

The river flows through the South Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and since 2011, a designated national park. There are two large aquifers in the area, one consisting of chalk, to the south of the river valley, and the other the Lower Greensand Group, underlying the whole of the river. The aquifers are separated by a Gault Formation, which consists of clay. At the western edge of the region, both the chalk and the gault turn to the north, creating a scarp slope. The base flow of the river consists of water from the Lower Greensand aquifer, and from springs along the bottom of the chalk scarp slope. These help to maintain the flows in the river during the summer months, although there have been significant periods where flows have been low, notably in the drought of the early 1990s, and again in 1995–96. These led to declines in the populations of the macro-invertebrates which are used to measure the health of a river, but these have subsequently recovered. In order to monitor the hydrology, the Environment Agency has a series of observation boreholes along the valley, and maintains gauging stations at Princes Marsh, close to the source, at Iping Mill, at Halfway Bridge on the River Lod just above its junction with the Rother, and at Hardham, just before the river joins the Arun.

Flows in the river are swelled by discharges from several sewage treatment works. The three largest are at Princes Marsh, Petersfield and Ambersham, all of which have outflows between per day, with another three discharging between per day at Rogate, Coultershaw and Fittleworth. The entire river, including parts of some of its tributaries, is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance by the local authorities through which it flows, in recognition of its value for wildlife. The upper reaches of the Rother are important for their fish populations of brown trout, grayling, juvenile sea trout, and the spawning and early development of salmonids. There are also populations of bullhead, eel, lamprey, minnow and stone loach. There has been some concern about declining fish stocks, thought to be partly caused by soil erosion, leading to silt and sediments being deposited on the river bed, which has been exacerbated by low flows in the river. Parts of the lower river support the same types of fish, but there are areas, particularly immediately upstream of weirs, where the major species are bream, pike and roach, with chubb, dace and perch on the lowest reaches. In order to assist the movement of fish along the river, particularly those that migrate to the headwaters to spawn, fish passes have been constructed around the gauging stations. The only known population of native white clawed crayfish in Sussex is located in the upper reaches of the Rother.

The quality of the water is generally good, helped by the fact that the groundwater in the chalk aquifer is of very high quality. However, some of the small streams in the upper reaches are polluted by discharges of effluent which are not licensed, and there are areas where the water in the aquifer, and hence the river, has raised levels of nitrates, largely caused by agricultural fertilisers. The Environment Agency has produced improvement plans to address a number of sources of both agricultural and urban pollution. Natural flows in the river are affected by the abstraction of water for the public water supply. There are many locations at which water is abstracted along the course of the river, including a site in the upper reaches where more than per day is abstracted from the aquifer, and another where the volume exceeds . Just above the junction with the River Arun, the Hardham Water Supply Works abstracts up to per day from the river.

==Etymology==
The river takes its name from Rotherbridge, not the other way round. Rotherbridge is derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Redrebruge&quot;, meaning cattle bridge, which was also the name of the Saxon Hundred or administrative group of parishes. Before this the river was known as the Scir.

==Route==
The route description has been split into two sections. From its source to Midhurst, the river has powered several mills, but has never been navigable. Below Midhurst, it was navigable until the navigation closed in the 1880s. There were eight locks on this section, some of which bypassed additional water mills.

===Source to Midhurst===
The River Rother rises from several springs near Empshott in Hampshire. The main one supplies watercress beds, before passing under Mill Lane, to the south of the village. It continues eastwards, to reach Greatham Mill. The mill, together with the mill house and an attached barn, which date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and are built of brick, are Grade II listed structures. All of the original machinery of the mill is still in situ, but is not operational, as the water supply has been diverted. The stream turns to the south-east, and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass, and Greatham Bridge, on the old route. It is joined by other streams, and turns south to reach Liss railway station. The railway and the river follow the same general route, and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet. At the northern edge of the village, the river is joined by the Ashford Stream, and there is another mill. After passing under the A272 road, to the east of the village, it reaches Sheet Mill.

Tillmore Brook joins from the west, and the course turns to the east. At Durleighmarsh, a hamlet which forms part of the civil parish of Rogate, it passes the ruins of Durford Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery situated on the north bank. It is a scheduled ancient monument, and the site includes a threshing barn with a water wheel and associated drive shafts. On the south bank is Durford Mill. This mill house is a grade II listed structure, and was built of clunch in 1770. The mill itself has been modernised and enlarged, and is not listed. A little further downstream, Harting Road crosses the river at Durford Bridge, build in the early 1600s with four semi-circular arches. It was restored in 1924. To the north of Habin, another hamlet in Rogate, North Lane crosses the river on Habin Bridge, which has four round-headed arches, and was probably built in the seventeenth century, but might be earlier. It is built of stone, and was restored in the eighteenth century.

To the north of Dumpford, a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst, is Terwick Mill. It is a grade II* listed structure, and consists of two mills, side by side. They were operational until 1966. The north mill is a timber-framed building, clad with weatherboarding, dating from the sixteenth century. The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750. Although it has been converted into a house, it still contains two iron waterwheels, one for each mill, and its machinery. The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635. The adjacent mill house, parts of which date from the eighteenth century, is also a listed building. The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton, and is crossed by Trotton Bridge, dating from the early 1600s, which has five ribbed arches. The river then turns to the east again at Chithurst, where Abbey House, an L-shaped timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, and the parish church, much of which dates from the eleventh century, are located on the north bank. An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river.
Continuing eastwards, the river is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping, a narrow stone bridge with five arches dating from the seventeenth century. To the west of the bridge is the site of Iping watermill. A mill was recorded there in the Domesday survey, completed in 1086. By 1665, there were the remains of a fulling mill at the site, and a wheat-mill and malt-mill, both part of the same building. It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century, and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930. At Stedham, part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping, Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone bridge with six segmental arches. Five of them date from the seventeenth century, with one later addition. The river then makes a large loop to the north, where Stedham Mill was situated. The mill building has been demolished, but the mill house is a listed structure. After the loop, Woolbeding Bridge, on the northern Edge of Midhurst, dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. It has four segmental arches, was restored in 1919, and is a grade II* listed structure.

After another loop to the north, the river passes between Easebourne to the north east and Midhurst to the south west. The bridge which carries the A272 road has two wide arches, and was of ashlar construction. Although this structure is still in situ, it is difficult to see, as a pedestrian bridge has been built on the north west side, attached to the original bridge by cantilevers, and one of the two arches was widened in 1912 by the addition of another arch outside it. Below the bridge is the mill house and adjoining water mill of North Mill. The mill carries the date 1840, and the house is of a similar age, although built in two stages. The river flows briefly to the south, passing Cowdray on the east bank, which is a scheduled ancient monument. It consists of a medieval fortified house, which is partly ruined, although some of it has been reused. It is situated within Cowdray Park, a grade II* listed landscaped park, which forms the grounds for Cowdray House, a nineteenth-century mansion some further east. On the opposite bank is a motte-and-bailey castle, dating from the twelfth century. Below this point, the river was navigable.

===Midhurst to mouth===
The terminus of the Rother Navigation was on a side stream, at the southern edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located to the north of the lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.
A widening in the modern river, close to the dismantled Midhurst branch of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, marks the site of Ladymead Lock, with a weir to the south and the lock structure to the north. The fourth lock was Coultershaw Lock. The river at this point runs to the south, and there was a large meander to the west with a weir at its head. The mill stream ran to the east, and the lock was built just to the west of the mill. Coultershaw Bridge now carries the A285 road over the mill stream, near which is Coultershaw Beam Pump; it was built in 1782 to provide a better water supply to Petworth House. The pump is powered by a water wheel, cast at Cocking Foundry, which is in diameter. There were two corn mills and a malt mill recorded on the site in 1534. The mill was modernised in 1910, when turbines replaced the wheels, and standby engines were installed in 1919. It was destroyed by fire in 1923, and a steel-framed concrete building replaced it. When it ceased to operate in 1972, the building was demolished, but the beam pump, which was located beneath the building, was rescued and has been restored. The pump no longer performs its original function, but supplies a fountain near the visitor centre.

Shopham Lock was another where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge at the tail of the lock is built from red and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the construction of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811 to 1812.

Near its junction with the River Arun, the river loops to the south in a large meander. A cut ran from the start of the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was.

==Conservation==
The &quot;Arun &amp; Rother Rivers Trust&quot; (ARRT) was set up in 2011 with the objective of enhancing and protecting the river and other connected waterways. It is a charity with further objectives concerning education, fisheries, biodiversity, access and pollution. The organisation is registered as a limited company, and was asked in 2012 to produce a Catchment Management plan by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It worked with the Arun and Rother Connections (ARC) Partnership and the South Downs National Park Authority to ensure that local opinion was adequately represented in the document.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Rother system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, some physical modification of the channel, the presence of North American signal crayfish, which are an invasive species, and runoff of chemicals as a result of agriculture and land management. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<doc id="460539" wikidata="Q29024968" url="?curid=460539" title="Bailiff of Guernsey">
<text>The title Bailiff of Guernsey has been used since at least the 13th century and indicated the leading citizen of Guernsey.

The 90th and current Bailiff is Sir Richard McMahon.

==History==

A &quot;Bailli&quot;, the early Norman name for Bailiff was the person who held and preserved the territory for the Duke of Normandy via the &quot; Sénéchale de Normandie&quot; and their &quot;Vicomté des Îles&quot;, upholding the laws of Normandy.

Significant change took place following the loss of Normandy in 1204 with King John appointing resident Wardens to defend the islands. John, as Count of Mortain, having himself been made a &quot;Warden of the Isles&quot; in 1198.

We find that during the 13th century the term &quot;Bailli&quot; had different meanings however by the 14th century the rights and duties had solidified and become a distinct office from the sub-warden, who became the military commander on the island. The first Bailiff of Guernsey was Hugh de Trubleville who served from 1270 to 1277.

The duty of the Bailiff was to preside over the Royal Court and direct the twelve Jurats who had the power to render judgement.

In 1617 a Privy Council decision clarified the division of civil and military responsibilities between the Bailiffs and the Lieutenant Governors in Guernsey and Jersey. For the first time the Crown laid down the Bailiff&#x27;s precedence over the Governor in judicial affairs and in the States chamber.

Until 1813 the position of Bailiff was virtually unpaid, changing when a petition by the then Bailiff, Peter de Havilland was accepted by the Prince Regent.

The Bailiff was required to reside in Guernsey and was appointed by either the King or the Warden of the Channel Islands or Guernsey although it was later normal for the Jurats to elect a Bailiff. The appointment is now made by the Sovereign by letters patent under the Great Seal, following recommendations.

The duties of the Bailiff were reduced in 2004 to avoid perceived conflicts of interest when acting in a political sense as head of the States of Deliberation with a casting vote in passing laws, followed by sitting in court and ruling on these same laws in a litigation or criminal case. The political duties have now been reduced. This has led to the island having two main citizens, the President of the Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey, also known as the “Chief Minister” being the figurehead of the States of Guernsey, the Bailiff remaining head of the Island as regards the law and civic matters.

==Qualifications, appointment and term of office==
From the start of the 19th century a Bailiff has always been a Guernsey qualified lawyer, which means qualifying in both English law and then obtaining a &quot;Certificat d’Etudes Juridiques Françaises et Normandes&quot; from Caen University before being invited to the Bar in Guernsey. More recently the proposed Bailiff now normally serves as H.M. Procureur and/or as Deputy Bailiff before assuming the duty of Bailiff.

The new Bailiff is robed and sworn into the office in front of the Jurats, the Members of the States of Guernsey and Advocates of the Royal Court. The oath is given in French with the oath giver undertaking to fulfil the office by maintaining the laws, liberties and customs of the island, advancing the Glory of God and honouring the Sovereign, as a true and loyal subject.

Since 1853 the Bailiffs’ dress is a silk lined robe of purple, trimmed with ermine. A velvet bonnet of traditional French design is the approved headgear.

The retirement age is set out in the letter of patent, normally the age of 65.

==Duties==

Current duties include:

* Legal
**Since 1950 the Bailiff is confirmed as the sole judge of law in the Royal Court, only having a vote in a case of indecision by the Jurats.
**On cases where fact is not an issue the Bailiff, or Deputy Bailiff may sit in sole judgement.
**&quot;Ex officio&quot; President and a Judge of the Guernsey Court of Appeal.
* Political 
**Presiding officer of the States of Deliberation, acting as moderator of debate.
* Communications link
** The Bailiff&#x27;s Chamber is the formal link between Guernsey and Governments of other countries, including formal and informal correspondence with the British Government.
* Civic Head
**The Bailiff is the civic head of the community and represents Guernsey on occasions of a non-political nature including representing the people on Royal visits.
* Deputy Lieutenant Governor
**Sworn in as the Deputy Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey, the Bailiff fulfils the function of Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey during absences.
* Patron of local charities
* May be appointed as a member of the Court of Appeal of Jersey

In the absence of the Bailiff, the Deputy Bailiff will normally fulfil most duties. The office of Deputy Bailiff was created in 1969.

A Judge of the Royal Court may preside over the Royal Court.

A senior Jurat may be appointed a Lieutenant Bailiff to preside over lesser Courts, such as the Contract Court and Liquor Licensing Extension Court. A professional lawyer may also be appointed as a Lieutenant Bailiff. A Lieutenant Bailiff may fulfil additional court duties in an emergency situation.

<doc id="460541" wikidata="Q1469840" url="?curid=460541" title="Malesia">
<text>Malesia is a biogeographical region straddling the Equator and the boundaries of the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. It is a phytogeographical floristic region in the Paleotropical kingdom. It was first recognized as a distinct region in 1857 by Heinrich Zollinger, a Swiss botanist and explorer. The precise boundaries used to define Malesia vary. The broadly defined area used in &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot; consists of the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea. The original definition by the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD) covered a similar area, but New Guinea and some offshore islands were split off as Papuasia in its 2001 version.

==Floristic region==

Malesia was first recognized as a distinct floristic region in 1857 by Heinrich Zollinger, a Swiss botanist and explorer. In 1948 and 1950, Cornelius G. G. J. van Steenis developed the idea of Malesia, and put forward plans for a &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot;. Van Steenis defined the area of Malesia through the concept of &#x27;demarcation knots&#x27;: lines across which there are major changes in the genera present in the flora. There were three clear boundaries: between the Malay Peninsula (including part of southern Thailand) and mainland Asia (line 1 in map 2); between the Philippines and Taiwan (line 2 in map 2); and along the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia (line 3 in map 2). The eastern boundary was less clear; van Steenis somewhat arbitrarily placed it between the Bismarck and Solomon Islands and the other Pacific islands (line 4 in map 2). Van Steenis initially used Zollinger&#x27;s name &#x27;Malesia&#x27;. He later anglicized it to &#x27;Malaysia&#x27;, but when the country of Malaysia was formed in 1963, it was necessary to return to the original name. The floristic region overlaps four distinct mammalian faunal regions.

The first edition of the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (WGSRPD) used the same definition, but in the second edition of 2001, New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago were removed from Malesia and united with the Solomon Islands, previously placed in the WGSRPD&#x27;s Southwestern Pacific region, and placed into a new region, Papuasia, whose eastern boundary extends to line 5 in map 2.

Using the &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot; definition, Malesia has a shared tropical flora derived mostly from Asia, but also with numerous elements of the Antarctic flora, including many species in the southern conifer families Podocarpaceae and Araucariaceae. Malesia is a hotspot of global biodiversity. In 1995, it was estimated that there were 42,000 species of vascular plants, of which 70% were endemic. By comparison, Europe, which is about three times the area, had 11,000 species of vascular plants, of which about 30% were endemic.

=== Western Malesia (Sundaland) ===

Western Malesia includes the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Borneo (area A in map 2). It shares the large mammal fauna of Asia and is known as Sundaland. These islands are on Asia&#x27;s relatively shallow continental shelf, and were linked to Asia during the ice ages, when sea levels were lower. The south-eastern edge of Sundaland (line 6 in map 2) is the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, the nineteenth-century British naturalist who noted the difference in fauna between islands on either side of the line.

Dipterocarps are predominant trees in the lowland forests of Sundaland. Sundaland has the greatest diversity of Dipterocarp species, with 10 to 14 native genera and approximately 450 native species, including approximately 267 species on Borneo, 155 on the Malay Peninsula, and 106 on Sumatra.

=== Central Malesia ===
The eastern boundary of central Malesia (area B in map 2) is formed by Lydekker&#x27;s Line (line 7 in map 2). Central Malesia can be divided into two subareas: the Philippines in the north and Wallacea in the south.

==== Philippines ====

The Philippines form the northern part of central Malesia. Most of the Philippines were never connected to the Asian mainland, and have a largely Asian-derived flora, and a distinct mammalian fauna.

The Philippines have approximately 50 species of Dipterocarps in 11 genera.

==== Wallacea ====

The islands between Sundaland and New Guinea, called Wallacea, form the southern part of central Malesia. They were never linked to the neighboring continents, and have a flora and fauna that include Indomalayan and Australasian elements.

Dipterocarps, which are dominant in Sundaland, are less common in Wallacea, with only 13 species in 4 genera.

=== Eastern Malesia ===
As defined in &quot;Flora Malesiana&quot;, Eastern Malesia consists of New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago (area C in map 2).
The eastern end of this definition of Malesia, which includes New Guinea and the Aru Islands of eastern Indonesia, is linked to Australia by a shallow continental shelf, and shares many marsupial mammal and bird taxa with Australia. New Guinea also has many additional elements of the Antarctic flora, including southern beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) and eucalypts. New Guinea has the highest mountains in Malesia and Papuasia, and vegetation ranges from tropical lowland forest to tundra.

In the second version of the WGSRPD, New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, together with the Solomon Islands, are placed in Papuasia (areas C and D in map 2) rather than Malesia.

== Assembly and origins of the Malesian flora ==
Major contributions to rainforest assembly have come from floristic elements which were carried on the Indian Plate and montane elements which have come from the Australian Plate (Sahul). The Sahul component is now understood to include substantial two-way exchanges with Sunda inclusive of lowland taxa. Evidence for the relative contributions of the great Asiatic floristic interchanges (GAFIs) with India and Sahul, respectively, to the flora of Malesia comes from contemporary lineage distributions, the fossil record, time-calibrated phylogenies, functional traits, and the spatial structure of genetic diversity. Functional trait and biome conservatism are noted features of montane austral lineages from Sahul (e.g., diverse Podocarpaceae), whereas the abundance and diversity of lowland lineages, including groups such as Syzygium (Myrtaceae) and the Asian dipterocarps (Dipterocarpoideae), reflect a less well understood combination of dispersal, ecology, and adaptive radiations. Thus, Malesian rainforest assembly has been shaped by sharply contrasting evolutionary origins and biogeographic histories.
