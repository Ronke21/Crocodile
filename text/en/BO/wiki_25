<text>Chesterfield Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system, after winning the 2023–24 National League title.

Chesterfield play their home games at the 10,500 capacity SMH Group Stadium, having moved from their historic home of Saltergate during the summer of 2010. Notable former players include record appearance holder Dave Blakey, who played in 617 of Chesterfield&#x27;s league games, and 162 league goal club record holder Ernie Moss. The club contests numerous local rivalries, most notably with Nottinghamshire club Mansfield Town. 

Chesterfield FC was officially established in 1867, though it would be the third incarnation of that name that turned professional in 1891 and changed its name to Chesterfield Town. Town entered the FA Cup for the first time the following year, and competed in the Sheffield &amp; District League and Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Senior Cup, before joining the Midland League in 1896–97. A third-place finish in 1898–99 resulted in a successful application to the Football League Second Division for the following season. After ten seasons in the Second Division they failed to gain re-election to the League and returned to the Midland League in 1909. They were champions of that league in 1909–10. The club entered liquidation in 1915, and were reformed as Chesterfield Municipal in April 1919. They again rejoined the Midland League and finished as champions in 1919–20.

The club was renamed Chesterfield in December 1920, and became founder members of the Third Division North in 1921–22. They marked their tenth season in the division, 1930–31, by winning the title, though they only managed two seasons in the Second Division before suffering relegation. They again won the Third Division North title in 1935–36, and after World War II recorded their best ever league finish of fourth in the Second Division in 1946–47. However they were relegated again in 1950–51, and were relegated out of the Third Division in 1960–61. Chesterfield won the Fourth Division in 1969–70, and then won the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1980. After relegation in 1982–83, they again won the Fourth Division title in 1984–85, though would again be relegated after five seasons in the third tier. They secured their return to the third tier with a 2–0 win over Bury in the 1995 play-off final at Wembley.

Chesterfield reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1997, but were relegated back to the basement division in 1999–2000. They made an immediate return to the third tier after securing a Third Division automatic promotion place in 2000–01. Relegated in 2006–07, they secured the League Two title in 2010–11, but were relegated from League One the following season. In 2011, Dave Allen took full ownership of the club and oversaw progress to two League Trophy finals; Chesterfield won the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Swindon Town in 2012, and finished as runners-up after losing 3–1 to Peterborough United in 2014. Chesterfield were crowned champions of League Two for a record fourth time in 2013–14, but remained in League One for just three seasons. Back-to-back relegations saw the club relegated out of the English Football League at the end of the 2017–18 season, before returning to League Two after winning the National League title in the 2023–24 season.

==History==

Potentially five or more teams have been called Chesterfield Football Club at different times. A &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot; newspaper report from 2 January 1864 noted a scheduled game between &quot;Chesterfield and Norton football clubs&quot;, suggesting that a Chesterfield FC, whether loosely or formally organised, was active from at least 1863.

A second Chesterfield FC was formally created as an offshoot of Chesterfield Cricket Club in October 1867.
The cricket and football clubs moved to the Recreation Ground at Saltergate in 1871, the same year that they became separate entities. However, a souring of the relationship between the two led to the closure of the football club in 1881, when it found itself homeless. Many players joined other local sides, notably Chesterfield Livingstone, a club that took up using the Saltergate site, and Chesterfield Spital, a team which competed in the early years of the FA Cup.

Three years later, in 1884, a third entity called Chesterfield Football Club was formed, again making its home at Saltergate. It drew in players from the preceding club and both Chesterfield Livingstone and Chesterfield Spital, though records show Spital continued as a separate club. After changing its name to Chesterfield Town, the club turned professional in 1891 and won several local trophies in the following two seasons, entering the FA Cup for the first time in 1892. For the 1892–93 season, the club wore an extraordinary playing strip of all dark blue with the Union Jack emblazoned across the front of the shirt. Chesterfield joined the Midland League in 1896, and successfully applied for a place in the Second Division of the Football League at the start of the 1899–1900 season, finishing seventh. After finishing bottom of the League for three consecutive seasons, the club failed to gain re-election to the League in 1909, returning to the Midland League.

In 1915 Chesterfield Town was put into voluntary liquidation and a new club with the same name was formed by a local restaurateur to play wartime football using locally based &quot;guests&quot; from Football League clubs. It lasted only two years before its management and players were suspended by the FA for illegal payments and the club shut down.

The current Chesterfield FC was formed on 24 April 1919 by Chesterfield Borough Council, seeing it as a way to spearhead improvements in local recreational provision. Initially called &quot;Chesterfield Municipal&quot;, the club made great strides on the pitch in its first season, lifting the Midland League title – and did so despite three changes of management. However, The Football Association and the Football League had already made clear their vehement opposition to a council-run club and ultimately forced it to cut its ties and become independent, reflected in a name change to Chesterfield FC in December 1920.

In 1921–22, Chesterfield became a founder member of the new Football League Third Division North. Following the arrival of new manager Ted Davison in 1926 and chairman Harold Shentall in 1928, the club won the Third Division North title in the 1930–31 season with an 8–1 victory over Gateshead on the final day, and were promoted to the Second Division. Relegation followed in 1933, but the Third Division North title was again won in 1936.

After the war the club achieved their best League position, finishing fourth in the Second Division in 1946–47. However, the sale of several players at the end of the season reduced their overall quality, and Chesterfield were relegated at the end of the 1950–51 season. They were placed in the Third Division on its formation at the start of the 1958–59 season; future England international goalkeeper Gordon Banks made his professional debut in a Third Division game in November 1958, but was sold to Leicester City for a then-club record £7,000 fee at the end of the season. In 1961 Chesterfield were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time.

Chesterfield spent eight seasons in the Fourth Division, earning promotion as champions in 1969–70 under manager Jimmy McGuigan. The Anglo-Scottish Cup was won in 1981. The club was relegated in 1983–84, and won the Fourth Division title the following season. Financial difficulties forced Chesterfield Borough Council to bail out the club in 1985 and the club&#x27;s training ground to be sold. Relegation followed in 1988–89; Chesterfield reached the play-off competition a year later, but were beaten by Cambridge United in the play-off final. The arrival of John Duncan as manager in 1993 was followed in the 1994–95 season by play-off victories over local rivals Mansfield Town and Bury to earn promotion to the redesignated Second Division. The 1996–97 season saw Chesterfield beat six clubs including Premier League side Nottingham Forest to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup for the first time. The semi-final match against Middlesbrough was contentiously drawn 3–3 after extra time; Chesterfield lost the replay 3–0.

The club were relegated to the Third Division in 2000 following a run of 21 games without a win, and chairman Norton Lea was replaced by Darren Brown. The following year, Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities after Brown attempted to avoid paying Chester City the fee agreed by the FA for Luke Beckett. Amid mounting evidence of fraud, he relinquished control of the club in March 2001 and ownership passed to a hastily organised fans&#x27; group, the Chesterfield Football Supporters Society. Massive debts run up by Brown forced the club into administration, but the team still secured the division&#x27;s final automatic promotion place. Brown was later sentenced to four years in prison following a Serious Fraud Office investigation that led to charges including false accounting, furnishing false information and theft.

Chesterfield were relegated to League Two at the end of the 2006–07 season, although they did reach the regional semi-final of the League Trophy and the fourth round of the League Cup in the same year. The club departed its historic home at Saltergate at the end of the 2009–10 season, and moved to newly built B2net Stadium. Chesterfield were promoted to League One after winning the League Two title in 2010–11 season. Later that year, Dave Allen took a majority shareholding of the football club from the Supporters Society. They went on to win the Football League Trophy for the first time in March 2012, defeating Swindon Town 2–0 in the final. However, they were relegated from League One the following month, with Allen taking over as chairman from Barrie Hubbard in the off-season. The club again returned to the third tier as League Two champions at the end of the 2013–14 season for a record fourth time under the guidance of manager Paul Cook.

Chesterfield secured sixth-place in League One at the end of the 2014–15 campaign, and went on to lose 4–0 on aggregate to Preston North End in the two-legged play-off semi-final. Cook departed at the end of the season. On 14 November 2016, Dave Allen resigned from his roles as chairman and director of the club. This signaled a crisis, and four days later a further four directors resigned from their roles. It was announced that Chesterfield was openly up for sale, and desperately needed some kind of investment in order to avoid administration. Mike Warner was installed as chairman on 19 November.

Chesterfield were relegated from League One in 2016–17, finishing bottom of the league. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Chesterfield suffered a second consecutive relegation, with the club playing outside the Football League for the first time since 1921. On 6 August 2020, it was announced that Chesterfield FC Community Trust, a charity associated with the club, had bought the club from previous owner Dave Allen. The following day, the Trust announced that John Pemberton had been appointed full-time manager, following a spell as caretaker manager from January 2020, during which time he was able to prevent the club&#x27;s relegation to National League North. 

In January 2022, the club faced Chelsea in the third round of the FA Cup, losing 5–1 to the Premier League side. After relegation from the Football League, Chesterfield had three unsuccessful play-off attempts, including losing the 2023 National League play-off final on penalties to Notts County. The club then won the National League title in the following season to return to the Football League after six seasons in non-League. During this season, the ownership of the club was transferred to brothers Phil and Ashley Kirk by the Community Trust.

==Stadium==
Chesterfield&#x27;s historic ground was Saltergate, officially named the Recreation Ground, which was in use from 1872 to 2010. Saltergate&#x27;s record attendance was 30,561, which was set when Chesterfield hosted Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup fifth round in February 1938.

Since the 2010–11 season, Chesterfield have played their home games at the £13 million B2net Stadium. The first match was against Derby County in a pre-season friendly, which Derby won 5–4, Craig Davies becoming the first goalscorer at the stadium. The first competitive fixture was against Barnet, which ended in a 2–1 win after Dwayne Mattis scored the opening League goal at the ground in the first half. Chesterfield suffered their first home league defeat at the B2net Stadium after a 2–1 loss to Burton Albion on 13 November 2010. 

On 13 August 2012, it was announced that, after the acquisition of b2net by Proact, the stadium would be renamed the Proact Stadium. On 15 May 2020, it was announced that, from August, the stadium would be renamed again, this time to the Technique Stadium, after local education provider Technique acquired the naming rights. In 2023 the stadium was renamed for the new sponsors, financial services company SMH group, for a minimum of three years. The highest attendance at the SMH group stadium was 10,108 at home in their last match of the 2023–24 National League season against Maidenhead United which Chesterfield won 3–2.

==Rivalries==
Chesterfield&#x27;s geographical position means that the club holds many local derbies. Their main rival is considered to be the Nottinghamshire club Mansfield Town, with the club contending a number of fiery encounters. This was intensified due to the Miners&#x27; Strike, with those in Derbyshire largely striking, while those in Nottinghamshire did not, leading to the latter being referred to as &#x27;scabs&#x27;. The last fixture between the sides finished in a 1–0 win for Mansfield at the Proact Stadium in April 2018. Chesterfield also have rivalries with nearby South Yorkshire clubs Rotherham United, Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United. The rivalries with Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday both came to the fore with the two playing in League One at periods in the 2010s. The Spireites have encountered United much more in recent years, continuing to meet in the third level of English football until 2017.

A slight rivalry with Grimsby Town intensified with a number of feisty encounters over the years.

<text>Colchester United Football Club is a professional association football club based in the city of Colchester, Essex, England. The team competes in , the fourth level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1937, the club spent its early years playing in the Southern Football League until they were elected to the Football League in 1950. Between 1950 and 1990, Colchester spent their time between the Third Division and Fourth Division, during which time they produced one of their most memorable results, a 3–2 victory in the fifth round of the FA Cup over Don Revie&#x27;s Leeds United in 1971.

Colchester United were relegated to the Football Conference in 1990 following a decline in the late 1980s, but won the Conference title in 1992 to make a swift return to League football. They achieved promotion to the Second Division in 1998 following a 1–0 win against Torquay United in the play-off final. The club were again promoted in 2006, achieving second place in League One. The following season, they achieved their highest league finish in club history, ending the season 10th in the Championship ahead of East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, Norwich City and also Essex rivals Southend United, despite having the division&#x27;s lowest attendance. The club returned to League One in 2008 following relegation from the Championship and then made a return to the fourth tier for the first time in 18 years in 2016.

Colchester United play their home games at Colchester Community Stadium in Colchester. They relocated to the stadium in 2008 when they moved away from Layer Road, their home stadium for 71 years.

==History==
Until 1937, Colchester Town were Colchester&#x27;s main club and were the original tenants of Layer Road. Colchester Town joined the Eastern Counties League in 1935, but their poor performances in the league convinced supporters that the club should turn professional, much like nearby Ipswich Town. With club officials against the idea of turning professional, a new professional club was formed in March 1937, Colchester United, which would also play at Layer Road. United joined the Southern Football League as crowds for Town matches dwindled. In December 1937, Colchester United formed a reserve team, signing many of Town&#x27;s players. As a result of this and Town struggling with £300 debts, Colchester Town folded the same month.

The club were Southern League champions in 1939 prior to the Second World War. Following the war, in 1947–48, the U&#x27;s produced one of the most notable FA Cup runs by a non-league side, defeating fellow non-leaguers Banbury Spencer in the first round, before beating Football League clubs Wrexham, Huddersfield Town and Bradford Park Avenue. They finally fell to Blackpool in the fifth round. This set them in good stead for potential election to the Football League.

Colchester United were elected to the Football League in 1950 on the back of their second Southern League Cup win and ending the 1949–50 season second to Merthyr Tydfil on goal average alone. They spent eleven years in the Third Division South and Third Division following the league&#x27;s reorganisation, with a best finish of third place in 1957, just one point behind rivals Ipswich Town and Torquay United.

The club suffered their first relegation in 1961 as they finished 23rd in the Third Division, but didn&#x27;t have to wait long until their first Football League promotion, spending just one season in the Fourth Division as they ended the season second to Millwall by just one point. This trend continued over the next two decades as they were relegated to the Fourth Division in 1965 and promoted to the Third Division in 1966, then relegated in 1968 and promoted in 1974, relegated in 1976 and promoted in 1977 before a final relegation to the Fourth Division in 1981.

During this time, the club embarked on one of the most notable runs in FA Cup history, as manager Dick Graham took his ageing side to the 1970–71 quarter-finals, dispatching non-league Ringmer, Cambridge United, Barnet and Rochdale following a replay. With the draw having been made prior to the replay against Rochdale, the U&#x27;s knew they would face a home tie with First Division Leeds United, and duly trounced Dale 5–0. In the match with Leeds, the U&#x27;s raced to an unprecedented 3–0 lead in front of a 16,000 Layer Road crowd, with two goals from Ray Crawford and one from Dave Simmons. Leeds did grab two goals back but Colchester held on for a famous 3–2 victory. The club faced Everton in the quarter-finals but succumbed to a 5–0 defeat in front of 53,028 at Goodison Park.

Financial difficulties and a number of changes at board level in the mid-1980s caused a slide towards the lower end of the Fourth Division table and crowd numbers to dwindle. Despite a brief turn around in form under former Rangers manager Jock Wallace, United were relegated from the Football League for the first time since their election.

Despite their relegation, the U&#x27;s remained a full-time club while playing in the Football Conference, as they sold their Layer Road ground to the Colchester Borough Council to clear the club&#x27;s debts. The club finished the season as runners-up to Barnet during their first season outside of the Football League, but, under the stewardship of player-manager Roy McDonough, the U&#x27;s won the league the following season on goal difference over bitter rivals Wycombe Wanderers. In addition to earning a swift return to League football, the club also won the FA Trophy in 1992.

The club had a successful 1995–96 season as they reached the 1995–96 Football League play-offs, but were defeated by Plymouth Argyle at the semi-final stage. The club narrowly missed the play-offs in 1996–97 but did however reach the Football League Trophy Final held at Wembley. The U&#x27;s drew 0–0 with Carlisle United but were defeated 4–3 on penalties. The following season however, Colchester were promoted via the Third Division play-off final with a 1–0 Wembley win against Torquay United.

Colchester consolidated their position in the third tier of English football for a number of seasons, before achieving their then-highest league finish of second place only to Essex rivals Southend United in the 2005–06 season. Under Phil Parkinson&#x27;s stewardship, the U&#x27;s were promoted to the second tier for the first time in their history. However, when Parkinson left to take the reins at Hull City, his assistant Geraint Williams was handed the daunting task of guiding Colchester into their first season in the Championship. He led the side to a 10th position finish, above East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, Norwich City and Essex rivals Southend United, while gaining the Pride of Anglia title in the process for the first time in their history. The momentum however did not continue into their second season in the Championship, as they finished bottom of the league and were relegated back to League One.

During the club&#x27;s second season in the Championship, Layer Road hosted its final game on 26 April 2008 as the U&#x27;s fell to a 1–0 defeat to Stoke City. The club then moved to their new ground, the Colchester Community Stadium, in the summer of 2008 in preparation for life back in the third tier. Despite hoping to make an immediate return to the Championship, the club made a dreadful start to the 2008–09 campaign, which saw manager Geraint Williams lose his job, leaving the club second from bottom. He was replaced by former Wycombe Wanderers manager Paul Lambert as he guided the club to a mid-table finish.

Colchester United started the 2009–10 season by thrashing recently relegated Norwich City 7–1 on the opening day of the season at Carrow Road. Manager Lambert then defected to Norwich when their manager Bryan Gunn was sacked following a poor start to the season. This ensured a fiery return fixture, held at the Community Stadium in January 2010. The game saw a record crowd of 10,064 watch as the U&#x27;s fell to a 5–0 defeat, with Ian Henderson being sent off on his United debut against his former club. The season ended with Colchester finishing in 8th position. The club finished in 10th position for both the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons, before narrowly avoiding relegation to League Two in the 2012–13 season, defeating Carlisle United 2–0 on the final day of the season to ensure their safety. The club then finished the 2013–14 season in 16th position.

Colchester secured League One safety on the final day of the 2014–15 season when they beat promotion hopefuls Preston North End 1–0 on 3 May 2015. However, Colchester could not stave off relegation to League Two in the 2015–16 season as they finished the campaign in 23rd position, confining them to the fourth tier of English football for the first time in 18 years.

In the 2019–20 EFL Cup, Colchester defeated Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur on penalties. Colchester were eventually eliminated by Manchester United in the quarter-finals, losing 3–0 at Old Trafford.

==Colours and crest==
When the club was formed, Colchester United continued in the tradition of their predecessors Colchester Town and played in blue and white striped shirts combined with white shorts. For the majority of the club&#x27;s history, the kit has remained true to the traditional design, with slight variations occurring in 1967 and 1968, when candy stripes were preferred, with white on blue used for 1967–68 and blue on white for 1968–69. The stripes were removed altogether between 1969 and 1973, with blue shirts and blue shorts adopted between 1969 and 1972 as modelled by Chelsea, and white shirts for 1972–73 during a failed relaunch. The original stripes were reinstated for the following campaign, and remained largely unchanged since this period. The club briefly used blue kits with white pinstripes between 1982 and 1986, and a crosshatch design between 1988 and 1990.

The club adopted the coat of arms of Colchester for their club crest upon their formation in June 1937. The coat of arms, which features the living cross of St Helena and the crowns of the Three Kings, was used until 1972, when a dispute between the club and Colchester Borough Council pushed United to design a new crest. Tied to the rebranding of the club and the new all-white kit, the U&#x27;s earned a new nickname (The Eagles) with a new badge featuring a Roman eagle standard. Following a disastrous season where the club were obliged to seek re-election, the kits were reverted and the club played with no crest on the shirts until 1979. Adidas replaced Umbro as kit manufacturer and the shirts were adorned with a simple &quot;CUFC&quot; cypher. The club emblem was modified to a circular badge in 1983 based on the 1972 design and was once again adjusted in 1986, updating the image of the eagle. In 1994, the crest was modified from a circular shape to a shield shape, with the golden eagle set against a blue and white striped background, a nod to the club&#x27;s traditional shirt colours. A slightly updated version was introduced in 2004 which rounded the shield, a design which has since remained unchanged.

A number of different manufacturers have provided the kits for Colchester United since the mid-1970s, with kits supplied by Umbro (1975–1979), Adidas (1979–1982), Le Coq Sportif (1982–1986), Olympic (1987–1988), Spall (1988–1990, 1993–1995), Ribero (1991–1993), Vandanel (1995–1997), Patrick (1997–2000), Strike Force (2000–2004), Admiral (2004–2006), Diadora (2006–2008), Puma (2008–2016) and Macron (2016–present).

Since the 1980–81, the club has offered sponsorship for its shirts, and offered away strip sponsorship from the 1999–2000 season. Primary shirt sponsorships have included Royal London Group (1980–1986), 0800 Linkline (1986–1987), Norcross Estates (1987–1990), Holimarine (1990–1991), Colchester Hippodrome (1991–1992), The Sun (1992, 1992–1993), Strovers (1993–1994), SGR Colchester (1994–1996), Goldstar Fabrications (1996–1997), Guardian Direct (1997–1999), East Anglian Daily Times (1999–2000), JobServe (2000–2002, 2018–2019), Tiptree Jams (2002–2004), ICS Triplex (2004–2005), Easy-Skip (2005–2006), MutualPoints.com (2006–2007), Haart (2007–2008), Weston Homes (2008–2010, 2013–2018), ROL Cruise (2010–2012), TEXO Scaffolding (2019–2022), Workhorse Group (2022-2024) and HotLizard Ltd (2024-Present). Away shirt sponsorship has been provided by Ashby&#x27;s (1999–2000), Ridley&#x27;s (2000–2002), 188Trades.com (2005–2006), Smart Energy (2006–2009), JobServe (2009–2010, 2012–2020), Strikerz Inc. (2020–2021), Workhorse Group (2021-2024) and HotLizard Ltd (2024-Present).

For the 2012–13 season, the U&#x27;s marked their 75th anniversary with a special kit. The shirt was coloured in the traditional blue and white stripes, however, the kit did not carry a main sponsorship logo, as the club looked to promote local businesses on a game-by-game basis and to reflect on the club&#x27;s early days without sponsorship.

==Stadium==

===Layer Road===
Colchester&#x27;s Layer Road stadium was built in 1910 and was home to United&#x27;s predecessors Colchester Town. The U&#x27;s shared the facilities with Town, as Colchester United&#x27;s first ever game at the ground came on 2 September 1937, a 6–1 win against Bath City. Gale-force winds almost destroyed the Layer Road End of the ground in January 1938. This was followed by the outbreak of World War II, and Layer Road was closed down by the club and passed over to Colchester Garrison. After the war, the club returned to the ground, as the Main Stand was extended for the 1946–47 season. Soon after, the Popular Side stand was demolished and the timber re-used to improve the Layer Road End.

The ground hosted the record home crowd for a Colchester United game on 27 November 1948 for an FA Cup first round tie with Reading. 19,072 fans gathered for the game which lasted just 35 minutes. The game was abandoned due to thick fog. More storm damage meant that the U&#x27;s went into the 1949–50 season with no roof to the Layer Road End due to a steel shortage.

During Colchester&#x27;s first season in the Football League, Layer Road hosted an average crowd of 10,573. This was to be the only time the club hosted a five-figure average at the ground. It wasn&#x27;t until 1959 that the stadium had floodlights installed, with proceeds from an FA Cup game against Arsenal funding the installation. In 1971, the ground was purchased from Colchester Borough Council with a series of covenants placed on the ground, including the clause that the ground could not be sold for development into housing. In 1980, the club&#x27;s chairman Maurice Cadman announced that Layer Road was in need of £280,000 of basic safety improvement to meet legislation. Plans were drawn up to remove the Open End altogether and construct a 5,000 capacity stand at the Layer Road End and a new main stand on the Popular side. The plans never came to fruition, as further plans for a new stadium were rejected by the council on the basis of the covenant. Following the Bradford City stadium fire and the Heysel Stadium disaster, Layer Road faced £500,000 worth of safety improvements. With the club struggling financially, sections of the ground were closed off, reducing capacity to 4,900.

Layer Road was sold back to Colchester Borough Council in the early 1990s for £1.2 million to help clear the club&#x27;s debts, as Colchester United leased the stadium back. The council then started to identify and investigate potential sites for a new stadium. In the meantime, the club refreshed the stadium ahead of the 1996–97 season with the Clock End all-seated and covered. With the lease due to expire in 2002, Kirklees McAlpine were commissioned as consultants for a new stadium in 1998. A preferred site at Cuckoo Farm in Colchester was identified, with the additional benefit being that the land was already Council-owned.

Plans for a new stadium were submitted in April 1999, with planning consent approved in 2003. The Council backed the £14.23 million project by taking out a £10.23 million loan in November 2006, with the remaining £4 million supplied in the form of grants from the Football Foundation and local government and development agencies. Scottish firm Barr Construction were announced as contractors for the stadium, with work beginning in July 2007.

===Colchester Community Stadium===

With building work neared completion, Colchester United announced the official name for the stadium would be the Colchester Community Stadium, but owing to a deal with building firm Weston Homes, the ground would initially be known as the Weston Homes Community Stadium. The ten-year sponsorship would be worth up to £2 million for the club and included shirt sponsorship for the 2008–09 season. Upon the expiry of the deal, JobServe won the naming rights for the stadium in a further ten-year sponsorship ahead of the 2018–19 season.

The club played their final match at Layer Road in front of 6,300 on 26 April 2008 as they fell to a 1–0 defeat to Stoke City.

Colchester United hosted the opening ramp-up event to Spanish club Athletic Bilbao on 4 August 2008. The first goal scored at the stadium came from Aritz Aduriz for Bilbao after 15 minutes, with Scott Vernon equalising with a penalty kick on 32 minutes. The game ended 2–1 to ten-man Bilbao with David López Moreno scoring a penalty on 83 minutes. The first competitive fixture at the Community Stadium came on 16 August 2008 when Colchester hosted Huddersfield Town in front of a crowd of 5,340. Mark Yeates scored the first competitive goal at the stadium in a 2–2 draw with Oldham Athletic on 30 August 2008 and registered their first win on 25 October 2008, winning emphatically against Carlisle United. They scored five goals from David Perkins, Dean Hammond, Akanni-Sunday Wasiu and two netted by Mark Yeates.

Colchester Community Stadium has a capacity of 10,105 and the record attendance at the ground was 10,064 when Colchester hosted Norwich City on 16 January 2010 as they fell to a 5–0 defeat.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Colchester United has an official supporters association known as the CUSA. They were formed in 1995 and is run entirely by fans on a volunteer basis. The club produces its own match day programme, titled &quot;We Are United&quot;, which replaced the former untitled official programmes from the beginning of the 2012–13 season. The club have also had a number of fanzine publications produced over the years, including &quot;The U&#x27;sual&quot;, &quot;Floodlight&quot;, &quot;Out of The Blue&quot; and &quot;The Blue Eagle&quot;. The club mascot is an eagle named &quot;Eddie the Eagle&quot;.

The 2003 Football Fans Census revealed that Colchester United fans considered Wycombe Wanderers to be their primary rival, with both Wycombe and Southend United considering the U&#x27;s to be their primary rival. Colchester fans considered Ipswich Town to be their secondary rivals, with Southend only third. Cambridge United additionally considered Colchester to be their tertiary rivals. However, in the 2012–13 census, Colchester fans changed their chief rivals from Wycombe to Southend, with Wycombe falling to second and Ipswich to third. Ipswich Town fans also named Colchester United as their third rivals after Norwich City and West Ham United. The U&#x27;s remained primary choice for both Southend and Wycombe fans. United were also ranked as the 12th least offensive club to the supporters of all other Football League clubs.

Colchester&#x27;s main recent rivalry is with fellow Essex side Southend United, with whom they contest the Essex derby. The competitive head-to-head record is 34 wins to Southend, 30 wins for Colchester and 17 draws. The most recent result was a 2–0 win for the U&#x27;s on 20 April 2021.

The club also contest the Pride of Anglia award, which they have won once when they finished in 10th position in the Championship ahead of East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town and Norwich City.

==Records and statistics==
Micky Cook is the current Colchester United record holder for most appearances, holding the record for appearances made in both the league at 613, and in all competitions with 700 between 1969 and 1984. Mike Walker ranks in second with 524 appearances in all competitions, and Tony English third with 515. Tony Adcock holds the record for most goals in all competitions with 149, but Martyn King is the club&#x27;s record league goalscorer with 132 goals.

Colchester United&#x27;s widest margin victory in the league was a 9–1 win over Bradford City on 30 December 1961 at Layer Road. Their highest losing margin came on 15 December 1988 when they were thrashed 8–0 at Leyton Orient.

The club&#x27;s record home attendance was for an FA Cup first round tie at Layer Road with Reading on 27 November 1948, when 19,072 fans turned up for a game that was abandoned after 35 minutes due to thick fog. The record Colchester Community Stadium attendance was 10,064 when Norwich City won 5–0 in a fiery match on 16 January 2010.

The highest transfer fee received for a Colchester United player is £2,500,000 for Greg Halford by Reading in January 2007. The highest fee paid by Colchester United for a player was £400,000 for Cheltenham Town striker Steven Gillespie in the summer of 2008.

At the end of the 2006–07 season, Colchester United created a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, with inducted players being one of &quot;those who have made a difference to the club&#x27;s history&quot;. Fans chose two inaugural players; Peter Wright and record appearance holder Micky Cook. Wright had previously been named as Colchester United&#x27;s &quot;Player of the Century&quot; by Colchester&#x27;s Gazette newspaper in 2000. A committee decided on a further three players to join the Hall of Fame in the same season, with Brian Hall, Mark Kinsella and Tony English chosen. New inductees have been announced most seasons since 2007, with the entire team that famously defeated Leeds United in the FA Cup in 1971 entered into the Hall of Fame.

<text>Grimsby Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, England, that competes in , the fourth level of the English football league system.

Nicknamed &quot;the Mariners&quot;, the club was founded as Grimsby Pelham Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Grimsby Town a year later, and moved to its current stadium, Blundell Park, in 1898. Grimsby Town is the most successful team of the three professional clubs in historic Lincolnshire, being the only one to play top-flight English football. It is also the only club of the three to reach an FA Cup semi-final (doing so on two occasions, both times during the 1930s). It has also spent more time in the English game&#x27;s first and second tiers than any other club from Lincolnshire. Notable former managers include Bill Shankly, who went on to guide Liverpool to three League titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup triumph, and Lawrie McMenemy who, after securing promotion to the then Third Division in 1972, moved to Southampton where he won the FA Cup in 1976. Alan Buckley is the club&#x27;s most successful manager; he had three spells between 1988 and 2008, guiding the club to three promotions and two appearances at Wembley Stadium during the 1997–98 season, winning both the Football League Trophy and the Football League Second Division play-off Final. In 2008, Buckley took Grimsby to the capital again, but lost out to MK Dons in the final of the Football League Trophy. The Mariners had also reached the Football League Two play-off Final in 2006 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but lost the match 1–0 to Cheltenham Town. Later trips to Wembley in 2013 and 2016 saw them defeated in the FA Trophy final by Wrexham and FC Halifax Town respectively, having also lost at the venue in the 2015 National League play-off final to Bristol Rovers before finally gaining promotion by winning the 2016 final against Forest Green Rovers. Grimsby were again relegated out of the Football League in 2021, but secured an immediate promotion at the first attempt with victory over Solihull Moors in the 2022 National League play-off final at the London Stadium. In 2022–23, Grimsby Town became the first team in FA Cup history to beat five teams from higher divisions following a 2–1 win at Premier League side Southampton to advance to the quarter-finals, before eventually losing to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Grimsby Town&#x27;s relegation in 2010 made them the sixth club to compete in all top five divisions of English football (after Wimbledon, Wigan Athletic, Carlisle United, Oxford United and Luton Town, and before Leyton Orient, Notts County and Oldham Athletic). Grimsby&#x27;s 1939 FA Cup semi-final attendance of 76,962 versus Wolverhampton Wanderers is still a record at Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford stadium. In 1954 they became the first English club to appoint a foreign manager, Hungarian Elemér Berkessy. The club&#x27;s record appearance holder is John McDermott, who made 754 appearances between 1987 and 2007, while their leading scorer is Pat Glover, with 180 goals (1930–39).

==History==

===Early years (1878–1918)===

Grimsby Town was formed in 1878 after a meeting held at the Wellington Arms public house in Freeman Street, Grimsby. Several attendees included members of the local Worsley Cricket Club who wanted to form a football club to occupy the empty winter evenings after the cricket season had finished.

The club was originally called Grimsby Pelham, this being the family name of the Earl of Yarborough, a significant landowner in the area. In 1880 the club purchased land at Clee Park which was to become their ground until 1889 when they relocated to Abbey Park, before moving again in 1899 to their present home, Blundell Park. The original colours were blue and white hoops, which were changed to chocolate brown and blue quartered shirts in 1884.

In 1888 the club first played league football, joining the newly formed &#x27;Combination&#x27;. The league soon collapsed and the following year the club applied to join the Football League, an application that was refused. Instead the club joined the Football Alliance. In 1890 the club became a limited company and in 1892 finally entered the Football League, when it was expanded to two divisions. The first game was a 2–1 victory over Northwich Victoria.
The 1901–02 season saw promotion to the First Division, having finished as champions; two seasons later they were relegated and within a decade they would be a non-League side again, failing re-election in 1910 and falling to the Midland League. However, they finished as champions at the first attempt and at the subsequent re-election vote, replaced local rivals Lincoln City in the Football League.

Grimsby Town and Hull City were the only two professional teams which had official permission to play league football on Christmas Day because of the demands of the fish trade, but that tradition has now disappeared following the dramatic reduction of their trawler fleets in recent years.

===Inter-War years (1918–1945)===
This was the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history. The first full season after World War I the club were relegated to the new Third Division; in the initial 1920–21 season they played against the former members of the Southern League who had been invited to form the new division, but after a year an equivalent Third Division North was created and Grimsby moved across to that. By 1929 they were back in Division One, where they stayed (with a brief break from 1932 to 1934) until 1939, obtaining their highest-ever league position, 5th in Division One, in the 1934–35 season. In 1925 they adopted the black and white stripes as their colours.

Three Grimsby Town players, forward Jackie Bestall, goalkeeper George Tweedy and defender Harry Betmead each received a solitary England cap during the period 1935–1937. They remain the only players from the club to have received full England honours.

Grimsby reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1936, the game was played at Huddersfield Town&#x27;s Leeds Road, but lost 1–0 to Arsenal, with the goal coming from Cliff Bastin five minutes before half time.

On 20 February 1937, the club&#x27;s record attendance of 31,651 was recorded when the club met Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup.

Grimsby also reached the semi-final of the FA Cup on 25 March 1939, Grimsby played Wolverhampton Wanderers, in a FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford. The attendance of 76,962 remains Old Trafford&#x27;s largest ever attendance. The Mariners lost the game 5–0 after goalkeeper George Moulson was injured early in the match. With the rules forbidding substitutes for injuries, Grimsby had to play with 10 men and an outfield player in goal.

===Post-war decline (1946–1970)===

With the resumption of the Football League for the 1946–47 season after World War II the club was relegated at the end of the 1947–48 season and has never returned to the highest level. Much of the 1950s and 1960s were spent alternating between the Second Division and the Third Division North, later the Third Division. From July 1951 to January 1953 they were managed by Bill Shankly. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. Shankly believed he still had good players to work with and was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.

Grimsby made a strong challenge for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South).

Grimsby&#x27;s aging team made a bright start in 1952–53 with five straight wins but eventually slipped and finished in 5th place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board could not give him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board&#x27;s lack of ambition as his main reason. Shankly&#x27;s record in league football at Grimsby was 62 wins and 35 defeats from 118 matches. Shankly went on to win the Football League, FA Cup and UEFA Cup with Liverpool.

Grimsby became the first English football club to appoint a foreign manager with the appointment of Hungarian Elemér Berkessy in 1954. Shortly afterwards Allenby Chilton became Grimsby&#x27;s first player-manager, he joined late in the 1954–55 season from Manchester United. However, Chilton was unable to stop Grimsby from being relegated. But the following season, Chilton led Grimsby to the Division Three North title – the only club ever to go from relegation to promotion in one season. Chilton continued as manager at Grimsby Town until April 1959 when he joined Wigan Athletic as manager for one season during 1960–61.

In 1968 Grimsby slipped into the Fourth Division for the first time. The following season the club had to apply for re-election to the league having finished second from bottom. It was in this season that the lowest-ever attendance for a Football League match at Blundell Park was ever recorded; 1,833 saw a 2–0 defeat to Brentford. Arthur Drewry, a local businessman, married the daughter of Grimsby Town&#x27;s chairman, and subsequently served as a director of the club before his own chairmanship. Drewry became President of the Football League and Chairman of the Football Association after Grimsby, before he was elected as the 5th President of FIFA.

===Revival of the 1970s (1970–1980)===

Grimsby Town broke their transfer record in 1972 with a fee of £20,000 for the signing of Phil Hubbard. In the same year 22,489 people witnessed a home victory against Exeter City that saw the club promoted as Division Four Champions. This turnaround was credited to the appointment of Lawrie McMenemy as manager.

The club stayed in Division Three until relegation in 1977 but were promoted again in 1979. A year later they finished as Third Division Champions under the stewardship of George Kerr and returned to the second tier of the English game, a level they had not been at for 16 years.

A popular myth has it that in 1976 the local Member of Parliament and then Foreign Secretary Anthony Crosland invited the then United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to watch the Mariners play Gillingham. Despite this being widely reported in the media, with some outlets claiming Kissinger subsequently became a Grimsby fan, in reality Kissinger&#x27;s Boeing 747 simply stopped off for a two-hour breakfast discussion with Crosland on the issue of Rhodesia at nearby RAF Waddington before flying directly to Nairobi. However, Crosland&#x27;s decision to force the US foreign policy leader to fly from London to Lincolnshire for their Saturday morning meeting was influenced by his desire to stay in his constituency and watch his local football team.

===Return to the Second Division (1980–1987)===
The first season back (1980–81) saw the club finish 7th. Work started that year on a new £1 million stand, originally called the Findus Stand (now known as the Young&#x27;s Stand) after the former Barrett&#x27;s Stand had been declared unsafe, the stand opened for the first time on 29 August 1982, as the Mariners played hosts to Leeds United. In the 1983–84 season the club finished 5th in the Second Division after spending most of the latter part of the campaign in the top three promotion places. This was their highest league finish since the 1947–48 season. Grimsby Town&#x27;s stay in the Second Division ended in 1987, having spent much of the 1986–87 season in the top half of the table, but a run of 8 losses and 2 draws in the final 10 games saw them fall from 8th to 21st before they could return to second tier again.

===Initial decline and double promotion (1987–1997)===
1987–88 saw Grimsby Town suffer a second consecutive relegation, placing them in the Fourth Division. The club&#x27;s financial situation was also dismal, and as the 1988–89 season began, the task at Grimsby was to avoid relegation to the Football Conference, avoid expulsion from the FA and avoid going out of business completely. This was achieved, finishing 9th. Following the resignation of Dave Booth in 1986 (to pursue outside business interests) the club had two managers in two years (Mick Lyons and Bobby Roberts). Alan Buckley was appointed after the 1988 relegation and by 1991 had led the club to two successive promotions with the chairman at that time being Peter Furneaux. Grimsby were to remain in football&#x27;s second flight for six years. Buckley&#x27;s crop of players consisting of some of the most popular and biggest cult heroes in the club&#x27;s history; players such as Shaun Cunnington, Keith Alexander, Mark Lever, Dave Gilbert, Steve Livingstone, Paul Futcher, Paul Groves and Clive Mendonca made the club a solid second-tier side (the Second Division became Division One in 1992 upon the creation of the Premier League from the old First Division). In 1992–93, Grimsby finished 9th in the new Division One, and until well into April they were in the hunt for a play-off place that would have given them the chance of a third promotion in four years. They dipped to 16th place a year later, though they were never in any real danger of relegation.

The Mariners began to produce homegrown talent from the club&#x27;s youth academy, including Jack Lester, John Oster, Gary Croft and Peter Handyside. Buckley departed Grimsby in October 1994 to join West Bromwich Albion and he was replaced by defender Brian Laws. Laws steered Grimsby to a 10th-place finish in his first season as manager. During his tenure, Laws became famous for a changing-room altercation after a defeat at Luton with Italian striker Ivano Bonetti, which left the latter with a fractured cheekbone, and caused the popular player to leave the club at the end of the season. Grimsby finished 17th and were in the battle to avoid relegation right up to the penultimate game of the season. In the 1996–97 season the Mariners were relegated from Division One. Despite flowing goals from Clive Mendonca, notably good performances from John Oster and newcomer Kingsley Black, Grimsby failed to save themselves. The club had suffered from the losses of Gary Croft, who made a £1.7 million move to Blackburn Rovers and ever present goalkeeper Paul Crichton.

===Double Wembley season (1997–98)===
The 1997–98 season saw the return of Alan Buckley as manager, after an unsuccessful period at West Bromwich Albion, for Grimsby Town&#x27;s most successful post-war season. In the summer of 1997, Buckley succeeded in bringing in players to the club who were to be instrumental in the club&#x27;s upcoming season; former skipper Paul Groves was re-signed from West Bromwich Albion, and Kevin Donovan and David Smith also joined the club from Albion. The mid-season capture of Huddersfield Town midfielder Wayne Burnett proved to be a great bit of business for Buckley. After a seemingly poor start to the League campaign, performances improved, which propelled the club into a promotion battle with Watford, Bristol City and an expensively assembled Fulham (at the time the only club at this level to have spent seven-figure sums on players), with Grimsby finishing the season in 3rd place.

A good run in the League Cup saw the Mariners knock holders Leicester City and fellow Premier League side Sheffield Wednesday out of the competition before finally losing out to Liverpool. A decent run of form had ignited the careers of such younger players as Daryl Clare, Danny Butterfield and Jack Lester who were becoming an integral part of the Blundell Park set-up. The Mariners went on to dump Burnley out of the Football League Trophy Northern section area final, which would see the club book its first trip to Wembley Stadium. The club were drawn against Southern section champions AFC Bournemouth and in a tight game, an equaliser from substitute Kingsley Black took the game into extra time, and in the 112th minute Grimsby secured the game courtesy of a golden goal from Wayne Burnett. This was the first major trophy awarded to the club following its first appearance at Wembley. It took only four weeks for Grimsby to return to the stadium though, this time to face Northampton Town in the Division Two play-off Final. Town won the game 1–0 thanks to a first half Kevin Donovan goal which gave the club a historic Wembley double and the Mariners promotion back to Division One.

===Return to the second tier (1998–2003)===
The 1998–99 season saw Grimsby Town finish in 11th place, but the 1999–2000 season saw Grimsby struggle and finish 20th, avoiding relegation at the expense of Buckley&#x27;s old club Walsall. The 2000–01 season saw a boardroom change with Doug Everitt taking over from Bill Carr. Everitt dismissed manager Alan Buckley just two games into the season, replacing him with Lennie Lawrence, who earlier in his managerial career had guided both Charlton Athletic and Middlesbrough into the top flight. The new manager chopped and changed the playing squad around and brought in some expensive loan signings from abroad such as Zhang Enhua, Menno Willems signing from Vitesse for 160K, David Nielsen and Knut Anders Fostervold. Despite this, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing their place in Division One on the last day of the season with a win over promoted Fulham.

The Mariners started the 2001–02 season strongly, topping the league table after five games. The club advanced to the third round of the League Cup where they met holders Liverpool at Anfield. In one of the club most famous victories, Grimsby held the Premier League team to a 0–0 draw after 90 minutes taking the game into extra time. Despite Gary McAllister scoring a penalty following a David Beharall handball to put the Reds 1–0 up, loan signing Marlon Broomes equalised before ex-Everton youth player Phil Jevons hit a 35-yard strike into the top corner of Chris Kirkland&#x27;s goal to give the club a historic victory. Grimsby&#x27;s push for promotion faltered and the team&#x27;s form declined rapidly, with Lawrence being dismissed halfway into the season. Paul Groves, the skipper, was chosen to replace him and he steered them to a 19th in the final table, enough to avoid relegation, but a disappointing end to a season which had begun so promisingly. The season was overshadowed by the collapse of ITV Digital putting enormous strain on finances for the club.

The 2002–03 season would bring relegation with the Mariners finishing bottom of Division One and relegated after five successive seasons at this level. At the time only one of their previous 12 seasons had been spent below the second tier of English football.

===Sliding down the divisions (2004–2010)===
The sudden collapse of ITV Digital had left the club with debts of over £2 million, £700,000 of which was owed to the Inland Revenue and a further substantial amount to their bankers, Lloyds Bank. The collapse had seen a lot of the smaller clubs playing in the second tier of English football struggle to make ends meet. Coupled with this, it meant first-team players such as Danny Coyne and Georges Santos moved on to other clubs. For the new season, the club also had to supply its own kits following the closure of long serving kit suppliers Avec Sportswear. Grimsby Town played the season using the brand &quot;Grimsby Town Sports&quot;.

Groves was dismissed in February 2004 following a poor stretch of games that had seen the club drop down the table, his replacement Nicky Law was sacked himself only a few months later as Grimsby were relegated for a second consecutive season. Russell Slade was appointed as the new manager in May 2004.

In 2005, director John Fenty became the controlling shareholder in the club after a search for outside investors failed, and a sale of shares to the local public was poorly received. He owned a 51% majority stake in the club and had made significant loans to the club to ensure its continued operation. Former Leicester City chairman John Elsom also joined the board of directors along with racehorse stable trainer and owner Michael Chapman in December 2002.

Having guided Grimsby to a mid table finish in his first season, Russell Slade began the 2005–06 season with a good start to the season and much improved results and performances had seen Grimsby Town rise to the top of Football League Two. A good run in the League Cup saw Town beat Derby County away at Pride Park in round one, and defeat Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur at home in the second round, with Jean-Paul Kamudimba Kalala hitting an 87th-minute winner. The Mariners eventually suffered elimination by Newcastle United in the third round, losing 1–0 at home. Grimsby would fall out of the promotion places on the final day of the season and after defeating Lincoln City in the play-off semi-finals they would lose 1–0 to Cheltenham Town in the final at the Millennium Stadium. On 31 May, manager Russell Slade left the club after failing to agree terms on a new contract.

Slade&#x27;s Assistant Graham Rodger was his replacement but by November he had been dismissed following a poor start to the season, he was replaced by Alan Buckley who arrived back with The Mariners for a third time but could only produce a bottom half finish in League Two. During the 2007–08 season the club enjoyed a good run in the Football League Trophy and on 4 March 2008 Grimsby booked their place at the new Wembley Stadium after beating Morecambe in a two-legged Northern Final. A Paul Bolland goal in the away first leg was enough to see Town through. They went on to play MK Dons in the Final on 30 March, losing 2–0 after Danny Boshell missed an early penalty. The season ended with eight straight defeats. After a 13–game winless streak in the league stretching from 22 March 2008, on 15 September 2008 Alan Buckley was sacked as manager for a second time. The board appointed Mike Newell as manager. The Mariners would finish 22nd in League Two narrowly avoiding relegation on the final day.

Following another slow start to the season, and despite previous backings from the Grimsby Town board, on 18 October 2009 the club&#x27;s official website declared they had sacked Mike Newell due to &quot;irretrievable breakdown&quot;. Neil Woods was controversially made permanent manager on 23 November 2009. The other main candidate for the job was former boss Russell Slade, but the board decided upon Woods ahead of Slade. Almost immediately Woods was dealt a blow when the club decided to do a U-turn and sell captain Ryan Bennett to Peterborough United for £500,000 despite rejecting this offer in the summer and the player only recently signing a new four-year deal. Grimsby under Woods struggled and despite winning four and drawing one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season, they were defeated 3–0 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League for the first time in nearly 100 years.

===Non-League (2010–2016)===
Neil Woods was relieved of his duties on 24 February 2011 after 15 months in charge, leaving the club in 9th position in the Conference National. On 23 March 2011, former Boston United managerial duo of Rob Scott and Paul Hurst were announced as the new joint managers. They finished the 2010–11 season in 11th on 62 points. On 19 September 2011, John Fenty resigned as chairman of Grimsby Town with immediate effect, a position he had held for 7 years.

Following an 11th-place finish in 2012, the Mariners enjoyed a positive cup run in the 2012–13 season FA Trophy and reached the final at Wembley Stadium where they played Wrexham on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to go, through an Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9-match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.

Grimsby came third in the Conference Premier 2014–15 season, and secured a play-off spot. Grimsby reached the 2015 Conference Premier play-off final against Bristol Rovers in front of a Conference record 47,029 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The game was forced to penalties where Jon-Paul Pittman missed the penultimate penalty in their 5–3 shootout.

Grimsby would play in the final of the FA Trophy, but lost 1–0 to FC Halifax Town. The week before, Grimsby Town beat Forest Green Rovers 3–1 in the 2016 National League play-off final at Wembley Stadium, seeing Grimsby promoted back to League Two after a six-year absence from the Football League.

===Return to the Football League (2016–2021)===
After promotion, manager, Paul Hurst, released a number of players, many of whom were pivotal to the previous season&#x27;s promotion push. On 24 October 2016, Paul Hurst was appointed as Shrewsbury Town manager, Chris Doig also left Grimsby and made Hurst&#x27;s assistant at Shrewsbury, thus leaving Dave Moore and Stuart Watkiss as caretaker managers. On 7 November 2016, Marcus Bignot, then manager of non-League side, Solihull Moors, was officially announced as the new Grimsby Town manager, along with the appointment of Micky Moore as his assistant. On 10 April 2017, Marcus Bignot was sacked. His replacement was Russell Slade, who joined the club for the second time as manager on 12 April 2017. The Mariners would finish 14th, with a total of 62 points.

Slade was sacked on 11 February 2018 after the team failed to win in 12 league games, with eight losses; he left the team 17th in League Two. Paul Wilkinson took over as caretaker manager following the sacking. Michael Jolley was appointed as the new manager on 2 March 2018 and twice secured Grimsby&#x27;s Football League status as well as securing cup runs that culminated in an FA Cup tie away at Crystal Palace and a League Cup tie at Chelsea. Jolley left the club by mutual agreement and was replaced on a temporary basis by assistant manager Anthony Limbrick.

On 29 December 2019, Ian Holloway joined Grimsby Town as manager, at the same time becoming a shareholder in the club. On 23 December 2020, just under one year later, Holloway left the club abruptly in controversial circumstances, announcing on Twitter that he was resigning with immediate effect. His decision was down to several boardroom issues, a big loss in form and his unwillingness to work with a consortium looking to buy out John Fenty. Ben Davies was caretaker manager for two games.

On 30 December 2020, Paul Hurst was re-appointed as permanent manager, but could not prevent the club from being relegated back to the National League following a 3–2 defeat to Exeter City, after a five-year stay in the Football League.

===Climbing to the Football League again &amp; New takeover (2021–)===

On 5 May 2021, local businessmen Jason Stockwood and Andrew Pettit under their company 1878 Partners completed their takeover of the football club after buying out majority shareholder John Fenty.

In the 2021–22 season, Grimsby finished 6th in the National League. They defeated Notts County in the quarter-final of the play-offs, and Wrexham in the semi-final 5–4. In the 2022 National League play-off final, they defeated Solihull Moors 2–1 after extra time to win promotion back to League Two at the London Stadium.

On 1 March 2023, Grimsby advanced to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1939 by beating Premier League side Southampton 2–1 away from home, becoming the first club in the competition&#x27;s history to knock out five teams from a higher division.

==Colours and strip==
The original 1878 kit of Grimsby Pelham, featured a shirt with narrow horizontal stripes in royal blue and white, with long white shorts and black socks. Between 1884 and 1910, various kit colours were introduced, with the most common colours being variations of pale blue and chocolate brown, worn with white shorts and black socks. Other kits from this period include:

*1897–1898 – Plain white shirt, with royal blue shorts and socks
*1904–1906 – Pale red shirt, with black shorts and socks
*1906–1908 – White shirt with red collar and cuffs, red shorts, black socks with red bands

Black and white vertical stripes were adopted in 1910 and with a few exceptions, they have rarely been missing from the kit design ever since and have become one of the most recognisable features of the club. The 1911 kit included the black and white striped t-shirt, white shorts and black socks. Exceptions from the traditional bar-stripe kit:

*1935–1936 – Plain white shirt featuring the coat of arms of the County Borough of Great Grimsby, black shorts and red socks
*1958–1959 – White shirt with black pin stripes, black shorts, red socks
*1960–1962 – White shirt with black collar and cuffs, red shorts, red socks
*1963–1966 – White shirt with black pin stripes, black shorts with white stripe, white socks with black bands
*2006–2007 – Black and white halves, black shorts, black socks

Since the introduction of the black and white bar stripes in 1910, the GTFC kits have featured exclusively red, black and white. The only exceptions to this are the corporate colours used in a sponsor logo and the yellow/gold trim used between 2001 and 2003. The official GTFC club logo first appeared on the club kit in 1974.

Grimsby Town announced for their game on 26 February 2023, that they would wear a special one-off shirt that promotes green energy, with the sponsor being labelled &quot;Europe&#x27;s Green Town&quot; in nod towards the &quot;Food Town&quot; sponsorship of the 1990s.

==Stadium==
Grimsby Town play their home games at Blundell Park in Cleethorpes. This is the club&#x27;s fourth stadium. They originally played at Clee Park until 1879, they then moved to Lovett Street for a single season, before returning to Clee Park for a further nine years. The Mariners then moved to Abbey Park until 1899 before a move to Blundell Park, the club&#x27;s current stadium.

In 1953 the club introduced its first floodlights to the ground and with that enabling Grimsby Town to play night-time fixtures. Tall floodlights were purchased second hand from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1958 and installed in 1960 at a cost of £9,000 which was raised by the supporters club, they have illuminated matches ever since when required. However, in 2019, these original lights were replaced with newer, brighter lights. Three of the four original pylons remain. The stadium has had an all-seated capacity of just 8,777 in recent years, being in and around 27,000 before the stadium was made all seated in 1995. The club&#x27;s demise from the second tier of English football, down to the fourth meant the expansion seating was removed. This brought the overall capacity down from around 12,000 to what it is today. Situated inside the Findus Stand at Blundell Park, is &quot;McMenemy&#x27;s Function Suite&quot;, named after former manager Lawrie McMenemy.

Since the late 1990s, there have been plans for a new 20,200-seat stadium at nearby Great Coates – tentatively titled the Conoco Stadium after a naming rights deal with the American energy corporation ConocoPhillips. There have been numerous delays to the development of the new stadium. The plans have been met with resistance from many residents of the local area surrounding the proposed stadium site, but other factors have also slowed progress. One of the most notable difficulties for the club was in demonstrating how it planned to finance the scheme. As a result, they later amended their proposal to include a retail park on the site, which would help to fund the development. This raised other problems, due to a rival proposal by the property developer Henry Boot, who are continuing with plans for their own retail park, which will be in direct competition with the Grimsby Town site and which has also been approved by the local council. Henry Boot attempted to have the football team&#x27;s development plan stopped, by asking for it to be sent for judicial review by the Government, however their attempt failed. Currently, the Grimsby Town stadium development proposal has satisfied all the conditions that were imposed by planning officials and consent for the project has been granted. Initial estimates had suggested that the club would be able to move to the new stadium for the start of the 2011–12 season. However, as a result of the ongoing global recession, the club has halted all progress on the new development and it is unlikely that any work will begin until an upturn in the economy.

As of the 2012–13 season, the GTFC Supporters Trust known as the &#x27;Mariners Trust&#x27; has taken over responsibility for the operation of most of the bars at the stadium, which hopefully will lead to refurbishment, and new ideas from fans as to how the bars operate.

Plans were underway to relocate the club to land at the side of the Peaks Parkway in Grimsby. As of 2020, new plans have been agreed with the council, Grimsby Town FC and The Freemen of Grimsby to build the stadium on recently cleared land off Freeman Street.

==Rivalries==
Grimsby Town&#x27;s geographical region pits them against three main professional rivals, two of which like Grimsby are from the former county of Humberside. Hull City, on the north bank of the Humber Estuary have traditionally been viewed as Grimsby&#x27;s main rival but a contrast in their recent fortunes has meant that the two clubs have not met in the League since 1987, prior to a 2020 EFL Trophy victory for Hull the clubs had last met in 1997 when The Mariners won 1–0 in the same competition. The closest football club to Grimsby are Scunthorpe United, The Iron are mainly regarded as Town&#x27;s biggest rival although historically Scunthorpe have played most of their football in divisions below The Mariners. In the mid-2000s Grimsby&#x27;s fall from the second tier to the fourth was followed closely with Scunthorpe earning several promotions, with the 2004–05 season being the only campaign both sides met in the same division before being reunited once more in 2019. Games involving any of the former Humberside clubs are known as the Humber derby.

In more recent times games against Lincoln City (a Lincolnshire derby) has been Grimsby&#x27;s primary derby game, although historically Lincoln are another local side who have predominantly spent a lot of time in lower divisions to the ones Grimsby have regularly featured in, Town&#x27;s relegation to League Two in 2004 renewed this rivalry with notable games being the play-off semi-final in 2006 in which Grimsby ran out 3–1 winners on aggregate. In a contrast to Mariners fans regarding Scunthorpe as their main rival, supporters of Lincoln City would regard Grimsby as theirs. A slight rivalry with Sheffield Wednesday intensified between 2000 and 2004, with the two clubs competing with each other in relegation battles over four seasons in both the First and Second Division but the clubs have not met since this period. Barnsley, Doncaster Rovers and Boston United are three other examples of clubs who have shared some kind of rivalry with Grimsby in past seasons, whilst they were in the second and fourth tiers respectively. There are two other clubs within the Borough of Grimsby who are on the football ladder, Grimsby Borough and Cleethorpes Town, coupled with other non-League sides in Lincolnshire such as Gainsborough Trinity, games with these clubs only form pre-season friendlies or fixtures in the Lincolnshire Senior Cup.

==Mascot==
The Mighty Mariner is Grimsby Town&#x27;s mascot. He wears the club&#x27;s home strip and normally parades in front of the Pontoon Stand as well as tormenting the opposition&#x27;s fans. He also plays football with the mascots and warms up the Grimsby Town fans. Up until 1998, there were two club mascots, Mighty and Mini Mariner, and until then they used to wear yellow fishing rain coats, before Mini was dropped, and Mighty was given the home strip to wear. Formerly, the mascot was a character named &quot;Harry Haddock&quot;, so-called after Grimsby&#x27;s fishing industry, who is actually a rainbow trout.

==Supporters==
The newly rebranded Mariners Trust has been working with the fans and the club on a number of projects and events with the aim of improving the match day experience for the fans. It has a new Junior Mariners section, works with similar GTFC-friendly organisations like the internet mariners and the PPAG and is run by volunteers of 400+ members and continues to encourage GTFC fans to join and get involved. Since the late 1990s Grimsby Town have had a Scandinavian supporters group based in Norway and Sweden. Mariners fans since 2006 have also had a friendship with the supporters of Belgian club Eendracht Aalst.

Actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who is most widely known for creating and portraying the characters Ali G and Borat was spotted at Grimsby Town&#x27;s home game against Cambridge United during the 2013–14 season. He watched The Mariners 1–0 defeat before talking to fans in the Blundell Hotel dressed in a Grimsby shirt and hat. Cohen had been in the town to think of ideas for a new film and had also visited the town&#x27;s fish docks. In December 2013 it was announced that Cohen would be appearing in a new film called &quot;Grimsby&quot;. Notable Mariners fans include &quot;Soccer AM&quot; presenter and comedian Lloyd Griffith, American actor and television presenter Adam Richman. Despite not being from Grimsby or England, the &quot;Man v. Food&quot; presenter said he is a supporter of the club, and was involved in a BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in before the 2013 FA Trophy final between Grimsby and Wrexham. In 2015 Richman contributed to a fan fundraiser &quot;Operation Promotion&quot; and in June 2020 became a club shareholder.

Grimsby-born actor Thomas Turgoose, who starred as the lead role character Shaun Fields in the drama film &quot;This Is England&quot; and the TV follow-up&#x27;s &quot;This Is England &#x27;86&quot;, &quot;This Is England &#x27;88&quot; and &quot;This Is England &#x27;90&quot;, is a season ticket holder. He appeared as a guest on Sky show &quot;Soccer AM&quot; in 2007 sporting a Grimsby Town shirt.

Other famous fans include politician Norman Lamont, former professional snooker players Mike Hallett and Dean Reynolds, singer and songwriter Ella Henderson and BBC weather presenter Keeley Donovan.

== Grimsby Town Women ==
In May 2019, it was announced that Grimsby Town would enter the world of female football with the launch of its first ever affiliated women&#x27;s team with trials being held at the academy team&#x27;s training base at Oasis Academy Wintringham. The 2019/20 season saw the team venture into league football in the Lincolnshire Women&#x27;s League, the then 7th tier of women&#x27;s football with their first ever league fixture being against Appleby Frodingham Ladies led by newly appointed manager Dale Houlston. 

In a season that was cut short in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Grimsby Town Women remained undefeated. They also reached the League Cup final and the Lincolnshire Women&#x27;s County Cup final however none of those cup finals took place because of the pandemic.

During the summer of 2020, the FA announced that following a restructure to the leagues, Grimsby Town Women would be promoted to the 6th tier of the women&#x27;s football pyramid, meaning that the team commenced the 2020–21 season in the East Midlands Women&#x27;s Regional Football League, Division 1 North. The 2020–21 season also saw Grimsby Town Women enter The FA Women&#x27;s Cup for the very first time.

Grimsby Town Women commenced the 2021–22 season well and led the league. In November of this season, manager Dale Houlston resigned his position, having played 7 games, winning 6 and drawing just 1. Hayley Cox was named as the new manager. By the end of the season, they had managed to achieve second place in the league.

The 2022-23 season was just as successful for Grimsby Town Women as they secured the league title and promotion to the East Midland&#x27;s Premier Division.

After promotion, Grimsby Town Ladies played tougher opposition in the 2023-24 season and were relegated however they did pick up some silverware, winning the Marsh Sports County Plate in a 10-0 victory over HBW United Ladies. On the conclusion of the season, the club parted company with manager Hayley Cox.

On 23 August 2024, Ben Challen was appointed as the new Women&#x27;s First Team Head Coach having taken charge on an interim basis in June.

<text>Hartlepool United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Hartlepool, County Durham, England. The team competes in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system.

They were founded in 1908 as the Hartlepools United Football &amp; Athletic Club Company Ltd. West Hartlepool won the FA Amateur Cup in 1905 and after the club was dissolved in 1910 its assets and liabilities were subsequently taken over by Hartlepools United, who were then playing in the North Eastern League. Hartlepools United were elected into the Football League in 1921 and spent the next 37 years in the Third Division North, at which point they were placed into the new Fourth Division. In 1968, they were renamed Hartlepool due to the merger of West Hartlepool with the town of Hartlepool and the village of Hart, forming the new Borough of Hartlepool. The club won promotion in 1967–68 for the first time, though were relegated out of the Third Division the following season. In 1977, they were renamed again, to Hartlepool United. They won another promotion in 1990–91, though were relegated in 1993–94. They won further promotions out of the fourth tier in 2002–03 and 2006–07, having been relegated again in 2005–06 after losing the 2005 League One play-off final to Sheffield Wednesday in the previous season. Hartlepool were relegated again in 2012–13 and ended their 96-year run in the Football League with relegation into the National League in 2016–17. Hartlepool achieved promotion back to the Football League in 2020–21, beating Torquay United in the 2021 National League play-off final. However, Hartlepool returned to the National League after two seasons following relegation in 2022–23.

Hartlepool have played home games at Victoria Park throughout their history. Their main rival is Darlington. Between 1924 and 1984, Hartlepool had to apply for re-election on fourteen occasions (a record) in the fourth tier of English football; however, they were not relegated from this level until 2017. The club is also known for being the one where Brian Clough started his managerial career. Ritchie Humphreys holds the record for most appearances for the club, having made 543 appearances, while their leading scorer is Joshie Fletcher with 111 goals.

==History==
===1908–1946: early years and establishment in the Football League===
Hartlepool United&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1881 when West Hartlepool Amateur Football Club were founded, later joining as founder members of the Durham FA in 1883. In 1889, West Hartlepool subsequently joined the new Northern League before winning the FA Amateur Cup in 1905, beating Clapton 3–2. Partly as a result of this victory, the opportunity for a professional football team arose in 1908, when West Hartlepool Rugby Club went bankrupt, leaving their stadium, the Victoria Ground vacant. The stadium was bought and the current club was founded under the name The Hartlepools United Football &amp; Athletic Club Company Ltd on 1 June 1908, representing both the town of West Hartlepool and the original settlement of Hartlepool, known locally as &quot;Old Hartlepool&quot;.
In their first season, they won the major regional trophy, the Durham Challenge Cup and retained it the following year as well as entering the FA Cup, in which they were drawn to play the local amateur club, West Hartlepool, with whom they shared the Victoria Ground. Hartlepools won 2–1 in the first qualifying round only to go out in the second, beaten by South Bank after a replay. They also entered the North-Eastern League, finished fourth in their initial season, and remained members of that league until 1920–21; their best season was 1910–11, when they finished third. In June 1910, the amateur West Hartlepool team folded, with their assets being taken over by Hartlepools. In 1921, the Football League agreed to form a Northern Section of the Third Division to complement the existing Third Division which contained only southern-based teams. Hartlepools were among the 18 applicants accepted as members. On 27 August 1921, Hartlepools played their first ever Football League match, defeating Wrexham 2–0. In 1921–22, Hartlepools finished their first Football League campaign in 4th place.
Two seasons later, Hartlepools came 21st in the table, so were obliged to apply for re-election to the League; they and bottom club Barrow were elected unopposed. In the 1935–36 season, the club reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time. Drawn against Grimsby Town, they held the First Division club to a goalless draw, but lost the replay. By the time the Second World War put a temporary end to competitive football, they had spent 18 consecutive seasons in the Third Division North, courtesy of two more successful applications for re-election.

===1946–1969: FA Cup runs and first promotion===

In the mid-1950s, Hartlepools enjoyed improved performances in both league and cup competition. In the FA Cup, they reached the fourth round for the first time in 1954–55, losing to Nottingham Forest in a replay after extra time. The following season, they lost 1–0 to reigning First Division champions Chelsea in the third round. At the same stage of the 1956–57 competition, in front of a record Victoria Ground attendance of 17,426, they came back from 3–0 down with top scorer Ken Johnson struggling with injury to equalise against Manchester United&#x27;s &quot;Busby Babes&quot; before the top-flight club scored a late winner. Those three league seasons brought top-six finishes, culminating in what remains the club&#x27;s record high of second place in 1956–57, when only the champions, Derby County, were promoted. They dropped into the bottom six in 1958, which meant they were placed in the Fourth Division when the regional sections were merged into nationwide third and fourth tiers. Despite this, in 1959, Hartlepools defeated Barrow 10–1, the current club record victory in a league match. However, Hartlepools did not fare well in the fourth tier. After five consecutive applications for re-election and with the club in financial difficulties, they appointed the 30-year-old Brian Clough in October 1965 to his first managerial role. He and assistant Peter Taylor, aided by a change of chairmanship, built a team that finished eighth in 1966–67. Clough gave his future European Cup winning captain John McGovern his professional debut for Hartlepools aged 16. Although Clough and Taylor then left for Derby County, the team maintained their form, finished third, and won promotion for the first time in the club&#x27;s history in 1967–68. To better represent the new borough formed by the recent amalgamation of the adjacent boroughs of Hartlepool and West Hartlepool, the board decided the club would be called Hartlepool Association Football Club instead.

===1969–1997: re-elections and stagnation in the Fourth Division===
Hartlepool&#x27;s foray into the Third Division lasted just one season, finishing 22nd. Under Len Ashurst (who became manager in 1971), the team slowly began to revive after years of largely indifferent form. After Ashurst departed for Gillingham, the club reached the League Cup fourth round in 1974–75 for the first and only time under Ken Hale, where they lost a replay to eventual winners Aston Villa. However, 1976–77 saw a return to the doldrums; Hale was sacked but his successor, Billy Horner, could not improve the team&#x27;s form, with Hartlepool finishing in 22nd place. Again there was a strong challenger from non-League in the form of Wimbledon; however, as the club was seeking re-election for the first time in six years, it was Workington – bottom for a second successive year – that made way. Over the close season the team&#x27;s name was changed to its current form of Hartlepool United. In 1977–78, the first season under that name, the team reached the fourth round of the FA Cup again. By the time automatic promotion and relegation between the Football Conference and the League was introduced in 1986–87, Hartlepool had made a record eleven applications for re-election to the Fourth Division, which added to the three in the pre-war Northern Section made fourteen, also a league record, all of which had been successful.

After a poor start to the 1989–90 season, the appointment of Cyril Knowles meant Pools achieved a remarkable turnaround. After avoiding relegation, Hartlepool were in play-off contention with the partnership of Paul Baker and Joe Allon. However, in February 1991, Knowles was diagnosed with brain cancer. Alan Murray was put in temporary charge, where Pools&#x27; form would improve further. Joe Allon&#x27;s 28 goals helped them gain promotion via a third-place finish in 1990–91 which was confirmed with a 3–1 win against Northampton Town. This time their stay lasted three seasons. In 1992–93, Hartlepool defeated Crystal Palace 1–0 in the FA Cup third round – the first time that Hartlepool had beaten a top division side in its history. It was revealed shortly after the cup win that the club were in financial difficulties. To make ends meet, a number of players were released or sold, and the club set an unenviable record by going 1,227 minutes without scoring. The club eventually escaped relegation, finishing 16th but were relegated back to the fourth tier in the following season.

===1997–present: success under IOR and relegation from the Football League===

In 1997, Harold Hornsey sold the club to IOR Ltd, with Ken Hodcroft becoming chairman. After narrowly avoiding relegation to the Conference in 1999, the appointment of Chris Turner turned around the club&#x27;s fortunes. Three consecutive defeats in the semi-finals of the play-offs preceded promotion in 2002–03 as runners-up, narrowly missing out on the title to Rushden &amp; Diamonds. Hartlepool then achieved their highest finishing position since the introduction of the four-division structure, coming sixth in the third tier in both 2003–04 and 2004–05 under Neale Cooper. In the latter season, they reached the play-off final but lost out to Sheffield Wednesday after extra time. Relegated in 2006, they bounced straight back as runners-up in what was by then League Two. Promotion was confirmed with an away win at Wycombe Wanderers but they missed out on the title on the final day to Walsall.

They would spend six years in the third tier before being relegated in 2012–13. They came close to automatic relegation to non-League in 2014–15. June 2015 saw a change of ownership, IOR handing over to Essex recruitment firm JPNG, which appointed director Gary Coxall as chairman. But two years later, they were relegated from League Two after 96 years in the Football League. Needing to win their final match of the season and hope Newport County did not, Hartlepool came from behind to beat title-chasing Doncaster Rovers; however, Newport produced an 89th-minute winner to secure their own safety at Hartlepool&#x27;s expense. By November 2017, financial legacy issues from JPNG intensified, with the club narrowly avoiding liquidation after being bought by local businessman Raj Singh in April 2018. Hartlepool ultimately finished a turbulent first season in non-League in 15th place. After four years, they returned to the Football League via the play-offs, defeating Torquay United on penalties in the 2021 play-off final. In Hartlepool&#x27;s first season back in the EFL, they finished 17th and reached the EFL Trophy semi-finals for the first time, losing on penalties to Rotherham United. However, in 2022–23, the club were relegated back to the National League after only two seasons in the fourth tier.
==Recent seasons==

==Club identity==
===Colours and crest===
Hartlepool have primarily played in blue and white vertical stripes throughout their history. From 1908 until 1911, Hartlepools initially wore white shirts with blue and white socks. In 1912, Hartlepools then adopted the blue and white stripes. From the mid-1960s to mid 1970s, the club&#x27;s strip was often solely blue. In the 1990s, Hartlepool often played in light blue with white before returning to dark blue with white towards the end of the decade.

The first time that a crest appeared on the kit was in 1959, the crest was a shield with the club&#x27;s initials. However, this would not last long as a crest would not appear on the kits again until the 1970s. From 1974, Hartlepool wore a variety of badges featuring a hart, taken from the logo of the newly enlarged town. In the early 1990s, a modern and abstract image of the hart was used. In 1995, the new ownership under local businessman Harold Hornsey ran a competition for a new logo. The winning design featured a ship&#x27;s wheel, reflecting the maritime identity of the town. The club reverted to a design with a hart in 2017, standing on water as a heraldic pun on &quot;Hart&quot;-le-&quot;pool&quot;. The club said that the 1995 logo did not reflect the club&#x27;s history, and that the ship&#x27;s wheel was difficult to replicate in digital and printed media.

==Ground==


The home of Hartlepool United has been Victoria Park since the club&#x27;s formation in 1908. The ground is currently under the ownership of Hartlepool Borough Council. The capacity of the ground is 7,856. The four stands of the ground are the Brunel Group Stand/Town End (1,599 capacity), the Teesside Airport Neale Cooper Stand (1,617 seated and 1,832 standing), the Rink End/Simpson Millar Stand - which is used for away supporters (1,003 capacity) and the Longbranch Homes Cyril Knowles Stand (1,775 capacity).

West Hartlepool Rugby Club bought the Victoria Park land from the North Eastern Railway Company in 1886 which was by then allotments. The land had once been a limestone quarry. The ground was named in celebration of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The club&#x27;s first fixture at the Victoria Ground was on 2 September 1908, a 6–0 win against a Newcastle United team. Hartlepools initially shared the ground with West Hartlepool before they were dissolved in 1910, with their assets being taken over by Hartlepools. In 1916, the stand on Clarence Road (the current location of the Cyril Knowles Stand) was bombed by a German Zeppelin and was completely destroyed. The club attempted to claim compensation from the German government but failed. A temporary stand was introduced and was used until the Cyril Knowles Stand was completed in 1995 in memory of former manager Cyril Knowles who had died in 1991. In June 1948, new terracing was added to the Victoria Ground.

Under Harold Hornsey&#x27;s ownership, a new covered terrace was built, with the ground renamed as Victoria Park. In September 1998, West Hartlepool Rugby Club started a ground share which lasted for a year. By September 2010, owners IOR claimed to have invested over £12 million in the ground during their tenure. Following the death of former manager Neale Cooper in 2018, the Cameron&#x27;s Brewery Stand was renamed in his memory. In June 2021, owner Raj Singh and Hartlepool Borough Council signed a memorandum of understanding to begin a long-term project of development of Victoria Park and the nearby area. Singh claimed that Victoria Park&#x27;s capacity could be extended to 15,000 as part of the project.

Due to sponsorship reasons, the ground was formerly named as the Northern Gas and Power Stadium (2016–17) and the Super 6 Stadium (2018–19). On 12 November 2021, it was announced that the stadium would be named the &#x27;Suit Direct Stadium&#x27; after a three-year partnership was signed with the menswear high street retailer Suit Direct. The stadium was named as the &#x27;Prestige Group Stadium&#x27; for the 2024–25 season.

==Popular culture==
===Andy Capp===
The comic strip Andy Capp, which was created by Hartlepool native Reg Smythe, has referred specifically to the team and the Cyril Knowles stand.

===Monkey hangers===
According to local folklore, the term monkey hanger originates from a likely apocryphal incident in which a monkey was hanged in Hartlepool during the Napoleonic Wars. According to the legend, a French &quot;chasse-marée&quot; was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Hartlepool. The only survivor from the ship was a monkey, allegedly dressed in a French Army uniform to provide amusement for the crew. On finding the monkey on the beach, a group of locals decided to hold an impromptu trial. Because the monkey was unable to answer their questions, and because they had seen neither a monkey nor a Frenchman before, they concluded that the monkey must be a French spy. Being found guilty, the animal was duly sentenced to death and summarily hanged on the beach.

The people of Hartlepool therefore gained the nickname of monkey hangers which has subsequently been adopted by the football club. In 1999, the club&#x27;s mascot H&#x27;Angus the Monkey was introduced.

====Mascot elected mayor====

In the 2002 council election, the team&#x27;s mascot &quot;H&#x27;Angus the Monkey&quot;, aka Stuart Drummond, was elected mayor of Hartlepool as an independent, under the slogan &quot;free bananas for schoolchildren&quot;. Even though his candidacy was just a publicity stunt, Drummond has since been re-elected after throwing off his comedy image and identifying himself increasingly with the Labour group on the council. On 5 May 2013, Drummond left his post of Hartlepool&#x27;s mayor after a November 2012 referendum meant that Hartlepool would no longer have a mayor, instead being led by committees.

==Supporters and rivalries==
In 2003, market research company FFC surveyed fans of every Football League club across the country to find who they consider their main rivals to be. Hartlepool United fans chose Darlington as their main rivals. Additionally, in 2008, 95% of both clubs named each other as their biggest rivals. Between the two clubs, Hartlepool have won 60 games, compared to Darlington&#x27;s 57 games in the rivalry. However, the two clubs haven&#x27;t met since 2007 in a League meeting due to Darlington&#x27;s financial issues and subsequent relegations. Hartlepool&#x27;s other rivals according to the 2003 report include: Sheffield Wednesday, Carlisle United, Rushden &amp; Diamonds (now extinct) and Sunderland respectively.

In 2015, a Hartlepool United&#x27;s Supporters Trust was founded with the intention of &quot;articulating the views of Hartlepool United supporters, lobby the club and provide the basis for some element of fan involvement and influence with the football club.&quot;

===Famous fans===
In recent years the most visible fan of the club has been Jeff Stelling, the former presenter of &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; on Sky Sports. Stelling is currently Club President (2018–) and formerly Honorary President of the Hartlepool United Supporters&#x27; Trust (2017–2018). Janick Gers, of the metal band Iron Maiden, is a season ticket holder in the Neale Cooper Stand. Cricket umpire Michael Gough is also a fan of the club and in January 2021 was appointed Honorary President of the Hartlepool United Supporters&#x27; Trust.

In 2003, rock star Meat Loaf said on &quot;Soccer AM&quot; he was a fan of Hartlepool. On &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; later in the same year, he spoke about his support for the club and brought a cuddly H&#x27;Angus toy on the show. It was reported in the media that he was looking to purchase a house in the town. Speaking to Setanta Sports News in 2008, he commented on Hartlepool&#x27;s recent victory but said that while amusing, the story about him looking to buy a house in the town was not true. In an interview with Talksport in 2010, Meat Loaf confirmed he still followed Hartlepool&#x27;s results. Following his death in January 2022, the club paid tribute to Meat Loaf.

==Records and statistics==

The record for most appearances for Hartlepool is held by Ritchie Humphreys, who played 543 matches in all competitions between 2001 and 2013. Joshie Fletcher is the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 111 goals in all competitions.

<text>Oldham Athletic Association Football Club is a professional association football club in Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. The team compete in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system, as of the 2024–25 season.

The history of Oldham Athletic began with the founding of Pine Villa F.C. in 1895, a team that played in the Manchester and Lancashire leagues. When neighbours Oldham County folded in 1899, Pine Villa moved into their stadium and changed their name to Oldham Athletic. They won the Lancashire Combination title in 1906–07 and were elected into the Football League. They won promotion out of the Second Division in 1909–10 and went on to finish second in the First Division in 1914–15, before being relegated in 1923. Another relegation in 1935 left them in the Third Division North, which they won at the end of the 1952–53 campaign, only to be relegated back into the following year. Placed in the Fourth Division, they secured promotion in 1962–63, and again in 1970–71 after another relegation in 1969.

Jimmy Frizzell managed the club from 1970 to 1982 and under his leadership, Oldham won the Third Division title in 1973–74. He was succeeded by Joe Royle, who also had a 12-year spell in charge, during which time Oldham reached the League Cup final in 1990, before winning the Second Division title in 1990–91, which took them back into the top-flight for the first time in 68 years. Oldham were founder members of the Premier League in 1992, but were relegated two years later and fell to the third tier by 1997. The club ended a 21-season-long stay in the third tier – which encompassed numerous financial crises – with relegation out of League One in 2018. At the end of the 2021–22 season, relegation from League Two was confirmed and the club fell into the National League, becoming the first former Premier League team to play non-League football.

They play home matches at Boundary Park. Known as &quot;Latics&quot;, Oldham traditionally play in blue shirts. The club contests numerous local rivalries, most notably with Rochdale, Bolton Wanderers and Huddersfield Town, the latter of which is known as the Roses Derby.

==History==

===Early history===
In July 1895, licensee John Garland with his son formed a football club named Pine Villa Football Club with a group of friends inside the Featherstall &amp; Junction Inn. The club was initially named after the Pine Mill whose shadow the club played in. The term Villa is thought to have originated due to Aston Villa&#x27;s dominance at the time of formation. The club changed its appearance and name in 1899 to Oldham Athletic Football Club. The club immediately gained professional status and played in both the Lancashire Combination and Lancashire League. Unlike many clubs, Oldham Athletic gained quick success and gained acceptance into the Football League in 1907–08. After three years in the Second Division, Latics gained promotion to the First Division.

Within a couple of seasons, Oldham had announced themselves serious contenders, finishing 4th in the league in 1912–13, and reaching the F.A. Cup semi-finals the same season, losing out 1–0 versus Aston Villa. In 1914–15, Latics reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup but were knocked out once again after a 0–3 replay against Sheffield United. In the league that season they almost won it all; Latics lost the league by one point, as close as they have ever come to winning the league. Latics early success was only halted by the First World War.

===Interwar struggles===

Following the return of competitive football after the First World War, Oldham Athletic struggled to find their early success before they returned to the Second Division in 1923 – it would be another 68 years before they played top division football again.

Many of the players from their former squads had either retired from football or had been killed in the war. Their highest success came in the 1929–30 season as they finished in 3rd, missing out on promotion by finishing two points behind Chelsea From then on they slowly but surely fell down the league table, until a final placing of 21st at the end of the 1934–35 season saw them relegated to the Third Division North. They found life in this new division much more to their liking, coming 7th in their first season and following this with three seasons in the top five. Promotion back to the Second Division looked like it might just be a possibility, but the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 brought an end to League Football. Players&#x27; contracts were terminated, and relying largely on guest players, the club was to play in the war-time Northern League until August 1946.

===Post-war plight===

Following the return of competitive football there was to be no immediate success for Oldham Athletic. They finished 19th in the first league season after the war and manager Frank Womack resigned. In spite of reaching a more respectable 6th place under his successor Billy Wooton in 1949, it wasn&#x27;t until the appointment of George Hardwick as player-manager in November 1950 that the club found any real form.

Hardwick&#x27;s appointment came at a cost, with a £15,000 transfer fee paid to Middlesbrough. This was a huge amount at the time, especially for a third division club, but it was to stir up the town and its fans, who now looked forward to seeing a man who had been captain of England only two years previously in charge of its club&#x27;s fortunes. In Hardwick&#x27;s first full season in charge they finished 4th after topping the table for a considerable time. Home gates stayed high, with an amazing 33,450 watching a 1–0 win over local rivals Stockport County in March 1952, after a January game in the snow had established a new club scoring record when Chester were beaten 11–2. Eric Gemmell scored seven of these to establish an individual club record for one game which still stands to date. The season after, Oldham Athletic proudly finished champions of the division and won promotion to the Second Division. With an ageing squad and little money to recruit, however, the season that followed was a massive disappointment. Only eight games were won, Oldham finished in last place and quickly returned to the Third Division North, where a first equally disappointing season saw them finish no higher than 10th.

Hardwick resigned in 1955 and between then and 1960, they continued to struggle, finishing below the top 20 on three occasions. With a 15th-place finish in 1958–59, Oldham became a founding member of a newly formed Fourth Division. In the following season they finished in the 23rd position – their lowest position in the entire League, and had to apply for reelection, which they passed as the League chose to drop Gateshead, who had finished above them, in favour of newcomers Peterborough United.

Ken Bates entered the picture at Oldham Athletic in the early 1960s (where he was chairman for 5 years), and along with the appointment of manager Jack Rowley, the club&#x27;s fortunes turned for the better. During the 1962–63 season, Oldham Athletic again gained promotion to the Third Division as Rowley left as manager. Over the next six seasons, Oldham struggled with consistency in the league and at the manager position, with Les McDowall, Gordon Hurst and Jimmy McIlroy all spending time at the managerial position.

In the 1968–69, Jack Rowley once more returned as manager. With their inconsistency, Rowley and Bates could not save the club from a last-place finish and inevitable relegation. Midway through the 1969–70 season, Rowley and Bates both left the club as Jimmy Frizzell became Latics manager, a position he held for the next 13 seasons.

===Frizzell and Royle eras===

In the 1970–71 season, Oldham saw their best result since 1962–63 as they finished in third place, earning promotion back to the Third Division. After a mid-table finish in their first season, Latics missed out on promotion, finishing in fourth place, seven points behind local rivals and league champions Bolton Wanderers. In the 1973–74 season, Latics finished in 1st place and returned to the Second Division for the first time in 21 years. Oldham&#x27;s trip back to the Second Division was far more successful than their previous visit. During Frizzell&#x27;s remaining time at the club, Latics remained in the Second Division, but with little FA Cup and Football League Cup success.

In June 1982, the club appointed Joe Royle as their manager. Royle&#x27;s side finished 7th in his first season in charge, but fell to 19th in his second. In the 1986–87 season, Oldham narrowly missed promotion to the First Division finishing three points behind Portsmouth and losing in the inaugural play-offs to Leeds United, when previous seasons would have seen them automatically promoted.

Royle&#x27;s Latics reached Wembley Stadium in the 1990 Football League Cup final versus Nottingham Forest, where they lost 1–0. The next season, Oldham did not have the same cup success, but instead found success by winning the Second Division and returning to the First Division for the first time in 68 years. In their first season back in the top flight, the club finished 17th and became one of the founding members of the newly formed Premier League. After two further seasons at the top level, Oldham faced relegation yet again and during the following season, the Joe Royle era came to an end, as he left the club for Everton.

During this era, Oldham Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals twice, both times losing to Manchester United after a replay. In 1994 they were less than a minute away from winning 1–0 in extra time when a Mark Hughes equaliser for Manchester United saw the game at Wembley Stadium end in a 1–1 draw, and Oldham were beaten 4–1 in the replay at Maine Road. Many fans of Oldham in the years since have described the last minute equaliser by Hughes as the start of a decline from which Oldham have never recovered. Oldham failed to win any of their seven remaining league games following the semi-final and were relegated on the final day of the season after a 1–1 draw at Norwich City.

===1994–2018: second and third tier struggles===
Graeme Sharp took over as Oldham&#x27;s player-manager on the departure of Joe Royle in November 1994, but he was unable to mount a promotion challenge and the pressure continued to build up a year later when Oldham narrowly avoided relegation. Relegation to Division Two happened at the end of the 1996–97 season, just after Sharp had resigned to be succeeded by Neil Warnock.

As one of the biggest clubs in Division Two for 1997–98, and being managed by Warnock who had achieved no less than five promotions with other clubs in the last 11 years, Oldham Athletic were tipped for an immediate return to Division One, but they finished a disappointing 13th in the league and Warnock resigned. Oldham would ultimately stay in the third tier for 21 years. Veteran striker Andy Ritchie took over as player-manager, but he too failed to mount a promotion challenge and was sacked in October 2001 to be succeeded by Mick Wadsworth.

In 2001, Oxford-based businessman Chris Moore purchased Oldham Athletic, vowing to take the club back to Premier League football within five years. Wadsworth quit as manager in the summer of 2002 to make way for Iain Dowie, who transformed Oldham&#x27;s fortunes on the pitch as they made their first serious challenge for promotion in Division Two. Oldham finished fifth and their promotion dreams were ended in the playoffs, and their fans were furious when Moore decided to end his interest with the club, leaving behind large debts and a weak squad, and after selling the better players at a fraction of their market value at the time. For a while, it looked as though the club would go out of business, but a takeover deal was soon completed.

In 2004–05, Simon Blitz and two other partners, Simon Corney and Danny Gazal, purchased Oldham Athletic, trying to rescue the club from possible liquidation. While trying to repay debts, Oldham struggled for several seasons, barely avoiding relegation once more in 2004–05. In 2006–07, Oldham&#x27;s fortune turned for the better once more as the club narrowly missed out on promotion, losing to Blackpool 5–2 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final. After two years with the club, manager John Sheridan was sacked on 15 March 2009, immediately being replaced by former manager Royle. After being offered the job on a permanent basis, Royle rejected the proposal and announced that he would be leaving the club after the final game of the season. Darlington boss Dave Penney was announced as Royle&#x27;s successor on 30 April. Penney was dismissed as Oldham manager on 6 May 2010, with his assistant, Martin Gray, taking over as caretaker manager for the final game of season 2009–10. During June 2010, Paul Dickov was named as Oldham Athletic player-manager signing a one-year contract. On 3 February 2013, he left his role as manager despite having knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup the previous week.

On 18 March 2013, the club hired Lee Johnson to become the next manager; at the time of his appointment, he was the youngest manager in the Football League at 31. The club narrowly avoided relegation for the 2012–13 season, finishing 19th and just three points above the drop zone. The club fared better in Johnson&#x27;s second season, finishing mid-table at 15th.

In January 2015, it was reported that Oldham was attempting to sign Ched Evans, an accused rapist. The move faced a significant public backlash, including from politicians, while a petition against the signing gained 60,000 signatures and Verlin Rainwater Solutions withdrew club sponsorship. Oldham ultimately decided not to sign Evans due to &quot;unbearable pressure&quot; while condemning the &quot;vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff&quot;.

In January 2018, Moroccan football agent Abdallah Lemsagam agreed a deal with the club&#x27;s majority shareholder Corney, ending his 14-year association with Oldham. Gazal and Blitz had left in 2010, with Corney staying as the majority shareholder. Lemsagam owned 97% of the club, while the Supporters&#x27; Trust maintained a 3% stake. The takeover did not include Boundary Park&#x27;s North Stand, which the club did not own but could use on match days. In the two years prior to the Lemsagam deal, Oldham had faced a number of winding-up orders for non-payment of its tax bills, and saw its ground raided by HMRC in November 2017.

===2018–present: decline and relegation from the Football League===

Oldham were relegated to League Two on 5 May 2018. They had not been in the fourth tier since 1971. The club faced further HMRC winding-up petitions in late 2019 and early 2020. Former owner Blitz sought to put the club into administration on 6 March 2020 because of debts owed to his company, Brass Bank, which owned Boundary Park, but the case was adjourned to 21 April after a &quot;significant&quot; proportion of the debt was paid, as was Oldham&#x27;s tax debt to HMRC. One-time Watford owner Laurence Bassini was reported to be interested in buying the club, but this was labelled as &quot;false&quot; during the 6 March hearing.

Former Australia international Harry Kewell took over as Oldham manager in August, at the start of the 2020–21 season and recorded 11 wins, six draws and 15 defeats before he was sacked by the club in March 2021. He left the club 10 points above the relegation places; some fans regarded the club&#x27;s decision as premature given that Oldham had recently beaten promotion challengers Newport County, Forest Green Rovers and Salford City. Keith Curle stepped in as temporary head coach, and made the move permanent in May 2021, but his efforts to build a stronger squad were hampered by an EFL transfer embargo, COVID-19 illness, and fans protests against the club&#x27;s owner.

On 7 September, with the club in 23rd position in the fourth tier, Lemsagam insisted he did not wish to sell his stake. Curle left Oldham in November. In December 2021 Lemsagam announced he was willing to sell the club amid accusations of late payment of salaries, threats of player strikes, and concerns about administration. Sheridan was re-appointed as manager in January 2022, but could not halt the slide towards the National League. With two games still to play, Oldham were relegated from the English Football League following a 2–1 home defeat by Salford City on 23 April, a match interrupted by an on-pitch protest by fans against the club&#x27;s owner. The club became the first former Premier League team to drop into non-league since its creation in 1992.

Following the relegation, the club&#x27;s supporters&#x27; trust started to campaign for a community takeover of the club. On 30 June 2022, after Lemsagam and the Boundary Park owner agreed to a sale, it was reported Oldham Athletic could be sold within the next month to an unnamed local business. On 28 July 2022, it was confirmed that the club had been sold to businessman Frank Rothwell, owner of Oldham-based Manchester Cabins, and that Oldham were at an advanced stage in negotiations to buy Boundary Park from former owner Simon Blitz - a deal agreed in late August 2022, and eventually completed in March 2023.

Oldham started their first National League campaign with just two wins from their first eight games. Sheridan stepped down as manager on 17 September 2022 following a 3–2 defeat of Eastleigh and was replaced by David Unsworth. The side finished the season in 12th place. Unsworth was sacked on 17 September 2023 after a seven-match winless run before being replaced by Mikey Mellon.

==Kit and badge==
Latics originally started out playing in red and white hooped shirts with blue shorts, bearing strong similarities to the Oldham Rugby League Club colours. The red stripes were eventually replaced with blue, before this was in turn replaced by a white shirt with the blue stripe down the middle; this shirt was rumoured to have been influenced by the Ajax shirt of the times. In the mid-1960s, under the ownership of Ken Bates, the strip was changed to tangerine shirts with blue shorts. In the mid-1970s the club adopted an all blue shirt, and these colours have been worn ever since, with the exception of the red and blue hooped shirt that was used the late 1990s. This shirt proved unpopular among supporters and caused kit clashing problems, resulting in opposition teams occasionally having to wear Oldham&#x27;s away kit. The club brought back the colours from the 1960s as an away kit for the 2007–08 season and this proved to be popular amongst the supporters. Home and away shirts currently bear the slogan &quot;keep the faith&quot; as a result of the financial turmoil the club faced in 2004. On 27 April, it was announced on a new website set up by the club () that there was to be a new crest for the club. This new badge was shown on the new away kit for the 2011–12 season, and was introduced to the home kit for the following season. The badge contains the traditional blue and white colours, however, there is no longer any red visible; there is still an image of an owl, yet it remains on top of a football.

==Stadium==

After playing at what was originally called Athletic Ground, Boundary Park was opened for Oldham&#x27;s first football club—Oldham County F.C. In 1899, after County had folded, Pine Villa moved into the ground and renamed the club and stadium. The stadium is located on the Oldham side of the conjunction of Oldham, Chadderton and Royton, and has a current capacity of 13,512. Before the demolition of the north stand in 2008, the stadium had a capacity of 13,624. The new north stand has recently opened with many new facilities available. This was done in a bid to gain extra revenue in a troubled cash stricken period for the club since Moore&#x27;s departure.

The record attendance is 47,671 during an FA Cup tie between Oldham and Sheffield Wednesday in 1930 – the ground capacity at the time was nearly 50,000.

In February 2006, the club unveiled plans for the reconstruction of the stadium. After initially being rejected by Oldham Council, the decision was overturned with permission for the entire ground to be redeveloped. The ground was expected to seat at least 16,000 and cost approximately £80 million. On 5 September 2008, Simon Blitz announced on World Soccer Daily podcast that due to the economic problems in England, the development of the stadium was placed on hold temporarily.

On 22 July 2009, the club and Oldham Council unveiled plans for an entirely new, £20 million stadium to be located in Failsworth. The club made an agreement with BAE Systems to purchase a piece of land, on which the club plans to build an initial 12,000-capacity arena along with other leisure and corporate facilities. Oldham Council initially backed the plans for the new stadium after council chiefs voted in favour of pushing forward with a land deal, but later offered the club £5.7 million to help with the redevelopment of Boundary Park, which would involve building a new North Stand on the site of the former Broadway Stand.

Initial preparatory work began on the site for the new North Stand at Boundary Park in mid-May 2013. The stand has a capacity of 2,671 for spectators and contains various other non-matchday facilities such as a health and fitness suite and supporters bar. The newly named Joe Royle Stand partially opened against Sheffield United on 17 October 2015, with maximum capacity operation and corporate facilities in use on 26 December 2015 vs. Doncaster Rovers.

==Support==
Notable Oldham Athletic fans include comedy duo Cannon and Ball, professor and former musician Brian Cox, ex-Manchester United footballer Paul Scholes, ex-Leeds Rhinos and England rugby captain Kevin Sinfield, The Courteeners rhythm guitarist Danny Moores, glamour model Michelle Marsh, Hollyoaks actor Alex Carter and comedian Eric Sykes.

==Rivalries==
Boundary Park is less than from the nearby Football League stadiums of Rochdale, Manchester City, Salford City and Manchester United, with the stadiums of Stockport County, Huddersfield Town, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Accrington Stanley and Blackburn Rovers all within a 20-mile (32 km) radius.

Traditional local rivals over the years include Bolton Wanderers, Bury, Huddersfield Town, Rochdale and Stockport County, although many of these clubs are no longer a regular opponent.

A survey conducted in August 2019 by GiveMeSport.com revealed that Latics fans consider Rochdale to be the club&#x27;s main rival with 82% of votes, followed by Bolton Wanderers (74%), Huddersfield Town (67%), Blackburn Rovers (58%) and Manchester United (52%).

Conversely, Oldham Athletic have a long-standing supporters friendship with Eintracht Frankfurt. A small section of Frankfurt&#x27;s support often makes the journey to Oldham Athletic games at Boundary Park.

=== Managerial history ===

In the history of the club, only three managers have won a league title: George Hardwick (Division Three North, 1953), Jimmy Frizzell (Division Three, 1974) and Joe Royle (Division Two, 1991). Frizzell also won promotion from Division Four in 1971 (3rd place), as did Jack Rowley from the runners-up spot in 1963.

However, arguably the most successful manager in the club&#x27;s history is David Ashworth. Appointed in 1906, he guided them to the Lancashire Combination Championship and promotion to the Football League in his first season. In 1910, after just three seasons in Division 2, they finished in second place and won promotion to the top flight of English football. For the next four years Ashworth maintained the club&#x27;s smooth progress. They finished season 1913–14 in fourth place, only for Ashworth to move to Stockport County, leaving his successor Herbert Bamlett to take the team to its best-ever league placing the season after, when they finished runners-up to Everton, missing out on the League Championship by just one point.

Meanwhile, at the end of World War 1, Ashworth emerged as manager of Liverpool, guiding them to the League Championship in 1921–22, after they had finished fourth in his previous two seasons. Although he then took what seemed to many to be a strange decision, moving back to Oldham in a brave but failed attempt to save them from relegation in 1923, he remains the only Oldham Athletic manager ever to have won the Football League Championship with any club.

<text>Peterborough United Football Club is a professional association football club based in Peterborough,
Cambridgeshire, England. The team compete in League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Peterborough United formed in 1934 and joined the Midland League. Having won the Midland League title for five seasons in a row from 1955 to 1956, they were elected into the Football League in 1960. Peterborough immediately won the Fourth Division title in 1960–61, scoring a Football League record 134 goals. Relegated in 1968, they won another Fourth Division title in 1973–74, though suffered a further relegation in 1979. Peterborough were promoted back into the Third Division at the end of the 1990–91 season and reached the second tier with victory in the 1992 play-off final. However, they returned to the fourth tier with relegations in 1994 and 1997.

Peterborough won the Third Division play-offs in 2000 under the stewardship of Barry Fry, though were relegated in 2005. They secured a place in the Championship after manager Darren Ferguson led them to consecutive promotions in 2007–08 and 2008–09 and spent three of the next four seasons in the second tier, winning a play-off final in 2011 after relegation the previous year. They were relegated back into League One in 2013, though went on to win the Football League Trophy in 2014. In the 2020–21 season, Peterborough were promoted back to the Championship, though were relegated back into League One the following season.

Peterborough have long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs Cambridge United and Northampton Town, the former with whom they contest the Cambridgeshire derby and the latter the Nene derby named after the river that runs through both settlements. They have spent their entire history at London Road and are nicknamed &quot;The Posh&quot;.

==History==

===1934–1990===
Peterborough United formed in 1934 at Peterborough&#x27;s Angel Hotel to provide a replacement for Peterborough &amp; Fletton United, who had folded two years previously. Peterborough&#x27;s application to join the Midland League was welcomed by the league, however, the representatives from the club did not have the money to pay for the security deposit, entry fee and subscription. Grantham Town loaned the money to The Posh who began selling shares to raise funds.

4,033 fans attended The Posh&#x27;s first league match which ended in a 4–0 victory over Gainsborough Trinity. William Rigby scored the team&#x27;s first goal. They won the Midland League on six occasions, including five seasons in a row from 1956 to 1960. The Posh were elected to The Football League for the beginning of the 1960–61 season, winning Division Four.

Following the Fourth Division Championship success in 1960–61, The Posh spent seven seasons in the 3rd Division. They reached the quarter-finals of the 1964–65 FA Cup, beating Arsenal and Swansea Town along the way before going out to Chelsea. They were relegated back to the 4th Division for financial irregularities in the summer of 1968. The club took six seasons to return to Division 3, winning the 4th Division championship.

In 1977–78 the club threatened to go one better until they narrowly missed out on promotion to Division 2 when they drew the last game of the season at champions Wrexham (0–0) when a win was needed to go up. The game was notable for the fact that over 2,000 Preston North End fans travelled to Wrexham to watch the game and cheer on the home side – Preston were the club who went up because Peterborough did not win. The Wrexham draw cast a long shadow over the club and it fell into a long decline. Relegation followed in 1979 and Posh subsequently spent 12 years back in the 4th division. The 1980s was a long story of mismanagement and false dawns, punctuated by the odd cup run. March 1984 marked the arrival of striker Errington Kelly on loan; after scoring seven goals in eleven appearances, he was made permanent, and went on to have over 100 appearances for Peterborough over five seasons.

===1991–2000===
In January 1991, Chris Turner, who had played in the 1974 Fourth Division championship team took over as manager and the team embarked on a run of 13 unbeaten games that propelled them into the top four. Six players were signed on transfer deadline day, which at the time was a record for the number of players signed by one club on a single day. On the final day of the season, Posh travelled to Chesterfield needing a win to seal promotion. Despite going two goals down in the first ten minutes, the team rallied and drew level with goals from David Robinson and George Berry. However, Posh&#x27;s closest rivals, Blackpool lost at Walsall and promotion was achieved.

The following season arguably remains the most successful in the club&#x27;s history. After an inconsistent start the team hit form during the autumn when they knocked Wimbledon and Newcastle United out of the League Cup. The reward was a home tie with a Liverpool team containing Bruce Grobbelaar, Jan Mølby, Steve McManaman, Dean Saunders and Mark Wright. Garry Kimble scored the only goal after 19 minutes prompting wild celebrations and a place in the quarter-finals. In the league, the team went from strength to strength and surged up the table. Middlesbrough ended the League Cup run after a replay and there was further disappointment when the team missed out on a trip to Wembley in the Football League Trophy when they lost to Stoke City over two legs in the area final.

Progress continued in the league and a play-off place was clinched on the last day of the season despite a 1–0 defeat to champions Brentford. The following week, Huddersfield Town came to London Road for the first leg of the Semi-final. Captain Mick Halsall&#x27;s last minute equaliser levelled the score at 2–2. Three days later, the supporters travelled north more in hope than expectation but they were rewarded when the team came from a goal down to win 2–1 with Worrell Sterling and Steve Cooper scoring the goals. On 24 May 1992, Peterborough United played at Wembley for the first time, against Stockport County in the Third Division playoff final. With Posh winning 2–1 and gaining promotion to the new First division. They played in Football League Division One between 1992 and 1994 and finished 10th, their highest-ever league finish, in 1992–93 season.

===2001–2010===
During the 2005–06 season the club had three managers: Team owner Barry Fry returned to management following former England international Mark Wright&#x27;s sacking in January 2006. Wright&#x27;s assistant Steve Bleasdale was then appointed acting manager, but resigned in April. Keith Alexander joined as manager from Lincoln City for 2006–07 but was sacked in January 2007 after a run of poor form and was replaced by Darren Ferguson. He led the club to back-to-back promotions from League Two to the Championship in his two full seasons in charge. By November 2009 Posh were bottom of the Championship and Ferguson left the club, to be replaced by Mark Cooper. In February 2010, after only 13 games in charge, Cooper also left the club and Jim Gannon was appointed in his place. Following confirmation of relegation from the Championship after a 2–2 draw at Barnsley, Gannon was replaced by Gary Johnson.

===2011–present===

Gary Johnson left the club on 10 January 2011 due to policy disagreement. Two days after Johnson&#x27;s departure, Darren Ferguson returned to the club on a four-and-a-half-year contract. Peterborough finally finished 4th in 2010–11 with one of the worst defensive records in the third tier, conceding 75 goals, but scoring 106; the most for anybody in the Football League that season. Peterborough beat Milton Keynes Dons in the play-off semi-finals. They defeated Huddersfield Town in the final with a 3–0 victory, and gained promotion back to the Championship.

Darren Ferguson led the team to safety in its first season back in the Championship, leading to a finish in 18th. However, the Posh were relegated back the following season, after losing to Crystal Palace 3–2 on 4 May 2013, the final match of the season. On 30 March 2014, the Posh won the Football League Trophy after defeating Chesterfield in the final at Wembley Stadium. Darren Ferguson ended his time as Peterborough United manager on 21 February 2015, following a 3–0 defeat at Milton Keynes Dons.

On 1 May 2021, Peterborough were promoted back to the Championship after an 8-year stay in League One after coming back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 against rivals Lincoln City following a 96th-minute penalty by Jonson Clarke-Harris. On 20 February 2022, Darren Ferguson left Peterborough United for the third time, after offering his resignation to club co-owner Darragh MacAnthony. Ferguson left the club in the relegation zone of the Championship, five points from safety. At the end of the 2021–22 season, Peterborough were relegated back to League One. In the 2022–23 season, Peterborough reached the League One play-offs, but lost in the semi-finals to Sheffield Wednesday. Peterborough won the EFL Trophy for the second time in the 2023–24 season, defeating Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 in the final.

==Nickname==
Peterborough United are nicknamed &quot;The Posh &quot;, a moniker coined in 1921, after Pat Tirrell, manager of Fletton United, was reported to say he was &quot;Looking for posh players for a posh new team&quot;. When Fletton United looked to join the Southern League in 1923 they added Peterborough to their name to form Peterborough &amp; Fletton United, in an attempt to gain the backing of businesses in Peterborough. Peterborough &amp; Fletton United went bankrupt in October 1932 so the current club is the third to be known as The Posh. However, the term &quot;posh&quot; was used as a derogatory term for the club by the press. A pub on London Road, Peterborough, founded in 1932 and originally named The Bridge, was renamed Port Out Starboard Home (POSH) in the 1970s and demolished 1990s.

Peterborough &amp; Fletton United were also commonly called &quot;the brickies&quot; in reference to the large brick industry in Peterborough, however the nickname was dropped when the club went bankrupt.

In 2002 Victoria Beckham filed a counter-claim with the UK Patent Office over the club&#x27;s application to register their nickname of &quot;Posh&quot; for use on merchandise. The former Spice Girl, who was known in the group as &quot;Posh Spice&quot;, claimed the &quot;nickname &#x27;Posh&#x27; has become synonymous with her on a worldwide basis&quot;. She was unsuccessful in her suit.

==Stadium==
Since their formation, Peterborough United have played their home games at London Road. The stand behind the London Road End is terraced while the Moy&#x27;s End, is a rebuilt all-seater stand, and now known as the GH Display Stand. A 20,000 all-seater stadium to replace London Road has been proposed.
The record attendance at the stadium is 30,096, achieved on 20 February 1965 in an FA Cup fifth-round game against Swansea Town.

The ground was renamed as the &quot;ABAX Stadium&quot; in November 2014 as part of a five-year sponsorship deal with Norwegian company &quot;ABAX&quot;. In June 2019, the ground was renamed the &quot;Weston Homes Stadium&quot; as a ten-year sponsorship deal, the largest in the club&#x27;s history, between the football club and the British property developer company.

==Rivalries==

Cambridge United

According to the Football Fans Census, Cambridge United were considered to be the club&#x27;s main rival. The Cambridge rivalry, known as the Cambridgeshire derby, has been fought very evenly over the years; Peterborough winning 18 and Cambridge 15, with Peterborough netting 59
times and Cambridge 52 in the 39 competitive matches they have played each other. However, the two sides did not meet each other between 2001 and 2017 when they faced each other in the Checkatrade Trophy, a game which Peterborough won 2–0. They next met in the league on 29 October 2022. A game which Peterborough won 1–0. Peterborough won the latest fixture with a 6–1 win in the league on 9 November 2024.

Northampton Town

Northampton Town are the club&#x27;s traditional rival, dating back to when both sides were lower league, and as the city of Peterborough is historically part of Northamptonshire.

MK Dons

More recently, Peterborough fans have begun to view the MK Dons as rivals, partly due to the geographic location, but also due to battling with the MK Dons for promotion from League Two and League One in Darren Ferguson&#x27;s first two full seasons.

Huddersfield Town

Ever since 1992 there has also been animosity between Peterborough United and Huddersfield Town, with Chris Turner&#x27;s Peterborough progressing to the final and later on winning the play-offs in the 1991–92 Football League Third Division, they progressed past Huddersfield winning 4–3 on aggregate in the playoff semi finals. This rivalry further grew in 2011 with Peterborough winning against Huddersfield in the 2010–11 League One play-off final 3–0, and in the 2012–13 Championship season Huddersfield relegated Peterborough from the championship on the last day of the season with them drawing 2–2 with Barnsley, and with Peterborough losing 3–2 against Crystal Palace, Huddersfield&#x27;s draw with Barnsley, with both sides willing to see the game out as a draw, caused the latter to leapfrog Peterborough and send them down to League One. This rivalry was played again in the 2021–22 Championship season.

Lincoln City

Peterborough also have shown a certain enmity towards Lincoln City as the city of Lincoln is only fifty miles directly up the A15 from Peterborough and also some southern parts of Lincolnshire are actually geographically closer to Peterborough rather than Lincoln itself . This rivalry grew on 1 May 2021, as Peterborough United came back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 meaning they secured automatic promotion to the Championship, denying Lincoln a chance at finishing second and forcing the Lincolnshire club to settle for a play-off place.

Pride of Anglia

Many fans consider Peterborough to be a part of the Pride of Anglia derby, contested between the professional clubs based in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and sometimes Essex. Matches against these teams often draw large crowds with Posh&#x27;s highest home attendance of the 2019–20 season coming against Ipswich Town with 10,071 fans.

<text>Teresina is the capital and most populous municipality in the Brazilian state of Piauí. Being located in north-central Piauí 366 km from the coast, it is the only capital in the Brazilian Northeast that is not located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. With 902,644 inhabitants, Teresina is the 19th largest city in Brazil, and the 16th largest state capital in the country. Together with Timon in the neighbouring state of Maranhão, it forms a conurbation with a population of about 2.729.527 inhabitants; the entire metropolitan region of Teresina has over 2.893.729 inhabitants. The only natural barrier that separates Teresina from Timon is the Parnaíba river, one of the largest in the Northeast.

Its cathedral, Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora das Dores, dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows, is the archiepiscopal see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Teresina.

== History and names ==

Teresina was founded on August 16, 1852, under the name of Vila Nova do Poty (because its origin is linked to the Poti river) as the capital of the state of Piauí. It was the first planned city in the Brazil and the only northeast capital located out of the coast. Until 1852, Oeiras was the capital of the Piauí Captaincy. However, due to difficulties in communication and trade, the capital was transferred to an area next to the Parnaíba River, to the other cities and to the sea coast. Colonization of the area where Teresina is now located dates back to the 18th century. The chosen place was a small community of fishermen, in 1760, nearby Poty and Panaíba rivers, which grew into a village called &quot;Vila do Poty&quot;, but, due to the inundation of the Parnaíba River riverbanks, the city had to be built in a higher position.

In the 19th century, it was initially called Vila Nova do Poty, but later the city was renamed Teresina, in honor of Empress Teresa Cristina, the wife of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil.
Teresina is the hottest city in the country and the city with the third-highest incidence of lightning in the world. Nowadays, Teresina&#x27;s economy is based on international manufacturing industries and trade.

<text>Stockport County Football Club is a professional association football club based in Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. The team competes in EFL League One, the third tier of the English football league system, after winning the 2023–24 EFL League Two title.

Formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers, they were renamed Stockport County in 1890 after the County Borough of Stockport. The team have played in blue and white kits since 1914; their original colours were red and white. The club is nicknamed &quot;The Hatters&quot; after the town&#x27;s former hat-making industry. Stockport have played at Edgeley Park since 1902.

Stockport first joined the Football League in 1900 but had to seek re-election in 1904. The club were not re-elected and spent one season outside the competition before they returned for the 1905–06 season. County then played in the Football League continuously for 106 years until 2011, mostly in the lower divisions. The team won their first league championship in 1922, the newly created Third Division North. Two league championships followed in 1937 (Third Division North) and 1967 (Fourth Division). The 1990s was the team&#x27;s most successful period, when Stockport competed in the First Division for five seasons and reached the League Cup semi-finals in 1996–97. County also made four appearances at Wembley Stadium during this period, two in the Football League Trophy and two in the Football League play-offs, but lost on each occasion.

After financial difficulties in the early 2000s, the club fell back down the divisions, and were relegated out of the Football League at the end of the 2010–11 season, followed by relegation to the sixth tier in 2012–13. Stockport stabilised on and off the pitch in the following seasons, and won promotion to the fifth tier in 2018–19. In 2021–22, County topped the National League, securing promotion back to the EFL after an 11-year absence. In their first season back in League Two, Stockport finished 4th and reached the 2023 EFL League Two play-off final, losing to Carlisle United at Wembley Stadium. The following season they secured automatic promotion to League One as League Two champions.

==History==
===Football League===
Stockport County was formed in 1883 as Heaton Norris Rovers at McLaughlin&#x27;s Cafe in Heaton Norris, by a group of pupils from Stockport Sunday School. After playing home matches in different parks in the Stockport area for several years, Rovers moved to Green Lane in 1889. This is recognised as their first official ground. The club changed its name to Stockport County in 1890 after the County Borough of Stockport. The team played in the Lancashire League and local cup competitions until 1900, when they gained admission to the Football League Second Division.
Stockport left Green Lane in 1902 and moved to Edgeley Park, which was also home to rugby league club Stockport RFC. County finished in the bottom three for their first four seasons, and failed to gain re-election at the end of the 1903–04 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 2 1903/04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After spending one season in the Lancashire Combination, the club was readmitted to the Football League. In October 1908, it was confirmed that Stockport County would become a &#x27;limited liability company&#x27;. The team remained in the Second Division for seven years until the 1912–13 season, when they again had to seek re-election. Stockport gained 22 votes and retained their Football League status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 2 1912/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

David Ashworth was appointed as the team&#x27;s first manager in 1914. After the outbreak of the First World War, competitive football was suspended. Stockport did, however, compete in the Lancashire section of the Wartime Football League, which was played from 1915–16 to 1918–19. Ashworth managed County throughout the war until the end of 1919, when he joined Liverpool.

The 1920–21 campaign saw Stockport finish bottom of the Second Division; however, instead of facing re-election, they were placed in the new Third Division North.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 2 1920/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The team won their first Football League title in 1921–22, when they defeated Darlington in front of 18,500 fans at Edgeley Park. The manager Albert Williams was presented with the trophy seven days later, before the final home game against Lincoln City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 3 (North) 1921/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The club&#x27;s goalkeeper Harry Hardy was called up for the England national team in 1924, and kept a clean sheet in a 4–0 win against Belgium. Stockport remained in the Third Division North during the 1920s, with two consecutive second-place finishes but failed to gain promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;DIVISION 3 (North) 1928/29&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DIVISION 3 (North) 1929/30&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, Stockport County played in a black and white home kit, and were briefly nicknamed the &#x27;Lilywhites&#x27;. On 23 July 1935, Edgeley Park&#x27;s wooden main stand burned down, which caused damage to neighbouring houses. The fire also destroyed the club&#x27;s records until 1935. A new main stand was built in 1936 and officially opened by Charles Sutcliffe, then president of the Football League. In 1936–37, the team won the Third Division North title and promotion to the Second Division following a last-day title decider against Lincoln City which was attended by more than 27,000 fans. They finished in bottom place the following season and were relegated back to the Third Division North, remaining there until the divisions were reorganised in 1958.

During the 1939–40 season, Stockport played only two matches before the Second World War started; the Football League was suspended and did not resume until 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 3 (North) 1939/40&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regional league competitions were set up; the FA Cup was also suspended and was replaced with the Football League War Cup. In March 1946, Stockport hosted Doncaster Rovers in a League Three North Cup match which lasted 203 minutes, and is considered the longest professional football game.

The regional Third Divisions were combined into the national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957–58 campaign. County were founder member of the new Third Division, but were relegated after one season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 3 1958/59&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1964–65 season, Stockport chairman Vic Bernard re-introduced the royal blue strip, and hired former Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann as the club&#x27;s general manager to improve its image. Bernard and Trautmann decided to move matches to Friday evenings in an attempt to increase revenue. Trautmann resigned from his position in 1966. County returned to the Third Division by winning the Fourth Division in 1966–67.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 4 1966/67&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was relegated back to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1969–70 campaign, and remained in the fourth tier until 1991. Eric Webster managed Stockport on five separate occasions, four of which were as caretaker manager during the 1980s, having first joined the club in 1974 as youth coach. Following the introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Football Conference at the start of the 1986–87 season, Stockport faced the prospect of non-League football, with just six points from 13 games. However, Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager, and Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games to remain in the division, although Murphy left shortly after the season.

 Danny Bergara was appointed manager in March 1989, and gained automatic promotion to the Third Division in 1990–91.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 4 1990/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1992 Associate Members&#x27; Cup Final, Bergara became the first South American to lead an English team at Wembley; Stoke City defeated County 1–0. He led Stockport to Wembley on three further occasions, once more in the 1993 Football League Trophy Final and twice in the play-offs, but lost all. In March 1995, Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then chairman Brendan Elwood, and was succeeded by Dave Jones. That same year saw the opening of the new all-seated Cheadle End stand, whose capacity was just over 5,000. The 1996–97 season proved to be the most successful in the club&#x27;s history: Stockport finished second in the Second Division and reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, in which they eliminated three Premiership teams before losing 2–1 against Middlesbrough over two legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 1 1996/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Jones left for Southampton in 1997 and Gary Megson took over as manager. County finished eighth in the First Division in his first season, only two places off the play-offs—the club&#x27;s best ever league placing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Division 1 1997/98&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With Stockport bottom of the First Division in October 2001, a home defeat against Millwall saw manager Andy Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001, but he failed to save the club from relegation to the third tier that season. Palmer was unable to build a team capable of returning to the First Division the next season. The summer of 2003 saw an ownership change. Elwood sold the club to Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy in a move that would see Sale play their home games at Edgeley Park. A new company, Cheshire Sport, was established, which combined ownership of Stockport County, Sale Sharks and the Edgeley Park stadium.

In 2005, after reportedly losing £4 million in operating costs, Kennedy handed ownership of the club to the Stockport County Supporters&#x27; Co-operative. Former County player Jim Gannon was appointed manager, initially as caretaker manager. He led the club to safety in 2005–06, and sustained a promotion challenge the next season but eventually missed out on the League Two play-offs on goal difference. The team continued their success during the 2007–08 season and reached the play-offs in which they faced Rochdale in the Final at Wembley. Stockport came from behind to win the game and earn promotion to League One.

In April 2009, Stockport County was placed into administration due to a loan to a creditor of around £300,000, and a tax debt of £250,000 to Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs. Two months later, County&#x27;s administrator, Leonard Curtis, announced terms had been agreed with the Melrose Consortium—headed by ex-Manchester City player Jim Melrose—for the sale of the club. In July, administrators agreed to a company voluntary arrangement with the previous shareholders and creditors. The Melrose Consortium bid was rejected by the Football League, however, in March 2010. A new consortium, the 2015 Group, was given exclusivity to work towards a takeover of the club.

The purchase of Stockport County by the 2015 Group was approved by the Football League in May 2010, with the takeover announced in June. Before the start of the 2010–11 season, the new owners pledged to &quot;rebuild the club from top to bottom&quot;, and appointed Paul Simpson as manager. He was sacked after only six months in charge, and Ray Mathias was brought in as interim manager. Despite an upturn in results, County were relegated to the Football Conference for the first time in their history.

===Non-league era (2011–2022)===

After relegation, a Liverpool-based businessman tried, and ultimately failed, to buy the club. Dietmar Hamann, who had no prior managerial experience, was named manager in July 2011. He won only three of nineteen matches before resigning, after his position had been undermined by a fans&#x27; meeting in November. The fans called for Gannon to be re-appointed as manager. He was reinstated, steered Stockport away from the relegation zone and finished 16th.

The club regained sole tenancy of their Edgeley Park stadium for the first time in nine years in 2012, after Sale Sharks relocated to Salford City Reds&#x27; new ground. In January 2013, former &quot;fcbusiness&quot; magazine editor, 30-year-old Ryan McKnight was named as the chief executive officer at County. Gannon was subsequently dismissed for a second time. Stockport employed two further managers in three months, and were relegated to the Conference North on the final day of the 2012–13 season. The club announced it was to lose its full-time status, and proceeded with a part-time model. McKnight announced his resignation in April 2014.

Neil Young was named as Stockport&#x27;s new manager in 2015, after he had previous successes in the division with Chester, but departed in January 2016. County once again turned to Gannon, who returned for a third stint. He stabilised the club on the pitch and finished around the play-offs places for the next two seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;National League North Table 2016/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;National League North Table 2017/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a local search was carried out to locate descendants of the club&#x27;s founders. In 2018–19, Stockport reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy and won the Conference North, their first league title in 52 years.

Local businessman Mark Stott purchased County for an undisclosed fee in January 2020, and cleared its debts; Stott pledged to return the club to full-time football, to reach the Football League and to find a new training ground. Managed by Dave Challinor (appointed in November 2021), County topped the National League in 2021–22, securing promotion back to the EFL after an 11-year absence.
===Return to the Football League===
In their first season back in League Two, 2022–23, Stockport finished 4th and reached the play-off final, losing to Carlisle United 5–4 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at Wembley. The following season, 2023–24, Stockport secured automatic promotion to League One and were later crowned as champions with two games remaining.

==Colours, crests and traditions==
Stockport County&#x27;s traditional kit colours are blue and white, although they have played in other colours throughout their history. Stockport&#x27;s original colours were possibly red and white, although other sources suggest they wore blue and white during their early years. From the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, County played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the use of blue and white as the team&#x27;s main colours. They have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts, and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. The club experimented for a short time with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the Falklands War, and it returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the early 1980s. Stockport marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by bringing in a third kit—a gold colour with black trim. It retired &#x27;undefeated&#x27; at the end of the year, having been worn for 13 victories and four draws.

The club former crest, which was used from 1991 until 2010 when the club exited administration, was based on the arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport. It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town&#x27;s arms more closely, including the Latin motto &quot;Animo et Fide&quot;, which loosely translated means &quot;With Courage and Faith&quot;. The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the de Stokeport family, from whom Stockport derives its name. The twin-towered castle above the shield is Stockport Castle, which stood until 1775.

After takeover of the club by the 2015 Group in 2010, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Latin motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion&#x27;s rampant (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport&#x27;s location astride the River Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the town&#x27;s Metropolitan Borough Council. The crest was further altered in 2011 to re-include the town&#x27;s motto. The new version added two white ribbons—one at the top, with &quot;Animo et Fide&quot;, and one at the bottom with &quot;Stockport County F.C.&quot;. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. Stockport County Supporters&#x27; Co-operative used the blue on white cross from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo.

The club&#x27;s kit was manufactured by local company Umbro, who supplied all three kits for the 2013–14 season. Stockport was Umbro&#x27;s flagship partner for their relaunch in the UK. From the start of the 2014–15 season, Stockport again changed their kit manufacturer, from Umbro to Spanish-based company Joma.

==Grounds==

===Green Lane===
Heaton Norris Rovers originally played home matches at the Heaton Norris Recreation Ground, then at various locations in Stockport until settling at a park on Green Lane, Heaton Norris, in 1889. The nearby Nursery Inn served as the team&#x27;s home, with players using a barn as changing rooms. The club played at Green Lane for its first two seasons in the Football League.

The stadium had one main stand that ran the length of the pitch, and a raised bank behind one of the goals. The remainder of the ground was uncovered terracing, with turnstiles located at the back of the Nursery Inn.

===Edgeley Park===
By 1902, County required a larger ground and moved to Edgeley Park, then home of the rugby league club Stockport RFC. Green Lane was retained for use by the club&#x27;s reserve team, although one further first team game was played at the ground in April 1903, when Edgeley Park was used by the rugby club. The Green Lane site was later used for housing.

In 1995, a new 5,000 all-seated Cheadle End stand was built to replace the terrace. In late 2000, chairman Brendan Elwood considered moving Stockport to Maine Road, the home of rivals Manchester City. The potential move was unpopular with supporters, and protests were staged after it was suggested that the club would change its name to Man-Stock County. The Manchester City Council ultimately decreed that rugby union club Sale Sharks would make better tenants. Maine Road was demolished in 2004 to make way for a housing estate, and Edgeley Park was then shared with Sale whose parent company, Cheshire Sports, owned the ground. In 2001, The Railway End, opposite the Cheadle End, was the last part of Edgeley Park to be converted to seating, and took the stadium&#x27;s total capacity to 10,852.

There was another rumour that Stockport would leave its home ground in 2012. This was dismissed by chairman Peter Snape, before Sale Sharks confirmed that they would be moving to Salford City Reds&#x27; new stadium. It left Stockport County as the only tenants at Edgeley Park. In May 2012, County renamed the Main Stand &quot;The Danny Bergara Stand&quot; in honour of the club&#x27;s former manager.

Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council purchased the stadium in 2015, to prevent it from being demolished and redeveloped. After a plea from fans to safeguard the ground, an emergency council meeting was held, and the stadium was purchased for £2 million. It is currently leased back to the club. In February 2022, the club agreed a 250-year lease of Edgeley Park from Stockport council.

==Supporters and rivalries==

With both Manchester United and Manchester City F.C. located around from Edgeley Park, Stockport County has always vied with top-level clubs for local support. During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in the four professional tiers, attempting to boost revenue for smaller clubs. It had the opposite effect in places like Stockport, where many other league clubs were in relatively close proximity. As a result, County moved all their home games to Friday evening, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

In 2004, the club attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China. Stockport were watched by 22,000 in Yingkou against their then sister side Stockport Tiger Star. It is possible this attendance was a result of County&#x27;s association with their affiliate team, and Tiger Stars&#x27; name change to include &#x27;Stockport&#x27; two years before.

The 2006–07 season saw the club average the fourth highest average attendance in League Two. There was a further increase the following season with Stockport&#x27;s away support outnumbering home supporters on a number of occasions. Stockport County had an average away attendance of over 900, the highest in the division. The club set a National League North record attendance, when 4,797 people attended a home fixture with F.C. United in December 2015. This attendance was broken again three times in the following three seasons.

The support from County fans has often been cited by managers and players, with the fans influence likened to having a twelfth player on the field. Between the 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons, the squad number 12 was allocated to the &#x27;Blue &amp; White Army&#x27;, in reference to the fans being the team&#x27;s 12th man. However, for the 2010–11 season, the number reverted to one of the players. It was given back to the fans upon the club&#x27;s return to the National League in 2019.

Some famous Stockport County fans include darts players Tony O&#x27;Shea and Nathan Aspinall, singer-songwriter Daz Sampson, Blossoms bassist Charlie Salt, and Manchester City and England under 21 defender, Taylor Harwood-Bellis. O&#x27;Shea has written articles in the club&#x27;s matchday programme and has also worn County&#x27;s colours in all of his televised darts matches. Sampson became a lifelong member of the Stockport County Supporters&#x27; Trust after he released &quot;The County Song&quot;, which paid tribute to the team&#x27;s Football League record of nine consecutive wins without conceding a goal.

===Supporters&#x27; groups===
&#x27;Help the Hatters&#x27; is a group of volunteers who raise money for the club and help with the maintenance of Edgeley Park. They also organised the &#x27;Players Fund&#x27;, which paid the wages of young players, and gave the Stockport County Supporters&#x27; Co-operative shares in the club. The group transformed the club&#x27;s Legends Lounge into the Stockport County Museum, which was opened by former player George Haigh on his 102nd birthday.

Stockport County Supporters&#x27; Co-operative is the other active supporters&#x27; group. It runs the Stockport County Appearance Number Scheme (SCAN), where every player who has played a first-team game is recognised with a framed certificate and a number which shows their position on the list of players who made their debut for the club.

===Rivalries===

As the two nearby Manchester clubs have rarely been in the same division as Stockport, historically there has been little rivalry with either club until the 1990s, when the rivalry between County and Manchester City took form between 1997 and 2002. The two clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and during the 1998–99 season, Stockport were a division above City.

The club also has significant local rivalries with Oldham Athletic, Rochdale, Bury, Crewe Alexandra, and Macclesfield. According to a survey in 2003, County supporters include more distant clubs Burnley and Stoke City among their main rivals for more historical reasons.
The club also has a fierce rivalry with Wrexham which was intensified during the 2021–22 season as both teams battled for the National League title, which Stockport won on the final day of the season beating Halifax Town FC 2–0.

<text>Wycombe Wanderers Football Club () is a professional association football club based in the town of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England. The team competes in League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1887, they entered the Southern League in 1896. They switched to the Great Western Suburban League in 1908 and then the Spartan League in 1919, before joining the Isthmian League after winning the Spartan League in 1919–20 and 1920–21. They spent 64 years in the Isthmian League, winning eight league titles and one FA Amateur Cup title. Having rejected numerous invitations to join the Alliance Premier League (now National League), they finally accepted an offer in 1985 and eventually found success in the fifth tier of English football under the management of Martin O&#x27;Neill, winning promotion into the Football League as Football Conference champions in 1992–93. They also lifted the FA Trophy in 1991 and 1993, and won the Conference League Cup, Conference Shield (three times) and Conference Charity Shield.

Wycombe made an immediate impact in the Football League, winning promotion out of the Third Division via the play-offs in 1994. They spent a decade in the third tier and reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 2001, though were relegated three years later. They also reached the League Cup semi-finals in 2007 and then gained promotion out of League Two in 2008–09. This was the first of four successive seasons of promotions and relegations between League Two and League One, which was followed by a decline that saw the club only avoid relegation into non-League on goal difference in 2014. The club secured promotion out of League Two in 2017–18 under the stewardship of Gareth Ainsworth, who then took the club to the Championship for the first time in the club&#x27;s history with victory in the 2020 League One play-off final. However, they would be relegated in their first season in the Championship. They play their home matches at Adams Park, located on the western outskirts of High Wycombe.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1887–1921)===
The exact details of the formation of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. have largely been lost to history. A group of young furniture trade workers started a team to play matches which led to a meeting, held at the Steam Engine public house in Station Road, High Wycombe in 1887 which saw the formation of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. It is highly likely the club was named Wanderers after the famous Wanderers, winners of the first FA Cup in 1872. The club played friendly matches between 1887 and 1896. It first entered the FA Amateur Cup in 1894 and the FA Cup in 1895. In 1895 the club moved to Loakes Park, which would become its home for the next 95 years. In 1896 the club joined the Southern League and competed in the Second Division until 1908.

In the summer of 1908 the club declined the invitation to retain their membership of the Southern League. The club decided to pursue amateur instead of professional football and joined the Great Western Suburban League and remained there until the outbreak of the First World War. After the hostilities had ended the club joined the Spartan League in 1919 and were Champions in successive years. In March 1921 the club&#x27;s application to join the Isthmian League was accepted.

===Amateur years (1921–1974)===
The club remained a member of the Isthmian League until 1985, when they finally accepted promotion to the Alliance Premier League. For over sixty years the Wanderers sought to be the greatest amateur club in the country. One of the club&#x27;s greatest achievements came in April 1931 when it won the FA Amateur Cup. The Wanderers beat Hayes 1–0 in the final at Highbury, home of Arsenal. The club also reached the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time in November 1932, losing to Gillingham in a replay at Loakes Park.

The club remained active during the Second World War, competing in the Great Western Combination, which was won in 1945. In 1947 Frank Adams, who had captained the club to its double Championship victories in the Spartan League and made 331 appearances for the Wanderers, scoring 104 goals, made arguably his greatest contribution when he gave Loakes Park to the club. It provided the basis for a period of unprecedented success in 1950s.

The club appointed Sid Cann as coach in 1952 and he led the Wanderers to their first Isthmian League title in 1956. The title was successfully defended the following season, and the club also reached Wembley for the first time in their history. They were beaten 3–1 by Bishop Auckland in the final of the FA Amateur Cup in April 1957. Their North-East rivals were something of a nemesis having also beaten the Chairboys at the semi-final stage in both 1950 and 1955. The second round proper of the FA Cup was reached in December 1959 when the club was defeated 5–1 by Watford at Vicarage Road. The stars of the team included winger Len Worley and striker Paul Bates.

Cann left the club to join Norwich City in 1961 and the club&#x27;s fortunes took something of a downturn during the 1960s. That changed in December 1968 when Brian Lee was appointed as the club&#x27;s first conventional manager. He changed several aspects of the club including team selection, which up to that point had been chosen by committee. He led the Wanderers to a third Isthmian League title in 1971 and it was again defended successfully in 1972. The club suffered yet more FA Amateur Cup disappointment at the semi-final stage, losing 2–1 to Hendon at Griffin Park, Brentford.

A fifth Isthmian League title was won in 1974 and the following season it was defended yet again, this time by the narrowest of margins, a superior goal difference of 0–1 to Enfield. In the same season the club created history by reaching the third round proper of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 to First Division Middlesbrough in a replay at Ayresome Park having drawn 0–0 at Loakes Park.

===Loss of purpose (1974–1984)===
Lee retired as manager in 1976 and again the Wanderers suffered a decline. A significant factor was the abolition of amateur football by the FA in 1974 which left the club without a sense of purpose. The Wanderers rejected the invitation to join the Alliance Premier League on its formation in 1979 and again in 1981 with concern over the increased travelling costs. The club reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy for the first time in 1982 but lost out to Altrincham. A seventh Isthmian League title was won in 1983 but promotion to the Alliance Premier League was again turned down.

===Football League dream (1984–1993)===
As a consequence crowds at Loakes Park dropped to record lows and the club decided to accept promotion to the Gola League in 1985, having finished third in the Isthmian League Premier Division. The club&#x27;s first season in a national league ended in disappointment, with the Wanderers relegated on goal difference. They soon returned after romping to an eighth Isthmian League title in 1987 after a battle with Yeovil Town. The club consolidated their place in the newly named GM Vauxhall Conference and under manager Jim Kelman they finished in fourth place in 1989. The following season would be the club&#x27;s last at their Loakes Park home. It was a disappointing season on the field with Kelman being asked to resign following an ignominious defeat to the Metropolitan Police in the FA Trophy.

The club appointed Martin O&#x27;Neill as his successor and he went on to lead the Wanderers to unprecedented success. The club moved to its new Adams Park home in 1990, and in May 1991, the Blues defeated Kidderminster Harriers 2–1 in the final of the FA Trophy in front of a then-record crowd. The club narrowly missed out on promotion to the Football League the following season, finishing level on 94 points with Colchester United, but placing second in the league on goal difference.

===Football League (1993–2000)===
The club recovered to become only the third in history to do the non-league double. The Wanderers claimed the 92–93 Conference title before winning the FA Trophy again, beating Runcorn 4–1 in the final at Wembley in May 1993. O&#x27;Neill rejected the chance to manage Nottingham Forest that summer, staying with Wycombe to lead the club to fourth in the Third Division and qualify for the play-offs in their inaugural season in the Football League. They beat Carlisle United in the two-legged semi-final, and beat Preston North End 4–2 in the final at Wembley in May 1994 to secure their second consecutive promotion, entering the Second Division (the third tier) for the first time in club history.

In their first season in the Second Division, Wycombe finished sixth, but due to league re-organisation, missed out on a play-off place, and O&#x27;Neill left to become manager of First Division Norwich City in June 1995. Former Crystal Palace manager Alan Smith was appointed as his successor, but was sacked in September 1996 as Wycombe struggled in the bottom half of the Second Division. John Gregory took over and managed to steer the club to safety on the penultimate weekend of the 96–97 season. He left to manage Aston Villa in February 1998 and youth team boss Neil Smillie was given the job.

Smillie was sacked in January 1999 with the Wanderers looking destined for relegation back to the fourth tier. Lawrie Sanchez was appointed his successor and tasked with keeping the club in the Second Division. Safety was secured on the final day of the season when Paul Emblen headed home the winner seven minutes from time to beat Lincoln City 1–0. In tribute to this result, the club acquired a new mascot, in the form of the Wycombe Comanche.

===Cup success and relegation (2000–2006)===
In 2000–01, Wycombe began a successful FA Cup run, with wins over First Division sides Grimsby Town, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Wimbledon taking them to a quarter-final with Premiership outfit Leicester City. Striker Roy Essandoh headed an injury-time winner to seal a 2–1 win for the Wanderers at Filbert Street. The semi-final at Villa Park saw Wycombe face Liverpool, and goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler put the Premiership side up 2–0. A last ditch effort from club mainstay Keith Ryan gave some hope to the Wanderers, but they would exit the competition after succumbing to a 2–1 defeat.

Despite cup success, the club&#x27;s league form continued to struggle, as they finished 13th in the Second Division in 00–01. As bottom half finishes continued, Sanchez was eventually sacked in September 2003 after the club ended the previous campaign in 18th. His successor Tony Adams failed to turn things around, and Wycombe ended a 10-year stay in the Second Division at the end of 03–04, finishing bottom of the league and suffering relegation to the Third Division, then renamed as the Coca-Cola League Two. At the time, the Wanderers were English football&#x27;s last professional members&#x27; club, but at an extraordinary general meeting in July 2004, the members voted by a narrow margin to restructure the club as a Public Limited Company. Chairman Ivor Beeks, Director Brian Kane and sponsor Steve Hayes all subsequently invested in the club, with an approximate total value of £750,000.

Adams remained in the manager&#x27;s job for just a year, resigning in November 2004, and John Gorman was appointed as his successor. His tenure saw a record of 21 league games unbeaten at the start of the 2005–06 season. A double tragedy would soon hit the club, however, with midfielder Mark Philo killed in a road accident in January 2006 and Gorman&#x27;s wife Myra dying of cancer in March. Subsequently, the team&#x27;s form slipped and they fell from top spot to eventually finish in sixth place, still achieving a playoff spot. Cheltenham Town won the two-legged play-off semi-final 2–1 and Gorman was sacked in May 2006.

Paul Lambert took over in June, and took the club on another ambitious cup run, this time to the semi-finals of the Carling Cup. Having previously never passed the second round, Wycombe defeated Fulham away, and knocked out then Premier League side Charlton Athletic in the quarter-finals. This bought them to a semi-final with reigning Premier League champions Chelsea. The Wanderers drew the first leg 1–1 at Adams Park, with Jermaine Easter scoring a late equaliser after a first half goal from Wayne Bridge. The second leg at Stamford Bridge was a different story, as doubles from both Andriy Shevchenko and Frank Lampard saw Wycombe lose 4–0 and exit the competition. Again, however, the side&#x27;s league form would suffer, and a number of changes were made to the squad and staff in the summer of 2007. They reached the League Two play-offs in 2008 but were knocked out 2–1 on aggregate by Stockport County. Lambert resigned shortly afterwards.

===Yo-yoing between the lower divisions (2006–2012)===
Peter Taylor was appointed as his successor in May 2008 and he led the side to another lengthy unbeaten start which lasted 18 games. The side was nine points clear at the top at Christmas but results soon tailed off and the team eventually finished in the last automatic promotion place, ahead of Bury by virtue of a superior goal difference of just one. The summer of 2009 saw Steve Hayes become the first sole owner of the club, converting £3m of loans into equity. He also announced his intention to move the club into a community stadium based on the site of the Wycombe Air Park.

Taylor was sacked in October 2009 after a poor start to the season, and was replaced by Gary Waddock who was unable to save the club from relegation back to League Two. Waddock did however guide the Wanderers straight back to League One at the first attempt. He led the side to a third-place finish, and achieved a points total of 80, the highest the club had recorded since its promotion to the Football League. In July 2011, after much argument and debate, Wycombe District Council announced that work on the community stadium proposed at Wycombe Air Park would stop.

Wycombe Wanderers kicked off their 2011–12 League One season on 6 August 2011, with a 1–1 draw against Scunthorpe United at home. However, Wycombe were relegated back to League Two on 28 April 2012, after a 4–3 home defeat to Notts County.

===Wycombe Wanderers Trust ownership and rise to the Championship (2012–2021)===
On 30 June 2012, the Wycombe Wanderers Trust (Supporter owned) formally took over the club. This financial stabilisation ended a transfer embargo. Gary Waddock took advantage of this immediately and signed several new players for the 2012–13 season. The season also included their 125th anniversary, and the shirt design was an adaptation of their first-ever kit, in Oxford and Cambridge Blue halves (instead of quarters).

Wycombe kicked off their new season in League Two with a 3–1 victory away at York City. Despite this strong start, Wycombe went through a bad period soon after and for a while sat just above the relegation zone in League Two. On 22 September 2012, after Wycombe&#x27;s third successive defeat, Waddock was sacked as manager with immediate effect.

Former club captain, Gareth Ainsworth was immediately named as the caretaker manager in Waddock&#x27;s absence. Just over a month later, on 8 November 2012, Ainsworth was named as Wycombe&#x27;s permanent manager. He signed a contract, lasting for the rest of the season. Ainsworth revitalised the squad and the club as a whole, and steered Wycombe safely away from the relegation threat. Wycombe eventually ended the season in 15th place, nine points clear of relegation. At the end of the season, Wycombe&#x27;s player-manager Gareth Ainsworth announced his retirement from professional football (after an 18-year career), although he signed a new two-year contract as Wycombe manager.

At the start of the final day of the 2013–14 season, Wycombe were three points adrift of safety in the relegation zone of League Two. However, after a 3–0 win away at Torquay, and Bristol Rovers losing to Mansfield Town, Wycombe finished in 22nd place, above Bristol on goal difference, to remain in the Football League.

Following the near-relegation of the previous season, Gareth Ainsworth released seven players from the club, including defender Leon Johnson who had made 200 appearances in 7 years. During the summer break, Ainsworth rebuilt his squad, with the addition of Paul Hayes for a second spell at the club. The 2014–15 season saw the club spend the majority of the season in the automatic promotion places. However, two costly home defeats to Morecambe and local rivals Oxford United led to a finishing position of 4th, setting up a play-off fixture against Plymouth Argyle. The play-off final took place on 23 May and within five seconds of kick-off Wycombe midfielder Sam Saunders pulled his calf muscle and had to be substituted for Matt Bloomfield in the fourth minute. During the regular 90 minutes both teams had a goal disallowed, but neither managed to score. Four minutes into extra time Wycombe were awarded a free kick just outside the Southend penalty area. Joe Jacobson took the free kick and the ball rebounded off keeper Dan Bentley and into the net. Southend continued to put pressure on Wycombe until Joe Pigott scored in the 122nd minute to tie the game at 1–1 and send it to a penalty shoot out. Southend won the shoot out 7–6 when Sam Wood&#x27;s effort was saved by Bentley.

In the 2017–18 season, Exeter and Notts County both losing respectively combined with Wycombe winning their penultimate game of the season ensured promotion to EFL League One, joining Luton Town and EFL League Two champions Accrington Stanley. In the 2019–20 season, Wycombe finished 3rd in League One on points per game due to the impact of COVID-19. They won the play-off semi final 6–3 on aggregate, against Fleetwood Town, then, on 13 July beat Oxford United 2–1 in the final, at an empty Wembley Stadium, to ensure that Wycombe would play in the EFL Championship for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

The 2020–21 Championship season was a learning experience for everyone involved with the club. With all but three of the 46 League matches being played behind closed doors due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, Wycombe struggled in the early stages, failing to register a point in their first seven League outings, and failing to score in their first four. An improved run of form, which included back-to-back wins against Sheffield Wednesday and Birmingham City, lifted Wycombe to 22nd in the table, but three successive defeats in December saw the club drop to bottom position on the Saturday before Christmas. The indifferent form continued into the New Year, but a fourth round FA Cup tie at home to Tottenham Hotspur proved a welcome distraction, with Wycombe taking the lead through Fred Onyedinma in the first half, before the Premier League club found their form to win the tie 4–1. Still bottom of the table going into the Easter period, Wycombe&#x27;s fortunes then began to turn around significantly, and they still had a theoretical outside chance of survival going into the final game away at Middlesbrough. A 3–0 win was not enough, but results elsewhere meant that Wycombe finished the season in 22nd place with 43 points, 16 of which had been gained from the final eight games. The club was therefore relegated back to League One, but only by a margin of one point and an inferior goal difference to Derby County. After Derby County, previously accused of breaching financial fair play regulations, went into administration in September 2021, Wycombe considered legal action to recoup potential losses of up to £20m.

===End Of Gareth Ainsworth era (February 2023) and Matt Bloomfield era (2023–2025)===

Gareth Ainsworth departed for Queens Park Rangers in February 2023. The club quickly sought a replacement in former Wycombe club captain Matt Bloomfield from Colchester United. Ainsworth&#x27;s departure marked the end of 10 years at the club which included of a period of unprecedented success for the club. During his time he took the club from the bottom of League Two to the Championship for the first time in their history.

In the 2023–24 season, Wycombe reached the EFL Trophy final for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. In the final, Wycombe lost 2–1 to Peterborough United. Following the conclusion of the season, the club announced that ownership of Feliciana EFL Ltd, the company owning 90% of the club, had transferred to Blue Ocean Partners II Ltd, owned by Kazakhstani-Georgian billionaire Mikheil Lomtadze.

After losing their first two League games of the 2024-25 season, Wycombe then went on a 19-game unbeaten League run which also included eight straight League wins. In the Football League Cup, there was a run to the 3rd Round, where Wycombe were narrowly beaten 2-1 by Aston Villa. With the club having reached the 4th Round of the FA Cup, and sitting in 2nd place in the League, Matt Bloomfield left the club on 14 January 2025 to take up the vacant managerial post at Luton Town.

=== Sam Grace interim and Mike Dodds as Head Coach (2025-) ===
When Matt Bloomfield left for Luton, then Academy manager Sam Grace became caretaker manager whilst the club looked for a permanent replacement. He led the team to 2 wins, against Mansfield Town and Barnsley, and 2 draws, against Northampton Town and Cambridge United.

On 2 February 2025, Wycombe announced that former Sunderland AFC Assistant Manager Mike Dodds would become the Head Coach of Wycombe.

== Facilities ==

=== Stadium ===

Wycombe&#x27;s stadium is known as Adams Park, and is located on the edge of an industrial estate in the Sands area of High Wycombe. The stadium was named Adams Park in honour of benefactor and former captain Frank Adams. The club has played at the stadium since 1990; the move from its previous ground Loakes Park was financed almost solely by the sale of Loakes Park to the health authorities in order to facilitate the expansion of Wycombe Hospital.

During the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, the stadium was known as &quot;The Causeway Stadium&quot; for sponsorship reasons.

The stadium has a current capacity of 9,558 with four stands. The original seated Main Stand (Origin Stand) is on the north side of the stadium, with a capacity of 1,248. The largest stand in the stadium is the Woodlands Stand on the south side of the ground, which was built in 1996, replacing a covered terrace. It has three tiers; the upper tier is known as the Frank Adams Stand (like the stadium, named after former captain Frank Adams), with a capacity of 2,842; the middle tier contains 20 executive boxes, plus the Woodlands Lounge, and has a capacity of 360; the lower tier is the Family Stand, with a capacity of 1,777. The stand therefore has a total capacity of 4,979. At one end of the Family Stand are 60 so-called &quot;2020&quot; seats, which can be used by both seated and standing spectators. The away section of the stadium, on the east side, is the Hillbottom Stand (WhiffAway Stand) with a usable capacity of 1,866 (although the physical seating capacity is actually 2,057). This stand was rebuilt in 2001, almost doubling its previous size. The stadium also has one terrace, on the west side, which is the Valley Terrace (Beechdean Terrace). This is the home supporters&#x27; end, with a capacity of 1,430. In addition, there are 35 places in the stadium not accounted for above.

The main supporters&#x27; bars at the stadium are the Woodlands Lounge, the Caledonian Suite (formerly the Vere Suite), and Monty&#x27;s (formerly the Centre Spot, then Scores). The new club shop was built in 2006, replacing the portable buildings that previously served as the shop; it was reconfigured in 2015 along with the main reception area, and again in 2020.

Wycombe Wanderers also shared the stadium with Aviva Premiership Rugby Union team Wasps (then known as London Wasps) between 2002 and 2014.
=== Training Ground ===

Wycombe have two Training Facilities in use. One is Marlow Road in High Wycombe, Wycombe sold Marlow Road in March 2013, in which it was leased back to Wycombe and they have been paying rent. The Other being Harlington Sport Ground at Harlington, in West London. This being the former training ground of QPR and Chelsea and is currently owned by Imperial College of London. On 10 June 2024, Wycombe have agreed to Lease the ground to use for the rebuilding of the academy and the use for the First Team.

==Rivalries==
As a non-League club, Slough Town were considered Wycombe&#x27;s fiercest local rivals. A rivalry with the more distant Colchester United also exists due to the two clubs battling to win promotion to the Football League in the early 1990s, which recently got more traction due to Wycombe&#x27;s Matt Bloomfield starting his managerial career at Colchester, then moving to Wycombe mid-season, this despite the two teams not being in the same league since 2018.
Since becoming a Football League club, the Chairboys have also built on and off rivalries with neighbouring clubs Oxford United (M40 Derby), Milton Keynes Dons (Buckinghamshire Derby), Luton Town, and Reading, with the rivalry with Reading gaining more traction due to Wycombe&#x27;s enquiry on Reading&#x27;s current training ground, Bearwood Park, coming one week after Wycombe beat Reading 2-1 in March 2024, with Reading fans protesting at Adams Park a few days after.

They also had a small yet well-documented rivalry with Plymouth Argyle, which stemmed from Plymouth&#x27;s former manager Derek Adams having a vocal dislike for Wycombe which is outlined in a photo of him rejecting a handshake from Gareth Ainsworth. It was ignited in the 2014–15 League Two Playoffs and flared up in January 2016, where Barry Richardson, who was 46 years old at the time, played a professional game for the first time since 2005, coming on for an injured Alex Lynch and keeping a clean sheet, prompting the Plymouth Argyle Twitter Admin to respond negatively to the playing style, with most Wycombe fans proclaiming 30 January 2016 as &quot;Barry Richardson Day&quot;

<text>Johannes Itten (11 November 1888 – 25 March 1967) was a Swiss expressionist painter, designer, teacher, writer and theorist associated with the Bauhaus (&quot;Staatliches Bauhaus&quot;) school. Together with German-American painter Lyonel Feininger and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, under the direction of German architect Walter Gropius, Itten was part of the core of the Weimar Bauhaus.

== Life and work ==
He was born in Südern-Linden, Switzerland. From 1904 to 1908 he trained as an elementary school teacher. Beginning in 1908 he taught using methods developed by the creator of the kindergarten concept, Friedrich Fröbel, and was exposed to the ideas of psychoanalysis. In 1909 he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in Geneva but was unimpressed with the educators there, and returned to Bern. Itten&#x27;s studies at the Bern-Hofwil Teachers&#x27; Academy with Ernst Schneider proved seminal for his later work as a master at the Bauhaus. Itten adopted principles espoused by Schneider, including the practice of not correcting his students&#x27; creative work on an individual basis, for fear that this would crush the creative impulse. Rather, he selected certain common mistakes to correct for the class as a whole. In 1912, he returned to Geneva, where he studied under Eugène Gilliard, an abstract painter.

He was heavily influenced by Adolf Hölzel and Franz Cižek. Itten opened a private art school in Vienna, using the work and textbook of Eugène Gilliard as a base. From Hölzel, Itten adopted a series of basic shapes (the line, the plane, the circle, the spiral) as a means from which to begin creation, and the use of gymnastic exercises to relax his students and prepare them for the experiences that were to occur in the class.

From 1919 to 1922, Itten taught at the Bauhaus, developing the innovative &quot;preliminary course&quot; which was to teach students the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color. &quot;Itten theorized seven types of color contrast and devised exercises to teach them. His color contrasts include[d] (1) contrast by hue, (2) contrast by value, (3) contrast by temperature, (4) contrast by complements (neutralization), (5) simultaneous contrast (from Chevreuil), (6) contrast by saturation (mixtures with gray), and (7) contrast by extension (from Goethe).&quot;

In 1919 he invited Gertrud Grunow, to teach a course on the &quot;theory of harmony&quot; at the Bauhaus. This involved using music and relaxation techniques with the aim of improving the students&#x27; creativity.

In 1920 Itten invited Paul Klee and Georg Muche to join him at the Bauhaus. He published a book, &quot;The Art of Color&quot;, which describes his ideas as a furthering of Adolf Hölzel&#x27;s color wheel. Itten&#x27;s so called &quot;color sphere&quot; went on to include 12 colors.

In 1924, Itten established the Ontos Weaving Workshops near Zürich, with the help of Bauhaus weaver Gunta Stölzl.

Itten was a follower of Mazdaznan, a neo-Zoroastrian religion founded in the United States. He observed a strict vegetarian diet and practiced meditation as a means to develop inner understanding and intuition, which was for him the principal source of artistic inspiration and practice. Itten&#x27;s mysticism and the reverence in which he was held by a group of the students, some of whom converted to Mazdaznan (e.g. Georg Muche), created conflict with Walter Gropius who wanted to move the school in a direction that embraced mass production rather than solely individual artistic expression. The rift led to Itten&#x27;s resignation from the Bauhaus and his prompt replacement by László Moholy-Nagy in 1923. From 1926 to 1934 he had a small art and architecture school in Berlin, in which Ernst Neufert, the former chief-architect of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus, taught as well from 1932 to 1934.

Itten&#x27;s works exploring the use and composition of color resemble the square op art canvases of artists such as Josef Albers, Max Bill and Bridget Riley, and the expressionist works of Wassily Kandinsky.

== Influence ==
Itten&#x27;s work on color is also said to be an inspiration for seasonal color analysis. Itten had been the first to associate color palettes with four types of people, and had designated those types with the names of seasons. His studies of color palettes and color interaction directly influenced the Op Art movement and other color abstraction base movements. Shortly after his death, his designations gained popularity in the cosmetics industry with the publication of &quot;Color Me A Season&quot;. Cosmetologists today continue to use seasonal color analysis, a tribute to the early work by Itten.

<text>Georg Jakob Steenke (30 June 1801 in Königsberg – 22 April 1884 in Elbing) was a German architect and a &quot;königlicher Baurat&quot; (royal construction councillor) of the Kingdom of Prussia. His father Johann Friedrich Steenke and his grandfather, both also from Königsberg, were involved with maritime trade.

In 1833 Steenke built a canal, the Seckenburger Kanal, in the Memel (Klaipėda) area. He designed the Oberländischer Kanal (now called Elbląg Canal), which was built between 1844–58 from the Drausensee (Drużno) to the Drewenz (Drwęca) River. Inaugurated in 1860, it connected the cities of Deutsch Eylau (Iława), Osterode (Ostróda), and Elbing (Elbląg). It connected territories with about 100 yard differences in height by putting ships on carriage carts on tracks and using pulley wheels and cables to have the ships glide up the hills.

From the time the canal was opened until his retirement, he resided at the Czulpa residence by Lake Ruda Woda.

A monument to honor Steenke was removed after the area became part of Poland in 1945. When UNESCO placed the canal on its list of architectural marvels, the monument was put up again in 1986.</text><links>

<doc id="451153" wikidata="Q3433234" url="?curid=451153" title="Rita R. Colwell">
<text>Rita Rossi Colwell (born November 23, 1934) is an American environmental microbiologist and scientific administrator. Colwell holds degrees in bacteriology, genetics, and oceanography and studies infectious diseases. Colwell is the founder and Chair of CosmosID, a bioinformatics company. From 1998 to 2004, she was the 11th Director and 1st female Director of the National Science Foundation. She has served on the board of directors of EcoHealth Alliance since 2012.

==Early life and education==
Colwell was born on November 23, 1934, in Beverly, Massachusetts. Her parents, Louis and Louise Rossi, had eight children, Rita being the seventh child born into the Rossi household. Neither her mother nor her father were from scientific backgrounds. In 1956, Rita obtained a B.S. in bacteriology from Purdue University. She also received her M.S. in genetics from Purdue in 1957. Colwell obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Washington in aquatic microbiology under the direction of microbiologist John Liston in 1961. She participated in a post-doctoral fellowship at the Canadian National Research Council in Ottawa.

== Career ==

Colwell is recognized for her study of global infectious disease spread through water sources and its impacts on global health. Through this research, she has developed an international network that has brought attention to the emergence of new infectious diseases in drinking/bathing water, pertaining mostly to its role on the developing world.

=== Cholera research ===
During early research and study of cholera, Colwell discovered that cholera can lay dormant in unfavorable conditions and then resume normal functions when conditions are favorable again.

Many of her research papers have focused on abating the spread of cholera in the developing world by improving ways to track its spread and researching inexpensive methods for filtrating out the infection agents of cholera in water systems. Some of these tracking methods include observing weather patterns, surface water temperatures, chlorophyll concentrations, and rainfall patterns. Colwell&#x27;s findings of correlations between these phenomena showed that the infection rate of cholera is connected to water temperatures. This rising temperature causes algae blooms that host cholera bacteria, and rainfall and extreme weather patterns aid in spreading cholera among water systems. Colwell also concluded that climate change will have a profound impact on the spread of cholera.

Colwell has proposed ways people in the developing world can use inexpensive methods to filter water when water treatment facilities are not available. In one study spanning about 3 years, 65 villages in rural Bangladesh comprising 133,000 individuals, participated in an experiment in which they used folded sari cloth or nylon mesh filters placed over water pots to acquire safe drinking water from their local waterways. These inexpensive and readily available materials yielded a 48% reduction in cholera, when compared with the control: absence of any type of filter.

=== National Science Foundation ===
Colwell was the first female director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and held this position from 1998 to 2004. In a presentation to members of the foundation in 2002, she detailed what the foundation should address in the future. She explained that an educated society is critical not just for developing technology, but for supporting that development, both by the public and by the government.

Colwell is interested in K-12 science and mathematical education, and she is a proponent of increasing the number of women and minorities in science and engineering. Rita Colwell was responsible for doubling the funding to the NSF initiative ADVANCE, which supports the advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. Colwell also pushed to invest $60 million as part of a new priority area in mathematical and statistical sciences.

In 2004, Colwell completed her term as director of the National Science Foundation. She then became the chief scientist at Canon U.S. Life Sciences, a division of Canon. She served as chairman of Canon U.S. Life Sciences until 2006 when she was named as Senior Advisor and Chairman Emeritus.

=== Academia ===
Colwell joined the faculty of the Department of Biology at Georgetown University in 1964, and she gained tenure there in 1966. While at Georgetown, Colwell and her research team were the first to learn that the causative agent of cholera was found naturally in the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. In 1972, Colwell accepted a tenured professorship at the University of Maryland. She remains a professor at the University of Maryland at College Park and at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. At the University of Maryland at College Park, she is a Distinguished University Professor in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS), which is part of the university&#x27;s College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.

=== CosmosID ===
Colwell founded the company CosmosID in 2008, and she currently serves as global science officer and chairman of the board. CosmosID is a bioinformatics company that develops various types of equipment to identify microbial activity in a variety of ecosystems.

=== EcoHealth Alliance ===

Colwell was elected to the Board of Directors of EcoHealth Alliance in November 2012.

== Publications and media ==

Colwell has authored or co-authored more than 800 scientific reports and publications, along with 19 books.

In 1977, Colwell produced the award-winning film &quot;Invisible Seas.&quot; In this 26-minute film, the microbiology department at the University of Maryland, College Park demonstrates what types of methodology are required of marine microbiologists when studying microorganisms in the ocean. They emphasize the importance of marine microbiologists studying microorganisms in the ocean in order to determine the impact pollution has had on our oceans.

Colwell is the founding editor of GeoHealth, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. Colwell recognized the increase in published Geohealth research due to the advancement in our understanding of how Earth and space science provides deeper insight into health and disease in both people and ecosystems. 

Colwell&#x27;s memoir &quot;A Lab of One&#x27;s Own: One Woman&#x27;s Personal Journey Through Sexism in Science&quot;, written with Sharon Bertsch McGrayne, was released in August 2020.

Colwell is a co-author of a letter published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; titled &quot;Statement in support of the scientists, public health professionals, and medical professionals of China combatting COVID-19&quot; in which the authors declared, &quot;We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.&quot; Her link with EcoHealth Alliance was not reported as a conflict of interest.

== Awards and recognition ==
Colwell is the recipient of 61 honorary degrees, including Honorary Doctorates from NUI Galway, the University of Notre Dame, The New School, and the University of St Andrews in 2016.

<text>Boston United Football Club is a semi-professional association football club based in Boston, Lincolnshire, England. The club participates in the National League, the fifth level of the English football league system.

The club is known as &#x27;the Pilgrims&#x27; in reference to the Pilgrim Fathers, who left England and sailed to North America and settled near, though did not found, Boston, Massachusetts. The club&#x27;s crest features the pilgrim fathers&#x27; ship, the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The club&#x27;s traditional colours are amber and black. They are rivals with Lincoln City, Scunthorpe United, Gainsborough Trinity and Grimsby Town. They play at the Jakemans Community Stadium, which was completed in 2020 with a capacity of 5,061 (2,155 seated) spectators.

The club was formed in 1933 as a successor to the short lived Boston Town. They initially competed in the Midland League, before joining the Southern League for a four-year spell in 1958. They returned to the Midland League and then joined then United Counties League, winning their first league title in 1965–66. Boston then switched to the West Midlands (Regional) League, winning the Premier Division in 1966–67 and 1967–68, before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. United won four Northern Premier League titles in the 1970s (1972–73, 1973–74, 1976–77 and 1977–78) and became founder members of Alliance Premier League in 1979. Boston returned to the Northern Premier League in 1993 and moved back to the Southern League Premier Division in 1998.

Boston United won the Southern League in 1999–2000 and the Conference in 2001–02 to secure a place in the Football League for the first time under the stewardship of controversial manager Steve Evans. They spent five years in the fourth tier, but entered administration in 2007 and were relegated down two divisions into the Conference North. Demoted to the Northern Premier League the next year, Boston won the Northern Premier League Premier Division play-offs in 2010 and had five unsuccessful play-off campaigns in the Conference and National League North before winning the National League North play-offs in 2024.

==History==

The club was founded in 1933 as a successor to a club called Boston Town. Their first game was a 3–1 defeat at home to Grimsby Reserves on 26 August 1933, when a crowd of 1,544 watched Boston&#x27;s no.7, Blessed, score United&#x27;s first ever goal. They then had a moderate amount of success in various leagues, including the Midland League and Southern League.

The club&#x27;s FA cup run of 1955–56 included a 6–1 victory at Derby County, then playing in Third Division North, with Geoff Hazledine scoring a hat-trick. This was a record away win by a non-League team against League opponents in the FA Cup. This set up a Third round match against Tottenham Hotspur of the Football League First Division at White Hart Lane on 7 January 1956. The match against Tottenham Hotspur was played in front of a crowd of 46,185. The Pilgrims lost 4–0, but the match was more notable for the travelling support. Over 10,000 Boston supporters attended the game. A number of special train services from Boston to King&#x27;s Cross were set up for the day.

They were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968, of which they were champions four times, and of the Alliance Premier League (now the National League) in 1979. However, their Northern Premier League title wins were not enough to gain them election to the Football League, and when they won the title in 1978 they surprisingly missed out on league status in favour of runners-up Wigan Athletic, who took the Football League place previously held by Southport.

In 1985, Boston United went to Wembley for the first and only time in their history for the FA Trophy Final of the 1984–85 season, after Bob Lee scored a winning last minute goal in the 2nd leg of the semi-final against Altrincham at York Street to put the Pilgrims through. Boston lost 2–1 to Wealdstone in front of 20,775, with Chris Cook scoring United&#x27;s only goal.

Boston United finished third in the Conference in 1988–89, but were unable to build on this and were relegated to the NPL in 1993. They were transferred to the Southern League, winning the title in 2000, and went fully professional in 2001. In their first season as a professional club, Boston won the Conference and were promoted to the Football League.

However, in the wake of their promotion, Boston&#x27;s manager, Steve Evans, and former chairman, Pat Malkinson, were charged with breaking the Football Association&#x27;s rules over the registration of players. Both men received bans from the FA, and the club were fined and docked four points from their first season in the League. This angered some, especially the Conference runners up Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, who believed that any points deduction should have applied to the previous season, which would have meant Dagenham being promoted instead.

Youth team coach Neil Thompson was appointed as manager for Boston&#x27;s maiden Football League season, and though they left it late to secure survival, they ultimately managed a creditable 15th-place finish. The following season resulted in another relegation battle, and as soon as former manager Steve Evans had served his suspension in full, Thompson was sacked and Evans was reinstated as manager, leading them to a strong late-season run and an eventual finish of 11th. Evans&#x27; return and a substantial investment in the playing squad saw Boston among the promotion favourites for the 2004–05 season, but it in fact resulted in a disappointing 16th place finish. 2005–06 would prove to be their most successful Football League season, with their finish of 11th being their joint-highest, but the club missing out on the play-offs by just five points.

 The 2006–07 season saw Boston struggle all season long, and in May 2007, Boston were relegated from League Two on the last day of the season. Steve Evans and his assistant Paul Raynor on 27 May resigned from the club, and two days later joined Crawley Town.

Because of the relegation Boston were originally scheduled to play the 2007–08 season in the Conference National but this position was immediately placed in doubt after the club&#x27;s chairman Jim Rodwell entered Boston into a Company Voluntary Arrangement late in their last game so that 10 points would then be deducted in the 2006–07 season instead of the 2007–08 season. Although this meant that Boston started the 2007–08 season without a points penalty FA rules dictated that they be demoted two divisions as a result of HM Revenue &amp; Customs placing a restriction into the CVA of Boston not being allowed to pay football creditors 100% of what they were owed. They therefore played the 2007–08 season in the Conference North division, two steps below the Football League. This would be United&#x27;s first season under the new ownership of David Newton and Neil Kempster, who took control of the club over from ex-Chairman Jim Rodwell.

Despite finishing the 2007–08 campaign in 10th place under the guidance of Tommy Taylor, United were still in administration by May 2008. This meant they were relegated again to the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2008–09 season. Despite coming out of administration just before the start of the new season, Boston failed to have this decision overturned. They finished the league campaign in 16th position. A much more favourable campaign the following season saw the Pilgrims finish 3rd in the league where they won the play-offs, beating Bradford Park Avenue in the final thanks to an Anthony Church extra time winner to earn promotion back to the Conference North.

Joint managers Rob Scott and Paul Hurst resigned from the club in 2011 and were appointed joint managers of Conference National side Grimsby Town. Club chairman David Newton revealed he was beginning legal proceedings against the pair and Grimsby Town for breach of contract. The Pilgrims appointed former Boston player Jason Lee and current player Lee Canoville as joint caretaker managers. With only seven Conference North games remaining, the pair guided United to a 3rd-place finish in the league setting up a play-off tie against Guiseley. Boston lost the first leg 1–0 at Nethermoor Park but fought back in the return leg winning 3–2 but would later miss out on penalties. After a decent start to the 2012–13 season, Boston started to drop off the promotion pace, with a 7-game winless run from November to mid-December not aiding their cause. More inconsistency followed, and Jason Lee was sacked. Graham Drury took over within the same week but left the club after less than 2 months. Dennis Greene took over soon afterwards, but after a good start could not help the club from finishing higher than a poor 16th place, just 5 points above the relegation zone.

In 2014–15, Boston reached the play-offs after a 3rd place finish. In the play-offs, Boston would again miss out on penalties, this time losing to Chorley in the semi-finals. Boston started the 2015–16 season as play-off favourites once again, but pressure mounted on Greene due to poor results. However, Boston found spells of form later in the season to ensure 5th place. Boston faced North Ferriby United in the play-offs, and won the first leg 2–0 at home, however, the second leg at Church Farm saw that lead overturned. The following season started poorly, manager Greene left the club in late November to be replaced by former Mansfield Town manager Adam Murray. He led the side to safety but was himself gone by November the following year. 

With Boston occupying a relegation spot, Craig Elliott – leaving Shaw Lane to do so – took over and guided the Pilgrims to safety. Elliott&#x27;s second full season in charge was to be the club&#x27;s last at York Street (2019–20). The side won through four away ties in the FA Cup to reach a second round game away to Rochdale. A draw at Spotland secured York Street one last big cup tie – the League One side winning 2–1 in a televised replay with over 4,000 in attendance. The coronavirus pandemic cut short the season and Boston finished third on points per game, winning a behind closed doors semi-final against Gateshead 5–3 to secure a play-off final with Altrincham. The Robins scored the only goal of the game, the club&#x27;s last match at York Street.

With the new Pilgrim Way stadium delayed due to the pandemic, the 2020–21 season, still behind closed doors, started with United playing home games at Gainsborough&#x27;s Northolme. A COVID-19 outbreak in the squad meant only three home games were played at Trinity&#x27;s home, as the Boston Community Stadium opened in December 2020. The season was ended as the coronavirus situation worsened over the winter. In the 2023–24 season, Boston won the National League North play-offs, defeating Brackley Town 2–1 away in the play-off final to return to the fifth tier.

==Stadium==

Boston United played at York Street until 2020, styled as The Jakemans Stadium through a sponsorship deal. There were four sides to the stadium: the main seated Mick George Stand; the Co-Operative York Street Stand; the Spayne Road Terrace; and the old away end—known as The Jakemans Stand and then turned into a home stand. The away fans sat in a section of the York Street Stand.

Former club chairman Jon Sotnick claimed it was not up to Football League standards and called for a new ground during the Pilgrims&#x27; time in the Football League. Planning applications were made to Boston Borough Council in June 2006, but the council turned down the application. The ground had a total capacity of 6,643.

The club built a new stadium outside the town, and on 10 April 2019 announced that the 2019–20 season was to be their last at York Street. The ground&#x27;s capacity is 5,061.

For the beginning of the 2020–21 season, the club were granted permission to use Gainsborough Trinity&#x27;s Northolme as their home ground temporarily whilst finishing touches were applied to their new stadium.

The club played its first game at the Boston Community Stadium on 5 December 2020, resulting in a 2–0 home defeat to Chorley in the National League North. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, fans were not able to visit the new stadium until July 2021 for a friendly against Lincoln City which Boston won 5–0.

==Financial problems==
On 4 December 2006, Boston&#x27;s plan to relocate to a new stadium on The Boardsides was unanimously rejected by Boston Borough Council. This plunged the club&#x27;s future into serious doubt. Chairman James Rodwell said the club&#x27;s future was &quot;hanging in the balance&quot; because York Street did not have the facilities to allow the club to operate at a profit, and a ground move was required to wipe out the club&#x27;s debts. Rodwell confirmed that he would be meeting with shareholders over the next couple of days to determine the best course of action, but did admit that the club&#x27;s future was ultimately now in the hands of HM Revenue and Customs, who were owed a sizeable six-figure sum by the club.

In a statement he released to the club&#x27;s official website on 5 December he said: &quot;The club&#x27;s financial situation at the present moment is dire. I would urge all supporters and anybody interested in the future of the football club, be that investors or potential purchasers, to come forward immediately&quot;.

In November 2006, Boston manager Steve Evans and his former chairman Pat Malkinson pleaded guilty to &quot;conspiring to cheat the public revenue between 1997 and 2002&quot;. Both were given suspended jail sentences.

In May 2007, Boston entered into a Company Voluntary Arrangement towards the end of their last game of the season when they knew they would be relegated to the Conference. This allowed them to avoid a points deduction in the next season, but has proved a controversial move.

On 10 June 2007, the Football Conference&#x27;s annual general meeting voted in favour of demoting Boston United to the Conference North, stating that the terms of the Company Voluntary Agreement which Boston entered was behind the decision. Altrincham were subsequently spared relegation for the second season running. Chief executive John Moules released this statement:

&quot;Because Boston United are in breach of certain rules, it was felt Blue Square North was the best place for them. HM Revenue and Customs put a caveat on that CVA that Boston could not pay football creditors. That breaks Football Association, Football League and Football Conference rules and regulations. We&#x27;re giving Boston the opportunity to re-establish themselves as a leading club outside the Football League. They believe the decision we have made is fair and just, and they are not going to appeal. We had meetings all day on Friday with Boston United and then informed Altrincham that they were staying up.&quot;

On 4 July 2007, Chestnut Homes, a local housing development company, announced that they had acquired Boston United FC.

In a statement at a press conference the new chairman David Newton said: &quot;... we are happy to sit here today and make certain pledges to the loyal supporters of the club. While we are involved in the club, the club will be whiter than white. While we are here, everyone will be paid. We will be prudent in the management of the club&#x27;s finances. We will strive for excellence on and off the pitch. As finances permit, we will develop the youth side of the club, and if managed well that should pay dividends in the medium to long term for the club. Above all, we will try to rebuild the reputation of this football club.&quot;

During the summer of 2007, Boston lost their entire squad except for Stewart Talbot and Paul Ellender, and new manager Tommy Taylor had to start from scratch. Nevertheless, at the end of the season it was announced Boston would be expelled from the Conference league structure after the club failed to exit administration by 10 May deadline. The Conference is the only league in the world to have this appendix, which is not a rule as such, but only a guideline to be used at the League&#x27;s discretion. The Pilgrims came out of administration before the end of the summer.

==Kit==
When founded in 1933, Boston United inherited a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and black socks from the wound-up Boston Football Club. Later that year, these kits were changed to a black shirt with a large white &#x27;V&#x27;, a design maintained until 1937. After this, United switched to white shirts and black shorts and socks. After World War II, Boston United reverted to blue shirts of different shades with either black or white shorts and socks.

The currently colour scheme of amber and black has been in place since 1951, although the design has varied from season to season. In recent times, Boston United have had their kits supplied by Umbro (1988–90), Paulas Benara (1990–2005), Vandanel (2006–10), Errea (2010–2016), Nike (2016–2020), Adidas (2020–2023), and Umbro (2023–present).

<text>Bury Football Club is an English association football club based in Bury, Greater Manchester, which plays in the Premier Division of the North West Counties League, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid, following a 2023 merger with phoenix club Bury AFC. Before expulsion from the English Football League, Bury F.C. had played in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of the English football pyramid, in the 2018–19 season.

The team are known as The Shakers and play in white shirts and navy blue shorts. Gigg Lane has been the club&#x27;s home since 1885. The club has long-standing rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale. Established in 1885, Bury was a founder member of the Lancashire League in 1889 and champions in 1890–91 and 1891–92, before being elected to the Football League in 1894.

Bury won the Second Division in 1894–95 and promotion to the First Division in which they played for 17 seasons. They won the FA Cup in 1900 with a 4–0 victory over Southampton and again in 1903 with a record 6–0 win over Derby County. Bury were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911–12 season and were there for twelve years until securing promotion as runners-up in 1923–24. They were relegated in 1928–29, their last top-flight season. In 1956–57, they dropped into the third tier for the first time but won promotion as champions of the Third Division under Dave Russell in 1960–61. From 1967 to 1971, they had one promotion and three relegations, the last of which was from the Third to the Fourth Division.

Bury won promotion at the end of the 1973–74 campaign and remained in the Third Division until 1979–80. Under manager Martin Dobson, Bury won promotion back to Division Three in 1984–85. In 1990 and 1991, the club qualified for the Third Division playoffs, but were then relegated in 1992. In 1995, Stan Ternent became team manager, leading the team back to the second tier for the first time in 28 years after securing two consecutive promotions in 1995–96 and 1996–97. The club stayed there for just two seasons before being relegated twice in four seasons. They secured promotion out of League Two in 2010–11. After that, Bury switched between Leagues One and Two, being twice relegated (in 2012–13 and 2017–18) and twice promoted (in 2014–15 and 2018–19). Bury finished the 2018–19 season as runners-up in League Two, earning promotion to League One for the 2019–20 season. However, the club was unable to begin the season because of longstanding financial difficulties, and was expelled from the Football League on 27 August 2019.

In November 2020, the club was placed into administration. In February 2022, Bury fans&#x27; group Est.1885 completed the purchase of Gigg Lane from the administrator and announced that they had acquired the trading name, history and memorabilia of Bury FC. After the sale was completed, efforts began to bring professional football back to Bury. In October 2022 supporters were urged to vote in a poll regarding a potential amalgamation of the Bury Football Club Supporters&#x27; Society (who owned Gigg Lane and the &quot;Bury FC&quot; trading name) and the Shakers Community Society (who owned phoenix club Bury AFC). The proposals initially failed to reach the required 66% threshold from both societies, but, on 5 May 2023, the merger of both societies was approved following a second poll. Bury AFC adopted the Bury FC playing name ahead of the 2023–24 season and returned to Gigg Lane, following FA approval on 5 June 2023. Upon merging, the two team&#x27;s histories were combined — retroactively counting Bury AFC&#x27;s seasons as seasons for Bury FC.

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1885–1895===
Bury Football Club was founded on 24 April 1885 after Aiden Arrowsmith, a local enthusiast, had brokered two meetings between church teams Bury Wesleyans and Bury Unitarians at the Waggon &amp; Horses Hotel and the Old White Horse Hotel. It was agreed from the outset that the team should be professional. The FA had recently legitimised professionalism but it was still a controversial topic. Ahead of the 1885–86 season, the club leased a plot of land on Gigg Lane from the Earl of Derby&#x27;s estate. On 12 September 1885, the first match played there was a friendly against a team from Wigan and Bury won 4–3.

The club first entered the FA Cup in 1887–88 and were drawn to play Blackburn Rovers away from home in the first round. They travelled to Ewood Park but scratched before the game. The two teams played a friendly match instead, which Bury lost heavily by 10–0. Some sources, including the Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF), have recorded the friendly as a first-round FA Cup tie. The Football Association, however, lists the result as a walkover by Blackburn, recognising that Bury withdrew from the competition. This is confirmed by the &quot;Lancashire Evening Post&#x27;s&quot; evening edition of the same day, which reported that &quot;Bury scratched before the match, and played an ordinary game&quot;. Bury FC do not include the tie in their complete FA Cup record.
Bury were founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889, finishing as runners-up in the inaugural 1889–90 competition. They won the championship the next two seasons. In 1891–92, Bury were Lancashire Cup winners for the first time, and they have won this competition a total of eleven times, most recently in 2017–18. The club&#x27;s nickname—&quot;The Shakers&quot;—was first used at the 1892 Lancashire Cup final against Blackburn Rovers. Before the match, J. T. Ingham, the club&#x27;s chairman manager, reportedly inspired the players by saying: &quot;We shall shake &#x27;em! In fact, we are the Shakers&quot;. His words were popularised by the media and the club subsequently adopted the term as their official nickname. Also in 1891–92, Bury contested an FA Cup tie for the first time when they defeated Witton and Heywood Central before losing to Blackpool after a replay in the third qualifying round.

In 1894, the club was elected to the Football League. In their first season, 1894–95, they won the Second Division title by a nine-point margin and beat Liverpool, the First Division&#x27;s bottom club, in the test match to gain promotion.

===Top-flight status and FA Cup victories: 1895–1929===
Bury retained their top-flight status for seventeen seasons until they were relegated to the Second Division after the 1911–12 season (they finished in the relegation positions in the 1904–05 season but avoided relegation when the capacity of Division One was increased from eighteen to twenty clubs). In 1900 and 1903, Bury won the FA Cup, scoring ten goals in the two finals without conceding any.

In the 1900 final, they beat Southern League team Southampton 4–0. Bury&#x27;s run to the final was remarkable in that they were drawn away from home in every round but won through with victories over Burnley, Notts County, cup holders Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest. The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1–1 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at Bramall Lane in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. Charlie Sagar pulled one back after 55 minutes and then Jasper McLuckie equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play. The final at the old Crystal Palace ground was played in a heatwave and Bury, captained by Jack Pray, dominated from the start. The goals in a one-sided match were scored by McLuckie (2), Willie Wood and Jack Plant. The players were on a win bonus of £10 each in the final, ten times more than their usual £1 per match bonus.

Three years later, Bury did not concede a goal in any round. En route to the final against Derby County, Bury defeated Wolverhampton Wanderers, Sheffield United, Notts County and Aston Villa. As in 1900, the final was played at the old Crystal Palace ground in south London. A crowd of 63,102 attended. As the two teams wore identical kits, agreement on colours for the day was necessary and they both changed with Bury wearing Cambridge blue shirts and navy shorts while Derby chose red shirts and black shorts.

Six of Bury&#x27;s 1900 finalists were in the 1903 team, led by skipper George Ross who scored the opening goal after 20 minutes. Derby&#x27;s keeper Jack Fryer played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury&#x27;s second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. Joe Leeming scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and Jack Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty. Bury&#x27;s 6–0 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score. The ball used in the 1903 final is on display at the National Football Museum.

Until 1907, the team was always managed by one or more committee members. Club secretary Harry Spencer Hamer is believed to have been in charge of the team in both the 1900 and 1903 FA Cup finals, but he was never formally appointed team manager. The first specialist team manager was goalkeeper Archie Montgomery who was appointed on 1 February 1907. He was in charge when the team were relegated in 1912 and stayed on until 30 April 1915 when he was dismissed because of the club&#x27;s lack of income in wartime. The club had a windfall in 1922 when Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unexpectedly gifted them with the freehold of Gigg Lane. The team returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in 1924 and achieved their highest-ever league position, fourth, in 1925–26. Bury have not played in the top flight since relegation back to the Second Division in 1929.

===Football in the Second and Third Division: 1929–1969===

Striving to recover First Division status, Bury had four top six finishes in Division Two in the 1930s. The closest that they have ever come to a top flight return was in 1936–37 when they finished third (only the first two teams were promoted).

With first-class league and cup football suspended for the duration of World War II, regional wartime competitions were organised in which Bury took part. Like all other clubs, they often relied on guest players because of service calls. There were ten regional leagues in 1939–40 and Bury were in the North West League, finishing as champions. The team were unbeaten in a sequence of 16 matches from October to February. On 30 December 1939, they played a friendly against Stoke City which resulted in a 7–6 win for Bury.

Bury were close to relegation from the Second Division several times after the war. They finally dropped into the Third Division North for the first time in 1957. 1957–58 was that division&#x27;s last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national Third and Fourth Divisions.

Under manager Dave Russell, a young Bury team were Third Division champions in 1960–61. They spent seven of the next eight seasons back in the Second Division with a best position of eighth in 1962–63. In the 1962–63 Football League Cup, they reached the semi-final but lost 4–3 on aggregate to eventual winners Birmingham City. For three seasons from 1963, Bury&#x27;s best player was the future England midfielder Colin Bell, who was team captain while still a teenager. He transferred to Manchester City in 1966 and Bury were relegated the following season. They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.

===Fourth-tier debut and return to the second tier: 1969–2000===
In 1971, relegation from Division Three took Bury into the Fourth Division for the first time. They gained promotion in 1974 and spent six seasons in the Third Division before the next relegation. The club celebrated its centenary in 1985 by gaining promotion back to the Third Division.

Bury came close to promotion from the Third Division in both 1990 and 1991 when they finished fifth and seventh respectively to qualify for the play-offs. They were eliminated at the semi-final stage in both play-offs, losing 2–0 on aggregate to Tranmere Rovers in 1990 and 2–1 on aggregate to neighbours Bolton Wanderers in 1991. Relegation followed in 1992 and then Bury qualified for the fourth-tier play-off in 1993 by finishing seventh but, yet again, lost their semi-final tie by going down 1–0 on aggregate to York City. Bury were back in the play-offs again in 1995 after finishing fourth. This time, they won their semi-final by beating Preston North End 2–0 on aggregate and so went to Wembley for the final, where they lost 2–0 to Chesterfield.

The club then enjoyed a resurgence under manager Stan Ternent who engineered two successive promotions in the mid-1990s. In 1996, third place in what was now the fourth-tier Division Three, followed by the third-tier Division Two title in 1996–97, brought Bury back to the second tier for the first time in 30 years. They went back to the third tier on the last day of the 1998–99 season on the basis of having a lower goals scored total than Port Vale, the League having decided to use this metric rather than goal difference as its tie-breaker. Bury&#x27;s goal difference was higher than that of Port Vale, and the League reinstated goal difference as the tie-breaker for the following season.

===Return to the lower divisions: 2001–2019===
In 2001–02, financial problems caused by the collapse of ITV Digital brought the club into administration and to the brink of folding. A supporters&#x27; campaign raised enough money to keep the club afloat, and in recognition of his role within that process, UEFA presented club press officer Gordon Sorfleet with their Best Supporter award for 2001–02. Bury were relegated to fourth-tier Division Three at the end of that season. They finished seventh in 2003 and qualified for the play-offs but, yet again, their semi-final hoodoo struck and they were beaten 3–1 on aggregate by Bournemouth.

In May 2005, Bury became the first (and to date the only) football club to score a thousand goals in each of the top four tiers of the English football league. A year later, in December 2006, the club was expelled from the FA Cup after they were found to have fielded an ineligible player in a second-round replay win against Chester City. In addition to that debacle, the team&#x27;s 2006–07 league form was poor and they eventually finished in 21st place, the club&#x27;s lowest-ever position, narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League.

In the 2008–09 season, newly appointed manager Alan Knill, led the team to a fourth-place finish, missing automatic promotion by a single goal; in the play-off semi-final, Bury were beaten on penalties by Shrewsbury Town after a 1–1 aggregate draw. Towards the end of the 2010–11 season, with the team chasing promotion, Knill left the club for Scunthorpe United. Youth team manager Richie Barker took over as caretaker manager and secured the club&#x27;s promotion to League One, the team finishing second.

In December 2012, Bury were placed under a transfer embargo after falling into financial difficulty as a result of poor attendance figures, and ended up being relegated at the end of the season. Property investor Stewart Day became chairman of the club in May 2013 and later that year he noted that £1.5 million had been invested in the club, mostly to pay off debt. Bury finished the 2014–15 League Two season in third place with a club-record points haul of 85 and earned promotion back to third-tier League One, where they spent the next three seasons. The team finished bottom of the 2017–18 EFL League One table and returned to League Two for the second time in five seasons.

In May 2018, the former Bury striker Ryan Lowe was appointed first-team manager on a two-year contract, having been caretaker-manager twice during 2017–18 after two other managers were sacked. In June 2018, Lee Dykes became the club&#x27;s first sporting director and introduced a youth development strategy designed to fast-track academy players into the first team at the earliest opportunity. Having three times reached the northern semi-final stage of the EFL Trophy in its earlier incarnations, Bury in the 2018–19 tournament advanced to the national semi-final where they lost 3–0 at home to Portsmouth. The team had a good season in League Two and, during the winter months, went 14 successive matches unbeaten before winning promotion to League One after a 1–1 draw at Tranmere Rovers on 30 April.

=== Financial crisis and EFL expulsion: 2019 ===

Businessman Steve Dale bought the club from Stewart Day for £1 in December 2018 and, in February 2019, paid an outstanding tax bill to avoid a HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) winding-up order. However, financial problems resurfaced on 2 April after staff and players did not receive their March salaries on time. On 10 April, former head coach Chris Brass, claiming to be a creditor of the club, issued a winding-up petition to be heard in the High Court. The winding-up petition was adjourned until 15 May (after the end of the league season). In addition to Brass&#x27;s claim, HMRC was claiming approximately £277,000.

On 25 April, Dale said the club&#x27;s financial problems were &quot;far in excess&quot; of what he understood when he took over, and placed the club on the open market. Around £1.6m was needed to pay wages, HMRC and pensions to the end of May, with only £180,000 income expected during that period. On 19 June, a High Court hearing on the winding-up petition was adjourned until 31 July, to allow additional time for a potential sale.

To secure the club&#x27;s future, Dale proposed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to ensure payment of the club&#x27;s football creditors in full while unsecured creditors, including HMRC, would receive 25% of monies owed. That was approved by creditors on 18 July. As a result, the winding-up petition was dismissed by the High Court on 31 July.

Bury&#x27;s preparation for the new season was further impacted by the loss of manager Ryan Lowe and several members of the first-team squad.

On 25 July, the EFL sought further details on how Bury would satisfy the CVA; without proof of the club&#x27;s financial viability, Bury could be expelled from the EFL. Satisfactory proof was not provided, and on 29 July the club&#x27;s opening league match of the season was suspended, as were four further league games. 

On 8 August, Bury was given 14 days to provide the EFL with a plan to pay off outstanding creditors. On 12 August, Dale said he would consider selling the club after staff &#x27;implored&#x27; him to accept a newly received offer to buy the club, but, on 20 August, he rejected a deal that would have secured the survival of the club, believing he could get a better offer. Bury North MP James Frith wrote to EFL chair Debbie Jevans asking for the expulsion deadline to be extended; Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, also requested an extension. On 22 August, the EFL gave an extra 48 hours to avoid expulsion after it emerged that four parties were interested in a takeover. Late on 23 August, Dale was said to have agreed a sale to analytics company C&amp;N Sporting Risk. The following morning, an EFL board meeting gave Bury 27 August to complete the sale, though Jevans later said a further short extension might be granted if the sale was very close to conclusion. Shortly before the deadline, however, C&amp;N Sporting Risk pulled out of the deal saying it was &quot;unable to proceed&quot;.

On 27 August, the EFL announced that Bury&#x27;s membership of the league had been withdrawn. Bury were the first club to be expelled from the Football League since Maidstone United in 1992. After the expulsion, it emerged that a late bid from a Brazilian-backed potential buyer had been rejected. The Insolvency Practitioners Association said it would investigate Bury&#x27;s CVA over allegations that Dale had tried to engineer a payout to a newly formed company, RCR Holdings, run by his daughter&#x27;s partner, and 140 youth players were released by Bury&#x27;s academy.

====Aftermath to expulsion====
On 30 August, Bury was &quot;actively considering&quot; legal action against the EFL over its expulsion. After local MP James Frith said he would propose that the EFL reinstate Bury in League Two in 2020–21, the EFL said it would consult member clubs. The EFL also announced an independent review of EFL regulations concerning the financial sustainability of member clubs, which in February 2020 concluded that any additional EFL action &quot;would not have made any difference to the eventual outcome&quot; – &quot;a lack of owner funding&quot; ultimately caused Bury&#x27;s demise, exacerbated by excessive wages paid to players under Day&#x27;s chairmanship. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police confirmed it was investigating a fraud allegation made in June 2019 in relation to Bury&#x27;s finances. The Frith-led working group&#x27;s proposal to admit Bury to League Two (backed by the Bury FC Supporters&#x27; Trust, Bury South MP Ivan Lewis, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and Bury Metropolitan Borough Council) was sent to the EFL on 20 September, but was rejected at a meeting of the EFL&#x27;s remaining 71 member clubs on 26 September. Following the EFL ruling, the working group suggested that Bury apply for a place in the National League in 2020–21, subject to ownership and financial issues being resolved.

Another winding-up petition was brought before the High Court by HMRC on 16 October 2019. It was adjourned for 14 days to allow the club more time to settle with small business creditors. Everton chairman Bill Kenwright attempted to give Bury £1m to help save the club, but this was disallowed under EFL conflict of interest rules. On 30 October, the petition adjournment was extended for another 35 days to 4 December after the club argued that it had continued to automatically pay taxes on unpaid wages. The judge agreed that an extension was necessary for HMRC to establish if the club had overpaid. On 4 December, the club was granted a further extension until 18 December with HMRC ordered to process the club&#x27;s returns and ascertain the exact amount still owed. When the High Court reconvened, this winding-up petition was dismissed; HMRC said an unspecified debt had been paid.

Whilst the formation of the fan-owned phoenix club was underway, Bury FC owner Steve Dale continued to fight administration and for a return to the football pyramid. On 31 January 2020, the club was in danger of liquidation as Dale had failed to pay any money to creditors under the terms of the July 2019 CVA. Dale had to pay at least £2m by 11 February or the CVA would be ended; debts totalling around £5m would become immediately due, with creditors able to petition for the club to be wound up. On 14 February, Dale was reported to have defaulted on the plan to settle outstanding debts, casting fresh doubt over Bury&#x27;s future, and making liquidation more likely. A month later, on 16 March 2020, Dale was reported to be seeking a new CVA; this followed a formal notice that the previous CVA had been terminated on 9 March. The supervisor of that initial CVA, Steven Wiseglass, warned that if no new CVA is agreed by 1 April, he would seek to wind-up the club and appoint a liquidator. The consortium attempt to complete a solvent takeover of the club fell through at the end of March. In late April, Dale was reported to have spent £250,000 in appointing a QC to lead a legal claim for damages against the EFL, and to have applied to the FA for a place in the National League or National League North (tiers five or six) in the 2020–21 season. However, on 7 August, the application was rejected by the FA, who cited the club&#x27;s &quot;financial resources, ownership and insolvency status&quot;; the club said it planned to submit an application for the 2021–22 season, but none was sent.

On 30 August 2020, 12 months after the club&#x27;s EFL expulsion, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; said: &quot;Bury FC still exists, though, if only on paper. With no players, no league to play in, and no employees to speak of, it is little more than a hollow shell of the club fans knew and loved.&quot; The MEN report said that the club &quot;continues to limp on&quot; but its future was uncertain and the danger of liquidation remained, though most fans still hoped for an eventual resurrection. Meanwhile, Dale began making statements on the club website, branding the fan-owned Bury AFC as &quot;fake&quot;.

On 27 November 2020, Dale finally placed the club into administration, with Wiseglass appointed administrator. In January 2021, a Nottinghamshire-based businessman and investor in Ilkeston Town, David Hilton, was reported to be interested in buying Bury FC, which was said to have debts of over £15 million.

In May 2021, the club&#x27;s Gigg Lane ground was put up for sale by the administrator. In June, Wiseglass said he had received two ultimately unsuccessful offers to buy the club, and that a deadline of 5 August had been set for bids to buy Gigg Lane. He also confirmed, in an update to the administration records filed at Companies House, that the club&#x27;s total liability amounted to £12,545,559. On 26 August, Wiseglass said offers had been received from several &#x27;interested parties&#x27;, with a fans-backed group, Est.1885, among the bidders to buy the ground and club. Supported by local MPs James Daly and Christian Wakeford and by Bury MBC, the Est.1885 bid was backed by an &quot;anonymous benefactor willing to bankroll ambitions for a fans-led club&quot;. On 22 October, the administrators confirmed that Est.1885 had been given exclusivity to buy both the club and Gigg Lane. The benefactor was English-born but now California-based businessman Peter Alexander, a lifelong Shakers fan who also wanted to reconcile any differences with Bury AFC. On 23 December 2021, the UK Government, through the Community Ownership Fund run by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, pledged £1m towards the bid to buy back Gigg Lane.

In November 2021, a court order was made extending the period of administration of The Bury Football Club Company Ltd to 27 May 2023 to allow time for the administrator to complete the sale of the stadium and to conclude investigations into the club&#x27;s financial affairs and the actions of its current and former directors and officers.

On 7 January 2022, Est.1885 said contracts had been exchanged on a deal to buy the stadium, the club&#x27;s trading name and memorabilia, with plans to resume competitive football in August 2022. On 13 January, Bury MBC agreed a financial contribution of up to £450,000 towards the costs of recommissioning Gigg Lane (this was later made conditional on a successful merger with Bury AFC).

On 18 February 2022, Est.1885 completed the purchase of Gigg Lane from the administrator and announced the acquisition of the club&#x27;s trading name, history and memorabilia. Est.1885 had been assisted by the Forever Bury supporters&#x27; group and said they would soon announce &quot;the rebranding and future role of Forever Bury and the transition of Est.1885&quot;. The statement also declared commitment towards &quot;finding a consensual path with Bury AFC&quot;. Matt Pickup of Est.1885 said all parties had set a target of football returning to Gigg Lane by August 2022, in time for the 2022–23 season.

On 21 February 2022, it was confirmed that the owner of Gigg Lane – and of the Bury FC trading name – was the newly formed Gigg Lane Stadium Limited, a company limited by guarantee whose members were Gigg Lane Propco Limited and Bury Football Club Supporters&#x27; Society Limited, a registered society. This meant that, when a Bury FC team played at Gigg Lane in future, it would represent Gigg Lane Stadium Limited. Meanwhile, the original club incorporated in 1885 – The Bury Football Club Company Ltd – remained in administration under the ownership of Steve Dale (its name was changed to CCFB Realisations 2022 Limited in April 2022 so that the new owner of the trading name could assume the original name; Dale was declared bankrupt in July 2022; Stewart Day was also declared bankrupt, in October 2022; and CCFB Realisations 2022 Limited was eventually dissolved in February 2025).

A Bury FC Supporters Society statement on 15 March 2022 said that the club&#x27;s application to join the Northern Premier League had been rejected. While the FA and Bury MBC favoured a merger with Bury AFC (promoted to the NWCFL Premier Division on 26 March 2022), the statement recognised there were conflicting loyalties: &quot;There are many supporters who have followed Bury AFC who are emotionally invested in the team and enjoying the success. We also have a significant number of supporters who did not choose this path and their feelings have to be seriously considered to avoid division and alienation.&quot; There were also FA restrictions about using the Bury FC name as football creditors to the old regime had not been paid.

=== Bury AFC: 2019–2023 ===
Although Bury FC were yet to enter administration and still continued to exist as a dormant club, in December 2019, a group of supporters resolved to form a phoenix club which they named Bury Association Football Club (Bury AFC). Some 300 Bury FC fans came forward to help and they formed a company registered as Bury Football Club (2019) Ltd (trading as Bury AFC). The club was fan-owned on the basis of one member one vote.

The new club immediately applied to the North West Counties Football League, the tenth tier of the English football league system, for membership in the 2020–21 season which was approved. 

The 2020–21 season was the club&#x27;s inaugural season. The FA Vase tie, played on 19 September, was the team&#x27;s first competitive game, but they lost 2–1. The season was suspended in December due to COVID-19 restrictions, and was subsequently abandoned on 24 February 2021.

In the 2021–22 season, Bury AFC played in the North West Counties Football League Division One North. On 27 March 2022, before a crowd of over 1,800 people, a 4–0 home victory over St Helens Town secured the club&#x27;s promotion to the NWCFL Premier Division as divisional champions. They finished the following season in 4th place on 83 points, four points from a play-off spot.

===Merger===
In May 2022, the Bury FC Supporters Society signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding the future of the club. Other signatories included Bury MBC, the Football Supporters&#x27; Association, Greater Manchester Combined Authority, Shakers Community Society on behalf of Bury AFC, and The Bury Football Club Company Ltd. In July 2022, Bury fans were asked to back a merger of the two principal supporters&#x27; groups (BFCSS and the Shakers Community Society) to bring Bury FC back to its &quot;spiritual home with wider benefits for the whole community&quot;. 

In October 2022, local football supporters were urged to vote in a poll, facilitated by the Football Supporters&#x27; Association, regarding a potential amalgamation of BFCSS (who owned Gigg Lane and the Bury FC name) and the Shakers Community Society (who owned the separate phoenix club, Bury AFC). Warned by the FSA that there was no &quot;viable and sustainable alternative to the merger&quot;, the two groups both recommended their members to vote in favour. However, amid continuing tensions between the two groups, the proposals failed to reach the required 66% threshold from both societies; the Shakers Community Society voted 94% in favour while the BFCSS vote in favour fell short, at 63%. In late January 2023, it was reported that BFCSS had submitted a detailed proposal to the North West Counties Football League (NWCFL) to restart a professional football club at Gigg Lane, though some of the claims were disputed by the Shakers group. 

The second merger vote was announced on 5 May 2023; members of both Bury FC and Bury AFC voted to merge the two clubs. On 5 June 2023, the club said that the FA had confirmed that the name &quot;Bury Football Club&quot; could be used in competition for the first time since August 2019, with the club competing in the Premier Division of the North West Counties League, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid.

===North West Counties League (2023–present)===
On 17 September 2023, after a run of form that saw two wins in eight games, Bury sacked manager Andy Welsh, who was succeeded by Dave McNabb. After finishing third in the league, in May 2024, Bury were beaten by Wythenshawe Town in the Premier Division play-off final via a penalty shoot-out, missing out on promotion.

==Colours and crest==
The club&#x27;s colours have been white and either navy blue or royal blue. Originally, the team wore a half sky blue half chocolate brown shirt before soon changing to a striped shirt with blue shorts, but the stripes were replaced by the long-established all-white shirt before the club joined the Football League in 1894. There was an exception in the 1962–63 season when a mistake was made by the club&#x27;s kit suppliers, who sent a consignment of royal blue shorts before the season instead of the usual navy blue. Then manager Bob Stokoe said the club could have sent them back but decided simply to keep them for the season; he joked that royal blue &quot;would tone with the Gigg Lane paintwork.&quot;

Despite playing in white shorts in the first two years of the club&#x27;s history, blue has been the predominant colour of this part of Bury&#x27;s kit since 1888. Navy was the colour from 1888 through to 1962. From then until 1986 the team wore royal blue, before the switch was made to a darker shade which lasted until 1994 when royal blue was reintroduced. Barring the 2009–10 125th anniversary season and the 2014–15 promotion season when white was the adopted colour, royal blue remained the colour of the team&#x27;s shorts until its last season in the Football League, when navy blue was chosen again.

The crest on the shirt is a representation of the coat of arms granted to the former County Borough of Bury by the College of Arms on 28 February 1877. This depicts the town&#x27;s industrial heritage with images in the shield of an anvil, a fleece, shuttles and a papyrus plant which respectively represent forging, wool, cotton and paper. It bears the inscription &quot;Vincit Omnia Industria&quot; (work conquers all).

==Stadium==
Bury have played at Gigg Lane since 1885 when they rented the plot from the Earl of Derby&#x27;s estate soon after the club&#x27;s foundation. The first Football League match played there was on 8 September 1894 when Bury defeated Manchester City 4–2. A floodlit match took place in 1889 but there were no permanent lights until 1953. Until the 1990s when a complete rebuild became necessary, the capacity of the ground was 35,000. That total was achieved when Bury hosted an FA Cup third-round tie against neighbouring Bolton Wanderers on 9 January 1960. The game ended 1–1, but Bury lost the replay 4–2 after extra time.

Gigg Lane was rebuilt in the 1990s and now has a capacity of 12,500, all seated and covered. The Main Stand, also called the Family Stand, is on the northern side and houses the club offices and dressing rooms. At the western end, the Manchester Road End houses away supporters. The South Stand (also known as the Les Hart Stand) is opposite the Main Stand and adjoins the Cemetery End, left (east) of the Main Stand. The Cemetery End was the last part of the rebuilt stadium to be completed, in 1999.

In August 2019, when Bury FC was expelled from the EFL, Gigg Lane was officially known for sponsorship purposes as the Planet-U Energy Stadium, and it was completely powered by renewable energy provided by the sponsors. Previous deals had seen the ground named the JD Stadium, and the Energy Check Stadium.

In 2020, when Bury F.C. and Bury AFC were considered separate teams, there was no possibility of Bury AFC playing its matches at Gigg Lane, and a groundshare was agreed with Radcliffe FC for the 2020–21 NWCFL season, so the team&#x27;s home venue was the 4,000 capacity Stainton Park in Radcliffe, about 2.5 miles (4 km) south-west of Bury. Bury AFC enquired about renting Gigg Lane but the request was rejected on 5 April 2022 as &quot;not feasible&quot; by the Bury FC Supporters Society who cited commercial risks and imbalances that could jeopardise a future merger with Bury AFC. In March 2023, Bury AFC temporarily agreed to play their final home fixtures at Mossley&#x27;s Seel Park due to poor ground conditions at Radcliffe caused by bad weather and additional fixtures.

On 8 July 2023, Bury FC played their first game back at Gigg Lane in a pre-season friendly against Bradford City, which Bradford won 6–0.

==Managerial history==

The club was founded in 1885 but there is no record of anyone managing the team until Tom Hargreaves, who was a committee member, in 1890. One or more committee members took team responsibility until the appointment of erstwhile goalkeeper Archie Montgomery in 1907 as the first specialist team manager. Montgomery was dismissed during World War One for financial reasons but the first manager to be sacked for poor results was James Hunter-Thompson in February 1927, even though his team had achieved the club&#x27;s highest-ever league position, finishing fourth in 1925–26.

Norman Bullock, who was the club&#x27;s then-record goalscorer, took over in December 1935 but went to Chesterfield in June 1938. After the Second World War, Bullock returned to Bury until November 1949 when he went to Leicester City. The club&#x27;s longest-serving manager has been Dave Russell for eight years from December 1953 to December 1961. The highlight of his career was winning the Third Division championship in 1960–61. Bob Stokoe was team manager twice between 1961 and 1978. In the early 1970s, Allan Brown held the post for eighteen months before moving to Nottingham Forest where, until 3 January 1975, he was Brian Clough&#x27;s predecessor.

With Bury consigned to the lower leagues from the 1970s onwards, there have been several sackings as successive managers were unable to
regain Second Division status. A measure of success was finally achieved in the late 1990s when Stan Ternent inspired the team to successive promotions from fourth tier to third in 1995–96 and, as champions, from third to second in 1996–97. He left in 1998 to take over at Burnley and, a couple of seasons later, Bury were back in the lower league where they have stayed amid worrying financial issues. The club had a disastrous season in 2017–18 when the team finished bottom of League One and two managers were sacked. The club&#x27;s former striker Ryan Lowe took full charge in May 2018, having twice been caretaker in 2017–18, before leaving in June 2019 to join Plymouth Argyle. On 2 July 2019, Paul Wilkinson was appointed as manager, but managed no first team games due to the club&#x27;s EFL expulsion the following month.

==Bury FC Women==
As women&#x27;s football developed in the 1990s, Bury became one of several professional clubs to establish a ladies&#x27; team or to accept an existing one as an affiliate. Bury FC Women, also known as the Bury FC Foundation Women&#x27;s Team, was founded in 1996. They were founder members of the North West Women&#x27;s Regional Football League (NWWRFL) Premier Division in 2003–04. They played in the NWWFRL for 16 seasons. In the 2018–19 season, they won the Division One North championship, earning promotion back to the Premier Division, which is now the fifth tier of the women&#x27;s football pyramid. After Bury FC collapsed, the ladies&#x27; team lost many of its players and had to rely on charitable funding. They managed to stay afloat but were obliged to seek membership of a lower league.

The ladies&#x27; team played numerous matches at Gigg Lane until 2019. After its closure that year, their home venue was the Goshen Sports Centre on Tennyson Avenue in Bury. On Sunday, 24 April 2022, they returned to Gigg Lane for a Lancashire FA Women&#x27;s County League match against Fleetwood Town Wrens. This was the first match of any kind to be played there since May 2019. Bury FC Women won 3–0 (1–0 at half-time) before a crowd of almost 500, the goalscorers being Lucy Golding, Kimberley Tyson and Sophie Coates.

In the 2021–22 season, Bury FC Women were managed by Colin Platt and played in the eighth tier Championship Division of the Lancashire FA Women&#x27;s County League. On 15 May 2022, they won the division title by defeating second-placed Clitheroe Wolves Ladies 2–0 at Gigg Lane, both goals scored by Kimberley Tyson. The match attracted a crowd of 655, a ground record for a ladies&#x27; match. Two days later, the Bury FC Supporters Society announced that a Service Level Agreement would ensure Bury FC Women&#x27;s future home fixtures would be played at Gigg Lane.

==Support==
The club has a supporters group called Forever Bury, founded in 2002, who strive to help the club face its financial difficulties. In 2019, they ran a campaign called &quot;Help Save Our Club&quot;. Bury have had a club mascot operating on the sidelines since 1997. The first, named after Robert Peel, was &quot;Robbie the Bobby&quot;, a cartoon policeman whose antics embarrassed the club when he was sent off the field by referees three times in 2001 for bad behaviour – one of a number of incidents involving mascots that led to a Football League review of mascot behaviour. He was retired in 2018 to be replaced by a cartoon police dog. The club explained that &quot;police dogs are key members of the force and are something the younger supporters can relate to&quot;. Following a children&#x27;s naming competition, the new mascot was named &quot;Peeler&quot; to maintain the link with Peel and he made his debut in the home match against Yeovil Town on 4 August 2018.

==Rivalries==
Bury&#x27;s ground is near to several other Football League clubs and so, in any season, they were likely to play at least one &quot;derby&quot; match (e.g., Oldham Athletic in 2018–19 and Rochdale in 2008–2009). Traditionally, Bury&#x27;s main rivalry has always been with their nearest neighbour Bolton Wanderers. For many seasons from the late 1990s, however, the two clubs rarely met as Bolton were in the Premier League or the Championship while Bury were in the lower divisions. The head-to-head record between them is 30 wins each and 19 draws. In recent years, matches between Bury and Rochdale have been dubbed the &quot;M66 Derby&quot; and their head-to-head record is 26 wins by Bury and 21 wins by Rochdale with 21 draws.

<text>Carlisle United Football Club ( , ) is a professional association football club based in Carlisle, Cumbria, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.

They have played their home games at Brunton Park since 1909. The club&#x27;s traditional kit is blue with white and red detail, whilst the badge takes elements from the city&#x27;s coat of arms by including two Wyverns. They are nicknamed the &quot;Blues&quot;, due to their kit, as well as the &quot;Cumbrians&quot;. The club is the closest English professional football club to Scotland.

Formed in 1904, the club entered the Lancashire Combination the following year and were crowned Division Two champions in 1906–07. They entered the North Eastern League in 1910 and went on to win the league title in 1921–22, before being elected into the Football League in 1928. They spent the next 30 years in the Third Division North, at which point they were assigned a place in the newly formed Fourth Division, from where they won promotion in 1961–62. Relegated the following season, they then won two consecutive promotions, finishing the 1964–65 season as champions of the Third Division under the stewardship of Alan Ashman. They secured promotion out of the Second Division in 1973–74, but stayed only one season in the First Division and were relegated back to the Third Division at the end of the 1976–77 campaign. Promoted again under Bob Stokoe in 1981–82, they suffered successive relegations to return to the fourth tier by 1987.

Carlisle won promotion as champions of the fourth tier in 1994–95, but were relegated the next season, before winning promotion again in 1996–97, only to be relegated again the following year. Their 76-year stay in the Football League came to an end with relegation in 2003–04, though player-manager Paul Simpson secured an immediate return after leading United to victory in the 2005 Conference National play-off final. They then won the League Two title in 2005–06 and they remained in League One until their relegation at the end of the 2013–14 season, being promoted back to the third tier nine years later after beating Stockport County in the 2023 play-off final. The club has reached the final of the Football League Trophy six times, more than any other team, winning it in 1997 and 2011, and finishing as runners-up in 1995, 2003, 2006 and 2010.

In November 2023, it was reported that Castle Sports Group became the club&#x27;s owner.

==History==
===1896–1904: Shaddongate United===
Shaddongate United F.C. are first reported in 1896 as the winners of the Carlisle Association Charity Shield and are recorded as playing at Willow Holme in the Shaddongate area of the city, now an industrial estate, and wearing blue and gold stripes. At the time Carlisle Red Rose and Carlisle AFC were the pre-eminent clubs in Carlisle but the new club quickly gained a following and by the time Carlisle AFC folded in 1899 they were considered a force to be reckoned with. By 1903 they had overtaken Red Rose and were further cemented as the city&#x27;s biggest club when Red Rose&#x27;s entire team were banned for four months by the Cumberland Football Association for taking part in a Scottish amateur tournament in contravention of league rules.

A myth has persisted that Shaddongate and Red Rose had merged to form Carlisle United and this likely led the club to adopt 1904 as their official date of foundation, though Red Rose continued until 1906 at which point they folded. Only in 2017 did more information about the early part of their history come to light.
===1904–1928: Carlisle United===
On 17 May 1904 at Shaddongate United&#x27;s annual general meeting the club&#x27;s members voted to change the team&#x27;s name to Carlisle United at a heated meeting in Caldewgate, and it wasn&#x27;t without its detractors. In fact, a breakaway group decided that Shaddongate United should live on and they continued to play under that name. However, they didn&#x27;t have much of a local impact and their exploits have also been lost in the fullness of time.. The initial idea having been proposed by Newcastle United officials who felt it would aid them when applying to regional football leagues if they represented the entire city. At the time they played at Milhome Bank and later at Devonshire Park, finally settling at their current home Brunton Park in 1909. The first ever recorded fixture that United played was on 1 September 1904 when they entertained Victoria Wanderers, another Carlisle based side, in a friendly. Wanderers would go on to win the game, played at Millholme Bank, 2–1 and, unfortunately, the scorer of that historic goal has been lost to history with his name never having been recorded.

The first ever Saturday match for Carlisle United was on 3 September 1904, and it ended in victory with a 3–1 win over Hexham. Seven days later it was Maxwelltown, just across the border, who played host in a thrilling 3–3 draw that saw both sides take and lose the lead. A final nail in the coffin for Shaddongate came when the new Carlisle United entered the Cumberland Senior League. The division had just the six teams (including fierce rivals Carlisle Red Rose) and it was to be the Roses who would inflict a first league defeat on United when they beat them 2–0 at Boundary Road. Revenge would be gained a month later when United went to the Roses ground at Maryport Cottages and beat them 2–1 in another nip and tuck match.

It was in this 1904–05 season that Carlisle United entered the FA Cup for the first time. They were drawn to play against Workington who were, at that time, the top side in Cumbria. In fact, so good were they that they comfortably held their own in the Lancashire Combination League. The cup game ended in a 2–2 draw with the West Cumbrians running out as 3–1 winners in the replay. In the Cumberland Cup United started by knocking out Frizington White Star, followed by Workington and then Keswick in the semi-final. The final, played on the Warwick Road ground, brought United and Red Rose together again, and it was the newer of the two sides who would come out on top. The 2–0 win not only handed them the Cumberland Cup, but also confirmed them as the first side to ever achieve the League and Cup double.

The remainder of the season for United was a series of friendly matches against the likes of Accrington, Darlington and Newcastle United. On Good Friday 1905 club officials pulled off a real coup when they managed to persuade Glasgow Rangers to come to the city for a game. The match was played at Warwick Road in front of a healthy crowd of 3,000, but the Gers won 2–1. Having won both the Cumberland Senior League and the Cumberland Cup in their inaugural season and been very impressed with what they had seen and heard of the Lancashire Combination League, United went in search of approval for admittance on 3 May 1905. After a two-week wait the request was rubber stamped and, along with Burnley, Bolton and Lancaster, United stepped up to a higher level of football, successfully applying to be admitted to the Second Division of the Lancashire Combination but were only admitted after agreeing to pay all visiting teams’ travel expenses for two years, due to Carlisle not being located in Lancashire. It was though a bold step for the Carlisle club who had to agree to pay the train fares for the visiting team for two seasons as well as providing them with a tea. The success of 1904–05 had resulted in the club&#x27;s bank balance increasing from £24 to £90 despite the outlay of £52 on player&#x27;s wages, an early sign of professionalism in the ranks. Yet this balance and more was needed to develop a new and better ground at Devonshire Park, situated off Lismore Place and Catholic Lane. A new stand seating 800 was erected and banking erected all around the playing area. The aim, as it was reported to the club&#x27;s AGM, was to improve the game in the Border City. The Lancashire Combination had begun life back in 1891 with the Second Division being established in 1903. Though almost entirely composed of clubs in Lancashire, Workington had been admitted in 1904 so United were guaranteed at least one local derby fixture.

The new season&#x27;s preparations also included moves to strengthen the playing staff. Several players were recruited from other local sides, not least Carlisle Red Rose, which had severe financial difficulties. Other players came from further afield including Tom Smith who arrived as both player and trainer from Preston North End, had also played for Tottenham with whom he had won an FA Cup winners medal in 1901. The Lancashire Combination era began on 2 September 1905 at home to St Helens Town. Despite two goals from Smith, the visitors won 3–2. The next game at home to Blackpool Reserves was lost 5–1 and despite a first win at Burnley, Carlisle then crashed 8–1 at Clitheroe in what proved to be almost the worst defeat of the season. Soon afterwards a new goalkeeper, James Scott, was signed from Barnsley and immediately results began to improve. Carlisle were able to sustain a mid table position for most of the season. A rare lapse came on 2 January 1906 when the trip to Brynn Central ended in an 8–0 rout, the biggest defeat of the campaign. The most convincing victory had come a week earlier on Christmas Day 1905 when Hyde St George&#x27;s were thrashed 10–2. Not surprisingly Hyde were to finish bottom of the table although it was reported rather unsurprisingly that they were &#x27;somewhat short of their strongest side&#x27; when they arrived in Carlisle. Despite this fact, a total crowd of 11,310 watched the two home games on Christmas Day and Boxing Day while a further 1,000 were said to have been admitted without paying after forcing their way into the ground.

Carlisle finished the season in 13th place among the 19 teams in the Combination. The campaign ended with four successive home matches, the last of these being the local derby with Workington. Though Carlisle were safely placed in mid table, Workington were near the top and in with a real chance of promotion to Division One. The teams had met a month earlier in Carlisle&#x27;s last away match of the season which saw the Reds win 3–1. The return match at Devonshire Park attracted a gate in excess of 10,000 with receipts of no less than £208 thanks to increased admission prices. The match ended 1–1 and Workington eventually missed promotion by a single point. Financial troubles had caused Carlisle Red Rose to resign from the Cumberland Senior League the previous summer. Fortunately they were later readmitted, playing their home games at the Milholme Bank ground that had just been vacated by United. The two sides were then drawn together in the FA Cup First Preliminary Round. Carlisle United won 3–0 at Devonshire Park before losing at Barrow in the next round. It was not until the end of the season that the city&#x27;s two leading sides met again. By that time Red Rose had won the Cumberland Cup Final, beating Frizington White Star who had just pipped them for the Cumberland League title. On 30 April 1906 United and Red Rose met in a friendly match in aid of the Red Rose club. The result was a 1–1 draw.

After the league reorganised four years later the board at United decided it did not suit the club&#x27;s best interests to be there any longer and the club entered the North Eastern League in place of their reserve team who had previously played in the league and been a founding member. When the Carlisle United first team left to join the Football League the reserve team resumed its place in the competition. Carlisle United were crowned champions of the North Eastern League in 1922.

The 1927–28 season was Carlisle&#x27;s last in the North Eastern League. An excellent home record helped them to second in the table finishing a full 10 points behind champions Sunderland Reserves. The close season meant the usual round of applications to join (and be re-elected to) the Football League. Carlisle went up against Chester, Durham City (applying for re-election), Nelson and York City. On 4 June 1928 a delegation of representatives from Carlisle United took their seats at the Football League meeting in London to hear the results of the vote. Carlisle received the second-most votes with 33, and replaced Durham City, who had received just 11 votes, as members of the Football League.

===1928–1964: Football League===
Carlisle United won their first League fixture Football League Third Division North in August 1928 with the side of Prout, Coulthard, Cook, Harrison, Ross, Pigg, Agar, Hutchison, McConnell, Ward and Watson beating Accrington Stanley 3–2. Their next game a week later was played against Hartlepools United and still stands to this day as their record victory at 8–0, though it was later equalled on Christmas Day 1952 when Scunthorpe were beaten by the same score. Carlisle finished in eighth place in their inaugural campaign which proved to be the best in the pre-war era. In 1934–35 the Club finished bottom of the table and had to seek re-election for the only time.

When the Second World War began in 1939, Carlisle United withdrew from national and regional competitions and only played local football. When the war was over the club returned to the Football League and appointed Ivor Broadis as player-manager, making him the youngest league club manager in history at just 23. He then had the distinction of becoming the first manager to transfer himself when he moved to Sunderland, he continued to live and train in Carlisle. Broadis returned to Carlisle United in 1955 an ex-England international.

In 1949, the club became the first to appoint Bill Shankly as manager. Shankly, a former player at Carlisle, later went on to manage local rivals Workington (helping them finish above Carlisle for the first time) before being appointed as manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide that club to numerous trophy successes. It is at Carlisle where he met local player Geoff Twentyman, who he would later sign as head scout at Liverpool, and lifelong friend Ivor Broadis. Broadis, who was playing for Sunderland but living and training with Carlisle, once arrived late for training and Shankly asserted that he would play by United&#x27;s training rules even if he didn&#x27;t play there. According to Shankly, he said to Broadis: &quot;What do you think you&#x27;re doing? Who do you think you are? If you do the training we do you can train with us and we&#x27;ll play five-a-side and you&#x27;ll run your guts out as an example to everybody else&quot;.

Carlisle were members of the Third Division North until 1958 when it combined with the Third Division South to become the Fourth Division. They remained there until 1962 when they won their first promotion, they were relegated the following season but immediately bounced back to begin the most prosperous period in the club&#x27;s history.

===1964–1985: Golden era===
Upon gaining promotion to the Third Division in 1964 United immediately won the Third Division Championship the following year. In the period which followed Carlisle enjoyed their greatest success outside of cup competitions. Over 12 years the club cemented themselves as a solid Second Division (then the second tier in English football) side. Within that period Carlisle finished seven out of 11 seasons in the top half of the table including third in 66–67, fourth in 70–71 and a third in 73–74 which saw them promoted to the top tier of English football. The end of the 71–72 season also saw Carlisle play their only European competition in the club&#x27;s history, the Anglo-Italian Cup, and in June 1972 they beat A.S. Roma 3–2 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

Playing in the First Division for the 1974–75 season, Carlisle won their first three fixtures (including 1–0 against Tottenham Hotspur before 18,426 spectators) to go top of the English football pyramid, partly due to the likes of Chris Balderstone, scoring the penalty which put them at the top, and Bobby Parker who both went on to make at least 375 league appearances for Carlisle. The success was short lived however, they finished the season in bottom place and were relegated. Highlight victories include doing a double over Everton, and home victories over eventual champions Derby County, and former title holders Ipswich Town, Arsenal, Burnley, Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Bill Shankly, an FA Cup and League Championship winning manager by that time, branded Carlisle&#x27;s climb to the top as &quot;the greatest feat in the history of the game.&quot;

After Carlisle&#x27;s brief taste of life in the First Division, the Club found themselves struggling in Division Two, and another relegation followed in 76–77 returning to the Third Division first time in 13 years.

Their top-flight journey three years earlier had faded into memory and, though a handful of their First Division squad remained, these were not such glorious times for the Cumbrians. It was Bobby Moncur&#x27;s first full season in charge in 1977–78, the Newcastle legend having succeeded reluctant boss Dick Young the previous autumn. Carlisle never managed to hit any sort of winning stride and found their campaign studded with draws. The FA Cup had brought some respite from the mundane, Carlisle encountered Manchester United after a decent spell of winter form. A 1–1 draw at Brunton Park is also remembered for the controversial decision not to award the Blues a second-half penalty, and eventually they bowed out with a 4–2 defeat in the Old Trafford replay. By the spring they had also seen the departure of their most dangerous player: striker Billy Rafferty, who was sold to Wolves. United had replaced him with Portsmouth&#x27;s David Kemp. Carlisle would settle the season with a 13th-placed finish.

After another campaign in the Third Division finishing sixth place in the 1978–79 season. Carlisle went into the start of the 1979–80 season struggling for consistency but looked to climb up the divisions with 22-year-old York City striker Gordon Staniforth arriving for £120,000 in October, making him the club&#x27;s most expensive purchase at the time. Staniforth would join Paul Bannon and the emerging Peter Beardsley with a fresh attacking impetus. By the time Sheffield United visited in November in front of a 6,347 crowd they had found a degree of better form, winning 1–0. If these were new beginnings for Staniforth, though, they also proved the start of the end for Moncur. Three months after the Sheffield United win, the boss departed Brunton Park to take the top job at Hearts. That left Martin Harvey in caretaker and subsequently permanent charge as Carlisle finished sixth, the same as the previous season.

The 1980–81 season had started badly, it had been the first calendar year in which United had employed three different managers, Bob Moncur having left for Hearts in February, Martin Harvey steering the ship to September, then Bob Stokoe moving back in for a second spell. Carlisle hit by some key departures including Mike McCartney, Steve Ludlam and the earlier exit of Phil Bonnyman. Carlisle hosted Burnley on Boxing Day in a 3–2 victory after a Gordon Staniforth hat-trick, ending a six-game winless run. Carlisle would avoid the drop into Division Four by just a single point finishing 19th place. Returning manager Bob Stokoe would trigger another revival at the club a year later.

In 1982 Carlisle were again promoted to the Second Division under Stokoe, this time in second place in the table after a 1–0 victory at Chester in their last game of the season. A four-year sojourn in Division Two then followed, including the “nearly” season of 1983–84, when they just missed out on promotion to the top flight once again; after spending the majority of the season in a top three placing with a team including Malcolm Poskett and Tommy Craig they mounted a promotion challenge but finished seventh after a late slump.

===1986–2005: Doldrums===
Carlisle ended their most prosperous period as rapidly as it had started. Back to back relegations saw them drop into the Fourth Division in 1987 for the first time since 1964. Even there, fortunes did not initially start to improve. Attendance slumped to the lowest in the club&#x27;s history and only 1,287 saw the league game against Chester in May 1987 and the introduction of automatic promotion/relegation to the Vauxhall Conference posed a new threat. Carlisle&#x27;s first season in there saw them finish second from bottom but 19 points ahead of relegated Newport County meant no danger of the drop.

Carlisle&#x27;s league form was improved after three awful seasons and they finished 12th in Division Four in 1988–89. They reached the FA Cup third round, where their run was ended by defending league champions and eventual FA Cup winners, Liverpool. Seventeen-year-old defender Steve Harkness was sold to Liverpool at the end of the season and his place in the team was filled by Middlesbrough&#x27;s Paul Proudlock.

Carlisle&#x27;s good progress continued into the new decade, but their play-off hopes were ended on the final day of the season by a 5–2 demolition at the hands of Maidstone United. This was a disappointing end to an encouraging season during which the Cumbrians had topped the 1989–90 Fourth Division on Christmas Day and for a while in January as well before a late slump in form cost them dearly. In the end they missed out on the play-offs due to inferior goal difference.

A promising start to the 1990–91 season suggested that the Cumbrians were finally on their way out of the Fourth Division, but a disastrous second half of the campaign saw them slump to 20th in the final table and cost manager Clive Middlemass his job in March. He was succeeded by Aidan McCaffrey, who was left needing a substantial overhaul to get Carlisle&#x27;s fortunes back on track.

In 1992, Carlisle endured one of the worst seasons in their history as they finished bottom of the Fourth Division, but were lucky because the demise of Aldershot mid-season resulted in no relegation to the Conference taking place that year. A brief respite in Carlisle&#x27;s decline then came when in the summer of 1992 the club was taken over by Michael Knighton, the man who had made headlines in 1989 with his failed takeover bid for Manchester United, who became chairman and chief executive of Carlisle United. Knighton purchased the entire shareholding from the former board of directors, some 75.6% of the club. The next three years saw a dramatic rise in the club&#x27;s fortunes. From 1992 to 1996, some £4.5 million of investment had been provided to improve the Brunton Park stadium. A new East Stand (6,000 All Seater) was opened by Nat Lofthouse in August 1996, as the first phase of the planned 28,000 all-seater stadium. In October 1993 a club record transfer fee was paid in the first three years of Knighton&#x27;s reign, acquiring a much-needed prolific goalscorer with the purchase of David Reeves for £121,000 from Notts County. The club also broke its unbeaten run of games without defeat, by setting a new record of 19 games.

Before the 1993–94 season began, Michael Knighton announced his intention to deliver Premiership football to Carlisle by 2003. He re-organised the management team to appoint Mick Wadsworth as director of coaching, while David McCreery was given the role of head coach and 38-year-old goalkeeper Mervyn Day was named as assistant coach. This season was Carlisle&#x27;s best in years; they won 10 of their final 14 league games to secure the final play-off place in the recently rebranded Division Three, a year after narrowly avoiding relegations but failed to gain promotion, though their promotion dream was ended by losing to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-finals.

The 1994–95 season was one of the club&#x27;s most memorable, with the club attaining only their second championship in the club&#x27;s history by topping the Third Division with a record number of points for the club, gaining some 91 points. David Reeves scored 25 league goals to help Carlisle achieve long-awaited success ending their eight-year ordeal in the league&#x27;s basement division. This season also witnessed the club&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley in the Auto Windscreens Shield Final against Birmingham City, with a record crowd, for this competition, of 76,663. A nail biting finish went into extra time and history was made again when the Golden Goal principle was used for the first time at Wembley to decide the winner, when Birmingham scored to gain a 1–0 victory.

In 1995–96 with new found Division Two status Carlisle were favourites to win the championship. However, profound disappointment materialised during that season, which culminated in a controversial relegation back to Division Three. The re-arranged Brighton vs York fixture was completed after the formal season had finished. York knew in advance that they only needed to win or score three goals to survive the drop themselves, and won 3–1 at the Goldstone Ground, sending United back to Division Three. Knighton threatened to sue the League, unless it adopted a more acceptable code of practice, to avoid such occurrences in the future. Mervyn Day became director of coaching following the departure of Mick Wadsworth, who left the club in January 1996 for First Division Norwich City, only to remain for a few months at Norwich before he left by “mutual consent”; Wadsworth found himself back in the Third Division as manager of Scarborough F.C.

The opening campaign of the 1996–97 season suggested that the club could well be in the running to bounce back to Second Division status at the first attempt. As predicted and anticipated at the end of 1996–97, the club gained promotion at the first attempt and returned to Division Two and gained an automatic promotion spot, Carlisle would finish third behind Wigan Athletic and Fulham, Wigan going through as champions. . However, although the team had started the campaign as the “fancied” favourites for the championship, Carlisle were slightly disappointed in finishing in third place, considering the calibre of the squad, but the fact that the end of season run-in only produced four wins from the last 12 games saw the team limp over the promotion line rather than finish with a flourish. Carlisle, also made their second visit in three years to Wembley, by reaching the Football League Trophy final against Colchester. A fairly tense, equal affair saw the game burst into life in extra time. The match ended with a thrilling penalty shoot out, Carlisle found themselves trailing 3–1 on penalties until Cumbrian Tony Caig pulled off two truly brilliant penalty saves to leave the club captain, Steve Hayward, with the last penalty kick to score and carry the day. He scored to see the club win 4–3 on penalties and make history for the club by lifting a winners&#x27; trophy at the famous “home of football”, for the first time.

With promotion gained at the first attempt and returned to Second Division status for the 1997–98 season. The disappointing form from last season would continue, picking up just one win out of the first six games, and taking the previous 12 games from last season into account it showed a poor performance of picking up just five wins in 18 matches. Mervyn Day was relieved of his duties, and the coaching team comprising Michael Knighton, David Wilkes and John Halpin took charge of first team affairs. Paul Devlin was recruited as community officer in the place of John Halpin. The main objective for the new coaching staff for season 1997–98 was to maintain Division Two status. Unfortunately this was not to be, and the club finished 23rd in the table. Knighton sold the club soon afterwards, and Carlisle entered another period of strife and struggle.

In the 1998–99 season Carlisle found themselves in their second successive relegation battle. With Peter Beardsley still unable to make up his mind whether he wished to join Carlisle as team coach, it was left with the Wilkes and Halpin partnership to steer the club forward. After a mixed start the team really began to play quite well throughout the end of September and October. In December Michael Knighton appointed former Middlesbrough captain, Nigel Pearson as manager. Nigel Pearson came on strong recommendation to Carlisle with glowing references from the likes of Howard Wilkinson and Ron Atkinson, two of his former managers. However, it is fair to describe that his period in charge as nothing short of disastrous, picking up just five wins out of some 27 matches in charge.

No one could have predicted the climax to the end of yet another disappointing season. The final game of the season created one of football&#x27;s golden folklore moments, &quot;the great escape&quot; game of 8 May 1999. Carlisle United needed to gain three points from the final game of the season at home to Plymouth Argyle to retain their league survival or be relegated from the Football League for the first time since 1928. Scarborough (Carlisle&#x27;s relegation rival) merely needed to draw against Peterborough. News had already flashed through to Brunton Park that Scarborough had achieved all they needed to do, drawing against high flying Peterborough at the McAlpine Stadium 1–1 each. The score line remained 1–1 at Brunton Park on 90 minutes and the crowd at Scarborough were already celebrating before the fourth official stated four minutes of extra time would be played. In the 95th minute of stoppage, goalkeeper Jimmy Glass, who had signed in an emergency loan deal from Swindon Town after the transfer deadline, sprinted from his goal line, arrived late in the box for a corner kick, Scott Dobie&#x27;s flashing header was parried by the Plymouth goalkeeper straight to the feet of Glass, who with the last kick in the game wasted no time in smashing the ball home in one of the most dramatic ends to a season ever witnessed. All pandemonium broke loose, a high spirited mass pitch invasion took place, the referee was swamped in a good natured fashion, and at least three or four minutes lapsed before the referee was able to return the ball to the centre spot. The moment the referee blew the whistle to re-start the game, he also signalled the end of the match, in a glorious survival and retention of Football League status for Carlisle. It was in many ways a fitting finish. There had been much criticism over the departure of local goalkeeping hero Tony Caig, and the incoming goalkeeper saving the club, to become a national star overnight and a folk hero amongst the greatest of Carlisle folk heroes of all time.

In June 1999, Michael Knighton resigned as chairman and put his shareholding in CUFC Holdings Ltd up for sale. The forthcoming 1999–2000 season produced yet another poor performance on the field of play. Despite £1m spent on players&#x27; wages and the club retaining one of the largest playing squads in the bottom two divisions, the club narrowly escaped relegation to the conference on goal difference. Carlisle lost their final game of the season 1–0 to Brighton but were kept up by Chester City&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Peterborough United. Chester City lost their league status, relegated to be replaced by Conference champions Kidderminster. Carlisle&#x27;s coach, Neil Cooper had already left by early January and both replacement, Paul Baker and manager Martin Wilkinson followed suit by the end of the season.

Ian Atkins, the former Northampton Town and Chester City manager was appointed to manage team affairs for the 2000–01 campaign. Atkins was one of the most successful managers in the lower leagues, and there was much hope that he could be the man to achieve promotion. But things didn&#x27;t work out and they finished 22nd, just one place higher than in the previous two campaigns. In July, Atkins quit at the end of the season to take the assistant manager&#x27;s job at Cardiff and was succeeded by Roddy Collins who had inspired Bohemians of Ireland to their historic UEFA Cup wins over Aberdeen and 1.FC Kaiserslautern.

In the 2001–02 season, the Blues just manage to avoid relegation at the expense of Barnet; safety was achieved in only the second to last game of the season. Carl Heggs scored the vital goal that secured the point needed in the away game at Lincoln City. The highlight of the season was the third round FA Cup tie at home to Arsenal, the Blues made the Gunners work hard for a 1–0 victory and were unlucky not to grab a replay. Improved results on the pitch were overshadowed once again by off the field events which included a failed takeover attempt by Irish businessman John Courtenay and in April Roddy Collins became the second manager to be dismissed that season by United following a series of outbursts criticising the club&#x27;s directors and overseeing Carlisle United&#x27;s worst start to a season in 46 years.

For the fourth time in five seasons, Carlisle narrowly avoided relegation in the 2002–03 season. This time 22nd place was just one place above the drop zone, as this was the first season in which two clubs were relegated to the Conference instead of just one.

After frequently in the struggle to avoid relegation to the Conference, Carlisle were finally relegated in 2003–04 after 76 years in the Football League. Relegation had seemed inevitable since well before Christmas, with 18 of Carlisle&#x27;s first 21 Division Three games ending in defeat. A revival followed from the next 25 fixtures under new player-manager Paul Simpson, 40 points from a possible 75 . Carlisle actually managed to finish second from bottom in the table after York City&#x27;s failure to win any of their final 20 league games, with Carlisle&#x27;s relegation being confirmed when they failed to win their penultimate game of the season.

===2005–present: Return to the Football League===

Carlisle were promoted out of the Conference at the first time of asking in 2004–05, winning the play-off final by defeating Stevenage Borough 1–0 at the Britannia Stadium. Carlisle&#x27;s excellent form under manager Paul Simpson continued into the following season as they returned to the Football League with a bang, clinching the League Two title. Simpson then departed for Preston North End, and was succeeded by Neil McDonald.

In 2006–07, the club were mired in mid-table but staged a late run for a play-off place, they finally finished the season eighth, their highest league place for 20 years with the added bonus of returning their highest average league crowds for 30 years. Carlisle started the 2007–08 season with a 1–1 draw at newly promoted Walsall but manager Neil McDonald was sacked on the Monday after the match. Cheltenham Town manager John Ward took over on a permanent basis in October 2007, with both clubs agreeing a six-figure compensation package. Under Ward Carlisle were in the hunt for an automatic promotion spot but could only manage a draw on the final day of the season and finished fourth. In the play-off semi-final, Carlisle lost to Leeds United 3–2 on aggregate.

The 2008–09 season saw Carlisle start promisingly but it was soon followed by one of the worst runs of form in the club&#x27;s history. Because of this manager John Ward was sacked and replaced by caretaker manager Greg Abbott, signing him permanently after he uplifted the club&#x27;s form in the subsequent games. Carlisle completed two full seasons with Abbott at the helm, and achieved comfortable mid-table finishes in both. More noteworthy were the two runs in the Football League Trophy which took place in those seasons. The team were beaten in the final in 2010 but returned the following year, to win the trophy in 2011. The following season started successfully for the Cumbrians and sustained a considerable play-off push throughout the season. A dip in form towards the end of the seasons saw Carlisle miss out by two points to Stevenage.

Following a narrow 1–0 home defeat to Port Vale, Abbott&#x27;s five-year reign as United manager ended. Following Abbott&#x27;s sacking, assistant manager Graham Kavanagh was installed as caretaker manager, later appointed on a permanent basis. In May 2014, Carlisle were relegated having finished 22nd, ending an eight-year spell in the third tier.

In September 2014, Keith Curle was appointed as Carlisle United manager. After a poor start to the season, Curle lifted Carlisle from the foot of the table, and out of the relegation zone. However, Carlisle drifted back towards a relegation battle, only securing their Football League safety with two games to spare. The next season was a much more comfortable one but not enough for a promotion push, with the team finishing 10th. A highlight of the season was a visit to Anfield for the third round of the League Cup. Carlisle held Liverpool to a 1–1 draw, but lost 3–2 on penalties.

The first half of the 2016–17 season was excellent for the club, with just one loss in their first 23 league fixtures. However a disastrous sequence followed, with only four wins in the next 21 games. Carlisle narrowly made the play-offs but lost 6–5 on aggregate to Exeter City in the semi-final. Keith Curle left Carlisle United at the end of the 2017–18 season after over four years in charge. The 2019–20 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the Cumbrians in a disappointing 18th place.

In February 2022, Paul Simpson returned as manager with the club in 23rd place. &quot;Simmo&quot; led the blues to eight wins, one draw and six defeats which was enough to pull the club from the relegation zone and keep Carlisle in the Football League, finishing in 20th place. After securing survival in the 2021–22 season, Simpson agreed terms on a new three-year contract as manager. In the 2022–23 season, Carlisle finished fifth, securing a play-off spot. In the play-off semi-final, Carlisle defeated Bradford City to win the tie 3–2 on aggregate. In the play-off final, the Cumbrians defeated Stockport County on penalties after a 1–1 draw to earn promotion back to League One after nine years in League Two.

The 2023–24 season was less successful. Carlisle were immediately relegated back to the fourth tier, finishing 24th, 16 points adrift of safety, with just seven victories in the league and only 30 points. A second successive relegation looked likely the following season; Simpson was sacked on 21 August 2024 after losing three of the first four league games. Then, after just five wins from 25 games, his successor, Mike Williamson, was sacked on 3 February 2025, with the club five points from League Two safety. Three days later, Mark Hughes became Carlisle&#x27;s new head coach.

==Colours and badge==
Upon the decision to change the name of Shaddongate F.C. to Carlisle United in 1904 the club also changed their shirt colours from gold and navy stripes to blue. In 1907 white shorts were introduced and since then various combinations of blue and white have been used by the club. In 1973 the first shirt to feature a sportswear sponsor was worn by United. Made by Admiral, the shirt was based on an earlier Birmingham City shirt and was the first to feature red detailing. Since then red detailing became a common feature on Carlisle shirts.

The first evidence of Carlisle wearing a crest dates to the 1950–51 season, first adorning it in a FA Cup tie against Arsenal. The design itself was based on the city&#x27;s own coat of arms which was registered at the College of Arms in 1924. The crest itself may have been derived from Sir William de Carlyell of Cumberland, in the reign of Edward II, who bore a red cross. The supporting red wyverns to either side of the shield are a symbol of the British Kingdom of Cumbria. The motto on the underlying scroll reads: ‘Be just and fear not’, which is a quote from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VIII&quot;.

Carlisle were often referred to as the Foxes due to the local connection with huntsman John Peel. In 1970 the club badge changed to reflect this and featured a golden fox jumping over the abbreviation C.U.F.C. The fox further became part of the club&#x27;s image with a mounted stuffed fox named Olga (an anagram of &quot;goal&quot;) which is traditionally carried onto the pitch by the mascot before the match. Later versions of this badge featured a fox&#x27;s head with a castle (representing Carlisle Castle) and a fox jumping through a ring of stars, somewhat resembling the European Union emblem.

Since 1995 the club has reverted to using the city&#x27;s coat of arms. However the club still sell merchandise with branding similar to their former fox badge. The club mascot (who is now Olga the Fox also) would continue the tradition of bringing the stuffed fox onto the pitch before each match, this was discontinued after flood damage suffered in 2015 caused it to rapidly deteriorate. 

===Sponsorship===
Stobart Group, a local business, had been the club&#x27;s main shirt sponsor since 1995. Before 2007 the shirt displayed the Eddie Stobart name associated with the haulage arm of the business (with the exception of the 1997–2000 shirt), in 2007 this changed to just Stobart in order to reflect the wider company. The Stobart deal ended for the 2014–15 season, ending one of the longest-running sponsorship deals in English football.

The Stobart Group have been strong supporters of the club in general. In 2010, to celebrate the company&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the group bought 4,000 tickets for the League One game against Rochdale and gave them away to the general public. On 3 April 2011 Carlisle United wore black armbands in the Football League Trophy final in respect of Edward Stobart (son of Eddie), who had died three days earlier.

==Stadium==

As Shaddongate United the club played at two grounds, Millholme Bank, to the south of the city, and Devonshire Park, where Trinity School now stands. In 1909, five years after becoming Carlisle United, the club moved to Brunton Park and has been there ever since.

The stadium has a capacity of 18,202 and comprises both seated and terraced areas. The four stands are known as Main (West) Stand &amp; Paddock, the East Stand, the &quot;Waterworks&quot; Petteril Stand and the Warwick Road End which usually hosts the most vocal supporters on match days. In the past the stadium has been the victim of severe flooding and a fire which burned down the wooden grandstand which stood until 1953.

In 2011, a plan was introduced to move to a 12,000 capacity all-seater stadium to be built in the Kingmoor Park area of the city which was to be locally known as project Blue Yonder. Though considerably smaller than Brunton Park, the new ground could be upgraded to a larger capacity if demand was met. An extension of this 12,000 capacity is thought to rely on the club achieving promotion to the Championship. The proposals have received mixed responses from Carlisle fans. There has since been no news as to whether the project has any advancement.

In December and January of the 2015–16 season, Carlisle played their home games at Deepdale in Preston, Bloomfield Road in Blackpool and Ewood Park in Blackburn, as Brunton Park recovered from flooding caused by Storm Desmond.

In December 2021, the club announced that the stadium capacity would be temporarily reduced to 9,999, after the government required attendees at events with a capacity of greater than 10,000 to show Covid certification.

==Ownership==
Carlisle United operates through the limited company Carlisle United Association Football Club (1921) Ltd which is currently controlled by Castle Sports Group which has a controlling 90.0% stake in the club&#x27;s holding company, CUFC Holdings Ltd. A minority (10.0%) stake is held by The United Trust, formed by supporters in 2001. Castle Sports Group is owned by the Piatak Family from Jacksonville, Florida, who own several other companies, most notably Magellan Transport Logistics, which provides transportation and logistics services throughout North America.

Allen, the owner of a local accountancy agency, left the board acrimoniously in 2009 when he made public a feud with fellow owners on the board stating &quot;Unfortunately, a lot of people perceive elements within Brunton Park&#x27;s hierarchy as an &quot;old boys’ club&quot; that is not receptive of change. I am unhappy being associated with that as it is not my style either personally or professionally.&quot; Since Allen left the club has gone from strength to strength having two Wembley finals under their belt including winning the JPT in April 2011 also posting healthy profits. Carlisle United released plans to move to a modern all seater stadium, however these plans fell through. Recent years have seen the club stagnate and decline both in terms of league position and attendances. The club has recently gone through its longest period in history without promotion, the last being the 2005–06 season.

In 1992 property developer Michael Knighton bought the club which was then playing in Division Four, the lowest tier of the Football League. Then began a 10-year ownership in which much of the talk around the club concerned Knighton himself. At one point he was even featured in the local paper claiming to have seen a UFO, local paper the &quot;News and Star&quot; ran the story with the headline: &#x27;Knighton: Aliens Spoke To Me&#x27;.

In 1997 Knighton dismissed popular manager Mervyn Day, who had won promotion to the Second Division and the Football League Trophy earlier that year. Knighton placed himself in charge of the club&#x27;s management with the uncredited help of Dave Wilkes and John Halpin. The club was relegated to the English fourth tier that season and only narrowly avoided losing Football League status due to a last minute goal by goalkeeper Jimmy Glass in 1999. Knighton became increasingly unpopular with the fans in the following years and the supporters&#x27; United Trust was formed to push for better ownership, this came in the form of John Courtenay after a seven-month battle in July 2002, ending Michael Knighton&#x27;s controversial decade-long reign

==Supporters and rivalries==
The main area of Carlisle support can be found within and around Carlisle itself and, due to being the only professional football club for a long distance, it attracts fans from across the county of Cumbria, South West Scotland and parts of West Northumberland. The club&#x27;s supporters are known as the &quot;Blue Army&quot;. The most vocal supporters on match days reside in Brunton Park&#x27;s Warwick Road End, known affectionately to the fans as The Warwick. In addition to generic English football chants Carlisle&#x27;s supporters sing &quot;Proud to be a Cumbrian&quot;, &quot;Super Carlisle from the North&quot; and an adapted version of Peggy March&#x27;s, &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot;.

Carlisle&#x27;s traditional rivals are Workington and Barrow. However, both clubs were voted out of the Football League in the 1970s and consequently competitive matches between the teams have been rare. Barrow were promoted back to the Football League in 2020, reinstating competitive matches between the two teams. Prior to 2008, the club&#x27;s nearest professional football club was Gretna, owned by Carlisle United fan Brooks Mileson. Gretna played in the Scottish Football League however and, therefore, the chance of meeting in competitive competition remained highly unlikely. Gretna was eventually liquidated in 2008.

In 2012, market research company FFC surveyed fans of every Football League club across the country to find who they consider their main rivals to be. Carlisle United fans were unusually shown to consider the more distant Preston North End, Hartlepool United and Middlesbrough as their main rivals. This is most likely explained by the fact that the survey did not include the option of choosing non-league clubs.

===League history===
To date Carlisle United have played 82 seasons in the Football League, their relegation in 2004 and reinstatement the following year remains the only departure from the Football League since the club was first admitted in 1928 (excluding wartime). United are currently the only club to have reached the final of the Football League Trophy on six occasions. This, alongside their two wins, makes them the most successful club in the competition&#x27;s history. The club&#x27;s highest achievement outside of cup competitions came in 1974 when the club was promoted to the first tier of English football and spent a short period of time at the top of the division. Carlisle still remains the smallest location in England, by local population, to have had a resident top-flight football team since 1906.

<text>Cheltenham Town Football Club is a professional association football club based in the town of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. The team competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1887, the club spent much of its early history competing in local football circles, before moving to the Birmingham Combination in 1932 and then the Southern League in 1935. They spent the next 50 years in the Southern League, winning the Midland Division in 1982–83 and then claiming the Premier Division title in 1984–85. They were subsequently promoted into the Alliance Premier League in 1985, where they remained for seven seasons until they were relegated in 1992. They finished as runners-up of the Southern League Premier Division for four of the next five seasons, and were promoted into the Conference in 1997.

Under the stewardship of Steve Cotterill, Cheltenham won the 1998 FA Trophy final and then secured promotion into the Football League for the first time after winning the Conference title in 1998–99. He left the club after the 2001–02 season, having guided them to the FA Cup fifth round and promotion with victory in the 2002 Third Division play-off final. Immediately relegated after one season in the Second Division, they secured another promotion as manager John Ward guided them to victory in the 2006 League Two play-off final. Relegated after three seasons in the third tier, the club&#x27;s 16-year stay in the Football League ended with relegation back to the National League in 2015. However manager Gary Johnson led Cheltenham to the Conference title with a 101-point tally in 2015–16, making them the first club in 26 years to secure an immediate return to the Football League as champions of the Conference. After Michael Duff took over from Johnson, he led the club to its first Football League title, winning the 2020–21 League Two title. They were relegated to League Two after three seasons in the third tier.

Nicknamed the &quot;Robins&quot;, they have played at Whaddon Road since 1932. The club contests rivalries with Gloucester City, Hereford United and recently Forest Green Rovers.

==History==

===Early Years: 1887–1940===
Cheltenham has a history of football prior to The Robins. In 1849, the first use of three official referees in a match, two in field and one in tribune, was recorded in the town. However, the modern club was founded in 1887 by Albert Close White, a local teacher.

The club spent its first three decades in local football. Notable players from those days included former England international Philip Bach, cricketers Gilbert Jessop and brothers Charles Barnett and Edgar Barnett..

In December 1931 the club moved to Whaddon Road and turned semi-professional in 1932–33, joining the Birmingham Combination whilst adopting new colours of red and white hooped shirts, black shorts, and red and white stockings. Former England international George Blackburn was appointed player coach, and led the team to third place in their debut season. The following year the club entered the FA Cup, featuring a ten-game journey to the third round before losing to Blackpool in front of a record attendance at the Athletic Ground in Cheltenham. Following a disappointing season in 1934–35, brightened only by winning the Leamington Hospital Cup and the discovery and sale of centre froward James Currier to Bolton Wanderers, the club applied for membership and were accepted to join the Southern League for the 1935–36 season.

Town kicked-off their debut Southern League campaign with two firsts. The club appointed its first manager with &quot;complete power&quot; of team selection in George Carr, and fielded an all professional eleven in the first game of the season against Barry. Despite a flying start in the season opener, Town could only finish sixth in the Western and ninth in the Central sections of the league. However, the season did feature an FA Cup run to the first round where Brighton and Hove Albion were taken to a replay. A notable result during the run was the club&#x27;s record victory, beating Chippenham Rovers 12–0 in the Third Round Qualifying.

The 1936–37 season was Carr&#x27;s last, resigning in April 1937. Town finished eleventh as the Southern League switched to a single division, with the side featuring appearances from future England international Tim Ward before his move to Derby County. Off the field, the club moved to establish itself as a limited company.

Carr&#x27;s replacement was former Arsenal forward James Brain. After losing two stalwart performers for the club - Cliff Lang to illness and Ernie Williams to injury - Brain couldn&#x27;t improve on eleventh place in the league. But he took the team to the FA Cup first round, losing 3–0 to Watford, while Newport County knocked Town out the Welsh Cup at the quarter-final stage. Two of the side&#x27;s consistent performers, winger Cliff Thorley and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler earned moves to Bristol City and Birmingham respectively. Crisis was averted when players, shareholders and supporters contributed to keep the club in business following a financial crunch.

Cheltenham rebranded as &quot;The Robins&quot; for the 1938–39 campaign, wearing white shirts with a robin emblem and red sleeves. Another FA Cup run ended against league opposition in the first round as Cardiff City won a replay following a 1–1 draw at Whaddon Road. In the league, Town had another bottom half finish. All 16 league wins came at home, and only on six occasions did Cheltenham avoid a league defeat away from Whaddon Road. Once again, the threat of closure hung over the club.

A promising start to the 1939–40 season was curtailed by the outbreak of World War II. Following a pause, the Southern League established a limited regional programme, often featuring guest players, and Cheltenham finished next to bottom of the league&#x27;s Western division. At the season&#x27;s end the club announced it would &quot;not arrange any more fixtures until further notice&quot;.

===1985–1999===
They won promotion to the Alliance Premier League (now the Conference National) in 1985, but were relegated seven years later.

The appointment of Steve Cotterill as manager during the 1996–97 was the start of a period of success at the club which resulted in Cotterill being their most successful manager. Four months after taking charge he guided the club to runners-up spot in the Southern Football League Premier Division, but they won promotion to the Football Conference as champions Gresley Rovers were unable to meet the required ground capacity for Conference membership. In 1997–98, Cheltenham finished runners-up in the Conference and were close to champions Halifax Town until the end of April 1998. They secured a place at Wembley in the 1998 FA Trophy Final, beating Southport 1–0 in front of a crowd of 26,837 at Wembley Stadium. In 1998–99, Cheltenham secured the Conference title and entry to the Football League.

===Football League (1999–2015)===
After two mid-table finishes in Division Three, Cheltenham finally won promotion to Division Two (via the Division Three playoffs) at the end of the 2001–02 season. Shortly after winning promotion, Cotterill left Cheltenham to join Stoke City as their manager.

Cheltenham replaced Cotterill with first-team coach Graham Allner who had won the Conference championship with Kidderminster Harriers in 1994. Allner and assistant manager Mike Davis, who was originally assistant to Cotterill, were sacked in January 2003, after six months in the job, with Cheltenham near the foot of Division Two. Cheltenham turned to Bobby Gould, one of the most experienced managers in English football whose exploits include an FA Cup victory with Wimbledon in 1988. Cheltenham continued to struggle, and defeat in their final game of the season condemned the club to relegation back to Division Three after just one season. Gould resigned as Cheltenham Town manager in November 2003 and was replaced by John Ward.

During the 2005–06 season, a new stand for visiting fans was added (The Carlsberg Stand). They finished the season in 5th, earning a place in the play-offs. In the semi-final Cheltenham beat Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 away and drew 0–0 in the second leg at Whaddon Road. In the play-off final, Cheltenham beat Grimsby Town 1–0, securing a place in League One for 2006–07. The match at the Millennium Stadium on 28 May 2006 was attended by 29,196 people.

Cheltenham started life in League One with a 1–0 win against Gillingham. Following Cheltenham&#x27;s 3–0 defeat to Port Vale, manager John Ward announced he had agreed a four-year contract with League One side Carlisle United. A highlight of the season was winning twice against Leeds United. Cheltenham&#x27;s survival was secured on the final day of the season as they beat Doncaster Rovers 2–1 at Whaddon Road, denying their opposition automatic promotion.

Early in the 2008–09 season, Keith Downing left Cheltenham Town and was replaced by Martin Allen. Allen&#x27;s team started poorly with a club-record seven consecutive defeats, part of a 15-game run without a victory. The club narrowly avoided administration, and the 10-point penalty that would go with it, before Allen revealed that all the players at the club were up for sale. The season finished with Cheltenham&#x27;s relegation back to League Two on the penultimate day of the season after three seasons in League One as they had conceded over 100 goals in all competitions.

Cheltenham won their first match of the 2009–10 season against Grimsby Town 2–1, but fell dramatically down the table soon after. On 20 October, Martin Allen was &quot;put on gardening leave&quot; amid allegations he racially abused a nightclub bouncer, and assistant manager John Schofield took temporary charge. Allen was formally cleared of misconduct but still left the club by mutual consent in early December. Former Cheltenham captain and Kidderminster boss Mark Yates was appointed manager on 22 December 2009. Cheltenham continued to struggle through the rest of the season, only managing to avoid relegation on the final day of the season, although they finished four points ahead of the relegated sides.

Yates, ahead of his first full season with Cheltenham, revamped the squad, releasing eight players, including defender Shane Duff, who had just completed his tenth year with the club. The season proved to be successful to begin with, with the Robins remaining close to the play-off positions, but they collapsed in the second half of the season and finished 17th, with only five wins in 26 games in 2011.

Despite losing in the first round of the League Cup, they reached the Football League Trophy south quarter-finals and were handed a lucrative tie at Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup third round. The Robins ended the season in 6th and defeated Torquay United 2–0 at home and then 1–2 away in the play-off semi-finals. The play-off final was contested at Wembley Stadium on 27 May 2012. Crewe Alexandra defeated Cheltenham Town 2–0 with goals from Nick Powell and Byron Moore in front of a crowd of 24,029.

The Robins also enjoyed a good run in the FA Cup, eventually losing out 5–1 to Premier League side Everton. On 6 November 2012, manager Mark Yates oversaw his 150th game in charge of the team in a 1–0 win against league leaders Gillingham. Cheltenham finished 5th, once again qualifying for the end of season play-offs after being pipped to the third promotion spot on the last day of the season by Rotherham United. The season included a run of 21 home league games without defeat. The play-offs saw Cheltenham face Northampton Town with Cheltenham losing both home and away games by 1–0.

After finishing in the play-offs for two consecutive seasons, Cheltenham Town&#x27;s 2013–14 season proved to be difficult. Any hopes of a third consecutive play-off place were ended by March. The highlight of the season was a trip to Premier League side West Ham United, with the club eventually losing 2–1 at Upton Park. Cheltenham finished the season in 17th place.

On 25 November 2014, Mark Yates was sacked by Cheltenham Town after almost five years in charge. Cheltenham subsequently appointed Paul Buckle as team manager, but he was dismissed after just 79 days. In March 2015 Gary Johnson was appointed manager. In April 2015, after Bryan Jacob, a lifelong supporter, gave the club&#x27;s supporters trust £222,000 in his will, members voted to use the money to accept a long-standing offer from the club for a permanent seat on its board of directors. Football fan Clive Gowing was subsequently elected. The club said it would also name a stand and supporters&#x27; player-of-the-season award in Jacob&#x27;s memory. On 25 April 2015, Cheltenham Town lost at Whaddon Road to Shrewsbury Town, which meant that Cheltenham were relegated from the Football League after sixteen seasons.

===Return to the Football League (2016–)===
After only one season outside of the Football League, Cheltenham secured an immediate return on 16 April 2016 with a 2–0 home win against FC Halifax Town. The team amassed 101 points, scoring the most and conceding the fewest goals, on their way to becoming champions, finishing 12 points clear of second-placed local rivals Forest Green Rovers. January signing Dan Holman was joint winner of the National League&#x27;s Golden Boot award, with 30 goals, having netted 16 times in just 18 games for the Robins. Danny Wright, a summer signing, finished the season with 22 league goals and 11 assists, winning the Supporters Player of the Year award.

For the club&#x27;s return to the Football League, manager Gary Johnson largely kept faith with the players that had won the previous year&#x27;s National League. The 2016–17 season proved to be a struggle with a number of players finding the step up to League Two more difficult than had been hoped. The Whaddon Road pitch also came in for criticism, from both supporters and visiting managers, as it struggled to cope with its high levels of use (Gloucester City were in the final season of a ground-share at Cheltenham during 2016–17). Results improved somewhat during the spring, although Johnson was absent on sick leave from March onwards while recovering from heart bypass surgery, leaving his assistant Russell Milton in charge. The Robins secured their league status with a 1–0 win over Hartlepool United in the penultimate game of the season. They finished the season in 21st place.

During the close season a recovered Gary Johnson returned to work and signed a new two-year contract. He oversaw a major clearout of the squad with eleven players released. In the 2017–18 season the club ultimately only gained one point more than in the previous year (51 compared to 50), and finished in 17th place in League Two. By far the biggest success of an otherwise low-key year was Sudanese striker Mohamed Eisa. Signed as a free transfer from non-league football, Eisa scored 23 league goals for Cheltenham during the season and ultimately moved to Bristol City, for a transfer fee reportedly in excess of £1m (a club record sale), in July 2018. At the end of the season, long-serving club chairman Paul Baker stood down from the role after 20 years, handing over the chairmanship to Andy Wilcox.

On 10 September 2018, ex-Cheltenham player Michael Duff was appointed after the departure of Gary Johnson. Duff guided the Robins to 16th. The following 2019–20 season was very successful, narrowly missing out on automatic promotion in 4th place. Final league standings were decided on a points-per-game basis following disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cheltenham missed out in the play-offs to Northampton Town, losing 3–2 on aggregate.

In 2020–21, Cheltenham returned to League One as champions after five seasons in League Two. Due to the ongoing disruption caused by COVID-19, the vast majority of fixtures in 2020–21 took place behind closed doors. The Robins reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2006 before narrowly losing out to eventual 2020–21 Premier League champions Manchester City. Cheltenham were leading the match with ten minutes to play before eventually losing 3–1. Cheltenham guaranteed their return to League One with a 1–1 draw at home to Carlisle United. On 8 May 2021, Cheltenham won their first ever Football League title, beating Harrogate Town 4–1 on the final day to secure the League Two championship.

In the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, Cheltenham finished 15th and 16th respectively in League One. As one of the smallest clubs operating at that level, they were greatly helped by the form of striker Alfie May who scored a total of 43 league goals over the two seasons. At the end of the 2021–22 season, head coach Michael Duff left for Barnsley and was replaced by Wade Elliott who was promoted internally from the role of first-team coach.

At the start of the 2023–24 season, Cheltenham failed to score a goal in their opening eleven matches which equalled a Football League record. This start to the season cost Elliott his job. He was replaced by Darrell Clarke, but despite form improving significantly, Cheltenham were still relegated to League Two on the final day of the season. Clarke left for Barnsley at the end of the season. On 31 May 2024, Michael Flynn was appointed as Cheltenham Town manager.

==Rivalries==
Gloucestershire outfit Forest Green Rovers are currently seen as the club&#x27;s main rivals. Fixtures between the two sides are humorously named &quot;El Glosico&quot;, a play-on-words of the famous &quot;El Clásico&quot; fixture. In recent years, the rivalry has grown heated due to the close proximity between the clubs, the fight for the 2015–16 National League title (Cheltenham and Forest Green finishing 1st and 2nd respectively) and, between 2017 and 2021, both competing in League Two.

Traditionally, Cheltenham&#x27;s main rivals were Gloucestershire neighbours Gloucester City. Due to Cheltenham&#x27;s rise up the leagues, the last competitive meeting between the two sides was in 1997, meaning the rivalry is now of less significance but is still keenly discussed by both sets of fans. They also used to maintain fierce rivalries with Kidderminster Harriers and Hereford United. The Hereford rivalry is nowadays less significant, however, due to United going out of business in 2014 and reforming as Hereford FC. The new club and Cheltenham are yet to meet in a competitive fixture.

A survey conducted in August 2019 revealed that fans of &quot;The Robins&quot; also consider fellow West Country sides Bristol City, Bristol Rovers and Swindon Town, as well as South East England side Oxford United, as rivals.

<text>Darlington Football Club is an association football club based in Darlington, County Durham, England. As of the 2023–24 season, the team competes in the National League North, at the sixth level of English football.

The club was founded in 1883, and played its matches at Feethams. The club originally played in regionally organised leagues, and was one of the founding members of the Northern League in 1889. They were first admitted to the Football League when the Third Division North was formed in 1921. They won the Third Division North title in 1925, and their 15th place in the Second Division in 1926 remains their highest ever league finish. After their admission to the League, they spent most of their history in the bottom tier. They won the Third Division North Cup in 1934, their first victory in nationally organised cup competition. They reached the last 16 of the FA Cup twice, and the quarter-final of the League Cup once, in 1968. In the early 1990s they won successive titles, in the Conference National in 1990 and the Fourth Division in 1991. In 2011 they won the FA Trophy, defeating Mansfield Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.

Darlington moved to the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was a major factor in driving the club into administration in 2003, 2009, and 2012. As the fan owned club was unable to agree a creditors voluntary agreement it was expelled from the Football Association (FA). A new club was immediately formed and moved to Blackwell Meadows stadium but the FA ruled that, as a new club, it must have a different playing name from the expelled club. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that club was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request to change to the traditional Darlington FC name.

The club have at times worn strips of black and white shirts, black shorts and black and white socks. The club&#x27;s crest depicts &quot;Locomotion&quot; No. 1, referring to the town&#x27;s railway history; as well as a stylised Quaker hat, referring to the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town, and which was the source of the team&#x27;s nickname, the Quakers. The club&#x27;s main rivals historically are Hartlepool United.

==History==

===Founding and pre-war===

In July 1883, a meeting was called in Darlington Grammar School to address concerns that so few Darlington-based football clubs were entering the major competition in the region, the Durham Challenge Cup. The meeting agreed with the view expressed by the &quot;Darlington &amp; Stockton Times&quot; newspaper, that there was &quot;no club, urban or rural, sufficiently powerful to worthily represent Darlington&quot;, decided to form a new club, and elected one Charles Samuel Craven, a local engineer, as secretary. Darlington Football Club duly entered the Durham Challenge Cup, reached the final in their first season, and won the trophy in 1885. The following season Darlington entered the FA Cup for the first time, only to lose 8–0 to Grimsby Town. Craven was instrumental in the formation of the Northern League in 1889. Darlington were one of the founder members, and went on to win the league title in 1896 and 1900; they reached the semi-final of the FA Amateur Cup in the same two seasons.
The club turned professional in 1908 and joined the North Eastern League. The 1910–11 season saw Darlington reach the last 16 of the FA Cup, progressing through five qualifying rounds to lose to Swindon Town in the third round proper, and two years later they won the North Eastern League. Ground improvements begun before the First World War left the club in financial difficulty during it; the chairman of Darlington Forge Albion financed the completion of the East Stand and cleared the debts, allowing them to continue to compete. When competitive football resumed after the war, Darlington finished second in the North Eastern League, and were champions for a second time the following year. This victory was well timed, as it coincided with the formation of the Northern Section of the Football League&#x27;s Third Division, which Darlington were invited to join.

Their first season in the Third Division was a successful one and they ended up in second place. Three years later, in 1924–25, they were champions and won promotion to the Football League Second Division. The 15th-place finish in 1926 remains Darlington&#x27;s best League performance, but they were relegated back to the Third Division in 1927, where they remained until the Second World War put an end to competitive football. They came as high as third in 1929–30, but twice had to apply for re-election to the League, in 1932–33 and 1936–37, after finishing in last place in the section. In 1934, they enjoyed their first success in a nationally organised cup competition, defeating Stockport County 4–3 at Old Trafford to win the Football League Third Division North Cup, and reached the final again two years later, this time losing 2–1 at home to Chester.

===Post-war===
Soon after the Football Association gave permission for competitive matches to be played under floodlights, Darlington beat Carlisle United 3–1 in the first floodlit FA Cup match between Football League clubs, a replay held at St James&#x27; Park, Newcastle United&#x27;s ground, in November 1955. The 1957–58 season saw the club equal their previous best FA Cup run, reaching the last 16 by defeating Chelsea, Football League champions only three years earlier, in the fourth round. After letting slip a three-goal lead at Stamford Bridge, Darlington won the replay 4–1 after extra time, described as &quot;a most meritorious win, earned by a combination of sound tactics and an enthusiasm that Chelsea never equalled&quot; by &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; correspondent, who felt it &quot;surprising that extra time was necessary, for Darlington always seemed to have the match well in hand&quot;. In the League, Darlington&#x27;s fourth place in 1948–49 was their only top-half finish in the first twelve seasons after the war, and when the regional sections of the Third Division were merged, they were allocated to the new Fourth Division.

The Supporters&#x27; Club raised £20,000 to pay for a roof at one end of the Feethams ground and for floodlights, which were first used on 19 September 1960. Later that night, the West Stand burned down due to an electrical fault. Darlington&#x27;s attendance record, of 21,023 against Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup fourth round, was set two months later. Under the management of Lol Morgan, they won promotion to the Third Division in 1966. A crowd of 16,000 watched the draw against Torquay United on the last day of the season which ensured they finished as runners-up, but they were relegated the following year.

Darlington reached the quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough&#x27;s Derby County, they took the lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for re-election to the League five times, and by 1982 they were facing a financial crisis which they survived thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the highest position they achieved in the Football League since the introduction of the four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.

Though Brian Little&#x27;s appointment as manager in February 1989 was too late to stave off relegation to the Conference, he went on to lead them to successive promotions. An immediate return to the Football League as Conference champions preceded the Fourth Division title in 1990–91, but Little&#x27;s departure for Leicester City was followed by relegation and a succession of short-term managers. They came close to a return to the Third Division via the play-offs in 1996; on their first visit to Wembley, against Plymouth Argyle, they were beaten by a Ronnie Mauge goal.

===New stadium, administration and decline===
The 1999–2000 season, the first under George Reynolds&#x27; chairmanship, was marked by Darlington becoming the first team to lose an FA Cup tie and still qualify for the next round. Manchester United&#x27;s involvement in the FIFA Club World Championship meant they did not enter the FA Cup. To decide who took their place, a &quot;lucky losers&quot; draw was held from the 20 teams knocked out in the second round; Darlington were selected, and lost their third-round tie 2–1 to Aston Villa at Villa Park. Their second Wembley appearance came later that season, facing Peterborough United in the play-off final after automatic promotion had seemed certain earlier in the season. After a 3–0 aggregate semi-final win over Hartlepool United, Quakers missed numerous chances and were again undone by a single goal, this time from Andy Clarke.

In 2002, Darlington made unsuccessful approaches to sign international stars Paul Gascoigne and Faustino Asprilla, and moved into their new stadium, named the Reynolds Arena, in summer 2003. Reynolds had paid the club&#x27;s debts when he took over, but the cost of the stadium, partly financed with high-interest loans and built without realistic expectation of filling it, drove the club into administration six months later. Reynolds resigned as a director in January 2004 with the club under threat of imminent closure. A benefit match, featuring footballers such as Gascoigne, Bryan Robson and Kenny Dalglish, played in front of a crowd of over 14,000, raised £100,000 to help ensure survival in the short term. Despite the off-field problems, David Hodgson, in his third spell as manager, and his players produced some fine performances as the team avoided relegation.
At the end of the season, Reynolds was obliged to hand over control to the Sterling Consortium to bring the club out of administration, Stewart Davies taking over as chairman. He and his staff adopted a fan-friendly approach, in contrast to the abrasive Reynolds, before in 2006, the club was sold to property developer George Houghton. For four consecutive seasons, under Hodgson, sacked in 2006, and then under successor Dave Penney, the Quakers finished in the top half of the table, reaching the play-off semi-final in 2008 only to lose to Rochdale on penalties. In February 2009, Darlington again went into administration, triggering an automatic 10-point deduction, without which they would have again reached the play-offs. Fundraising efforts kept the club going, but when no buyer was found for the club by a May deadline, the administrators made the majority of the first-team squad available for transfer and cut staff numbers to a minimum. On 20 May, Houghton returned to the club as chairman, appointed former Middlesbrough boss Colin Todd as manager, and brokered an agreement which led to the club coming out of administration and ownership passing to local businessman Raj Singh and enabling it to compete in the 2009–10 season without any points deduction. Todd left the club after losing seven of his first nine games and was replaced by former Republic of Ireland manager Steve Staunton, who only won four of 23 league games.

The club were eventually relegated to the Conference, and suffered more managerial turmoil during the summer when Simon Davey and successor Ryan Kidd both left within 11 days, to leave Mark Cooper in charge. He led the club to victory in the 2011 FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium, defeating Mansfield Town 1–0 with a goal from Chris Senior in the last minute of extra time. Following a succession of poor performances at the start of the 2011–12 season, Cooper and his assistant Richard Dryden were sacked by the club in October. A little more than two months later, Singh placed the club into administration for the third time in less than a decade. A number of players were released and allowed to join other clubs for nominal fees in January before interim manager Craig Liddle and the remaining playing staff had their contracts terminated by Darlington&#x27;s administrator. Two days later, the club was spared from liquidation after a last-minute injection of funding by supporters&#x27; groups. Enough funds were raised for Darlington to complete the season, but relegation was confirmed with three matches remaining.

===Darlington 1883===
On 3 May 2012, the club was taken over by DFC 1883 Ltd with the intention of moving into community ownership. Because it failed to agree a creditors voluntary agreement, the club was expelled from the Football Association and was eventually wound up in the High Court. DFC 1883 Limited immediately formed a new club. Because the club proposed to play at a ground without the required grading for the Northern Premier League, the new club was placed in the Northern League Division One, by the Football Association. Martin Gray was appointed manager. An appeal against the new club not being treated as a continuation of the old club was rejected, confirming that the club was to be treated as a new club and would not be able to play under the name Darlington F.C. The new owners opted to name the new club Darlington 1883.

In February 2013, the club became 100% fan- and community-owned after the Darlington Football Club Community Interest Company (DFC CIC), representing around 800 members, had taken a 52% stake; the Supporters&#x27; Club held 15%, and individual fans held the remaining 33%. The new ownership were committed to paying off debts incurred under the previous owners; five months later, the club made a final payment on tax owed to HMRC.

On the pitch, Darlington were crowned Northern League Division One champions in 2012–13 with a club record haul of 122 points, having scored 145 goals in the process, thus gaining promotion to the Northern Premier League Division One North for the 2013–14 season. The season saw them finish as Division One North runners-up, before losing in the play-off semi-final to Ramsbottom United. In 2014–15, Darlington again finished second, and this time won the play-off final 2–0 against Bamber Bridge, earning promotion to the Premier Division. Darlington clinched their second successive promotion and the 2015–16 Northern Premier League Premier Division title on 21 April 2016 after beating Whitby Town 7–1. However, the club were unable to make it three promotions in a row, as despite finishing in the National League North play-off positions in 2016–17, ground grading issues prevented their participation.

===Return to Darlington F.C.===
In April 2017, the FA approved the club&#x27;s request to change to the traditional name of Darlington F.C. for the 2017–18 season.

In the summer of 2017, it was reported through the club website that work had begun on a new playing area and a new seated stand, following the addition of more fundraising.

In October 2017, Gray resigned as manager to join rivals York City. He was succeeded by former player Tommy Wright, with another former player Alan White as his assistant. Wright led Darlington to a 12th and 16th-place finish respectively during the two seasons he was in charge before leaving by mutual consent in April 2019.

In May 2019, Wright was succeeded by another former player Alun Armstrong who joined from Blyth Spartans. Assistant Manager Alan White also left the club in July 2019 before replacing him with another former player Darren Holloway a week later.

In Armstrong&#x27;s first season as manager, Darlington qualified for the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since they were reformed in 2012, including wins all away from home against Trafford, Leamington and Tamworth. In the first round, they played away again against League Two side Walsall and the match finished 2–2 with midfielder Joe Wheatley getting a 97th-minute equaliser to get a replay at Blackwell Meadows. Darlington did then lose the first round replay 1–0 in a record crowd since their first game at Blackwell Meadows with the attendance of 3,106, which was shown in front of the BT Sport cameras.

After a 10th-place finish in the 2019–20 season, the 2020-21 campaign was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Darlington finished 13th in 2021–22 and after being top of the league in January 2023, fell to 10th in the 2022–23 season. The poor run continued into the 2023–24 season, and Armstrong was dismissed on 6 September 2023. Josh Gowling replaced Armstrong, but only lasted three months before he was dismissed after only winning three out of sixteen games during his tenure and left the club second bottom in the league. Steve Watson replaced Gowling and brought Terry Mitchell from Workington with him as his assistant manager. They guided Darlington to a 16th-place finish after being 9 points adrift from safety at one stage of the season and winning 10 out of the last 15 games of the season, completing &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

==Colours and badge==
In 1888, Darlington&#x27;s kit consisted of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors&#x27; names have appeared on Darlington&#x27;s shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.

The club badge is in the form of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, is in the club&#x27;s home colour of white, the larger is red, their traditional away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts George Stephenson&#x27;s Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Quakers&quot;, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.

==Stadiums==
Feethams was originally used by Darlington Cricket Club, but began to be used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand at the turn of the century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. Floodlights were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major negative effect on the club&#x27;s finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the floodlights were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.
The 25,000-seat Reynolds Arena was opened in 2003, at a cost of £18 million. The first match at the new stadium was a 2–0 loss to Kidderminster Harriers on 16 August 2003. The attendance of 11,600 still stands as a record for the ground. After Reynolds left the club, the stadium had a variety of sponsored names, but it is generally known as the Darlington Arena. The capacity was restricted to just 10,000 because of county and local planning regulations, but attendances rarely reached 3,000, and in 2011, the club&#x27;s receivers put it up for sale. In May 2012, Darlington confirmed they would no longer play at the Arena. Later that year, it was bought by Darlington Mowden Park R.F.C.

Before the stadium was sold, there was interest by the local council to build a new railway station next to the stadium as part of the Tees Valley Metro scheme to improve public access to D.F.C matches. The scheme also included better services to Darlington and Saltburn, new rollingstock, as well as possible street running to Darlington town centre. However, the rail scheme was eventually abandoned by 2011, and unlike other proposed stations in the project, Darlington Arena never received a station.

Plans had originally been laid down to groundshare with Shildon, but arrangements were eventually for Darlington to share Bishop Auckland&#x27;s Heritage Park ground from the start of the 2012/13 season. In December 2013, it was confirmed that a deal had been reached in principle for the football team to share Darlington RFC&#x27;s ground at Blackwell Meadows ground, and thus return to the town of Darlington. In March 2016, it was confirmed that Darlington aimed to relocate by the start of the 2016/17 season, with expansion plans in place to increase the capacity to 3,000, as required for promotion to the National League. In the event, they played their first match at Blackwell Meadows on 26 December 2016, a 3–2 National League North win against F.C. Halifax Town in front of 3,000 spectators. Darlington expanded the seated stand at Blackwell Meadows to seat 588 in 2018, after a successful funding drive by their fans, allowing for the club to be promoted to the National League. This was built following the 2016–17 season, where Darlington finished the season in the playoff, but were disqualified from playing due to the inadequate number of seats at Blackwell Meadows. The club continues to explore further ways to improve Blackwell Meadows, including a stand at the currently empty west end of the ground.

As of 2025, Darlington FC are attempting to lock down a site for a new ground, so they can enjoy increased revenue and continue to kick on. 

==Supporters and rivalries==
Darlington&#x27;s supporters consider Hartlepool United their main rivals. The feeling is reciprocated: in a 2008 survey, 95% of supporters of both clubs named the other as their bitterest rivals. They have fierce competition each time they come up against each other. The clubs, based apart, had met 147 times in the Football League, as of 2009–10, of which Hartlepool won 60 to Darlington&#x27;s 57. The meeting between the two clubs in 2007 attracted a crowd of 10,121 to the Darlington Arena, the largest attendance for that League fixture for 50 years, though the average League attendance at the stadium declined from over 5,000 in its opening season to 2,744 in 2009–10.

In the 2012–13 season, Darlington&#x27;s first season as a renamed club, its main rivals were Spennymoor Town owing to the hotly contested title for the Northern League. Spennymoor Town had won the league for the three previous years, but had not applied for promotion until the 2012–13 season when Darlington entered the league. Spennymoor Town were the only club to contend with Darlington for the title towards the end of the season. To a lesser extent, landlords Bishop Auckland were also rivals owing to their shared home ground. In the 2014–15 season, Darlington once again locked horns with Spennymoor Town after they achieved promotion from the Northern League in 2014. Again, they contested Darlington for promotion in a semi-final playoff match that Darlington won 3–2. The rivalry with Spennymoor was re-ignited in 2017–18 when Spennymoor booked their place in the National League North, with the first game ending all square 1–1 at Blackwell Meadows on 28 August 2017.

The team&#x27;s mascots included Mr Q, &quot;a flat-looking cartoon man with a very big hat&quot;, Darlo Dog, a Dalmatian who was once ejected from the ground for climbing on the advertising boards in front of television cameras, and a panda named Feethams. Fanzines included &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;, first published in the early 1990s, and &quot;Where&#x27;s The Money Gone&quot;, whose teenage editor, along with the editor of the &quot;Darlo Uncovered&quot; website, were among several supporters banned from the ground by chairman George Reynolds for criticising the running of the club. Since 2013, a fan-run internet radio station, Darlo Fans Radio, has provided commentary on Darlington matches both home and away.

Darlington had an official supporters&#x27; club and an away supporters group, known as Darlington Away Far Travelling Supporters (DAFTS), who represented Darlington supporters from places elsewhere in the country. A supporters&#x27; trust was founded in 2002; it established a Disabled Supporters Group, tried to maintain a working relationship between club and supporters, and, together with the Darlington Camera Club, staged a &quot;Farewell to Feethams&quot; exhibition in celebration of the club&#x27;s longtime home.

In October 2016, it was announced that Horden Colliery Welfare would move 30 miles to Darlington to become the reserve team of Darlington; they will change their name to Darlington 1883 Reserves and play on the 4G surface at Eastbourne Sports Complex. Horden chairman Norman Stephens said &quot;If the move had not have happened, Horden would have been dead by Xmas&quot;. Stephens and some of the playing staff were retained by Darlington who took Horden&#x27;s place in the Wearside League. They played their first game under the new name on 6 October in a 1–0 away defeat to Boldon C.A.

In June 2024, Darlington announced that they would be forming an Under 23s team. The team would be a continuation of Grant Cuthbertson and John Walters&#x27; U18s team, that won 3 successive county cups, and would be entering the Wearside League Division Three. Numerous players completed the step up between the teams during the 2024-25 season, including Matthew Kirokiro and Will Maddison

==Records==
Darlington&#x27;s highest league finish was fifteenth in the Football League Second Division, during the 1925–26 season. The club&#x27;s best performance in the FA Cup has been two appearances in the last 16 of the competition. This first was in 1910–11, when they lost to Swindon Town in the third round. The second was in the 1957–58 season, when they beat Chelsea 4–1 in a replay to reach the fifth round, in which they lost 6–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club&#x27;s best League Cup performance was reaching the quarter-final in the 1967–68 season.

The Quakers&#x27; biggest home win was a 13–1 defeat of Scarborough in the FA Cup on 24 October 1891. Their best away win in the Football League was on 22 October 1921, when they beat Durham City 7–3 in the Third Division North. They achieved 7–1 wins in the Northern League Division One against Billingham Town in October 2012 and Hebburn Town in February 2013, and in the Northern Premier League against Whitby Town in April 2016.

The player with the most league appearances for Darlington is Ron Greener with 439 between 1955 and 1967. He made a total of 490 senior appearances for the club. Alan Walsh scored a club-record 87 league goals between 1978 and 1984, and scored 100 goals for Darlington overall. The most league goals scored for the club by a single player in a season is 39, by David Brown in the 1924–25 season. Franz Burgmeier has the most senior international appearances while a Darlington player, with seven caps for Liechtenstein in the 2008–09 season.

===Dream team===
As part of the 2003 &quot;Farewell to Feethams&quot; celebrations, a competition in the club programme selected the following all-time &quot;Dream Team&quot;: Mark Prudhoe, Ron Greener, Craig Liddle, Kevan Smith, John Peverell, Andy Toman, David McLean, Alan Sproates, Alan Walsh, Marco Gabbiadini and Colin Sinclair. Gabbiadini, scorer of 53 goals in his two seasons at Darlington, was voted greatest ever player.

==Notes==
A. The Darlington Arena was built to hold 25,000 seated spectators, yet a condition was imposed at the planning stage that &quot;at no time should the owner of the property admit or permit the admission of more than 10,000 people to the new stadium&quot;. Capacity was for a time restricted to 6,000 for weekend events and 4,500 for midweek events unless prior written permission was granted to exceed those limits.

B. Though not the &quot;first&quot; FA Cup match to be played under lights, as the club history suggests: a preliminary round replay between Kidderminster Harriers and Brierley Hill Alliance took place under floodlights on 14 September 1955, some two months before Darlington&#x27;s match against Carlisle United.

<text>Doncaster Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club based in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. The team compete in League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. The club play their home games at the Eco-Power Stadium, having moved from Belle Vue in 2007. Their home strip consists of red and white hoops, which has been the main design of the club&#x27;s home shirt since 2001 through different variations.

The club was founded in 1879 and turned professional six years later, moving to the Intake Ground. They entered the Midland League in 1891 and were elected into the Football League in 1901. The club lost re-election votes in 1903 and 1905 and so returned to the Midland League. They were admitted into the Football League for a third and final time in 1923 and went on to win the Third Division North in 1934–35. The club won two further Third Division North titles in 1946–47 and 1949–50, having been relegated from the Second Division in 1937 and 1948. Doncaster found themselves in the Fourth Division after suffering consecutive relegations in 1958 and 1959, though would go on to win the Fourth Division title in 1965–66 and 1968–69. The club continued to move between the third and fourth tiers, winning promotions in 1980–81 and 1983–84 and relegations in 1983 and 1988, before suffering relegation into non-League football in 1998.

Doncaster regained their Football League status after winning the 2003 Conference play-offs and then went on to win the Third Division title in 2003–04. They won the Football League Trophy in 2007 and the next year won the League One play-offs to secure a place in the second tier for the first time since 1958. They spent four of the next five seasons in the Championship, winning the League One title in 2012–13, though were relegated out of the Championship in 2012 and 2014. Relegated into League Two in 2016, they won an immediate promotion in 2016–17 and remained in League One until relegation in 2022.

==History==
===Early years===
The club was formed in 1879 by Albert Jenkins, a fitter at Doncaster&#x27;s Great Northern Railway works. He gathered together some friends to play a match against the Yorkshire Institute for the Deaf in September 1879. The institute side took a 4–0 lead but the game ended as a 4–4 draw. On walking back from the game, the team took a rest at the Hall Cross, and had a discussion in which they decided to play more and called themselves Doncaster Rovers.

The first match under the name was on 3 October 1879, a draw away against Rawmarsh. The club turned professional in 1885. Gradually, they became the main team in the town, and appear to have had their first professional players in 1887–88.

Rovers first entered the FA Cup in 1888–89, losing 9–1 to Rotherham Town at home. Season 1890–91 was to be a significant move forward. The club were a founder member of the Midland Alliance League and came second. The following season, saw them enter the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA Challenge Cup, beating Sheffield United 2–1 at Bramall Lane to win the final. That same season, they also moved up to the Midland League, becoming Champions in 1896–97 and 1898–99.

They were first elected to the Football League in 1901, as a replacement for New Brighton Tower. Their first season in the League was in fact the one when Doncaster achieved their highest position ever (7th in the Football League Second Division). They only lasted two seasons in the league before being voted out in favour of local rivals Bradford City, having finished the 1902 season in the bottom three.

They spent the following season in the Midland League, only managing 11th place out of 18 but were elected back to Division 2. This time, in 1904–05, Doncaster finished bottom with W3 D2 L29, adrift by 12 points, gaining only 8 points – an unfortunate still standing record. They were voted out once again. The following several seasons saw them finish lower midtable of the Midland League, till between 1910 and 1913 they had greater success. The last few years before the war mediocrity returned, and in August 1914 debts run up over the years led to voluntary liquidation. However, a new club was formed in time for the 1914–15 season and was accepted into the Midland League to continue where the old club had left off. The outbreak of the First World War meant the club closed down, and the army took over its ground using it as a depot.

===Inter war period===
The club re-formed as a limited company after the war in 1919, rejoining the Midland League a year later playing at their new temporary Bennetthorpe Ground. The first two seasons Rovers finished lower-mid table. The third season they moved to Belle Vue, finished runners up and were accepted into the Football League Division 3 North for 1923–24 to replace Stalybridge Celtic.

The first match back in the Football League was a 0–0 draw against Wigan Borough at Belle Vue on 25 August 1923, with Rovers playing in red tops with white shorts. One of the players in that first match was Rovers legend Tom Keetley who went on to become the club&#x27;s highest scorer with 186 goals in 241 appearances. Doncaster ended the season in 9th place. The next few seasons saw them rise towards the top of the table, then decline towards the bottom, before in the early 1930s finishing consistently near the top and finally becoming Champions in 1934–35.

Rovers spent two seasons in Division 2, relegated in 1936–37. However, they did well in the following two seasons before the outbreak of war, being runners up in Division 3 North, with only the champions being promoted at that time.

===Second World War – late 1990s===
Doncaster Rovers were involved in the longest ever competitive football match, against Stockport County at Edgeley Park on 30 March 1946, in a Division Three (North) cup tie. The match was deadlocked at 2–2 at 90 minutes, and after two 10-minute periods of extra time there was no further score. The rule at that time was that the game would carry on until one team scored. However, after 203 minutes, and with darkness closing in, the game was finally stopped. Fans were said to have left the game, gone home for their tea, and come back to watch the end of the game. The replay, at Doncaster, was won by Rovers 4–0, goals coming from Steven Bain, Billy Mortimer and a late double from Graeme Dunne.

In 1946–47 Doncaster set a record for the most games won in a league season (33), when they won the Third Division North title. The following season saw them relegated from the Second Division, but two years later with Peter Doherty as player-manager, they won the Third Division North again. This time they stayed in the Second Division for eight seasons, their most successful period to date.

During this time, several high class players were with Doncaster including Harry Gregg who kept goal, and was sold to Manchester United in December 1957 for £23,500. At the time, he was the most expensive goalkeeper in the world. He went on to help save lives in the Munich air disaster and was a regular goalkeeper for Northern Ireland. Another player, lesser known outside Doncaster, was Alick Jeffrey. Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, had lined him up to be bought, however in October 1956 Jeffrey badly broke his leg playing for England under-23s. This ended his move and any chance of what was seen to be an almost certain glittering international career to come. Doncaster suffered two consecutive relegations in 1958 and 1959 to drop to the Fourth Division.

Billy Bremner, who achieved fame for his playing career with Leeds United and Scotland, managed Doncaster twice, his final spell ending in November 1991 – six years before his death.

===Richardson era===
During the early 1990s, Ken Richardson, who was later described by detectives as &quot;the type that would trample a two-year-old child to pick up a 2p bit&quot;, took over as the majority shareholder of the club. He ploughed a lot of money into Doncaster Rovers with one thing on his mind, a new stadium. When he was refused a new stadium by the council he soon lost interest. Richardson hired three men to torch Belle Vue and planned to sell the ground to developers. The attempt put Richardson in jail for four years, ruined Belle Vue and Rovers were edging closer to relegation. In 1998 Rovers dropped out of the league with a −83 goal difference. He withdrew his financial backing and as a result the club was subject to an administration order. The better players left to ease some of the financial burden but unfortunately, the players who were left at Rovers were just not up to the task. The fans blamed Richardson for effectively destroying Rovers and even a funeral was held at Belle Vue on the last game of the 1997/98 season complete with coffin along Carr House Road. Just weeks after Rovers were relegated, Richardson was found guilty of trying to set fire to the Rovers ground, apparently hoping to pay off the club&#x27;s debts with the insurance money.

===The rise===
The Westferry Consortium took over the club just before the beginning of the 1998–99 season with a commitment to invest heavily in the club. The details of this season are collected in Ian McMahon&#x27;s book &quot;The Only Way Is Up&quot;. They also brought in John Ryan as a non-executive chairman and he took over at the end of this season. Having aspirations of returning it to the second tier where he had seen them when he was a boy, he stated he would build a new stadium within ten years, both of which he went on to achieve within the ten years. Doncaster found their best form in 50 years in the 2000s.

After five seasons in the Conference League, under the helm of manager Dave Penney the club returned to the fourth tier (known at the time as Division Three) after winning the 2003 Conference play-off final, in the only sudden death goal (also known as a &quot;Golden Goal&quot; and officially known as &quot;Promotion Goal&quot; in this game) in history of English football promotion play-offs. In 2003–04, the first season they were back in the Football League, Rovers achieved promotion to the third tier as champions. Doncaster were the first team to win the Fourth Division/Third Division (fourth level) Championship three times, 1966, 1969, and 2004. Football League rules state that any team who wins a trophy three times can keep it. When Rovers tried to retain ownership of the actual Third Division trophy, the Football League claimed that Rovers could not keep the trophy because the league names had changed from &quot;Fourth&quot; to &quot;Third&quot; Division, and so they had not won that particular league three times. Doncaster were the last team to win Division Three before it was renamed League Two.

In 2005–06, Doncaster beat two Premiership teams in the League Cup – Manchester City and Aston Villa. They reached the quarter finals of the competition where they met Arsenal. They went ahead in normal time and Arsenal equalised, and in extra time Rovers went up for a second time but Gilberto Silva equalised in injury time and the North London side went on to win on penalties.

Penney left in August 2006 feeling he had taken the club as far as he could and was swiftly replaced with former AFC Bournemouth manager Sean O&#x27;Driscoll, with Richard O&#x27;Kelly as assistant manager.

A new stadium was completed in December 2006. Doncaster&#x27;s first game at the new Keepmoat Stadium was against Huddersfield Town on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2007 and the first goal scored at the Stadium was by Mark McCammon.

===2007–present===
On 1 April 2007, Doncaster Rovers travelled with their new manager to the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff to play Bristol Rovers in the Football League Trophy final. Playing in front of over 59,000 people, this was Rovers&#x27; first major cup final in the club&#x27;s history. They got off to the perfect start when a tap in from Jonathan Forte and a brilliant finish from Paul Heffernan put Rovers 2–0 up within the first 5 minutes. However, after a brave fight back from Bristol Rovers, the game finished 2–2, so it went to extra time. In the second half of extra time a Sean Thornton corner was headed home by skipper Graeme Lee who had come forward from his central defensive position. Doncaster held on to claim their first major trophy.

2007–08 proved to be one of the most exciting seasons in Doncaster&#x27;s history. After a slow start they were in serious contention for a top-six finish for much of the second half of the season. Defeat away at Cheltenham Town on the final day of the season cost them automatic promotion and they finished third, with Nottingham Forest taking 2nd place. After a 0–0 draw away to Southend United in the playoff semifinals first leg, Rovers beat their opponents 5–1 at home in the second leg including a James Coppinger hat-trick to advance to the League One play-off final at Wembley on Sunday 25 May 2008 where they beat Leeds United 1–0 to move into Football League Championship after a half century absence. A James Hayter headed goal in the 47th minute was enough to secure victory in front of over 75,000 fans at Wembley.

The first half of the 2008–09 season saw Doncaster struggling to adapt to the Championship despite a promising start with an away win over newly relegated Derby County. A long run of bad results saw them bottom of the Championship on 20 December 2008 following a narrow 1–0 defeat to Wolves at home. Rovers managed to turn things around soon after and enjoyed an undefeated run of 8 Championship games, starting with a thrilling 4–2 win at relegation rivals Nottingham Forest on Boxing Day. The win against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday 14 February was especially memorable considering it was the first time Doncaster had defeated the Owls in any league competition. The streak ended at the hands of Swansea City on Saturday 21 February after a 3–1 defeat at the Liberty Stadium. Doncaster Rovers secured their place in the Championship for the 2009–10 season after an emphatic 3–0 win at Home Park against Plymouth Argyle. Doncaster ended their first season in the Championship comfortably in 14th position, finishing above 8 former Premier League teams, including Charlton Athletic, Southampton, Crystal Palace and Derby County. The survival was also a major feat, as before the start of that season, they were tipped by many as strong favourites for relegation.

Doncaster finished the 2009–10 season marginally better than their first season back in the Championship, in 12th and earning two more points than the previous season with 60 points. This was despite a promising period towards the end of the season which saw Doncaster close to the play-off places, thanks in part to Sheffield United loanee Billy Sharp who scored 15 goals during his stay. The 2009–10 season&#x27;s success became a football league record. Having become the first team to be bottom of the table at Christmas, but still managed to survive the drop.

The 2010–11 season proved to be Doncaster&#x27;s most trying season in the Championship thus far. Despite a club record signing of £1.15 million for Billy Sharp, the season was plagued by injuries to key players, as well as poor form. They finished in 21st place, 6 points clear of relegated local rivals Sheffield United and Scunthorpe United.
Rovers struggled in the 2011–12 season; seven games into the season, Rovers had failed to win a game ( no wins, one draw, six losses). This led to the sacking of manager Sean O&#x27;Driscoll and assistant manager Richard O&#x27;Kelly. On 23 September 2011, Dean Saunders was unveiled as the new boss, leaving Wrexham. His reign started unbeaten in three games. With the controversial help of football agent Willie McKay, Rovers brought in several players on loans and short-term contracts, and on low wages, including El Hadji Diouf, Pascal Chimbonda, Herita Ilunga, Carl Ikeme, Frédéric Piquionne, and Habib Beye. However, Doncaster were relegated to League One with three games still to play. Many supporters blamed the failure to stay in the Championship on McKay&#x27;s involvement, others felt it was worth the try. At the end of the 2011–12 season, chairman John Ryan deemed the McKay &quot;experiment&quot; over as it &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot; and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t work in the third tier&quot; anyway.

The squad was rebuilt for the 2012–13 season with 19 players leaving. Expectations were low, but after an average start, Saunders&#x27; team ended up firmly in the promotion positions by the end of 2012. On 7 January, Saunders filled the vacant managers position at Wolves and on 17 January caretaker manager Brian Flynn was given the permanent managers job till the end of the season with Rob Jones as player coach. In an incredible finale to the season at Griffin Park, they beat Brentford 0–1 when James Coppinger scored in the last seconds of 5 minutes of added time, only seconds after Brentford&#x27;s Marcello Trotta had hit a penalty against the crossbar. If Brentford had won, they would have been promoted and Doncaster would have to compete in the play-offs. As it was, the goal put Doncaster one point above Bournemouth as champions.

Following promotion to the Championship for the 2013–14 season, Brian Flynn was moved to become Director of Football and overseeing the newly formed &quot;development squad&quot; which would be playing competitive games. Paul Dickov was brought in as manager with Brian Horton as his assistant. To boost support for their chosen charity, Bluebell Wood Children&#x27;s Hospice, the club signed One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson on a non-contract basis.

On 9 November, John Ryan gave an emotional farewell and stepped down as chairman of the club after 15 years, minutes before the kick-off against a championship encounter against Barnsley at Oakwell, amid reports of boardroom disagreements following a proposed takeover bid by a hedge-fund consortium led by Sequentia Capital. On 3 May 2014, Doncaster were relegated back to League One after just one season following a 1–0 defeat to Leicester City on the final day of the season.

Rovers finished the 2014–15 season in 13th place, before being relegated to League Two after finishing 21st in 2015–16 with new manager Darren Ferguson. The 2016–17 season saw them being promoted back to League One at the first attempt in 3rd position, missing out on the title on the final day of the season.

Darren Ferguson left his post in June 2018 and was replaced by another former Peterborough boss in Grant McCann ahead of the 2018–19 season. Under McCann, Rovers finished sixth in League One, qualifying for the end of season play-offs where they faced Charlton Athletic over two legs. A 2–1 defeat in the first leg and an early Krystian Bielik goal in the second left Rovers with a mountain to climb at The Valley, but goals from captain Tommy Rowe and Andy Butler forced extra time. John Marquis put Rovers ahead for the first time in extra time, only for Darren Pratley to equalise a minute later. Rovers lost the penalty shoot-out 4–3 with misses coming from Rowe and Marquis as they fell just short of making the Wembley Stadium showdown.

McCann left in the summer for Championship side Hull City and was replaced by former defender Darren Moore ahead of the 2019–20 campaign. With the club sitting around the play-offs in December, the club&#x27;s season looked to be going well. However, Moore moved to struggling Sheffield Wednesday on 1 March 2021, and Andy Butler was appointed as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Doncaster finished the season in 14th place in League One.

For the 2021–22 season, former trophy winning Doncaster Rovers player Richie Wellens was installed as first team manager, with Noel Hunt as assistant manager. Wellens was relieved of his duties as Doncaster Rovers manager on 2 December 2021. Doncaster appointed then under-18s manager Gary McSheffrey as the interim manager, later deciding that McSheffrey was a good fit, and gave him the position full-time on 29 December 2021. Doncaster Rovers finished the season in 22nd place, relegating them to League Two. Rovers then finished 18th in League Two in the 2022–2023 season, sacking McSheffrey in October 2022 then his successor Danny Schofield after the season&#x27;s end, before re-appointing Grant McCann as manager on 12 May 2023. McCann helped Rovers to a club record-equalling run of 10 successive wins to climb into the top seven in the final week of the 2023–24 season, though the club lost on penalties to Crewe Alexandra at the play-off semi-final stage.

==Stadium==
===1885–1915 – Intake Ground===

For the first six years the club began playing their games wherever they could, on playing fields at Town Moor and the Racecourse. They gained a permanent ground in 1885 when they started playing their games near the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and so was known as the Deaf and Dumb Ground. A year later the stadium was officially named as the Intake Ground. A few months after completion, the roof blew off the stand, and the same happened in 1894 on the press and team officials stand after a gale. They played their football there until August 1914 when the club went into liquidation. A new company did take over the club soon after but all English league competition was suspended in 1915 due to the First World War and the club was closed down and the ground turned into an Army depot.

===1920–1922 – Bennetthorpe Ground===
When the club was re-formed after the war in the summer of 1919, the Army were still occupying the old Intake Ground as a depot. They had wanted to move to Low Pastures but restrictions set by the local council meant this was not a viable option. The Club did not join the Midland League until 1920–21, by which time and as a temporary solution, a field was found on the south side of Bennetthorpe for which they were given a two-year lease. On the first day of the second season (1921–22) there, in the Midland League, the Bennetthorpe Ground saw 7,219 people watch Rovers against Gainsborough Trinity. The ground consisted of a small stand on one side and small organised terraces around the pitch. Some of the fencing/gates on Town Moor Avenue remain.

===1922–2006 – Low Pasture, Belle Vue===

With council restrictions on the six acre Low Pastures site having been satisfactorily negotiated, the club moved there for the beginning of the 1922–23 season. Large amounts of ash from nearby coal tips was laid as a base for the pitch, serving it well throughout its years of use with superb drainage. Initially, there was a stand for 4,000 seated fans with terracing in front for another 3,000. The ground had a unique feature in that home and away teams had separate entrances. The stadium was opened in 1922 by Charles Sutcliffe, a representative of the Football League when it was named Belle Vue. The first match there was against Gainsborough Trinity in the Midland League with an attendance of 10,000. After two years, shelter was added for standing spectators on the &quot;Popular Side&quot;. A few years later in 1927, the stand from the Bennet Thorpe Ground was jacked up and moved to the new venue providing a sheltered stand at the &quot;Town End&quot;. The &quot;Popular Side&quot; was extended in 1927 and concreted in 1928. Turnstiles, gates and fencing were added in 1935, and in 1938 the &quot;Popular Side&quot; stand roof was replaced and put further back increasing the capacity of Belle Vue to 40,000. In 1947 the stadium recorded its highest attendance of 37,099 against Hull City, although apocryphal accounts refute this and claim that many more gained entry to the ground by climbing over walls and thus avoided having to pay.

Following the Bradford City stadium fire disaster, in 1985 the wooden &quot;Cow Shed&quot;, as the old Bennetthorpe stand was known, had to be removed for safety reasons. Mining subsidence in 1987 meant much of the &quot;Pop Side&quot; was removed, drastically reducing the grounds capacity to around 10,000. Further safety conditions imposed after the Hillsborough disaster led the capacity to fall to 7,294.

When the Westferry Consortium took over the club in 1998 one of the first guarantees was to help establish a new stadium for the club. Belle Vue had never been upgraded heavily since 1938 and despite minor cosmetic changes and the addition of some seating was really showing its age by the time Westferry took over. Despite this, some improvements were made in the last few years of its use as the club rose out of the conference, through Division 3 and into League 1. The Town End terracing was made safe and usable with portacabins added as executive stands behind it. The Rossington End was also extended and updated, with the capacity in its final years rising to around 11,500.

In 2003 it was renamed the Earth Stadium after Earth Finance started sponsoring the ground. Belle Vue was Doncaster&#x27;s home for 84 years.

===2007–present – Keepmoat/Eco-Power Stadium===

A new 15,231 all-seated stadium owned by Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council and rented by the club, was completed in December 2006. The first game at the new Keepmoat Stadium was against Huddersfield Town on New Year&#x27;s Day, 2007. The game also saw the first three red cards in the new stadium. Doncaster Rovers&#x27; centre forward Mark McCammon was the first player ever to score on the new pitch in a football match. The official opening of the Keepmoat Stadium was on 3 August 2007, with Doncaster Rovers playing a Manchester United XI in front of a crowd of 13,080. United won the game 2–0 with Anderson making his debut for them.

On 19 June 2012 it was confirmed that Doncaster Rovers had secured a 99-year operating lease from the council to lead the management of the Keepmoat stadium with a view to improving operating results. The change placed the club back in charge of its home stadium after the period of renting since its move from Belle Vue (also leased from the council) in 2007. On 11 August 2012, the stadium was officially handed over to chairman John Ryan in a presentation before the League Cup tie with York City.

On 27 December 2021, the stadium underwent a name change in line with the sponsorship rights being handed over from Keepmoat Homes to the Eco-Power Group.

==Training facilities==
Doncaster train at Cantley Park which has been their main training facility since June 2000. The site was originally leased from Case IH.

==Crests==

Like most of the early English football clubs, the original crest adopted by Doncaster Rovers was that of the local coat of arms. The coat of arms of Doncaster at the time was of two lions holding Yorkshire roses in their mouths as well as a red shield depicting the old medieval Doncaster Castle. The coat of arms is primarily red and white which explains the team&#x27;s decision to adopt red and white as their colours. The club stopped using Doncaster&#x27;s coat of arms in 1972 when the Viking crest was introduced.

In the sixties Doncaster council denied Rovers permission to use the coat of arms and therefore a competition was held, from which the best design would be selected as the club&#x27;s new badge. The winner and current crest was designed by a group of local students and named &quot;the Viking&quot;.

When the new crest was introduced it included a monochrome Viking image overlaying a red and white circle, which denoted the club&#x27;s colours, along with the year of the club&#x27;s formation 1879. The Viking image would become known as &quot;The Turk&#x27;s Head&quot;. Also included on the crest was a shield with the club&#x27;s initials – D.R.F.C. as well as the Yorkshire white rose in reference to the club&#x27;s location. The inset shield was also coloured red and white to denote the team colours. In the early 1990s the crest was altered, omitting the red and white circle background and the Viking image was coloured gold.

A further modification to the Doncaster Rovers crest was introduced in 2006 and used until 2012. This version included a new Yorkshire rose design on the shield as well as a slightly different Viking image in dark yellow.

The club reverted to the previously used design in 2012 with a two-tone gold background. This is the version still in use by the club today.

==Kits and sponsorship==

From 1879 to 1885 Doncaster played in blue and white, and since then red and white. The club&#x27;s first strip was a navy blue and white strip with a yellow diagonal cross. The kit uniquely included a blue Tam o&#x27; Shanter with a red toorie at the centre. A solid red shirt with a black collar was the first design adopted when the club first entered the English Football league in 1901. Since 2001 the club have played in a red and white hooped home shirt.

The home shirts have been red and white hooped (44 seasons), solid red (37), solid white (18), and red and white striped (10).

In recent years, Rovers have had a third kit each season promoting mental health charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM), with proceeds of certain home games being donated to the charity.
LNER pledged their sponsorship for 2 further years after the 2018–2019 season. Stoneacre also agreed a new contract with the club to last until the end of the 2021–2022 season extending the partnership to 13 years.

*This sponsor appears on the back of the home kit

==Mascot==
The team&#x27;s mascot, previously portrayed by Andrew Liney, is a brown dog known as &quot;Donny Dog&quot; that wears a red and white Rovers jersey. Before a scheduled appearance during the game against Huddersfield Town at the Galpharm Stadium on 4 March 2006, police prevented Liney from entering the stadium in costume, citing unspecified &quot;police intelligence&quot;, and refused him permission to wear any part of the costume within 50 metres of the stadium. Mr Liney later received a full written apology for these unfounded allegations from the head of West Yorkshire Police. The mascot was next portrayed by Tracy Chandler and in June 2011, she was relieved from the position after she posed in her underwear for a Sunday newspaper. Later in the same week she was reinstated back as the club&#x27;s mascot.

A second mascot, a yellow haired and bearded Viking with a helmet and wearing the away shirt named Eric the Viking, made its first appearance at the home game against Yeovil on 25 February 2013.

==Fanzine==
Doncaster Rovers&#x27; fanzine is called &quot;Popular Stand&quot; which was first launched on 17 January 1998. Previously there have been several other fanzines &quot;Raise The Roof&quot;, &quot;Warboys is still God&quot; and &quot;Keegan Was Crap Really&quot; which are no longer being published. The fanzine sells at £1 which is the same price as when it was first published in 1998. All of its profits of the fanzine are donated to Doncaster Rovers or related causes. Popular Stand is currently edited by Glen Wilson.

In 2016 Popular Stand won the Football Supporters&#x27; Federation Fanzine of the Year.

==Rivalries==
Doncaster Rovers&#x27; main rivals are Rotherham United, Barnsley, and Scunthorpe United, with Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United, Chesterfield, Leeds United, Mansfield Town, Grimsby Town, Bradford City and Nottingham Forest all being rivalries to a lesser extent.

==In popular culture==
===TV===
In 1998 Rovers featured in a documentary on Yorkshire Television. This episode titled &quot;Trading Places&quot; documents and contrasts the 1997–98 season for two of the region&#x27;s football clubs; Rovers heading out of the Football League and Halifax Town heading the opposite the way as Champions of the Conference. Also in 1998 the club was featured in the 1998 Channel 5 &#x27;fly-on-the-wall&#x27; documentary &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Rovers&quot; in which it showed the fall of Rovers. In the early 1980s there was a documentary about Billy Bremner as the manager of Rovers. The documentary is notable not only for the inside look at the pre-match preparations, warm-up conducted in the dressing rooms, starting line-up read out as if it is coming to Bremner there and then, but for such rare footage of early 1980s Belle Vue, with a full-size Popular Stand and the Cow Shed still standing at the Town End.

<text>Kidderminster Harriers Football Club are a professional association football club based in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England. The team competes in the National League North, the sixth level of the English football league system.

Formed in 1886, Harriers have spent their entire history at Aggborough Stadium. They have won the Worcestershire Senior Cup a record 27 times and are the only club from the county ever to have played in the English Football League. Founder members of the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1889, they merged with Kidderminster Olympic the next year and entered the Midland League as Kidderminster F.C., though folded due to financial difficulties in March 1891. Kidderminster Harriers reverted to amateur status and rejoined the Birmingham &amp; District League, though it would take until 1937–38 for them to claim their first league title, which they retained the following year. They joined the Southern League in 1948, though reverted to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1960. They won four further league titles: 1964–65, 1968–69, 1969–70 and 1970–71. Harriers switched to the Southern League Division One North in 1972 and were promoted to the Alliance Premier League at the end of the 1982–83 season.

Kidderminster Harriers won the FA Trophy in 1987 and were crowned Conference champions in 1993–94, though Graham Allner&#x27;s team were denied a place in the Football League due to the state of Aggborough. The club improved the stadium and were admitted after winning the title again under Jan Mølby&#x27;s stewardship in 1999–2000. They remained in the Football League for five seasons, finishing as high as tenth in the Third Division in 2002, before being relegated out of League Two three years later. They finished second in the Conference in 2012–13, but were beaten in the play-off semi-finals, and were relegated from the National League in 2016. They qualified for the National League North play-offs in 2017, 2018 and 2022 before winning the play-off final in 2023 to return to the National League after seven years.

==History==
Kidderminster Harriers were formed in 1886 from a highly successful athletics and rugby union club that had existed since 1877. In July 1880 the Athletics club amalgamated with the local Clarence rugby club to become &#x27;Kidderminster Harriers and Football Club&#x27;. Matches were played at White Wickets on the Franche Road in Kidderminster. 1885-6 was the last season played as a rugby club and the Harriers switched to Association rules for the next season.
===Olympic and Kidderminster F.C.===
Playing games at Chester Road (the current cricket ground) Harriers&#x27; first game was 18 September 1886, away to Wilden, winning 2–1. The town saw a rival team start up as Kidderminster Olympic in 1887, rapidly becoming one of the best sides in the area. In 1887–88 the club started playing its matches at Aggborough.

Both Olympic and Harriers were founder members of the Birmingham and District League in 1889, Olympic won the league in 1890, with Harriers runners-up. Both sides regularly attracted crowds of 2–4,000, with the local derbies seeing over 7,000 attending. Owing to their success soon after both Olympic and Harriers were subject to allegations of &#x27;professionalism&#x27; and illegal payments to players, although the League Committee let off both clubs with a warning about future conduct.

In 1890 the two clubs amalgamated as Kidderminster F.C. on a full professional basis, the new club being admitted to the Midland League which had been formed in 1889. The club became the first from the town to enter the FA Cup and after winning 4 qualifying-round games, reached the first round proper (last 32). They lost 3–1 away to Darwen but protested the result because of the poor state of the pitch. Their protest was upheld and the tie was replayed a week later, again at Darwen, where Darwen won 13–0. However the club found things difficult financially as a fully professional club, and, with debts of £369, resigned from the league and was wound up in March 1891.

===Birmingham League===
The club reverted to amateur status in the Birmingham and District League the following season as Kidderminster Harriers. The club again reached the 1st Round of the FA Cup in 1906–07, losing to Oldham Athletic away 5–0. In 1910 the then current England international full-back Jesse Pennington signed for Harriers after a dispute with his then club West Bromwich Albion. He played one game before the dispute was resolved and he returned to Albion.

The twenties were hard going for the club as poor form on the pitch and financial problems off it took their toll. Harriers did manage a League runners-up place in 1924–25. In this season Harriers made national headlines by signing Stanley Fazackerley, who had been the first £5,000 transfer in English football and scorer of the FA Cup Final winning goal for Sheffield United in 1915. After a pay dispute, he had been given 14 days notice by his then club Wolverhampton Wanderers and had returned to the public house he managed in the city, where a Harriers fan drinking there overheard the news and quickly contacted the Harriers Secretary. The then Wolves captain George Getgood, also in contractual dispute at the time, also signed for Harriers in a double swoop.

The 1927–28 season saw another accusation of bribery, this time against secretary Pat Davis by Cradley Heath. During an investigation Davis admitted he had offered Burton Town players a ten shillings bonus if they managed to beat Worcester City in the last match of the season. The match was drawn so the bonus was never paid. The case made the national newspapers and Pat Davis was temporarily suspended from all duties.

Harriers proved a rich source of young quality players picked up by professional football clubs at this time, those moving to bigger clubs including full back Billy Blake (Crystal Palace), winger Fred Leedham (transferred to West Bromwich Albion for £300), Dennis Jennings (to Huddersfield Town for £600) and forward Norman Brookes (to Walsall for £70). In 1935–36 a new scoring record for the club was set, with Billy Boswell scoring 64 goals in a single season.

===Southern League===
Harriers did not win the West Midlands League until 1938, finishing the season undefeated. They moved to the Southern League the following year, but played just two games because of the onset of World War II.

They rejoined the Southern League in 1948. Their first game was a 1–1 draw with Chingford Town in front of 3,889. Future Football Association General Secretary Ted Croker was a Harriers player during the early 1950s, as was future England international striker Gerry Hitchens(1953–55). Harriers became the first team to host a floodlit FA Cup match, when on 14 September 1955 they played Brierley Hill Alliance in a preliminary round replay, which Harriers won 4–2. By 1956–57 the club was again in financial difficulties and after several seasons of struggle in 1960 the club voluntarily dropped back down to the Birmingham League.

During the 1964–72 era Harriers won the West Midland League four times (including three years running 1968–70), and the various County Senior Cups eight times. Brendan Wassall arrived at Aggborough and debuted on 17 October 1962 against Banbury Spencer. He went on to make 686 appearances up until 1975, and scored 269 goals. His son, Darren, played for Nottingham Forest, Birmingham City and Derby County.

In 1963 Peter Wassall joined the Harriers on the advice of his brother Brendan after spells with Wolves, Aston Villa and Atherstone Utd.
After a season in midfield he switched to play up front and went on to score a total of 448 goals in 621 games for the Harriers.
He joined Hereford Utd briefly in 1971 but returned to Aggborough a year later.

They were back to the Southern League by 1972–73 as part of Division One North, one level under the Southern League Premier.

===Conference===
Under player-manager Jon Chambers (ex Aston Villa) in 1983, Harriers were promoted to the Alliance Premier League (now the Conference) after finishing second to AP Leamington, who were refused entry on ground facility issues.

After a poor start to the first season in the Alliance, AP Leamington manager Graham Allner was appointed manager, marking the start of a 16-year association with the club. Despite not playing in Wales, they were invited to play in the Welsh Cup through the 1970s and 1980s, reaching the final in 1986 and again in 1989.

In July 1985, Allner signed striker Kim Casey from Gloucester City for £2,500. He previously played for Sutton Coldfield and AP Leamington. In his first season for the Harriers, Casey scored 73 goals in 69 games, a club record, and netted 47 the following season. He was transferred to Cheltenham Town in August 1990 for £25,000 before re-joining Harriers briefly in July 1995. For much of the eighties and nineties Casey partnered Paul Davies up front, Davies eventually logging 307 career goals in 656 games over 13 years for the club, while Casey hit nearly 200 goals in six seasons.

In 1989, Kidderminster Harriers launched their first Youth training scheme (YTS) – a first, because the club was still playing non-league football in the Vauxhall Conference. The first crop of players were Ian Clarke (Midfield/Defender), Ryan Rankin (Defender), Willie Bache (Midfield), Alan Knott (Forward), Richard Congrave (Forward), Russel Dodds (Midfield/Defender), Craig Gillett (Midfield) and Justin Taylor (Forward). The intake was coached by Graeme McKenzie and gained instance success finishing runners-up in their first season in the Midlands Floodlit league behind Hereford United.

In 1994, Harriers were Conference champions but were controversially refused promotion due to the Football League&#x27;s tightened fire safety regulations for stadiums after the Bradford City stadium fire. Aggborough&#x27;s main stand was of wooden construction and, despite assurances a new cantilever stand would be ready for the new season (which was completed on time), and considerable West Midlands media support, the Football League rejected Harriers&#x27; promotion. Ironically, the ground hosted an 8,000 crowd without any problems for the visit of West Ham United in that year&#x27;s 5th round FA Cup.

Harriers finished second to Macclesfield Town in 1997, but then finished in the bottom half in each of the next two seasons.

Harriers received the biggest sell-on fee for a former non-league club, picking up £700,000 when Lee Hughes joined Coventry City in August 2001. Harriers had sold Hughes to West Bromwich Albion in 1998 and under the sell-on clause negotiated by manager Allner at the time received 15% of any further transfer fee. This was activated when Hughes moved to Coventry City for a reported £5 million.

===Football League===
Backed by retired retail millionaire Chairman Lionel Newton, former Liverpool star Jan Mølby was appointed as manager for the 1999–2000 season. He signed Mike Marsh in November 1999 as a midfield general. He then led the club to the Conference title at the first attempt, beating Rushden &amp; Diamonds by nine points. Thereafter, low attendances (the town is close to several large Championship and Premier League sides) and lack of revenue following the ITV Digital collapse meant the club struggled to make a mark in the Football League, and after five seasons they were relegated back to the Conference National division.

A close-season boardroom takeover battle disrupted preparations for their first season back in the Conference; consequently the club struggled to maintain efforts towards a quick return to the Football League, ending up with a 15th-place finish in the Conference National. Ex-Harriers captain and former Doncaster Rovers, Cheltenham Town player and Burnley assistant coach Mark Yates took over as Manager from the sacked Stuart Watkiss during the season. He steered the club away from minor danger of relegation in the 2005–06 season and during his first full campaign, took the side to the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium for the first time in 12 years. They however lost 3–2 to Stevenage Borough in front of 53,262. Their league form however was less impressive, resulting in mid-table finishes for three consecutive seasons.

In December 2009 Mark Yates and his number two coach Neil Howarth left the club to take over as coaches at Cheltenham Town.

After a month of speculation and a number of names such as Jim Harvey and Jeff Kenna being mentioned as possible replacements for Mark Yates, Stalybridge Celtic Manager Steve Burr took over on an initial two-and-a-half-year contract, which was extended to 2014 in March 2011. The club finished sixth in Burr&#x27;s first season in charge. Burr&#x27;s second season in charge was largely similar to his first. Harriers again finished sixth, just one place outside the play off places. Harriers were given a 5-point deduction for submitting misleading financial information.

The 2012–13 season started badly for Harriers as they lost the first five games, drew the next five games. However, Harriers went on a run that saw them win 22 out of their last 23 games, including a run of 12 wins, putting them in contention for the title and promotion. In January, Harriers received a club record fee of £300,000 from Fleetwood Town for striker Jamille Matt. Following the departure of Matt, Harriers signed eventual top scorer Michael Gash from Cambridge United on loan till the end of the season with a clause that Harriers could make the deal permanent at the end of the season. The title race with Mansfield Town went down to the last day with Mansfield 2 points ahead. Harriers in front of a sold out 6,453 Aggborough beat Stockport County 4–0 which confirmed their relegation. Mansfield beat a weakened Wrexham side who were already guaranteed the play-offs 1–0. Harriers finished 2nd and played 5th place Wrexham in the play off semi-final. Harriers lost the first leg at the Racecourse Ground 2–1, Michael Gash scoring Harriers goal from the penalty spot. Harriers also lost the second leg, again in front of a sell out crowd 3–1, confirming a 5–2 aggregate loss and Conference football for another season.
After such a fantastic season, Harriers had 3 players in the Conference Team of the Year for the 2012–13 season, they were Anthony Malbon, Josh Gowling and Lee Vaughan.

Strong early form in the 2013–14 season found them in 2nd place which could not be sustained. In November 2013, Steve Burr walked out on Harriers to speak to Forest Green Rovers. The talks broke down and Burr returned to Harriers where the league form dipped rapidly. Harriers enjoyed a fine cup run beating League Two side Newport County in the second round and holding League One side Peterborough United 0–0 at Aggborough in the third round. However, Burr did not get chance to see the replay as a heavy 6–0 defeat away to Luton Town saw him sacked as Harriers manager on 7 January 2014. On 8 January, Andy Thorn was appointed manager, winning his first game in charge 3–0 at home to Salisbury, Joe Lolley&#x27;s first hat trick for the club and last league game as a move to Huddersfield Town was looming. Having agreed to let Lolley stay for the FA Cup replay, Lolley then netted the winning goal in a famous 3–2 win away to Peterborough United. The next day, Lolley moved to Huddersfield Town for a fee in the region of £250,000 having only been at the club for 6 months. Harriers league form dipped after the departure of Lolley and strain of the FA Cup run as Thorn was sacked after 54 days in charge following a run of only 3 wins in 10 games which also included the 1–0 FA Cup Fourth-round loss to Premier League Sunderland. On 5 March, Burr&#x27;s former number two Gary Whild was appointed Harriers manager for the final 13 games until the end of the season. Under Whild, Harriers lost only 1 of the last 13 games, but 6 draws meant that Harriers fell just short of the play-offs finishing the season in 7th.

In April 2014, it was announced Gary Whild would stay on as Harriers manager after signing a one-year rolling contract. The 2014/15 season started strongly for the Harriers, as they remained unbeaten in their first 7 games which propelled them into the play-offs. From September till December, Harriers went on a 15 games run where no result was the same back to back. Harriers inconsistent form left them outside the play-offs approaching the Christmas period. In November it was announced that Harriers were having money troubles and that the wage budget would have to be decreased. This led to key players Chey Dunkley and Nathan Blissett being loaned to Oxford United and Bristol Rovers respectively, both moves being made permanent in January. One other key influence on Harriers&#x27; declining league form was the state of the deteriorating pitch. The signs of two teams playing on the pitch was showing and grass was turning to mud. This showed through December and January, Harriers winning all 4 away matches but losing all 4 at home. Reducing the budget further in January, several players were released including key striker Michael Gash and instrumental midfielder Kyle Storer after just reaching 150 appearances for the club. However, this created the chance for former West Brom goal machine Lee Hughes to rejoin Kidderminster Harriers some 18 years after leaving the club, now 38, Hughes&#x27; contract at Forest Green Rovers was cancelled by mutual consent, allowing him to sign again at Aggborough. He began his career at Aggborough in 1994 and scored 70 goals in 139 games for Harriers before moving to West Brom in 1997. Hughes went on to score on his second debut for the Harriers in a 1–1 home draw against Woking. Harriers were sitting 6th after boxing day, with a game in hand to go into the playoffs. However, Harriers only won three of the last twenty games, losing twelve of those as they finished 16th in a tale of two halves season. At the end of the season, it was announced that Harriers only had five players contracted for next season and that the wage budget would be significantly reduced.

The Harriers began the 2014–15 in the same poor form they had finished on the last. Harriers were winless after 11 games, and in September 2015 it was announced Head Coach Gary Whild would be leaving the club. First team coaches Mark Creighton and Tim Flowers also left the club. The club was relegated from the National League at the end of the season.

====National League North====
On 21 April 2016, former Watford and Derby County midfielder John Eustace was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager. Eustace guided Harriers to a second-place finished in their first season in the National League North, before they were beaten by Chorley in the play-off semi-finals. After the culmination of the 2017–18 season, where Harriers again lost in the first round of the play-offs, this time to Bradford Park Avenue, manager John Eustace left the club to join Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers, and was replaced by Neil MacFarlane. MacFarlane was replaced by former manager Mark Yates in January 2019, as Harriers struggled to a mid-table finish. John Pemberton was installed as manager ahead of the 2019–20 season, although he too was replaced part-way through the season. After an early curtailing of the season, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Russ Penn and Jimmy O&#x27;Connor were appointed manager and joint-manager, respectively. In the 2021–22 season, the pair led Harriers to a fourth placed league finish, as well as the fourth round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Premier League side West Ham United. In the play-offs, Harriers exited at the first round, as they suffered a 2–1 defeat to Boston United.

In the 2022–23 season, Harriers won their last six consecutive league matches and a further three wins in the play-offs beating Alfreton Town in the play off eliminator 1–0, beating second placed Kings Lynn Town 4–1 in the play-off semi-final before winning the play-off final 2–0 against Brackley Town thanks to two goals from Ashley Hemmings to earn promotion to the National League after seven years&#x27; absence. On 7 January 2024, Penn was sacked with the club bottom of the National League. Although form initially picked up following the appointment of Phil Brown, the club were relegated in the penultimate match of the season.

==Cup success==

===Welsh Cup===
Harriers reached the Welsh Cup final in 1986, losing to Wrexham (2–1) in the replay after drawing the first game (1–1) and again reaching the final 1989, losing to Swansea City (5–0).

===FA Trophy===
In 1987 Harriers went to Wembley Stadium for the FA Trophy final against Burton Albion. The game was a 0–0 draw after extra time, but Kidderminster won 2–1 in the replay at The Hawthorns. They have reached the final on three occasions since, losing 2–1 to Wycombe Wanderers in 1991 in front of a crowd of 34,842 at the old Wembley and that remained the record attendance for a Trophy match until 2007 again when Kidderminster played Stevenage in another final. Kidderminster also lost 2–1 to Woking in 1995 final.
In 2007, Kidderminster again reached the final, losing 2–3 to Stevenage Borough, despite being 2–0 up at half time through two James Constable goals. Stevenage came back and scored the winner in the 88th minute in front of the new record trophy attendance of 53,262, which was also the very first competitive match to be held at the New Wembley.

===FA Cup===
Kidderminster have also had some success in the FA Cup. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion were entertained in the late 1960s as were Blackburn Rovers &amp; Millwall (first round) in successive seasons 1981 &amp; 1982. They reached the fifth round in 1994 (a feat not again equalled by a non-league team until Crawley Town F.C. achieved it in 2011, although Crawley were fully professional), shooting to national fame after defeating Birmingham City 2–1 away and Preston North End 1–0 at home in the previous two rounds. They then lost narrowly 0–1 at home in front of nearly 8,000 to West Ham United.

In 2004 Kidderminster again reached the third round to face Premier League team and local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, Harriers were one minute away from causing a massive shock before an 89th-minute equaliser forced a replay, the game finishing 1–1 at Aggborough Harriers lost the replay 2–0 although video footage clearly showed that the second goal did not cross the line. In the 2008–09 season Harriers again reached the third round, losing away to Coventry City 2–0.

In the 2013–14 FA Cup Kidderminster beat League Two side Newport County 4–2 in the second round In the third round, Harriers beat Peterborough United from League One 3–2 at London Road in the 3rd round replay in front of 3,483 of which 660 were travelling Harriers fans, after drawing 0–0 at Aggborough. In the fourth round they lost away to Premier League Sunderland 1–0 in front of 25,081, of which 4,000 were travelling Kidderminster fans, to end their run.

In 2022, Harriers reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, whilst in the sixth-tier National League North, where they were drawn against Premier League opponents West Ham United, the same club Harriers faced at home in round 5 in 1994. Harriers had beaten National League opposition in Grimsby Town and FC Halifax Town in the first and second round, respectively, before coming from behind to beat Championship side Reading in the third round. Harriers led for much of the tie through Alex Penny&#x27;s first-half goal before West Ham equalised through Declan Rice in the last minute of stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes to send the match into extra time. Jarrod Bowen then scored for West Ham in the dying seconds of extra time as Harriers eventually lost 1–2 and were eliminated.

==Rivals==
Harriers fans consider local teams Stourbridge, Hereford (continued from the rivalry with the now defunct Hereford United), Bromsgrove Sporting and Worcester City to be the club&#x27;s main rivals. They also share a less significant rivalry with near neighbours AFC Telford United. There was also a healthy rivalry with the now defunct Rushden &amp; Diamonds, which stemmed from the 1999–2000 Conference title-winning campaign. During the club&#x27;s stint in the Football League, they developed a rivalry with Cheltenham Town.

<doc id="451162" wikidata="Q19595" url="?curid=451162" title="Leyton Orient F.C.">
<text>Leyton Orient Football Club is a professional association football club based in Leyton, Waltham Forest, London, England. The team compete in EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1881 as the Glyn Cricket Club, they began playing football as Orient in 1888 and joined the London League in 1896 after success in the Clapton &amp; District League. The club adopted the name Clapton Orient two years later and were elected into the Football League in 1905. Relegated out of the Second Division in 1929, the club adopted the name Leyton Orient after World War II. They won the Third Division South title in 1955–56 and secured promotion out of the Second Division in 1961–62, though were relegated out of the First Division after just one season, and suffered a further relegation in 1966. That summer the club&#x27;s name reverted to Orient F.C. and they went on to win the Third Division under the stewardship of Jimmy Bloomfield in 1969–70. Orient spent the 1970s playing in the second tier, winning two London Challenge Cups and reaching the 1977 Anglo-Scottish Cup final and 1977–78 FA Cup semi-finals, before being relegated in 1982 and again in 1985.

In 1987 the club reverted to being Leyton Orient again. They won promotion out of the Fourth Division via the play-offs in 1988–89, though were relegated again in 1995. Orient gained promotion out of League Two with Martin Ling in 2005–06, before Hearn sold the club to Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti, who presided over two relegations in three years under 11 managers, taking the club out of the Football League for the first time in 112 years. Nigel Travis took over running the club in 2017 and appointed Justin Edinburgh as manager, and under this stable leadership the club went on to reach the FA Trophy final and win promotion back into the Football League as champions of the National League in 2018–19. Under manager Richie Wellens, the club was crowned champions of League Two in the 2022–23 campaign.

They are the second oldest football club in London to play at a professional level, and are known to their fans by their nickname &quot;the O&#x27;s&quot;. The club&#x27;s home colours are all red. They have played home matches at Brisbane Road since 1937, having previously played at Millfields and Lea Bridge Road.

==History==
===Formation and name (1881–1914)===
Leyton Orient were originally formed by members of the Glyn Cricket Club in 1881, many of whom were former students of the Independent College, Homerton in nearby Hackney (now Homerton College in Cambridge); an annual fixture is still held between the club and the college. The team has had several name changes since, first as Eagle Cricket Club in 1886, then as Orient Football Club in 1888.

The 12 history books written on the club by its historian Neilson N. Kaufman between 1974 and 2015 suggest that the choice of the name &quot;Orient&quot; came about at the behest of a player, Jack R Dearing, who was an employee of the Orient Steam Navigation Company, later part of P&amp;O – Peninsular &amp; Oriental. The club&#x27;s name was changed again to Clapton Orient in 1898 to represent the area of London in which they played, though there was another team called Clapton F.C.

Before their relegation in 2017, the O&#x27;s were the second-oldest league club in London behind Fulham and were the 24th oldest club currently playing in the Football League. Following Fulham&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League they became the oldest London club playing in the Football League. They played in the Second Division of the Southern Federation&#x27;s League in 1904, joined the Football League in 1905. By this time players such as part-time outside right, Herbert Kingaby could earn £2 4s (&quot;2012: £&quot;) per week – payment being somewhat sporadic.

The name Leyton Orient was adopted following the conclusion of the Second World War. The club had moved to Leyton in 1937, though again there was another team called Leyton F.C. A further rename back simply to Orient took place in 1966 after the Municipal Borough of Leyton (in Essex) was absorbed into the London Borough of Waltham Forest. That renaming followed a financial crisis – one of several to hit the club and by no means the first or last – and restructuring of the company behind the club; this is remembered for a &quot;pass the bucket&quot; collection that took place at a special meeting of supporters in the East Stand, when complete closure was claimed to be a definite possibility.

The club reverted to Leyton Orient in 1987, shortly after Tony Wood took over as chairman and at a time when a supporters&#x27; campaign was taking place in the &quot;Leyton Orientear&quot; fanzine to reinstate the &quot;Leyton&quot; part of the club&#x27;s name.

===World War years (1914–1955)===
The 1914–15 season was the last football season before the league was suspended due to the outbreak of the First World War. A total of 41 members of the Clapton Orient team and staff joined up into the 17th Battalion Middlesex Regiment (the Footballers&#x27; Battalion), the highest of any football team in the country and the first to join up &quot;en masse&quot;. At the final game of the season – Clapton Orient vs Leicester Fosse, 20,000 people came out to support the team. A farewell parade was also hosted but not before the O&#x27;s had won 2–0. The British Film Institute holds a brief recording of this historic match and parade in its archives.
During the Battle of the Somme, three players gave their lives for king and country: Richard McFadden, George Scott and William Jonas. Though they were the only Orient staff to have died during the First World War, many others sustained wounds, some more than once and were not able to resume their football careers after the war. Prior to the First World War and whilst on a training run, O&#x27;s striker McFadden had saved the lives of two young boys who were drowning in the River Lea – this, only a week or so after rescuing a little girl from a house fire, when walking through Clapton Park on his way to the O&#x27;s ground. It is also documented that he had dragged a man from a burning building prior to signing for the Orient.

History was made on Saturday 30 April 1921 when the Prince of Wales, later to become King Edward VIII, visited Clapton Stadium/Millfields Road to see the O&#x27;s play Notts County. The Orient won 3–0 and this was the first time a member of royalty had attended a Football League match. The royal visit was to show gratitude for Clapton Orient&#x27;s patriotic example during the Great War and there is now a plaque erected on the site of the Millfields Road Stadium to commemorate this historic event.

===Later 20th century (1955–2001)===

Leyton Orient were Division Three South champions in the 1955–56 season and spent 20 of the next 25 years in the Second Division, before being relegated at the end of the 1981–82 season. They have not been back to that level since.

Orient&#x27;s golden years were in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1961–62 season Orient were promoted to the top tier of English football, the First Division, for the only time in their history, after finishing second in Division Two under the management of Johnny Carey. The team struggled in the top flight and were relegated after just one season. Nonetheless, they did defeat local rivals West Ham United at home.

They were Division Three champions in the 1969–70 season and spent the whole of the 1970s in Division Two. In 1972 Orient achieved one of the most famous results in their history – coming back from 2–0 down to beat Chelsea 3–2 in the FA Cup fifth round. On 28 August 1973, Bobby Fisher became the first black player to represent Orient, and would go on to play 384 times for the club. They were also Anglo-Scottish Cup runners-up in 1976–77. In 1978 Orient were defeated in the semi-final of the FA Cup, the furthest they have progressed in that competition.

In 1978 the club was indirectly responsible for the album &quot;Variations&quot; composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber for his brother, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. This reached No.2 in the pop album charts. &quot;Variations&quot; came about as the result of a bet between the two brothers on the outcome of Orient&#x27;s final game of the 1976–77 season against Hull City.

In the 1980s Leyton Orient fared less well and after two relegations found themselves in the fourth tier of English football. However, they ended the decade on a high, as they were promoted in the 1988–89 season, when under manager Frank Clark they were promoted in the Division Four play-off final after a 2–1 aggregate victory over Wrexham The early 1990s saw steady progress in the Third Division, missing out on a play-off place in the 1992–93 season on goal difference. However, the financial crisis at the club caused by then-chairman Tony Wood losing his business in the Rwandan Civil War led to a relegation back to the fourth tier, now renamed as the Third Division following the formation of the Premier League. Barry Hearn became chairman in 1995 after the club was put on sale for £5 by then-chairman Tony Wood, a period covered by the television documentary &quot;Orient: Club for a Fiver&quot; (made by production company Open Media for Channel 4 and listed in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2020 as one of its &quot;Top Five Sports Documentaries&quot;). Under manager Tommy Taylor, Orient were defeated in the 1999 and 2001 Third Division play-off finals, played at Wembley Stadium and the Millennium Stadium respectively. The latter final saw the fastest ever play-off final goal scored to date at the Millennium Stadium, as Orient&#x27;s Chris Tate scored after just 27 seconds. Orient&#x27;s fastest ever goal was scored after just 12 seconds by Lee Steele in a match against his former club Oxford at The Kassam Stadium on 28 March 2005.

===Promotion to League One (2001–2010)===
After the 2001 play-off final defeat, Leyton Orient took several years to recover from their second play-off final defeat in three years. After Tommy Taylor left the club, Paul Brush spent two unsuccessful years in charge and after he was sacked, former player Martin Ling took over as manager in October 2003, with Orient second-bottom of the league. After several years of steady improvement, Leyton Orient gained promotion in the 2005–06 season, finishing in third place and gaining automatic promotion to League One. This was the club&#x27;s first automatic promotion in 36 years and ended a period of 11 years in the English league&#x27;s bottom division. This promotion season also saw an excellent FA Cup run, with Leyton Orient progressing to the fourth round after beating Premiership side Fulham. Promotion was only secured in the final minutes of the final game of the season, away at Oxford United; with the score tied at 2–2 and Orient seemingly destined to miss out yet again, news came through of a late goal scored against promotion rivals Grimsby Town F.C. that would potentially promote Orient. The Orient fans were still celebrating this when just 14 seconds later, Lee Steele scored to confirm Orient&#x27;s promotion. The result also relegated Oxford to the Football Conference. Grimsby&#x27;s manager that season was Russell Slade, who would later become Orient&#x27;s manager.

In 2006–07, Orient endured a difficult season in the third tier, having spent most of the season in or around the relegation zone and were bottom of the table at times during the first half of the season. An improvement in fortunes after Christmas – including memorable wins against Millwall, Tranmere Rovers and a vital win at eventually-relegated Bradford City near the end of the season – helped them finish in 20th place, one spot above the relegation zone. Most of the 2006 promotion-winning side left at the end of the season. Some players were released, some declined new contracts and the club&#x27;s longest-serving player Matthew Lockwood was re-signed but later moved in pre-season to Nottingham Forest.

2007–08 was better, as Orient finished 14th with 60 points. The O&#x27;s began the season in fine form, not dropping out of the top seven until after Christmas. However a loss of form in the second half of the season, recording only three wins from the last 12 games, meant the season ended in a respectable mid-table finish.

Leyton Orient kicked off the 2008–09 season with a 2–1 win over Hereford United at home. Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1–0. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1–2 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4–1 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams&#x27; positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1–0 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place.

Orient had a proud day when they beat former Premier League runners-up Newcastle United 6–1 in a pre-season friendly match on 25 July 2009. By beating Colchester United away, in the first round of the Football League Cup, they earned a home second round fixture against Premier League Club, Stoke City.

===Continued success (2010–2014)===
On 3 April 2010 Geraint Williams was sacked as manager after a 3–1 home defeat to fellow relegation strugglers Hartlepool following a poor run of form. Kevin Nugent once again took control for the 2–1 defeat at Southampton on 5 April and after the match Russell Slade was named as manager until the end of the season. With even less time to save Orient from relegation than Williams before him, Slade managed to bring about a change in form that saw Orient finish in 17th place, just one point but four places clear of relegation. In the summer of 2010 Slade&#x27;s contract was extended for two years. After a poor start to the 2010–11 season, Orient&#x27;s league form picked up towards Christmas, culminating in an 8–2 win against non-league Droylsden in an FA Cup second round replay. In a game described as &quot;the weirdest football match ever&quot;, Orient had trailed most of the game 2–0 but scored six goals in extra time to progress into the third round. Orient then beat high-flying Championship side Norwich City 1–0 at Carrow Road to progress into the fourth round where they met another Championship side, Swansea City, at the Liberty Stadium. Orient beat Swansea 2–1 to set up a glamour fifth round tie against Premier League giants Arsenal at Brisbane Road, which finished in a 1–1 draw thanks to a late Jonathan Téhoué equaliser for the O&#x27;s. This set up a replay at the Emirates Stadium. Leyton Orient lost that replay 0–5, bringing to an end their longest run in the FA Cup since 1981–82. Either side of the Arsenal games, Leyton Orient achieved a club record-equalling 14 games unbeaten, putting the team just outside the play-off positions. However they were unable to maintain that momentum and ultimately missed out on the play-offs by just one point.

The 2013–14 season saw more success for Orient, finishing third in the league and securing a place in the play-offs. They defeated Peterborough United to advance to the playoff final at Wembley, but lost in the final to Rotherham United via a penalty shoot-out.

===Sale, financial crisis and fall to Non-League (2014–2017)===
The 2014–15 season saw a reversal of fortunes for Orient after the club was taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti. Long-standing manager Russell Slade left early in the season and was replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Nugent, followed in quick succession by Mauro Milanese and then Fabio Liverani before Christmas 2014. A disastrous second half of the season meant that Orient was relegated from League One after a 2–2 draw at Swindon Town on the final day. Liverani, with only eight wins in 27 matches, left the club by mutual consent on 13 May 2015.

Orient finished one place but six points away from a League Two play-off place in the 2015–16 season. However, the following season (2016–17) saw another disastrous slump, under five different managers, as well as off-pitch turmoil, including a winding-up hearing against Becchetti for unpaid taxes. Another managerial departure saw Daniel Webb resign from the club, with assistant manager Omer Riza taking over first-team duties until the end of the season. On 22 April 2017, Orient were relegated to the National League after a 3–0 loss to Crewe Alexandra, ending their 112-year stay in the Football League. Becchetti who had overseen two relegations in three years, saw continued criticism for his ownership, which resulted in a pitch invasion and protest against him on 29 April, resulting in the game being called off. On 22 June, the club was officially sold to Nigel Travis, the chairman of Dunkin&#x27; Brands.

===Non-League and promotion back to League One (2017–)===
After a poor start to the season, manager Steve Davis, appointed at the start of the National League campaign, was sacked on 14 November 2017, and was replaced by Justin Edinburgh. Under Edinburgh the club fared better, and spent much of the 2018–19 season competing for promotion from the National League. On 27 April 2019, following a 0–0 draw with Braintree Town, Orient secured promotion to League Two as champions of the National League after two years in non-League. The club also reached the final of the FA Trophy, but were defeated by AFC Fylde.

On 3 June 2019, manager Justin Edinburgh was admitted to hospital following a cardiac arrest. He died five days later, aged 49. His assistant Ross Embleton was appointed as interim manager for the new season. Embleton was replaced by Carl Fletcher in October 2019 but Fletcher was sacked the following month after just five games in charge without gaining a win, Embleton was reinstated as interim boss. Embleton was appointed permanently in January 2020 on a 12-month rolling contract. Orient&#x27;s first season back in League Two produced a 17th-place finish, with the final table ultimately being determined on a weighted points per game basis because of football&#x27;s suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, the club furloughed all players and staff to reduce the financial burden on the club due to the pandemic. The following season, the club finished in 11th place in League Two. Ross Embleton was sacked in February 2021 and was replaced by Jobi McAnuff until the end of the season. In May 2021 Kenny Jackett was named as the new manager. Jackett was sacked in February 2022 after a bad run of form which left the club only 3 points above the League Two relegation zone and was replaced by Richie Wellens who kept Orient up and secured a comfortable 13th-placed finish. A strong 2022–23 season saw the club promoted back to League One on 18 April 2023, after eight years away from the level, securing their promotion with four games remaining despite a 2–0 defeat to Gillingham. Orient took the League Two title four days later with a 2–0 home victory over Crewe Alexandra. In the 2023-24 season, Orient cemented their place in League One for a following season, finishing 11th.

==Kit and badge==
Orient&#x27;s crest is made up of two wyverns facing each other over a football. The wyvern symbol was introduced in 1976 and is believed to incorporate Orient&#x27;s links with the City of London – the wyvern is the symbol of the Thames, in mythology is the defender of the Thames – and with the sea, through the old Orient Shipping Company. The wyvern on the badge provided the inspiration for the club mascot Theo who got his name from a shortening of the club nickname, the O&#x27;s. Theo first appeared in the 2000–01 season.

Previous club crests have included a version of the Borough of Leyton&#x27;s coat of arms and a single red dragon. The club&#x27;s home colours are all red.

===Sponsorship===
The club shirt sponsorship deals have included tie-ups with Independent Transport, Acclaim Entertainment, Marchpole, Matchroom Sport and PokerMillion.com. At the start of the 2008–09 season the club entered into a three-year deal with PartyGaming.com to present PartyPoker.com, PartyBets.com and PartyCasino.com on the front of players&#x27; and replica kits.

During the 2012–13 season, the shirt sponsors were Samsung and FIFA 13. The same sponsors were used for the 2013–14 season, only FIFA 13 became FIFA 14. For 2014–15, the club announced a deal with online bookmakers 666Bet.

On 30 July 2015, Orient announced a deal that would see steel distributors and stockholders Rainham Steel feature on the home, away and third kits. From 2016 to 2018, Orient were sponsored by Energybet.com. From 2018 to 2019 onwards, Orient&#x27;s principal shirt sponsor is The Sun&#x27;s Dream Team. For the 2020–21 season until the 2022–23 season, former loanee Harry Kane sponsored Orient, using the space on their shirts to thank the key workers of the Coronavirus pandemic, and support the Haven House Children&#x27;s Hospice and Mind, the mental health charity. 10% from the sale of every shirt is allocated to the charity named on the front. In November 2020, the club announced a new sponsorship with the British YouTuber group the Sidemen, as the group were looking to support a local club and a stadium to record their popular football challenges. For the 2023/24 season, it was announced that investment bankers Eastdil Secured would be the main shirt sponsor.

==Stadiums==
Orient&#x27;s initial ground was at Glyn Road between 1884 and 1896 when the club moved to Whittle&#x27;s Athletic Ground.

===Millfields===

Whittle&#x27;s Athletic Ground was originally a whippet racing ground later known as Millfields and Clapton Orient played there until 1930. The O&#x27;s also played pre-season friendlies at Leyton Cricket Ground for several seasons.

Millfields could hold 35,000 or more and was quite modern for its time, though larger crowds were typically for dog racing and speedway and was a major London venue for boxing and baseball. As Orient was only a tenant and facing high rents and competition with other events at Millfields Road, Orient owners left Millfields Road for another racing ground across Hackney Marshes soon after, having stayed for 30 years. The ground closed in 1969, the Greyhound Racing Association selling with housing redevelopment taking its place in 1974.

===Lea Bridge Road===

Clapton Orient left Millfields in 1930, moving to Lea Bridge Stadium which had been used as a speedway stadium. Orient&#x27;s first match held there was a 3–1 win over Newport County on 4 September 1930, in front of a crowd of 5,505. However, the ground was closed for repairs by order of the Football League after the directors of Torquay United complained that a wooden fence was too close to the touchline. Orient&#x27;s next two home league fixtures (both victories) were held at Wembley Stadium, the second attracting a crowd of just 1,916 to see the 3–1 win over Southend United. An FA Cup tie against Luton Town had to be held at Arsenal Stadium.

The capacity of the stadium was 20,000 and although with improvements it could have been increased to 50,000, the Orient directors were never content with the ground. There were rumours of a move as far as Mitcham or a merger with short-lived neighbours Thames but a decision was made to move to Brisbane Road in time for the start of the 1937–38 season. The last Orient match to be held at Lea Bridge Road was another 3–1 victory over Southend United in front of a crowd of 2,541. The stadium was demolished in the 1970s.

===Brisbane Road===
Brisbane Road has undergone many changes since Orient&#x27;s arrival. Previously known as Osborne Road and having been the home of Leyton F.C., it initially had only one stand (known as &quot;the orange box&quot;) on the east side that held 475 people and cover on the west side for standing. All of the standing was cinder banks. The East Stand (also known as the Main Stand) was bought from Mitcham Greyhound Stadium in 1956 and eventually extended to cover the whole east side. The terraced enclosures at the front of the East Stand were replaced by seating in the late 1990s. Over the decades, the west side became a covered terrace and finally a seated-stand, while uncovered terracing was built at the north and south sides. As the ground&#x27;s capacity was being progressively reduced through changes to ground safety regulations, Orient looked to redevelop Brisbane Road as an all-seater stadium to secure its future there.

The initial plans, dubbed &quot;Orient 2000&quot; by the club, were revealed in the mid-1990s. The plans were ambitious, as they involved rotating the pitch and developing all four sides. However, the club&#x27;s near-bankruptcy and subsequent buy-out by Barry Hearn meant that a more realistic redevelopment plan was instigated. The first phase involved demolition of the South Terrace in the late 1990s and after delays while National Lottery funding was unsuccessfully sought the new South Stand was opened at the start of the 1999–2000 season.
The next phase of redevelopment (replacement of the North Terrace and West Stand) ran into financial problems. Notwithstanding that finance for the redevelopment had already been raised by selling off the four corners of the stadium for residential blocks of flats, an increase in costs meant that an emergency general meeting of the company was needed in April 2005. It was agreed that the club should sell a c.999-year lease on the West Stand for £1.5 million to a consortium led by Barry Hearn (under the company name &quot;Samuel Beadie (Leyton) Ltd&quot; or &quot;SBLL&quot;), with SBLL leasing back to the club on a same-length lease all of the stand except the office space for an annual rent of £1. The additional funds generated by this complicated arrangement were used to complete the building of the West Stand. External completion of the West Stand was achieved in mid-2005 and the stand was opened for the 2005–06 season. The stand has a single lower tier of seating, while further up the structure are directors&#x27; and corporate hospitality boxes, club offices and player facilities, which were fitted out in summer 2007, prior to which the players continued to use the facilities in the East Stand.

A second EGM was held in May 2006, where it was agreed to sell further land behind the North and South Stands to SBLL for £1.25 million, the proceeds to be used to fund the building of the North Stand. The plan was to commence building the North Stand in July 2006 and for it to be open by Christmas 2006 but Waltham Forest council initially rejected the revised planning application for the stand and its adjoining additional flats. A revised application approved in early 2007 and construction began towards the end of the 2006–07 season. The stand – which has become the Family Stand – was completed before the 2007–08 season, giving the O&#x27;s a four-sided ground once more, with a capacity of 9,271. The modernisation of the East Stand happened during the break between the season of 2013–14 and 2015–16. Black seats formed a pattern over the other red seats to spell out &quot;The O&#x27;s&quot;.

During the 2008–09 season, Leyton Orient changed the name of the South Stand in honour of the late Orient top-scorer, Tommy Johnston and is known simply as the Tommy Johnston Stand.

===Olympic Stadium proposal===
On 18 October 2011, the club submitted a request to the Football League to become tenants of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium after the initial decision to award West Ham the stadium collapsed on 11 October 2011, following legal challenges from Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient. Orient also expressed an interest in ground sharing the stadium with West Ham, but West Ham were not keen on the idea, and in December 2012 West Ham was chosen as the permanent tenant of the Olympic Stadium. Orient chairman Barry Hearn voiced his complaints over West Ham United being given an anchor tenancy at the stadium. Orient claimed that the stadium was too close to their own, which they claimed would breach FA rules and by extension, move the club into bankruptcy. On 6 March, Barry Hearn stated that he would mount another legal challenge as he believed that the rules set out by the LLDC had not been followed. Hearn also said that he felt that Leyton Orient&#x27;s proposed ground share had been ignored and not properly explored. Orient&#x27;s legal challenge was ended when a confidential agreement between Orient and the Premier League was reached.

==Supporters==
The supporter fan-base is usually centred in East London.

The Supporters club is the official supporters representative although there is a smaller group called &quot;Leyton Orient Fans Trust&quot;. that are involved in fans rep meeting alongside the supporters club, The fans trust coordinated protests against the owner at the time between 2017 and 2019 at Blackpool (along with home fans who were also protesting their management), which included a protest down Leyton high road which was attended by a couple of hundred people. In April 2016 a smaller fans group known at the time as OTF arranged pitch protests against Hartlepool United, where the fans stormed the pitch and Colchester United where the game was abandoned after a pitch invasion with five minutes remaining which saw thousands enter the pitch effectively getting the game abandoned. The remaining five minutes of the game were eventually played three hours later behind closed doors, the protest brought much needed publicity to the club&#x27;s plight, with worldwide news coverage.

Notable fans include Bob Mills, Daniel Mays, Colin Matthews, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Andrew&#x27;s brother Julian. The album &quot;Variations&quot;, which was famously used as the theme tune for London Weekend Television&#x27;s South Bank Show, was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber as the result of his losing a bet to Julian Lloyd Webber on the result of a Leyton Orient match. Julian later presented a gold disc of &quot;Variations&quot; to the club chairman at half time during a game with Leicester City.

==Rivalries==

Among Orient&#x27;s main rivals are Southend United, with whom they contest the A13 derby. The rivalry came about after a period of Southend being Orient&#x27;s geographically closest league rivals between 1998 and 2005. Although they have not often played in the same division, they have met in the League Cup in 2011–12 season, Leyton Orient beating the Shrimpers after extra time on penalties. More recently, Southend beat Orient 3–2 on aggregate in the 2012–13 Football League Trophy Southern Area final.

Other local rivals include West Ham United, Millwall, Brentford, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Colchester United and Barnet.

Historic rivals include neighbours Leyton and two other disbanded/merged clubs, Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue. The Dagenham &amp; Redbridge rivalry continues the old rivalries with the latter two.
