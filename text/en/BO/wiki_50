<text>Robert Lusser (19 April 1899 – 19 January 1969) was a German engineer, aircraft designer and aviator. He is remembered both for several well-known Messerschmitt and Heinkel designs during World War II, and after the war for his theoretical study of the reliability of complex systems. In the post-war era, Lusser also pioneered the development of modern ski bindings, introducing the first teflon anti-friction pads to improve release.

==Biography==
Lusser was born in Ulm. As a pilot, he won the International Light Aircraft Contest in France in 1928. Next he participated in three out of four FAI International Tourist Plane Contests, flying Klemm aircraft, and completed all three taking quite high places (Challenge 1929: 4th, Challenge 1930: 13th, and Challenge 1932: 10th). In August 1930 he was 3rd in the handicapped race &quot;Giro Aereo d&#x27;Italia&quot; in Italy.

Lusser&#x27;s first jobs were with the Klemm and Heinkel companies, before joining the newly relaunched &quot;Bayerische Flugzeugwerke&quot; (Bavarian Aircraft Works) in 1933. There, he assisted Willy Messerschmitt with his design for a touring aircraft, the Messerschmitt M37. This was later put into production as the Messerschmitt Bf 108, and formed the basis for the company&#x27;s best known product, the Bf 109 fighter aircraft. By 1934, Lusser was head of Messerschmitt&#x27;s design bureau and in charge of the Bf 110 heavy fighter project. In 1938 the company was renamed Messerschmitt.

Lusser stayed with the company until 1938, when he returned to Heinkel. There, he led the design of two highly sophisticated aircraft that never reached their full potential - the He 280 and the He 219. The He 280 was the first jet fighter to leave the drawing board, but which the RLM (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; - &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) passed over in favour of the Messerschmitt Me 262. The He 219 was an advanced night-fighter design that was rejected by the RLM in August 1941 as being too complex to order into production because of its many innovations. Ernst Heinkel immediately dismissed Lusser and resubmitted a simplified design that eventually saw limited production.

From Heinkel, Lusser went to Fieseler, and there became involved with the company&#x27;s efforts to produce a pilotless aircraft, initially designated the Fi 103. This was a collaborative effort between the company and engine manufacturer Argus, who were developing a pulsejet. Lusser worked with Argus engineer Fritz Gosslau to refine the design. The project was an initiative of the two companies, begun by Argus as early as 1934, and received little official interest until Erhard Milch recognised its potential in 1942 and assigned it high priority. Nazi propaganda dubbed this flying bomb the V1, (&quot;Vergeltungswaffe&quot; - &quot;revenge weapon&quot;). It was a design competing with Wernher von Braun&#x27; s &quot;V2&quot; vertical takeoff rocket. Despite initial demonstrations before Luftwaffe made the V2 look more reliable, it was decided both designs should proceed into production. Lusser and von Braun were rivals, and even later their relationship was never frictionless. Near Wolfsburg, Lusser found the main design flaw of his rocket, which turned out to be an underdimensioned main wing spar, as the ramp up of production began. From there on, the design worked.

===Post war time===
Like many important German engineers, Lusser was brought to the United States after the end of World War II. There, he worked for the Navy, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and in 1953, re-joined von Braun&#x27;s rocketry team at Huntsville, Alabama. During his six years there, he formalised his theories of reliability, which focus on the contribution that the reliability of each part makes to the reliability of an overall system. This is now known as Lusser&#x27;s Law. Based on these calculations, he pronounced that von Braun&#x27;s ambitions of reaching the Moon and Mars were doomed to failure because of the complexity of the spacecraft required.

He returned to Germany, and to the Messerschmitt company, by then, Messerschmitt-Bölkow. His alarming reliability study of the adaptations that the company was making to the F-104 Starfighter that it was building under licence turned out to be tragically correct.

In 1961 he ruptured his Achilles tendon while testing his ski&#x27;s cable bindings in his hotel room at Saas-Fee. He decided to attack the binding problem, developing the first bindings that gripped the toe of the boot, rather than the flange projecting from the front of the sole at the toe. This allowed the toe binding to release in any direction. In 1963 he quit his job at Messerschmitt to start the Lusser Binding Company. This was a major brand until his death in 1969. He died on 19 January 1969 in Munich.

<text>The Canigó ( , ; ; ) is a mountain located in the Pyrenees of southern France.

The Canigó is located less than from the sea and has an elevation of .Due to its sharp flanks and its dramatic location near the coast, until the 18th century the Canigou was believed to be the highest mountain in the Pyrenees.

Being between south and Northern Catalonia, the mountain has a historical symbolical significance for Catalan people.

In good weather, it is visible from Marseille on 8 February and 31 October, due to atmospheric optical effects.

== Geography ==
The Canigó is located in Pyrénées-Orientales, south of Prades and north of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste. Its summit lies on the border between two communes: Vernet-les-Bains and Taurinya (although the territories of two other communes - Casteil and Valmanya - approach quite closely to the summit). Its location makes it visible from the plains of Roussillon and from Conflent in France, and as well from Empordà in Spain.

Twice a year, in early February and at the end of October, with good weather, the Canigó can be seen at sunset from as far as Marseille, away, by refraction of light. This phenomenon was observed in 1808 by baron Franz Xaver von Zach from the Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica in Marseille. All year long, it can also be seen, with good weather, from Agde, Port-Camargue and the Montagne Noire.

==Trekking and sightseeing==
Jeep tracks on the north side of the massif lead to the Chalet des Cortalets (at 2150 m) which is a popular outpost with walkers.

There are two ancient monasteries at the foot of the mountain, Martin-du-Canigou and Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa.

==Canigó Flame==
The mountain has symbolical significance for Catalan people. On its summit stands a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag. Every year on 23 June, the night before St. John&#x27;s day (&quot;nit de Sant Joan&quot;), there is a ceremony called &quot;Flama del Canigó&quot;. French Catalans carry a flaming torch from Perpignan to the cross and the Catalonian flag on top of the mountain, and people light bonfires throughout the area.

==Literature==
The Canigó inspired the epic poem &quot;Canigó&quot; by Catalan poet Jacint Verdaguer i Santaló. 
In these verses Verdaguer compares the snowy mountain to a Magnolia flower (pages 27–28):

While he was staying in Vernet-les-Bains in 1911, Kipling wrote about Canigou. In a letter to the Club Alpin, he praised it as a &quot;magician among mountains&quot;.

Kipling also wrote a light-hearted short story entitled &quot;Why Snow Falls at Vernet&quot;. It makes fun of the English habit of always talking about the weather.

<text>Broken Sword is a series of adventure games. The first game in the series, &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars&quot;, was released and developed in 1996 by British developer Revolution Software. Its sequel, &quot;Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror&quot;, was released a year later, and was followed by &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot; in 2003, &quot;Broken Sword: The Angel of Death&quot; in 2006, and &quot;Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot; in 2013. A remake of the first game in the series, known as &quot;Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars – The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, was released in 2009, and a remake of the second game in the series, &quot;Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered&quot;, in 2010 for iOS devices; other platforms followed in 2011.

The main protagonists of the series are George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer, and Nicole &quot;Nico&quot; Collard, a French freelance journalist. While Nico does not appear as a playable character in the original version of &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot;, she does become playable in the Director&#x27;s Cut.

The &quot;Broken Sword&quot; series was conceived in 1994 by Charles Cecil, Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan, while talking about the mythology of the Knights Templar. The first three games in the series as well as the fifth game were developed by Revolution Software, while the fourth game was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital. &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; and &quot;The Smoking Mirror&quot; were critical and commercial successes, selling millions. However, &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; received mixed reviews and were not as popular as the first two games. This was mainly due to the switch to 3D graphics and because the third game left the &quot;point and click&quot; interface for a more action-oriented gameplay. The latest game in the series, &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot;, returned to the series&#x27; 2D roots. The series appeared on several top adventure game lists. A comic book was produced for each remake of the first two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games.

He becomes both a witness and victim of a bomb attack on a Parisian café &quot;La Chandelle Verte&quot;, caused by a clown, later revealed to be an assassin named Khan. The perpetrator steals an old man&#x27;s briefcase and sets off a bomb inside the café. Stobbart meets a French photo-journalist, Nicole &quot;Nico&quot; Collard, a resident of Rue Jarry in Paris, with whom he tries to discover who is responsible for the murder of the old man, Plantard, and while doing so, end up unraveling a conspiracy relating to the Knights Templar. The third and fourth game, &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death&quot;, follow the Templar-related storyline: &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; continuing the story from &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; with a number of returning characters, while in &quot;The Angel of Death&quot;, George and Nico, with a newly introduced character Anna-Maria, unravel a mystery related to the Catholic Church. Unlike the other installments, in &quot;The Smoking Mirror&quot;, George and Nico unravel a Mayan mystery, involving the Mayan god Tezcatlipoca. &quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot; follows a storyline related to the Gnostic Gospels.

==Development==
===&quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; and &quot;The Smoking Mirror&quot;===
Video game designer, writer and director Charles Cecil began working on the scenario for &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, Revolution Software&#x27;s third game following &quot;Lure of the Temptress&quot; (1992) and &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot; (1994), in 1992, which would be set in Paris with a Knights Templar storyline. After visiting Paris and reading &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, Cecil was certain the Templars would be a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins and Jonathan L. Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist Alan Drury. Steve Ince, who created initial location sketches for the game before working on &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;, was promoted to producer halfway through the project. In 1994 Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan, then-head of publishing at Virgin Interactive, and Virgin agreed to publish the game&#x27;s PC version, but were not interested in publishing the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to publish the game for the console. Tony Warriner and David Sykes were the game&#x27;s designer-programmer Carmody the executive producer. The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine, as do Revolution&#x27;s previous two games.

One of Cecil&#x27;s goals was to depart from the humour-based adventure games more popular at the time by creating a game with good pacing and a complex storyline, a reason he thought the Knights Templar would be an ideal subject. &quot;Broken Sword&quot; offered a unique &quot;conversation icon&quot; system which would not reveal to the player what the protagonist was about to say; Cecil&#x27;s intention was to make the game more cinematic. Although aiming at designing a game with a cinematic feel, Cecil felt the game should not resemble interactive movies of that time, which he felt were &quot;mimicking movies&quot;. He wanted to create two protagonists who would exchange ideas, helping drive the game along. He made George American and Nico French to appeal to US and European markets. Revolution believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries.
Hand drawn artwork was animated by artists including Don Bluth Studios&#x27; Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen and Red Rover Studio&#x27;s Mike Burgess, resulting in graphics animated in a style resembling classic animated films. The game&#x27;s final cost was one million pounds.

&quot;Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror&quot; was conceived in 1997, by Cecil and Revolution&#x27;s crew. The artwork for &quot;Broken Sword 2&quot; was developed through a number of stages. Initially pencil drawings were made of characters which were then digitally coloured in, before being cleaned up. The background layouts were produced in a similar way, also starting out as pencil designs. They were all drawn by Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen, who both previously worked on the original &quot;Broken Sword&quot; game, while they were now working together with Amy Berenz and Lee Taylor. The music in the game was again composed by Barrington Pheloung, with Bob Sekar adding the closing score. While Rolf Saxon returns to voice actor of George, Jennifer Caron Hall a bilingual actress and daughter of French actress Leslie Caron, was cast as Nico. Theatre director Edward Hall rehearsed the assembled actors and took no more than a week to record the entire game, according to an interview given by Rolf Saxon in 2011. Alternative Magazine The game was first released for Windows on October 31, 1997.

===&quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death&quot;===
Revolution first discussed the idea of a third &quot;Broken Sword&quot; in 2000. At first, &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; was planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals to the first two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games, but Revolution decided not to use the &quot;flat&quot; look, claiming it lacked visual depth. The team wanted the game to look believable, but not necessarily realistic, similar to Japanese animated films. Textures were hand drawn to achieve the &quot;cartoon&quot; look, while the light-map employed radiosity to create realistic lighting. Advances in hardware plus the changes in methodology allowed the game to move to 24-bit color. To make the game feel like a film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmospheres appropriate for each scene. The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough. The voice recording was scheduled to take five days, but the entire process took four days. The voices were recorded with the voice actors together, enabling better getting into their parts. The full script is 6,000 lines in total, similar to &quot;Broken Sword II&quot;. While Rolf Saxon returns to voice George, Nico was this time played by Sarah Crook. The game&#x27;s final cost was two million pounds.

Revolution Software and THQ announced &quot;Broken Sword: The Angel of Death&quot; in August 2005. According to Charles Cecil, the &quot;Broken Sword&quot; was originally planned to be a trilogy, but after the release of &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot;, the demand from fans for a sequel was overwhelming. Though &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; benefited commercially from being released on console as well as PC, this approach required certain development compromises as the PC version was held back by the constraints of the console versions. As a result, &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; was written for PC only &quot;so as to really push the boundaries in terms of the technology and graphics&quot;. As a series&#x27; first, Revolution was not the only developer, but was co-developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital. Cecil believed that because of the requirement for ever larger team sizes, it was no longer possible to maintain a large development team to write single original titles, resulting in Revolution closed the production side in order to concentrate on design, and Sumo to concentrate on production. It was the first game to use the amBX lighting technology. &quot;Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon&quot; was criticised for featuring a high number of action elements. Cecil stated that he aimed to put the player under pressure. While he still stood behind this principle, he thought the action elements were not the right approach. &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; was also criticised for using a high number of crate puzzles, resulting in Cecil reducing the number of them. The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough and features tracks by Übernoise. While Rolf Saxon returns to voice George Stobbart, Nicole &quot;Nico&quot; Collard was this time played by Katherine Pageon.

===&quot;The Shadow of the Templars – Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and &quot;The Smoking Mirror – Remastered&quot;===
On March 21, 2009, Ubisoft released a special edition of &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; for the Wii and Nintendo DS. According to Cecil, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; came about thanks to a group of &quot;Broken Sword&quot; fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS.

When considering the project, Cecil played the game again and noticed many issues, including that backgrounds were pixelated, the movies and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, in which they could add a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic.

The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard&#x27;s back-story. Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;, worked on visual references for the game; he also produced a comic book to accompany the game&#x27;s DS release.

Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again for the first time since the original game&#x27;s release. Rolf Saxon, as in every sequel, also returns to voice George Stobbart. Unlike in the original game, players control Nicole Collard for selected game sections. Besides the new character artwork by Gibbons during conversations, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; also features a new first person view for certain puzzles. In the DS version, there is no spoken dialogue, only subtitles.

A version for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20, 2010. Later in May, a version with higher resolution and a digital comic was released on the iPad. A PC version was released on August 27 on various digital distribution services.

&quot;Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered&quot; for Apple iOS devices was released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.

===&quot;The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot;===
A fifth title in the series, &quot;Broken Sword 5: The Serpent&#x27;s Curse&quot;, was in development for six months and returned to the series&#x27; 2D graphical style; it was released in 2013. Cecil said that, despite interest from the &quot;industry&#x27;s biggest third party publisher&quot;, funding for the game&#x27;s remaining development was sought via Kickstarter with a target of $400,000. It received its funding of $771,561 in September 2012.

===&quot;Remaster Test by Tony Warriner&quot;===
In August 2021, Tony Warriner did a test run to see how &quot;Broken Sword 1&quot; would look as a remastered game, and was kind enough to share the screenshots with Pixel Refresh.

=== &quot;Shadow of the Templars Reforged&quot; ===
At Gamescom 2023 Microsoft announced a remaster of the original &quot;Broken Sword&quot;. The original game has been remastered in 4K resolution using a mixture of AI tools and brand new hand-painted background art. The game also includes new features, such as one that removes incorrect items used in puzzles if the players have used it once already, in order to guide the player to the correct answers. The reforged game is due to release in September 19 2024. It will be based on the original game, not the director&#x27;s cut.

=== &quot;Parzival&#x27;s Stone&quot; ===
Also at the Gamescom 2023 Microsoft event a new game in the series was announced, entitled &quot;Parzival&#x27;s Stone&quot;. It will feature a &quot;Super 2D&quot; visual design using hand-painted background art imposed onto three-dimensional scenes to make the game&#x27;s scenes feel more cinematic and believable.

==Reception and legacy==
===Sales and critical reception===
The &quot;Broken Sword&quot; franchise is Europe&#x27;s most successful adventure series, selling six million units; &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; and &quot;The Smoking Mirror&quot; are Revolution&#x27;s best-selling titles, each selling a million copies. With the decline of the adventure genre at the beginning of the 2000s, sales of the &quot;Broken Sword&quot; series decreased as well, with &quot;The Sleeping Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; selling a few hundred thousand copies. During the so-called &quot;adventure renaissance&quot;, the two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; remakes were met with success; in 2011, the &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and &quot;The Smoking Mirror: Remastered&quot; sold 500,000 copies on the iOS alone. By 2005, before the release of &quot;Broken Sword 4&quot;, the series had shipped above 2.5 million units to retailers worldwide.

The series&#x27; installments have received positive reviews, with &quot;The Shadow of the Templars&quot; often being cited as a classic in the adventure genre, ranking high on various &quot;top&quot; lists. The remakes were met with acclaim, most notably the iOS versions, often called one of the best games on the platform.

===Other media===
In May 2007, Charles Cecil was interested in making a film based on the game franchise.

Dave Gibbons produced comics for each remake of the first two &quot;Broken Sword&quot; games; &quot;Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, and &quot;Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered&quot;.

In September 2008, &quot;mindFactory&quot; released a fan-made freeware &quot;Broken Sword&quot; game, called &quot;Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars&quot;.

<doc id="455877" wikidata="Q6705237" url="?curid=455877" title="Lusser's law">
<text>Lusser&#x27;s law in systems engineering is a prediction of reliability. Named after engineer Robert Lusser, and also known as &quot;Lusser&#x27;s product law&quot; or the &quot;probability product law of series components&quot;, it states that the reliability of a series of components is equal to the product of the individual reliabilities of the components, if their failure modes are known to be statistically independent. For a series of &quot;N&quot; components, this is expressed as:

:formula_1

where &quot;Rs&quot; is the overall reliability of the system, and &quot;rn&quot; is the reliability of the &quot;n&quot;th component.

If the failure probabilities of all components are equal, then as Lusser&#x27;s colleague Erich Pieruschka observed, this can be expressed simply as:

:formula_2

Lusser&#x27;s law has been described as the idea that a series system is &quot;weaker than its weakest link&quot;, as the product reliability of a series of components can be less than the lowest-value component.

For example, given a series system of two components with different reliabilities — one of 0.95 and the other of 0.8 — Lusser&#x27;s law will predict a reliability of

:formula_3

which is lower than either of the individual components.

<doc id="455879" wikidata="Q919422" url="?curid=455879" title="Zakhar Chernyshev">
<text>Zakhar Grigoryevich Chernyshev (; 172231 August 1784) was a Russian noble, courtier to Catherine the Great, Imperial Russian Army officer, and Imperial Russian politician in the 18th century.

After made a courtier to then-Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1744, Chernyshev remained a favorite of the future Russian monarch into the 1770s. An Imperial Russian Army officer during the Seven Years&#x27; War, Chernyshev retired in 1764, and would be ultimately promoted to general field marshal by Catherine II. At her appointment, Chernyshev led the College of War from 1764 to 1774, served as her governor-general of the Pskov and Mogilev Governorates, and was the mayor of Moscow until his death.

==Personal life==
Born a Russian count in 1722, Zakhar Grigoryevich Chernyshev () was the older brother of Ivan and Andrei Chernyshev. By 1744, Chernyshev spoke Russian, French, and German.

When Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst was betrothed to Peter III of Russia in 1744, Chernyshev was chosen by Empress Elizabeth of Russia as one of three nobles to join the princess&#x27; personal court as a gentleman of the chamber. In 1745, Chernyshev&#x27;s mother begged Empress Elizabeth to send her son away because she feared his infatuation with the Grand Duchess Catherine Alekseievna of Russia; Chernyshev was given a diplomatic assignment. When he returned to Saint Petersburg six years later, Chernyshev began actively courting the then-grand duchess: flattering Catherine, sending love letters, and finding occasion to recreate with the royal.

Chernyshev died unexpectedly on 31 August 1784 in Moscow.

==Military==
At the age of 13, Chernyshev joined the Imperial Russian Army in 1735, and was promoted to &quot;kapitan&quot; in 1741. In 1748, he was assigned to a regiment in Moscow, and in 1750, he was promoted to the ranks of &quot;polkovnik&quot; and general-major.

As an Imperial Russian general officer, Chernyshev commanded soldiers in the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1757, he was at the Battle of Kolín, and in 1758, he joined forces with the Austrian army. For his leadership in the 1758 Battle of Zorndorf and the 1760 occupation of Berlin—capital of the Kingdom of Prussia, Chernyshev was awarded the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. In early 1762, then-General Chernyshev commanded a Russian corps of 16,000 infantry in Silesia that was attached to the Austrian army, fighting the Prussian kingdom. With the 1762 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, Peter III withdrew from the war and instead threw Russia&#x27;s lot in with Prussia. Chernyshev was given command of the Russian forces now attached to the Prussian Army, and the Prussian monarch (Frederick the Great) awarded him the Order of the Black Eagle. When Emperor Peter III was replaced by Empress Catherine II later that year on 28 June, one of her first orders was to Chernyshev: immediately return to Russia with his corps, and if King Frederick interfered, &quot;join the nearest army corps of her Imperial Roman Majesty, the empress of Austria .&quot; Upon this change in alliances, Catherine II awarded Chernyshev with the Order of St. Andrew.

In November 1762, Chernyshev was one of ten military commanders convened by Catherine II for the purposes of reforming the Imperial Russian military. Chernyshev retired from the military in early 1764, citing &quot;weak health and straitened finances.&quot;

==Politics==
In 1742, Kapitan Chernyshev was sent to the Holy Roman Empire city of Vienna, where he worked under the Russian ambassador there, Ludovic Lanczynski. At his mother&#x27;s urging, Empress Elizabeth next sent Chernyshev as her representative to the sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1745.
On 4 March 1764, Catherine II appointed Chernyshev to the College of War&#x27;s top post of vice-president. He was a Governing Senator in March 1765 when he was awarded by Catherine II for his governmental service. When it first met on 4 November 1768, Chernyshev was on Catherine II&#x27;s advisory council for the Russo-Turkish War, and in autumn 1773, he was appointed to the new position of War College president, along with a commiserate promotion to general field marshal, and advised Catherine II regarding Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion.

===Administration===
Upon the 1772 First Partition of Poland, the Russian Partition consisted mostly of former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth territory in the drainage basin of the Vistula river: that became the Pskov and Mogilev Governorates. On 28 May 1772, Chernyshev was appointed these new governorates&#x27; governor-general. He still held this office in May 1780 when Catherine II met with Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in Mogilev.

In 1782, Chernyshev was recalled to Moscow to serve as that city&#x27;s mayor. He commissioned Matvey Kazakov, and had a luxury home built on Tverskaya Street that would house Muscovite mayors into the 20th century. During his tenure, he &quot;renewed [and] decorated the ancient capital with many buildings&quot;. For his service, he was awarded the Order of Saint Vladimir by Catherine II.

==Literary references==

The action of Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie, or the New Heloise&quot; is set in and around Vevey.

Vevey, and in particular the hotel &quot;Trois Couronnes&quot; is one of two locations that comprise the setting of Henry James&#x27; novella &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;.

In Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s short story &quot;A Canary for One&quot;, three Americans—a woman and a couple—meet on a train. Vevey is named as the place where the daughter of the woman fell in love with a local man and was taken away by her family, while the couple had spent their honeymoon there.

It is also mentioned in &quot;Little Women&quot;, the classic American novel by Louisa May Alcott, as the location of the young Theodore &quot;Laurie&quot; Laurence&#x27;s early studies at boarding school as well as a stop on Amy March&#x27;s European trip. It is in Vevey where she hears of her sister&#x27;s death and becomes engaged to Laurie. Vevey was also the place where, in real life, Alcott met Ladislas Wiesniewski, who served as one of the models for Laurie.

Vevey is also the lakeside town used as the setting for Anita Brookner&#x27;s Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Hotel du Lac&quot;.

H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;, published in 1934, predicted a Second World War breaking out in 1940 and lasting until 1950. In this future scenario, Vevey is depicted as the venue of an international peace conference held in 1941, where various prominent diplomats and statesmen gather, deliver &quot;brilliant pacifist speeches [which] echo throughout Europe&quot;, but fail to end the war.

A small village church above Vevey is mentioned by John Ruskin in The Stones of Venice, CHAPTER XI, The Arch Masonry, Page 169, diagram 5. Commenting on it, &quot;It could hardly be stronger&quot;.

== Prix Clara Haskil ==
The Clara Haskil International Piano Competition is held biennially in her memory. The brochure reads: &quot;The Clara Haskil Competition was founded in 1963 to honour and perpetuate the memory of the incomparable Swiss pianist, of Romanian origin, who was born in Bucharest in 1895. It takes place every two years in Vevey, Switzerland, where Clara Haskil resided from 1942 until her death in Brussels in 1960.

==In modern music==
Rick Wakeman, keyboardist for the progressive-rock band Yes, recorded the final organ portion of the song &quot;Awaken&quot;, and the organ part in the song &quot;Parallels&quot;, (both on the Yes album &quot;Going for the One&quot;), on the pipe organ in St. Martin&#x27;s Church in Vevey. A further instrumental track, Vevey (Revisited) appears in part on the &#x27;YesYears&#x27; album, and in full on the 2003 remaster of &quot;Going for the One&quot;. Wakeman also used the St. Martin&#x27;s organ on his solo album (recorded shortly after Going for the One) &quot;Rick Wakeman&#x27;s Criminal Record&quot; most notably in the final track &quot;Judas Iscariot&quot;.

Vevey, along with the Vineyards of Lavaux are mentioned in the song &quot;Lavaux&quot; on singer Prince&#x27;s album 20Ten.

==Infrastructure==
Vevey railway station, the first station to be &quot;automated&quot; in 1956, is served by several routes of the RER Vaud commuter rail system. It has frequent trains to Blonay, Lausanne, Geneva, Montreux and Villeneuve, among others.

The Vevey–Chardonne–Mont Pèlerin funicular links Vevey with the summit of Mont Pèlerin.

The Vevey–Villeneuve trolleybus line is the last remaining of the five interurban trolleybus lines that have existed in Switzerland. It largely follows Swiss main road no. 9, passes through the municipalities of Vevey, La Tour-de-Peilz, Montreux, Veytaux and Villeneuve, and serves a total of 41 stops.
Also known as line 201, it operates every 10 minutes during the day between termini at the base station of the funicular and Villeneuve.

The number 213 bus line, operated by motor buses, goes up to Châtel-Saint-Denis and Bossonnens. There are also late night &quot;Petit Prince&quot; buses.

Vevey is well connected on the lake with boats going to all the major harbours like Le Bouveret, Saint Gingolph, Evian, Lausanne and more.

<text>Złotów is a town in northwestern Poland, with a population of 18,303 inhabitants (2011), seat of the Złotów County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

The town is located on the river Głomia and is surrounded by five lakes. It is part of the historic Greater Poland region. A railway line connects it to Piła and Chojnice, with buses operating locally. The local Metaplast windows fitting factory is the biggest industrial employer. The Euro Eco Meeting is organized regularly there each July.

==History==
Złotów is the historical centre of the northern part of Krajna. Human activity in the region goes as far back as the 8th century BC. Around 700 AD, a hill fort on the shore of the Baba lake was the residence of a Pomeranian tribal chief. The land belonged to the dukes of Gdańsk Pomerania from the house of the Samborides within partitioned Poland and after the last duke Mestwin II died in 1294 it passed under direct rule of the Piast dynasty. In the early 14th century it was occupied by the Teutonic Knights. Złotów was mentioned in 1370 in the chronicle of Jan of Czarnków. In 1370, Złotów was granted Magdeburg rights while under Polish rule. According to the last will of Polish king Casimir III the Great after his death in 1370 his grandson, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, was to inherit the lands of Dobrzyń, Bydgoszcz, Kruszwica, Złotów and Wałcz as fiefs.
Złotów was destroyed by the Teutonic Knights in 1455 during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. The town later belonged to the Potulicki family which provided it with a new Gothic castle in Renaissance style at the beginning of the 17th century. In 1619, Jan Potulicki issued a founding document for the church and parish of the Holy Assumption of Mary. Later it passed to the Grudziński family. In 1665 the town still had Magdeburg rights. The castle was destroyed during the Swedish invasion in 1657. The bombardment also destroyed other parts of the city including the town hall. A new church, still standing today, was founded there in 1664 by Andrzej Karol Grudziński. After the rule of the Grudziński family came to an end in 1688, the Działyński family came into power.

From 1709 to 1711, a plague beset the area. According to incomplete church records, approximately 1,650 people died as a result of the epidemic. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Złotów was incorporated into Prussia. In 1784 a Protestant half-timbered church was built on the great market square, which during the time span 1829–31 was replaced by a modern church designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.

From 1772 to 1945, as part of Prussia and later Germany it was known as &quot;Flatow&quot;. The town was given county (&quot;Kreis&quot;) town status in 1818. It was part of the Flatow district in the Prussian Province of West Prussia. In 1871, a railway line from Piła (then &quot;Schneidemühl&quot;) was completed. Around this time many local people emigrated to America, including many members of the local Polish community. Despite the Germanisation policy of the Prussian authorities, local Poles founded several organizations, including the People&#x27;s Bank (&quot;Bank Ludowy&quot;), the &quot;Cecylia&quot; choir, which is one of the oldest still existing choirs of Greater Poland and an agricultural and trade cooperative, all three of these entities operate to this day.
In 1919, it was decided that the eastern part of the Flatow district would be ceded to Poland and the western part of the district, including the town of Flatow would remain in Germany. This caused huge protests from the large Polish minority of the town (approx. 12%) and the surrounding rural lands. From 1922 until 1938, Flatow was part of the newly formed Province of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia inside Germany. When this province was dissolved on 1 October 1938, Flatow was integrated into the Province of Pomerania. Despite this, the town became the seat of local branches of the Union of Poles in Germany and the Polish-Catholic School Society. Local Poles managed to establish a Polish school, preschool, library and the Sparta Złotów football club (multi-section club after the war). Polish press was still issued in the town. The Polish school was devastated by the Germans in the 1930s, and the local synagogue was destroyed during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938. In 1939, shortly before the invasion of Poland, local Polish activists and teachers were arrested and later imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. During World War II, the Polish resistance conducted espionage of German activity in the town. In the last months of the war, the town was captured by Polish troops in the on 31 January 1945 and was finally reintegrated with Poland.
After World War II, the redrawn borders forced upon Germany and Poland by the Soviet Union in the Potsdam Agreement placed the town, once again, inside Poland. Its first post-war mayor was , leading pre-war Polish activist in Złotów, who was imprisoned by the Germans in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during the war. Already in 1945, new Polish schools were founded, and both the Sparta Złotów sports club and the &quot;Cecylia&quot; choir resumed their activities. The Culture Center was established in 1946 and the Municipal Library in 1947. In 1957, the only monument in Poland to Piast the Wheelwright, the semi-legendary founder of the Piast dynasty, was unveiled in Złotów. In 1961 the Regional Museum was established. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Piła Voivodeship.

<doc id="455898" wikidata="Q881018" url="?curid=455898" title="Blade Runner (1997 video game)">
<text>Blade Runner is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive for Microsoft Windows, released in November 1997. The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1982 Ridley Scott film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; but is instead a &quot;sidequel&quot;, telling an original story, which runs parallel to the film&#x27;s plot, occasionally intersecting with it.

Set in 2019 Los Angeles, the game tells the story of Ray McCoy, an elite detective charged with hunting down a group of dangerous replicants (bioengineered androids designed to look and act like humans). Although several of the film&#x27;s characters appear in the game, with some of the original actors returning to voice them, the film&#x27;s protagonist, Rick Deckard, does not appear in a speaking role. Instead, he is referred to on multiple occasions, is seen several times, and his activities as depicted in the film are mentioned. Other parallels with the film include the reproduction of several prominent locations, as well as scenes and dialogue closely modelled on the original. The game also features extracts from the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

&quot;Blade Runner&quot; was advertised as a &quot;real-time 3D adventure game&quot;, since it was one of the first adventure games to use both 3D character rendering and a game world which progressed in real-time (as opposed to waiting for the player&#x27;s actions). Unlike many games of its time, which used polygon-based renderers exploiting 3D accelerators, Westwood opted for their own software-based renderer using voxel technology.

The game received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, selling over one million units worldwide. It went on to win the Interactive Achievement Award for &quot;PC Adventure Game of the Year&quot; and was nominated for &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot; by &quot;PC Gamer&quot;. Virgin Interactive wanted Westwood to make a sequel, but it was thought the cost of production would make the game commercially unviable and the idea was scrapped. For many years, it remained trapped in legal and intellectual property entanglement, preventing a re-release on digital storefronts, until it finally arrived on GOG.com in December 2019. Nightdive Studios and Alcon Entertainment released an &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot; of the game on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on June 23, 2022.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Blade Runner&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game played from a third-person perspective, in which the game world is navigated, explored, and manipulated using the mouse. The pointer has four different styles depending on the given situation; a standard grey pointer is used to move McCoy by clicking on any location, and scan the screen for elements with which to interact; an animated green pointer indicates McCoy can interact with an object or begin a conversation with an NPC; an animated blue pointer indicates the screen can be changed and a new area accessed (usually appears at the sides of the screen or in doorways); an animated red target becomes available only in combat mode and indicates McCoy can fire (if the target is grey, it means McCoy cannot fire).

&quot;Blade Runner″s&quot; main focus is detective work rather than puzzles or combat, and the majority of gameplay consists of searching for evidence, questioning suspects and analyzing clues. Occasionally, the player must solve compulsory puzzles, and often, to progress the story, certain clues must be located. Clues are found by searching crime scenes, and come in the form of items, photographs, interviews, or unusual markings. When analyzing photographs, the player must use the ESPER system, a high-density computer with a powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity which allows for the enhancement of photos and enables the player to find details within the picture. Combat is occasionally available in the game, but is rarely compulsory. The only weapon available to the player is McCoy&#x27;s standard issue police pistol, which may be loaded with various types of ammunition.

Another important investigative tool at the player&#x27;s disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people to determine if they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject&#x27;s eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a human; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, the more likely they are replicant. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go. Which characters are replicants is randomized each time a new game is started.

Aside from choosing how to react to Voight-Kampff results, the player must also decide how McCoy conducts himself in other areas of the game, such as whether to interrogate an NPC or simply talk to them and how aggressive to be in his questioning. The player can choose from one of five settings regarding McCoy&#x27;s demeanor during conversations: &quot;Polite&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Surly&quot;, &quot;Erratic&quot; (the game randomly picks one of the first three options at different points of the conversation), and &quot;User Choice&quot;. If the fifth option is selected, conversations with NPCs will present the player with menus from which they can choose their questions, rather than the game automatically selecting questions. Each choice will affect the storyline differently, with the player&#x27;s cumulative decisions leading to one of the game&#x27;s thirteen different endings.

All clues, conversation histories, and documents are stored in McCoy&#x27;s &quot;Knowledge Integration Assistant&quot; (KIA), where they are automatically organized for easy access. The KIA has three main sections. The &quot;Crime Scene Panel&quot; lists the various crime scenes, along with all known suspects and all related clues. The &quot;Suspect Panel&quot; displays all available information about the suspects for the various crimes. It includes a photo of the suspect (if the player has found one), a list of crimes to which they are connected, and a list of clues which tie them to a specific crime. Suspect clues are arranged into four categories; &quot;Whereabouts&quot; (known places the suspect has visited, and suggestions as to their current location), &quot;MO&quot; (information on the suspect&#x27;s previous actions, and suggestions as to their possible future actions), &quot;Replicant&quot; (any evidence suggesting the suspect may be a replicant) and &quot;Non-replicant&quot; (any evidence suggesting the suspect may be a human). The &quot;Clue Panel&quot; is a master list of all clues, but also contains clues which have not been linked to a specific crime or suspect as of yet, and, as such, are not available in either of the other two sections. The KIA also keeps track of McCoy&#x27;s money and ammunition.

The game runs in nonlinear &quot;real time&quot;, meaning that as McCoy investigates and gathers clues, the NPC characters are doing the same, completing their own objectives and performing random actions elsewhere in the game world. A good example of this is found in the computer mainframe, which is accessible from the police headquarters. When the player uploads their KIA data into the mainframe, any evidence collected by other Blade Runners is automatically downloaded into the player&#x27;s KIA. This tends to be random, with different pieces of evidence discovered by different Blade Runners becoming available at different times of the game.

==Story==

===Main characters===
* Ray McCoy (voiced by Mark Benninghofen): the game&#x27;s protagonist and a rookie Blade Runner. McCoy shares his apartment with his pet dog, Maggie.
* Crystal Steele (Lisa Edelstein): one of the best Blade Runners on the job and an expert in undercover work. She hates replicants, believing they should be exterminated. She is somewhat condescending towards McCoy early in the game but grows to respect him as the story progresses.
* Gaff (Javier Grajeda as Victor Gardell): a veteran Blade Runner who often offers McCoy advice.
* Lieutenant Edison Guzza (Jeff Garlin): temporarily placed in charge of the Blade Runner unit while the previous commander, Captain Bryant, is on sick leave.
* Clovis (Mark Rolston): the leader of a group of renegade replicants. Highly intelligent and eloquent, he is also extremely ruthless, unpredictable and, at times, capable of extreme acts of aggression.
* Lucy Devlin (Pauley Perrette): a fourteen-year-old girl who works at the pet store attacked by the replicants in the opening scene

===Supporting characters===
* Dektora (Signy Coleman): an exotic dancer.
* Sadik (Alexander Mervin): a member of Clovis&#x27; gang.
* Howie Lee (Toru Nagai): the owner of a restaurant in Chinatown.
* Zuben (Gerald Okamura): a replicant who works as a chef at Howie Lee&#x27;s Restaurant in Chinatown.
* Luther and Lance (Jason Cottle): identical twin replicant brothers who are former Tyrell Corporation employees.
* Gordo Frizz (Bruno Oliver): a stand-up comedian.
* Runciter (Warren Burton): the owner of the pet store attacked by the game&#x27;s replicants.
* Izo (Timothy Dang): a weapons dealer who supplies automatic firearms to Clovis&#x27; gang.
* Bullet Bob (Vincent Schiavelli): a World War III veteran who runs a gun shop near Animoid Row.

Original cast members from the 1982 film who make cameo appearances in the game are Sean Young as Rachael, Brion James as Leon, James Hong as Hannibal Chew, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, and William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian.

===Plot===
The game begins shortly after the beginning of the film, with McCoy tasked with tracking down a group of replicants who are suspected of murdering animals—a crime nearly as heinous as murdering humans since most animal species are extinct and real specimens are exceedingly rare.

As McCoy&#x27;s investigation progresses, he is framed for the murder of a civilian by the corrupt Lieutenant Guzza, who has been assisting the replicants in an effort to prevent them from revealing his activities. Forced into hiding, McCoy explores the underbelly of LA and makes contact with the replicant twins Luther and Lance, former genetic designers for the Tyrell Corporation who are now working to extend their own lifespans as well as those of all other replicants. From them, McCoy receives a detailed report containing evidence of Guzza&#x27;s corruption. Using this information, he blackmails Guzza and forces him to set his falsified record straight. They meet in the city sewers for the exchange, where Guzza is wounded by replicant gunfire. At this point, the player can either run away or kill Guzza.

The game features thirteen different endings, which are influenced by the player&#x27;s cumulative actions and decisions throughout the story. The endings are variations on three major themes:

* McCoy is human and hunts down the replicants either alone or with Crystal.
* McCoy is a replicant himself and sides with the other replicants.
* McCoy&#x27;s status remains ambiguous and he sides with neither the replicants nor the police, instead leaving the city—either alone, with Dektora, or with Lucy.

===Poems===
Within the plot Clovis is shown as a big fan of William Blake. The following works were cited:
* The Tyger - In the opening cutscene, when he kills the animals (including a tiger, the most valuable animal in the collection) belonging to Runciter, who sexually harassed Clovis&#x27;s 14 y.o. stepdaughter Lucy, who was an employee in his shop, in order to punish him.
* Jerusalem - the last stanza, when discussing McCoy fate at the roof.
* The Marriage of Heaven and Hell - &quot;A fool sees not the same tree a wise man sees.&quot; - when discussing McCoy fate in the room.
* A Poison Tree - the first stanza, when visiting the twins.
* To Tirzah - The first stanza, when killing Guzza.
* Memory, Hither Come - the last stanza, when assaulting Tyrell.
* With happiness stretchd across the hills - the third part of the poem, the last words before expiration.

==Development==
===Origins===
The initial idea for a video game adaptation of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; came from The Blade Runner Partnership (composed of Bud Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio of Tandem Productions). They originally approached Electronic Arts, Sierra and Activision, before Virgin Interactive agreed to take the project on. However, the rights to the film were spread out over several entities, each of whom owned a different aspect, making production of the game complex from a copyright perspective; The Ladd Company owned North American distribution rights to the film; Run Run Shaw owned international distribution rights; and The Blade Runner Partnership owned all ancillary rights, and were the bond guarantors, who had taken control of the film when it went over-budget and over-schedule towards the end of production. As a result, sorting out the rights took several years before Virgin were in a position to actually begin development. They ultimately hired Westwood Studios to work on the game, but even with the rights secured, and the game in pre-production, there were still legal problems. As Louis Castle, the game&#x27;s executive producer, art director and technical director, explains

However, Castle&#x27;s unique idea for the game somewhat side-stepped the potential legal problems. He didn&#x27;t want to adapt the film; he wanted to make an original game set within the film&#x27;s &quot;milieu&quot;. This would mean the game would not have to borrow as heavily from the film as it would were it a straight adaptation, hence avoiding the potential legal problems down the road. Virgin loved Castle&#x27;s idea, and asked him to make a pitch to Bud Yorkin. Castle built a demo for the pitch, but rather than using footage from the film, he and his team created a rough opening cutscene based on the film&#x27;s aesthetic style, but without recreating any exact scenes. According to Castle, going into the pitch, Yorkin was concerned about how much footage from the film would be needed for the game, but when he saw the demo, he was thrilled, and asked Castle if the whole game could be made in a similar manner. From that point forward, the development team had one overriding mandate; every scene in the game would be generated from scratch in 3D; no footage from the film would be used.

Although both footage and the film&#x27;s soundtrack were off-limits, the designers were allowed to re-create the likenesses of the actors who had appeared in the film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn&#x27;t surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused to talk about it in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film&#x27;s director, as he too had had a bad experience on the film, and had fallen out with Bud Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.

One major contributor to the film who did work with the developers, however, was Syd Mead, whose concept art formed the basis for &quot;Blade Runner&quot;″s aesthetic. Mead sent the team extracts from his original &quot;Blade Runner&quot; artwork. However, they quickly noticed a disparity – Mead&#x27;s art didn&#x27;t correlate with the finished film; whilst his artwork tended to be highly stylized and polished, the film had a much grittier and &quot;lived-in&quot; texture. The team contacted one of the film&#x27;s set builders, who explained that had Mead&#x27;s artwork been used as it was presented, the film would have cost too much, so production designer Lawrence G. Paull and art director David Snyder had decided to create &quot;less perfect&quot; versions of Mead&#x27;s designs; they took Mead&#x27;s concepts and remoulded them. Inspired by this, Castle issued a similar directive to his design team; nothing in the game was to be created from scratch, everything had to come from either the film or Mead&#x27;s art.

===Story===
From the beginning, Westwood had no interest in doing a straight adaptation of the film as either a shoot &#x27;em up or traditional point-and-click adventure game. As a result, the team decided to write a new story set within the fictional &quot;milieu&quot; of the film – a story in which players would play not as Rick Deckard, but as a new character, Ray McCoy. This allowed fans of the film the experience of seeing the sights and sounds of the movie, but without knowing where the story is heading.

The writers decided the plot of the game would begin shortly after the opening of the film, with Deckard having already been assigned to track down Roy Batty and the other replicants. The game&#x27;s plot was imagined in such a way that the player would occasionally hear about Deckard, but would never meet him. For example, when visiting the Tyrell building, Rachael mentions that she has already spoken to another Blade Runner, and Tyrell tells McCoy, &quot;as I explained to Mr. Deckard earlier, I&#x27;ve given the Nexus 6 a past.&quot; Another example is a photograph taken in Animoid Row, which shows Deckard in the background, and prompts McCoy to exclaim &quot;He looks familiar.&quot; Additionally, while searching Leon&#x27;s room in the Yukon hotel, McCoy discovers Det. Holden&#x27;s badge, and Lt. Guzza questions how Deckard missed it, going on to say, &quot;Deckard, he feels too much, ya&#x27; know?&quot; The developers were also keen to include locations from the film, such as the Bradbury Building, the Tyrell Corporation Pyramid, and the L.A.P.D.&#x27;s cylindrical skyscraper. They also enlisted many of the actors from the film to make cameos in the game; Sean Young as Rachael, Brion James as Leon, James Hong as Hannibal Chew, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, and William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian.

Of paramount importance to the designers was that the story of the film be treated as sacrosanct – nothing the player can do in the game can ever alter, contradict or in any way run contrary to what happens in the film. David Yorkin, Bud&#x27;s son, and David Leary worked on the game&#x27;s script, initially writing it as a linear game. However, the designers wanted the game to feature a great deal of random elements, with the idea being that no two playthroughs would be the same, and no walkthrough would be able to cover every possible eventuality or every possible combination of random events. The game presents the player with fifteen suspects, but only two are &quot;always&quot; replicants (Clovis and a cook named Zuben). Which of the other thirteen characters is a replicant is randomized every time the player plays the game, and their behavior is different each playthrough based upon whether or not they are human. Due to the random nature of the game, the script swelled to 500 pages, and the quality assurance people had to play through the game 2,500 times to experience every possible variation.

Because of how central to the plot randomness is, NPC behavior was not scripted. Instead, each NPC is assigned certain goals to accomplish based upon whether they are a replicant or a human. How they go about accomplishing these goals is handled by the AI system, and can change from game to game, as most of the goals have several possible methods of achievement. The developers likened this aspect of the game to simulation games such as &quot;SimCity&quot; rather than traditional adventure games such as &quot;Myst&quot;. Castle explains, &quot;those agents are real, goal-oriented artificial intelligences. We don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going to do, exactly. We&#x27;ve given them behavior, we haven&#x27;t given them instructions. There&#x27;s a big difference between behavior-based AI and scripted instructions.&quot;

===Design===
The graphic design of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was extremely ambitious for the available technology of the time. In contrast to many contemporaneous games, the game engine included pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D characters, but did not require the use of any hardware 3D accelerators. Designers David Leary and James Walls achieved this through a self-developed technology using voxels (pixels with width, height and depth). Castle explains,

The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn&#x27;t be used, as there would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the designers used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said &quot;people ask me all the time &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you just use 3D?&quot; Well, that&#x27;s easy to say now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back then you just didn&#x27;t. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn&#x27;t accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I&#x27;d do it all in 3D.&quot; Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.

The game&#x27;s environment takes up 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, primarily because of the moving camera, but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.

All character animations in the game are based on motion-captured actors, with the characters moving in the pre-rendered 3D environment. At the time, any game that attempted 1,000 motion-captured sequences was considered cutting edge; &quot;Blade Runner&quot; featured 20,000. Speaking in 2014, Castle stated

===Music===
The rights for the film&#x27;s original soundtrack could not be secured for the game, so Westwood brought in their in-house composer Frank Klepacki to create new tracks based on Vangelis&#x27; score, and also to re-record some of the main tracks from the film. As Klepacki was not allowed access to the original master recordings, he had to re-create the music by ear.

==Reception==
&quot;Blade Runner&quot; received generally positive reviews. It held an aggregate score of 77% on GameRankings, based on sixteen reviews.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; rated it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;the game&#x27;s shortcomings seem irrelevant as the journey that Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford began 15 years ago is brought to an entirely new end at the player&#x27;s command. All movie-licensed game publishers should take note.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; likewise judged that the game&#x27;s strongest points are its faithfulness to the book and movie and the way the ending is determined by the player&#x27;s actions throughout the game. They also complimented the cinematics, dialogue, and &quot;riveting plot and slick style&quot;, though they criticized the character models for their &quot;overwrought body language&quot; and said that those who are not fans of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; would find it solid but unexciting. They gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics, 5.0 for sound, 4.0 for control, and 4.5 for fun factor.

&quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;″s Peter Suciu awarded it an A+, writing the &quot;computer-generated setting of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is simply one of the best to arrive on computer desktops,&quot; and calling the game &quot;an outstandingly enjoyable adventure simulation.&quot; &quot;Game Revolution&quot; Marke Cooke scored the game an A−, calling it &quot;one of the best adventure games out there.&quot; &quot;RPGFan&quot; gave the game an overall rating of 93%, praising its pre-rendered backgrounds, with &quot;rain, spotlights, Spinners or blimps advertising off-world vacations. The crisp images never fail to dazzle.&quot; Although the review pointed out that the graphics can become a &quot;tad blurry and pixilated,&quot; it was argued &quot;this doesn&#x27;t detract too much from these otherwise stunning visuals.&quot;

In a 2006 review for Adventure Gamers, Chris Pickering scored the game 4.5 out of 5, praising it for its &quot;glorious aesthetics, intriguing storyline, and well implemented controls.&quot;

Less impressed was &quot;GameSpot&quot; Ron Dulin, who scored the game 6 out of 10, calling it &quot;an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise – but somewhere along the production line, someone forgot to include a game.&quot; He was critical of the random nature of the game, especially the multiple endings; &quot;To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague for the bulk of the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up.&quot; He concluded, &quot;most of what&#x27;s interesting about the game is exactly what was interesting about the film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game&#x27;s flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting.&quot;

In a 2007 article for &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, &quot;&quot;Blade Runner&quot;: A Classic Revisited&quot;, Duncan Harris argued &quot;critics may have been divided over the means by which you got there: a logical trail of clues, many of which were less the result of detective work than blind luck and idle exploration [...] but you couldn&#x27;t deny that here, for once, was a movie tie-in which put the movie first, dismissing thoughts of its own genre and letting the subject dictate the design. With its insular thinking, it&#x27;s something the games industry all too rarely sees.&quot;

===Sales and awards===
&quot;Blade Runner&quot; was a commercial success. In the United States alone, it sold 15,307 copies and earned $795,045 by November 30, 1997. Between January 1998 and July 1998, it sold another 47,939 copies in the region, which drew $2,283,055 in revenues. Westwood&#x27;s Louis Castle reported that its lifetime sales had reached 800,000 units worldwide by February 2002. &quot;Blade Runner&quot;″s sales ultimately surpassed one million units by 2006; Castle claimed that it outsold &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; three to one.

&quot;Blade Runner&quot; was the winner in the category of &quot;PC Adventure Game of the Year&quot; during the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards; it also received nominations for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;, &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Software Engineering&quot;, and &quot;Interactive Title of the Year&quot;, losing in the first category to &quot;&quot;, the second category to &quot;StarCraft&quot;, and the last two to &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;. In 1998, it was nominated for &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; and for &quot;Best Adventure Game&quot; at the &quot;PC Gamer&quot; awards, losing on both occasions to &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Blade Runner&quot; the 21st-best adventure game ever released. PC Gamer also did a retrospective on the game, praising it for being authentic to the cyberpunk setting more than other similar themed games.

==Sequel and re-release==
===Sequel===
&quot;Blade Runner&quot; sold well, but due to high development costs, the profit margin was low. According to Louis Castle, &quot;The mere fact it was four CDs made it a very expensive game. And the deal we had with the Blade Runner Partnership meant it was not terribly profitable. It didn&#x27;t do as well as you might think.&quot; Although Virgin were interested in doing a sequel, if a sequel were approved, the Blade Runner Partnership intended to increase the licensing fee. Ultimately, Westwood and Virgin concluded the cost of producing a game to top the original, coupled with the increased cost for licensing, made the prospect of a sequel economically untenable, as such a sequel would have to sell several million units to generate what would be considered an acceptable profit. In 2009, the Blade Runner Partnership offered Gearbox Software the rights to the franchise, but production costs were estimated at $35 million and the project was scrapped.

===Re-release===
Speaking in 2015 regarding a possible re-release of the game via Steam or GOG.com, Louis Castle explained the source code and assets were lost when Westwood moved its studio from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, thus making a re-release or a HD remaster impossible. Even if the code was found, to restore almost a terabyte of assets, whether for new pre-rendered backdrops or full real-time 3D, would cost tens of millions of dollars, making a re-release as unlikely as a sequel. The Blade Runner Partnership and Electronic Arts owned the rights to the game for many years by that point.

The game made it to GOG.com on December 17, 2019, after an agreement with Alcon Interactive Group and the website, using ScummVM.

===ScummVM===
Several attempts were made to reverse engineer the game&#x27;s engine. As it is technically complex with voxel graphics for the in-game actors, video backgrounds, and randomised paths, it took the ultimately successful project with combined efforts eight years to completion. The new Blade Runner engine was included in the game engine collection ScummVM on 13 October 2016. It took another three years until it was ready for public testing on 16 June 2019, and was included in ScummVM version 2.1.0.

===Enhanced Edition===
Nightdive Studios and Alcon Entertainment announced they would be developing an Enhanced Edition of the game. It was originally planned to release in 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, but was delayed to an unspecified date due to technical issues. Stephen Kick explained that while the source code for the game was lost, they had reverse engineered it and reworked within their proprietary KEX engine, used for other remastered games. In addition to support for modern systems, the Enhanced Edition included updated character models, animations and cutscenes. Many of the supporting assets to make the fixed graphic scenes were also lost, so Nightdive used a combination of graphics tools and machine learning to upscale these for modern systems as well as increasing the frame rate on the video scenes.
&quot;Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition&quot; was released on June 23, 2022. The game was met with negative reception, that the improved graphics were worse than the original game or the unofficial ScummVM port. Nightdive informed they would fix this in upcoming patches. Nightdive updated the Steam version of the &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot; to include the ScummVM version alongside the enhanced version a few days later. Metacritic listed &quot;Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition&quot; as the tenth-worst game of 2022.

<text>Acrophobia, also known as hypsophobia, is an extreme or irrational fear or phobia of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort, that share similar causes and options for treatment.

Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, known as the fear of falling. On the other hand, those who have little fear of such exposure are said to have a head for heights. A head for heights is advantageous for hiking or climbing in mountainous terrain and also in certain jobs such as steeplejacks or wind turbine mechanics.

People with acrophobia can experience a panic attack in high places and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. Approximately 2–5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men. The term is from the , , meaning &quot;peak, summit, edge&quot; and , , &quot;fear&quot;. The term &quot;hypsophobia&quot; derives from the Greek word (hypsos), meaning &quot;height&quot;. In Greek, the actual term used for this condition is &quot;υψοφοβία&quot; (Hypsophobia).

== Confusion with vertigo ==

&quot;Vertigo&quot; is often used to describe a fear of heights, but it is more accurately a spinning sensation that occurs when one is not actually spinning. It can be triggered by looking down from a high place, by looking straight up at a high place or tall object, or even by watching something (i.e. a car or a bird) go past at high speed, but this alone does not describe vertigo. True vertigo can be triggered by almost any type of movement (e.g. standing up, sitting down, walking) or change in visual perspective (e.g. squatting down, walking up or down stairs, looking out of the window of a moving car or train). Vertigo is called &quot;height vertigo&quot; when the sensation of vertigo is triggered by heights.

Height vertigo is caused by a conflict between vision, vestibular and somatosensory senses. This occurs when vestibular and somatosensory systems sense a body movement that is not detected by the eyes. More research indicates that this conflict leads to both motion sickness and anxiety. Confusion may arise in differentiating between height vertigo and acrophobia due to the conditions&#x27; overlapping symptom pools, including body swaying and dizziness. Further confusion can occur due to height vertigo being a direct symptom of acrophobia. 

== Causes ==
Traditionally, acrophobia has been attributed, like other phobias, to conditioning or a traumatic experience. Recent studies have cast doubt on this explanation. Individuals with acrophobia are found to be lacking in traumatic experiences. Nevertheless, this may be due to the failure to recall the experiences, as memory fades as time passes. To address the problems of self report and memory, a large cohort study with 1000 participants was conducted from birth; the results showed that participants with less fear of heights had more injuries because of falling. Psychologists Richie Poulton, Simon Davies, Ross G. Menzies, John D. Langley, and Phil A. Silva sampled subjects from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study who had been injured in a fall between the ages of 5 and 9, compared them to children who had no similar injury, and found that at age 18, acrophobia was present in only 2 percent of the subjects who had an injurious fall but was present among 7 percent of subjects who had no injurious fall (with the same sample finding that typical basophobia was 7 times less common in subjects at age 18 who had injurious falls as children than subjects that did not).

More studies have suggested a possible explanation for acrophobia is that it emerges through accumulation of non-traumatic experiences of falling that are not memorable but can influence behaviours in the future. Also, fear of heights may be acquired when infants learn to crawl. If they fell, they would learn the concepts about surfaces, posture, balance, and movement. Cognitive factors may also contribute to the development of acrophobia. People tend to wrongly interpret visuo-vestibular discrepancies as dizziness and nausea and associate them with a forthcoming fall. Experiencing these cognitive factors while associating them with the idea of falling may be enough to cause the same fear that would be expected after a traumatic fall.

A fear of falling, along with a fear of loud noises, is one of the most commonly suggested inborn or &quot;non-associative&quot; fears. The newer non-association theory is that a fear of heights is an evolved adaptation to a world where falls posed a significant danger. If this fear is inherited, it is possible that people can get rid of it by frequent exposure of heights in habituation. In other words, acrophobia could be associated with a lack of exposure to heights in early life. The degree of fear varies, and the term phobia is reserved for those at the extreme end of the spectrum. Researchers have argued that a fear of heights is an instinct found in many mammals, including domestic animals and humans. Experiments using visual cliffs have shown human infants and toddlers, as well as other animals of various ages, to be reluctant in venturing onto a glass floor with a view of a few meters of apparent fall-space below it. Although human infants initially experienced fear when crawling on the visual cliff, most of them overcame the fear through practice, exposure and mastery and retained a level of healthy cautiousness. While an innate cautiousness around heights is helpful for survival, extreme fear can interfere with the activities of everyday life, such as standing on a ladder or chair, or even walking up a flight of stairs. It is uncertain if acrophobia is related to the failure to reach a certain developmental stage. Besides associative accounts, a diathetic-stress model is also very appealing for considering both vicarious learning and hereditary factors such as personality traits (i.e., neuroticism).

Another possible contributing factor is a dysfunction in maintaining balance. In this case, the anxiety is both well-founded and secondary. The human balance system integrates proprioceptive, vestibular and nearby visual cues to reckon position and motion. As height increases, visual cues recede and balance becomes poorer in people without acrophobia. However, most people respond to such a situation by shifting to more reliance on the proprioceptive and vestibular branches of the equilibrium system.

Some people are known to be more dependent on visual signals than others. People who rely more on visual cues to control body movements are less physically stable. An acrophobic, however, continues to over-rely on visual signals, whether because of inadequate vestibular function or incorrect strategy. Locomotion at a high elevation requires more than normal visual processing. The visual cortex becomes overloaded, resulting in confusion. Some proponents of the alternative view of acrophobia warn that it may be ill-advised to encourage acrophobics to expose themselves to height without first resolving the vestibular issues. Research is underway at several clinics. Recent studies found that participants experienced increased anxiety not only when the height increased, but also when they were required to move sideways at a fixed height.

A recombinant model of the development of acrophobia is very possible, in which learning factors, cognitive factors (e.g. interpretations), perceptual factors (e.g. visual dependence), and biological factors (e.g. heredity) interact to provoke fear or habituation.

== Assessment ==
ICD-10 and DSM-5 are used to diagnose acrophobia. Acrophobia Questionnaire (AQ) is a self report that contains 40 items, assessing anxiety level on a 0–6 point scale and degree of avoidance on a 0–2 point scale. The Attitude Towards Heights Questionnaires (ATHQ) and Behavioural Avoidance Tests (BAT) are also used.

However, acrophobic individuals tend to have biases in self-reporting. They often overestimate the danger and question their abilities of addressing height relevant issues. A Height Interpretation Questionnaire (HIQ) is a self-report to measure these height relevant judgements and interpretations. The Depression Scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short form (DASS21-DS) is a self report used to examine validity of the HIQ.

== Treatment ==
Traditional treatment of phobias is still in use today. Its underlying theory states that phobic anxiety is conditioned and triggered by a conditional stimulus. By avoiding phobic situations, anxiety is reduced. However, avoidance behaviour is reinforced through negative reinforcement. Wolpe developed a technique called systematic desensitization to help participants avoid &quot;avoidance&quot;. Research results have suggested that even with a decrease in therapeutic contact, desensitization is still very effective. However, other studies have shown that therapists play an essential role in acrophobia treatment. Treatments like reinforced practice and self-efficacy treatments also emerged.

There have been a number of studies into using virtual reality therapy for acrophobia. Botella and colleagues and Schneider were the first to use VR in treatment. Specifically, Schneider utilised inverted lenses in binoculars to &quot;alter&quot; the reality. Later in the mid-1990s, VR became computer-based and was widely available for therapists. A cheap VR equipment uses a normal PC with head-mounted display (HMD). In contrast, VRET uses an advanced computer automatic virtual environment (CAVE). VR has several advantages over &quot;in vivo&quot; treatment: (1) therapist can control the situation better by manipulating the stimuli, in terms of their quality, intensity, duration and frequency; (2) VR can help participants avoid public embarrassment and protect their confidentiality; (3) therapist&#x27;s office can be well-maintained; (4) VR encourages more people to seek treatment; (5) VR saves time and money, as participants do not need to leave the consulting room.

Many different types of medications are used in the treatment of phobias like fear of heights, including traditional anti-anxiety drugs such as benzodiazepines, and newer options such as antidepressants and beta-blockers.

== Prognosis ==
Some desensitization treatments produce short-term improvements in symptoms. Long-term treatment success has been elusive.

== Epidemiology ==
Approximately 2–5% of the general population has acrophobia, with twice as many women affected as men.

A related, milder form of visually triggered fear or anxiety is called visual height intolerance (vHI). Up to one-third of people may have some level of visual height intolerance. Pure vHI usually has smaller impact on individuals compared to acrophobia, in terms of intensity of symptoms load, social life, and overall life quality. However, few people with visual height intolerance seek professional help.

<doc id="455907" wikidata="Q2000742" url="?curid=455907" title="Astraphobia">
<text>Astraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, ceraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning or an unwarranted fear of scattered and/or isolated thunderstorms, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia is composed of the Greek words ἀστραπή (astrape; lightning) and φόβος (phobos; fear).

==Signs and symptoms==
A person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, feeling of dread, insertion of the fingers in the ears, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm. They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows.

A typical sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. A person with astraphobia may be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. This can lead to anxiety and in very extreme cases, agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home.

==Children==

In 2007, scientists found astraphobia is the third most prevalent phobia in the US. It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child&#x27;s phobia should be addressed, as it may become a serious problem in adulthood.

To lessen a child&#x27;s fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment.

==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==
The most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Some other treatment methods include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to themselves in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort.

==Dogs and cats==
Dogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol – a hormone associated with stress – affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and dog appeasing pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers.

Studies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is less common, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm.

Generally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals.

<doc id="455908" wikidata="Q19178" url="?curid=455908" title="Harmodius and Aristogeiton">
<text>Harmodius (Greek: Ἁρμόδιος, &quot;Harmódios&quot;) and Aristogeiton (Ἀριστογείτων, &quot;Aristogeíton&quot;; both died 514 BC) were two lovers in Classical Athens who became known as the [[Tyrannicide]]s (τυραννόκτονοι, &quot;tyrannoktonoi&quot;) for their assassination of Hipparchus, the brother of the tyrant Hippias, for which they were executed. A few years later, in 510 BC, the Spartan king Cleomenes I forced Hippias to go into exile, thereby opening the way to the subsequent democratic reforms of Cleisthenes. The Athenian democrats later celebrated Harmodius and Aristogeiton as national heroes, partially to conceal the role played by Sparta in the removal of the Athenian tyranny. Cleisthenes notably commissioned the famous statues of the Tyrannicides.

==Background==
The two principal historical sources covering Harmodius and Aristogeiton are the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; (VI, 56–59) by Thucydides, and &quot;The Constitution of the Athenians&quot; (XVIII) attributed to Aristotle or his school. However, their story is documented by a great many other ancient writers, including important sources such as Herodotus and Plutarch. Herodotus claimed that Harmodius and Aristogeiton presumably were &quot;Gephyraeans&quot; (el) i.e. Boeotians of Syrian or Phoenician origin. Plutarch, in his book &quot;On the malice of Herodotus,&quot; criticized Herodotus for prejudice and misrepresentation and he argued that Harmodius and Aristogeiton were Euboeans or Eretrians.

Peisistratus had become tyrant of Athens after his third attempt in 546/7 BC. In Archaic Greece, the term tyrant did not connote malevolence. A tyrant was one who had seized power and ruled outside of a state&#x27;s constitutional law. When Peisistratus died in 528/7 BC, his son Hippias took the position of Archon and became the new tyrant of Athens, with the help of his brother, Hipparchus, who acted as the minister of culture. The two continued their father&#x27;s policies, but their popularity declined after Hipparchus began to abuse the power of his position.

Thucydides offers this explanation for Harmodios and Aristogeiton&#x27;s actions in Book VI: Hipparchus approached Harmodius with amorous intentions. Harmodius was the &quot;eromenos&quot; (younger lover) of Aristogeiton. Harmodius rejected Hipparchus and told Aristogeiton what had happened. Hipparchus, spurned, invited Harmodius&#x27; young sister to be the kanephoros (to carry the ceremonial offering basket) at the Panathenaea festival, then publicly chased her away on the pretext she was not a virgin, as required, causing shame on Harmodius&#x27; family. With his lover Aristogeiton, Harmodius resolved to assassinate both Hippias and Hipparchus and thus to overthrow the tyranny. Harmodios and Aristogeiton successfully killed Hipparchus during the 514 BC Panathenaia, but Hippias survived and remained in power. In the four years between Hipparchus&#x27; assassination and the deposition of the Peisistratids, Hippias became an increasingly oppressive tyrant.

According to Aristotle, it was Thessalos, the hot-headed son of Peisistratus&#x27; Argive concubine, and thus half-brother to Hipparchus, who was the one to court Harmodius and drive off his sister.

==The assassination==
The plot – to be carried out by means of daggers hidden in the ceremonial myrtle wreaths on the occasion of the Panathenaic Games – involved a number of other co-conspirators. Thucydides claims that this day was chosen because during the Panathenaic festival, it was customary for the citizens taking part in the procession to go armed, while carrying weapons on any other day would have been suspicious. Aristotle disagrees, asserting that the custom of bearing weapons was introduced later, by the democracy.

Seeing one of the co-conspirators greet Hippias in a friendly manner on the assigned day, the two thought themselves betrayed and rushed into action, ruining the carefully laid plans. They managed to kill Hipparchus, stabbing him to death as he was organizing the Panathenaean processions at the foot of the Acropolis. Herodotus expresses surprise at this event, asserting that Hipparchus had received a clear warning concerning his fate in a dream. Harmodius was killed on the spot by spearmen of Hipparchus&#x27; guards, while Aristogeiton was arrested shortly thereafter. Upon being told of the event, Hippias, feigning calm, ordered the marching Greeks to lay down their ceremonial weapons and to gather at an indicated spot. All those with concealed weapons or under suspicion were arrested, gaining Hippias a respite from the uprising.

Thucydides&#x27; identification of Hippias as the two&#x27;s purported main target, rather than Hipparchus who was Aristogeiton&#x27;s rival erastes, has been suggested as a possible indication of bias on his part.

===Aristogeiton&#x27;s torture===
Aristotle in the &quot;Constitution of Athens&quot; preserves a tradition that Aristogeiton died only after being tortured in the hope that he would reveal the names of the other conspirators. During his ordeal, personally overseen by Hippias, he feigned willingness to betray his co-conspirators, claiming only Hippias&#x27; handshake as guarantee of safety. Upon receiving the tyrant&#x27;s hand he is reputed to have berated him for shaking the hand of his own brother&#x27;s murderer, upon which the tyrant wheeled and struck him down on the spot.

===Leæna===
Likewise, there is a later tradition that Aristogeiton (or Harmodius) was in love with a courtesan (see hetaera) by the name of Leæna (Λέαινα – meaning lioness) who also was kept by Hippias under torture – in a vain attempt to force her to divulge the names of the other conspirators – until she died. One version of her story holds that previous to being tortured she had bitten off her tongue, afraid that her resolve would break from the pain of the torture. Another is that the Athenians, unwilling to honour a courtesan, placed a statue of a lioness without a tongue in the vestibule of the Acropolis simply to honor her fortitude in maintaining silence. The statue was made by the sculptor Amphicrates. Pausanias alleges that it was in her honor that Athenian statues of Aphrodite began from then on to be accompanied by stone lionesses. Leæna&#x27;s story, however, is only told in later antiquity sources and is likely spurious.

===Aftermath===
His brother&#x27;s murder led Hippias to establish an even stricter tyranny, which proved very unpopular and was overthrown, after an intervention of an army from Sparta led by the king Cleomenes I, in 510. This was followed by the reforms of Cleisthenes, who established a democracy in Athens.

==Apotheosis==
Subsequent history came to identify the figures of Harmodius and Aristogeiton as martyrs to the cause of Athenian freedom, possibly for political and class reasons, and they became known as &quot;the Liberators&quot; (&quot;eleutherioi&quot;) and &quot;the Tyrannicides&quot; (&quot;tyrannophonoi&quot;). According to later writers, descendants of Harmodius and Aristogeiton&#x27;s families were given hereditary privileges, such as &quot;sitesis&quot; (the right to take meals at public expense in the town hall), &quot;ateleia&quot; (exemption from certain religious duties), and &quot;proedria&quot; (front-row seats in the theater). A number of years after the event, it had become a received tradition among the Athenians to believe that Hipparchus was the elder of the brothers, and to fashion him as the tyrant. The story of the tyrannicides was heavily promoted by the Athenians in order to erase the embarrassment of owing the removal of their tyranny to Sparta.

===Statues and artistic depictions===
After the establishment of democracy, Cleisthenes commissioned the sculptor Antenor to produce a bronze statue group of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. It was the first commission of its kind, and the very first statue to be paid for out of public funds, as the two were the first Greeks considered by their countrymen worthy of having statues raised to them. According to Pliny the Elder, it was erected in the Kerameikos in 509, as part of a cenotaph of the heroes. However, a far more probable location is in the Agora at Athens, and many later authors such as Pausanius and Timaeus attest to this. Annual offerings &quot;(enagismata)&quot; were presented there by the polemarch, the Athenian minister of war. There it stood alone as special laws prohibited the erection of any other statues in their vicinity. Upon its base was inscribed a verse by the poet Simonides:
The statue was taken as war booty in 480 BC by Xerxes I during the early Greco-Persian Wars and installed by him at Susa. As soon as the Greeks vanquished the Persians at Salamis, a new statue was commissioned. It was sculpted this time by Kritios and Nesiotes, and set up in 477/476 BC. It is the one which served as template for the group we possess today, which was found in the ruins of Hadrian&#x27;s villa and is now in Naples. According to Arrian, when Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, in 330, he discovered the statue at Susa and had it shipped back to Athens. When the statue, on its journey back, arrived at Rhodes it was given divine honors.

Several comments of the ancients regarding the statue have come down to us. When asked, in the presence of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, which type of bronze was the best, Antiphon the Sophist replied, Lycurgus, in his oration against Leocrates, asserts that
Other sculptors made statues of the heroes, such as Praxiteles, who made two, also of bronze.

The statue group has been seen, in modern times, as an invitation to identify erotically and politically with the figures, and to become oneself a tyrannicide. According to Andrew Stewart, the statue

The configuration of the group is duplicated on a painted vase, a Panathenaic amphora from 400, and on a bas-relief on the Elgin throne, dated to ca. 300.

===Skolia===
Another tribute to the two heroes was a hymn (skolion) praising them for restoring isonomia (equal distribution of justice) to the Athenians. The skolion may be referred to 500 BC or thereabouts, and is ascribed to Callistratus, an Athenian poet known only for this work. It is preserved by Athenaeus. Its popularity was such that 
When sung, the singer would hold a branch of myrtle in his hand. This ode has been translated by many modern poets such as Edgar Allan Poe, who composed his &quot;Hymn to Aristogeiton and Harmodius&quot; in 1827. The following translation was judged to be the best and most faithful of a number of versions attempted in Victorian England.

&lt;poem&gt;
In myrtles veil&#x27;d will I the falchion wear,
For thus the patriot sword
Harmodius and Aristogiton bare,
When they the tyrant&#x27;s bosom gored, 
And bade the men of Athens be 
Regenerate in equality.

Oh! beloved Harmodius! never 
Shall death be thine, who liv&#x27;st for ever. 
Thy shade, as men have told, inherits 
The islands of the blessed spirits,
Where deathless live the glorious dead,
Achilles fleet of foot, and Diomed.

In myrtles veil&#x27;d will I the falchion wear, 
For thus the patriot sword
Harmodius and Aristogiton bare,
When they the tyrant&#x27;s bosom gored; 
When in Minerva&#x27;s festal rite 
They closed Hipparchus&#x27; eyes in night.

Harmodius&#x27; praise, Aristogiton&#x27;s name, 
Shall bloom on earth with undecaying fame; 
Who with the myrtle-wreathed sword 
The tyrant&#x27;s bosom gored, 
And bade the men of Athens be 
Regenerate in equality.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Importance to the erastes-eromenos tradition==
The story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, and its treatment by later Greek writers, is illustrative of attitudes to pederasty in ancient Greece. Both Thucydides and Herodotus describe the two as lovers, their love affair was styled as moderate &quot;(sophron)&quot; and legitimate &quot;(dikaios)&quot;. Further confirming the status of the two as paragons of pederastic ethics, a domain forbidden to slaves, a law was passed prohibiting slaves from being named after the two heroes.

The story continued to be cited as an admirable example of heroism and devotion for many years. In 346 BC, for example, the politician Timarchus was prosecuted (for political reasons) on the grounds that he had prostituted himself as a youth. The orator who defended him, Demosthenes, cited Harmodius and Aristogeiton, as examples of the beneficial effects of same-sex relationships. Aeschines offers them as an example of &quot;dikaios erōs,&quot; &quot;just love&quot;, and as proof of the boons such love brings to lovers – who were both improved by love beyond all praise – as well as to the city.

<doc id="455909" wikidata="Q1967405" url="?curid=455909" title="National Institute of Mental Health">
<text>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH, in turn, is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research.

NIMH is the largest research organization in the world specializing in mental illness. Shelli Avenevoli is the current acting director of NIMH. The institute was first authorized by the U.S. government in 1946, when then President Harry Truman signed into law the National Mental Health Act, although the institute was not formally established until 1949.

NIMH is a $1.5 billion enterprise, supporting research on mental health through grants to investigators at institutions and organizations throughout the United States and through its own internal (intramural) research effort. The mission of NIMH is &quot;to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.&quot;

In order to fulfill this mission, NIMH &quot;must foster innovative thinking and ensure that a full array of novel scientific perspectives are used to further discovery in the evolving science of brain, behavior, and experience. In this way, breakthroughs in science can become breakthroughs for all people with mental illnesses.&quot;

== Research priorities ==
NIMH has identified four overarching strategic objectives for itself:

*Promote discovery in the brain and behavioral sciences to fuel research on the causes of mental disorders
*Chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where and how to intervene
*Develop new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses
*Strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research

== History ==

=== Organizational history ===
NIMH had passed through a series of name changes and organizational arrangements with in the United States Public Health Service (PHS) throughout its history:

* PHS Narcotics Division (1929–30) (Not to be confused with the Bureau of Prohibition Narcotics Division)
* PHS Division of Mental Hygiene (1930–43)
* Mental Hygiene Division, within the PHS Bureau of Medical Services (1943–49)
* National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH, 1949–67)
* NIMH as an independent division of the PHS (1967–68)
* NIMH, within the Health Services and Mental Health Administration (1968–73)
* NIMH, within NIH (1973)
* NIMH, within the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (1973–1992)
* NIMH, within NIH (1992–present)

In 1992, when the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration was abolished, NIMH was transferred to NIH, retaining its research functions while its treatment services were transferred to the new Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

=== Prohibition era ===
During the Prohibition era, the Narcotics Division of the Bureau of Public Health was responsible for the patients confined to the &quot;narcotic farms&quot; that had been a result of the Narcotic Farms Act of 1929. Confusingly, the Bureau of Prohibition which was also in the Treasury had in its organizational structure a Narcotics Division whose Deputy Commissioner was Levi G. Nutt, an advocate of forced confinement of addicts to the narcotic farms.

=== Functions ===
Mental health has traditionally been a state responsibility, but after World War II there was increased lobbying for a federal (national) initiative. Attempts to create a National Neuropsychiatric Institute failed. Robert H. Felix, then head of the Division of Mental Hygiene, orchestrated a movement to include mental health policy as an integral part of federal biomedical policy. Congressional subcommittees hearings were held and the National Mental Health Act was signed into law in 1946. This aimed to support the research, prevention and treatment of psychiatric illness, and called for the establishment of a National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) and a National Institute of Mental Health. On April 15, 1949, the NIMH was formally established, with Felix as director. Funding for the NIMH grew slowly and then, from the mid-1950s, dramatically. The institute took on a highly influential role in shaping policy, research and communicating with the public, legitimizing the importance of new advances in biomedical science, psychiatric and psychological services, and community-based mental health policies.
In 1955, the Mental Health Study Act called for &quot;an objective, thorough, nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental health.&quot; The resulting Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health prepared a report, &quot;Action for Mental Health&quot;, resulting in the establishment of a cabinet-level interagency committee to examine the recommendations and determine an appropriate federal response.

In 1963, Congress passed the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, beginning a new era in Federal support for mental health services. NIMH assumed responsibility for monitoring the Nation&#x27;s community mental health centers (CMHC) programs.

During the mid-1960s, NIMH launched a campaign on special mental health problems. Part of this was a response to President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s pledge to apply scientific research to social problems. The institute established centers for research on schizophrenia, child and family mental health, suicide, as well as crime and delinquency, minority group mental health problems, urban problems, and later, rape, aging, and technical assistance to victims of natural disasters.

Alcohol abuse and alcoholism did not receive full recognition as a major public health problem until the mid-1960s, when the National Center for Prevention and Control of Alcoholism was established as part of NIMH; a research program on drug abuse was inaugurated within NIMH with the establishment of the Center for Studies of Narcotic and Drug Abuse.

In 1967, NIMH separated from NIH and was given bureau status within PHS. However, NIMH&#x27;s intramural research program, which conducted studies in the NIH Clinical Center and other NIH facilities, remained at NIH under an agreement for joint administration between NIH and NIMH. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John W. Gardner transferred St. Elizabeths Hospital, the Federal Government&#x27;s only civilian psychiatric hospital, to NIMH.

In 1968, NIMH became a component of PHS&#x27;s Health Services and Mental Health Administration (HSMHA).

In 1970, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act (P.L. 91-616) established the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within NIMH.

In 1972, the Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act established a National Institute on Drug Abuse within NIMH.

In 1973, NIMH went through a series of organizational moves. The institute temporarily rejoined NIH on July 1 with the abolishment of HSMHA. Then, the DHEW secretary administratively established the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA) – composed of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and NIMH – as the successor organization to HSMHA. ADAMHA was officially established in 1974.

The President&#x27;s Commission on Mental Health in 1977 reviewed the mental health needs of the nation and to make recommendations to the president as to how best meet these needs in 1978. In August 1977, The Washington Post reported that senior directors at the NIMH were likely aware of the institute&#x27;s covert participation in the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s MKUltra experiments, administering LSD to federal prisoners in Lexington, Kentucky.

In 1980, The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, an unprecedented research effort that entailed interviews with a nationally representative sample of 20,000 Americans was launched. The field interviews and first wave analyses were completed in 1985. Data from the ECA provided a picture of rates of mental and addictive disorders and services usage.

The Mental Health Systems Act of 1980 – based on recommendations of the President&#x27;s Commission on Mental Health and designed to provide improved services for persons with mental disorders – was passed. NIMH participated in development of the National Plan for the Chronically Mentally Ill, a sweeping effort to improve services and fine-tune various Federal entitlement programs for those with severe, persistent mental disorders.

In 1987, administrative control of St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital was transferred from the NIMH to the District of Columbia. NIMH retained research facilities on the grounds of the hospital. The NIMH Neuroscience Center and the NIMH Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital, located on the grounds of St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, were dedicated in 1989.

In 1992, Congress passed the ADAMHA Reorganization Act, abolishing ADAMHA. The research components of NIAAA, NIDA and NIMH rejoined NIH, while the services components of each institute became part of a new PHS agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The return to NIH and the loss of services functions to SAMHSA necessitated a realignment of the NIMH extramural program administrative organization. New offices were created for research on Prevention, Special Populations, Rural Mental Health and AIDS.

In 1994, The House Appropriations Committee mandated that the director of NIH conduct a review of the role, size, and cost of all NIH intramural research programs (IRP). NIMH and the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) initiated a major study of the NIMH Intramural Research Program. The planning committee recommended continued investment in the IRP and recommended specific administrative changes; many of these were implemented upon release of the committee&#x27;s final report; other changes — for example, the establishment of a major new program on Mood and Anxiety Disorders — have been introduced in the years since.

In 1996, NIMH, with the NAMHC, initiated systematic reviews of a number of areas of its research portfolio, including the genetics of mental disorders; epidemiology and services for child and adolescent populations; prevention research; clinical treatment and services research. At the request of the National Institute for Mental Health director, the NAMH Council established programmatic groups in each of these areas. NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) continued to implement recommendations issued by these Workgroups.

In 1997, NIMH realigned its extramural organizational structure to capitalize on new technologies and approaches to both basic and clinical science, as well as changes that had occurred in health care delivery systems, while retaining the institute&#x27;s focus on mental illness. The new extramural organization resulted in three research divisions: Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Research; Services and Intervention Research; and Mental Disorders, Behavioral Research and AIDS.

Between 1997 and 1999, NIMH refocused career development resources on early careers and added new mechanisms for clinical research. It also launched mentorship initiatives and expanded funding for early-career researchers, fostering a diverse pipeline of mental health professionals.

In 1999, The NIMH Neuroscience Center/Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital was relocated from St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital in Washington, D.C., to the NIH Campus in Bethesda, Maryland, in response to the recommendations of the 1996 review of the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) Intramural Research Program by the IRP Planning Committee.

The first White House Conference on Mental Health, held June 7, in Washington, D.C., brought together national leaders, mental health scientific and clinical personnel, patients, and consumers to discuss needs and opportunities. The National Institute on Mental Health developed materials and helped organize the conference.

U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher released The Surgeon General&#x27;s Call To Action To Prevent Suicide, in July, and the first Surgeon General&#x27;s Report on Mental Health, in December. NIMH, along with other federal agencies, collaborated in the preparation of both of these landmark reports.

Since the appointment of Thomas R. Insel as Director of NIMH in 2002, the institute has undergone organizational changes to better target mental health research needs (the expansion from three extramural divisions to five divisions, with the two new divisions focusing on adult and child translational research). NIMH also weathered several years of controversy due to conflict of interest and ethics violations by some of its intramural investigators. This situation cast light on an area that affected all of NIH and resulted in more stringent rules about conflict of interest for all of NIH. Recently, Congressional interest turned to ethics and conflict of interest concerns with external investigators who receive NIMH or other NIH support. Current federal law has responsibility for managing and monitoring conflict of interests for external investigators with their home institutions/organizations. NIH responded to these new concerns by initiating a formal process for seeking public input and advice that will likely result in a change to the rules for monitoring and managing conflict of interest concerns for externally supported investigators. Finally, the past decade has also been marked by exciting scientific breakthroughs and efforts in mental illness research, as new genetic advances and bioimaging methodologies have increased understanding of mental illnesses. Two notable consequences of these advances are the institute&#x27;s collaboration with the Department of Army to launch the Study To Assess Risk and Resilience in Service Members (STARRS), a Framingham-like effort scheduled to last until 2014 and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) effort, which seeks to define basic dimensions of functioning (such as fear circuitry or working memory) to be studied across multiple levels of analysis, from genes to neural circuits to behaviors, cutting across disorders as traditionally defined.

A collection of interviews with directors and individuals significant in the foundation and early history of the institute conducted by Dr. Eli A. Rubenstein between 1975 and 1978 is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.

== Noted researchers==
In 1970, Julius Axelrod, a NIMH researcher, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research into the chemistry of nerve transmission for &quot;discoveries concerning the humoral transmitters in the nerve terminals and the mechanisms for their storage, release and inactivation.&quot; He found an enzyme that terminated the action of the nerve transmitter, noradrenaline in the synapse and which also served as a critical target of many antidepressant drugs.

In the 1960s and 1970s, John B. Calhoun, ethologist and behavioral researcher studied the population density and its effects on behavior in the NIMH facility in Maryland. Later his work become renowned after several publications, including articles in Scientific American and a widely known &quot;Universe 25&quot; story predicting a dystopian future based on rodent experiments in an overpopulated environment.

In 1984, Norman E. Rosenthal, a psychiatrist and NIMH researcher, pioneered seasonal affective disorder, coined the term SAD, and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. He received the Anna Monika Foundation Award for his research on seasonal depression.

Louis Sokoloff, a NIMH researcher, received the Albert Łasker award in Clinical Medical Research for developing a new method of measuring brain function that contributed to basic understanding and diagnosis of brain diseases. Roger Sperry, a NIMH research grantee, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for discoveries regarding the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres, or the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; brain.

Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard, each of whom have received NIMH support for more than three decades, shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sweden&#x27;s Arvid Carlsson. Kandel received the prize for his elucidating research on the functional modification of synapses in the brain. Initially using the sea slug as an experimental model but later working with mice, he established that the formation of memories is a consequence of short and long-term changes in the biochemistry of nerve cells Greengard was recognized for his discovery that dopamine and a number of other transmitters can alter the functional state of neuronal proteins, and also that such changes could be reversed by subsequent environmental signals.

Nancy Andreasen, a psychiatrist and long-time NIMH grantee, won the National Medal of Science for her groundbreaking work in schizophrenia and for joining behavioral science with neuroscience and neuroimaging. The Presidential Award is one of the nation&#x27;s highest awards in science.

Aaron Beck, a psychiatrist, received the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. Often called &quot;America&#x27;s Nobels&quot;, the Laskers are the nation&#x27;s most distinguished honor for outstanding contributions to basic and clinical medical research. Beck developed cognitive therapy—a form of psychotherapy—which transformed the understanding and treatment of many psychiatric conditions, including depression, suicidal behavior, generalized anxiety, panic attacks and eating disorders.

In 2010, Mortimer Mishkin was awarded the National Medal of Science. Mishkin is chief of the NIMH&#x27;s Section on Cognitive Neuroscience, and acting chief of its Laboratory of Neuropsychology. He is the first NIMH intramural scientist to receive the medal. Due in part to work spearheaded by Mishkin, science now understands much about the pathways for vision, hearing and touch, and about how those processing streams connect with brain structures important for memory.

Calhoun&#x27;s experiments on mouse and rat population dynamics inspired novelist Robert C. O&#x27;Brien to write &quot;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&quot;, a 1971 children&#x27;s book about laboratory rats who escape from the institute and develop a literate and technological society. The book was adapted for film in 1982 as &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;.

<text>Mini-ITX is a motherboard form factor developed by VIA Technologies in 2001. Mini-ITX motherboards have been traditionally used in small-configured computer systems. Originally, Mini-ITX was a niche standard designed for fanless cooling with a low power consumption architecture, which made them useful for home theater PC systems, where fan noise can detract from the cinema experience.

The four mounting holes in a Mini-ITX board line up with four of the holes in ATX-specification motherboards, and the locations of the backplate and expansion slot are the same (though one of the holes used was optional in earlier versions of the ATX spec). Mini-ITX boards can therefore often be used in cases designed for ATX, micro-ATX and other ATX variants if desired.

Mini-ITX motherboards have only one expansion slot. Earlier Mini-ITX motherboards had a standard 33 MHz 5V 32-bit PCI slot, whereas newer motherboards use a PCI Express slot. Many older case designs use riser cards and some even have two-slot riser cards, although the two-slot riser cards are not compatible with all boards. Some boards based around non-x86 processors have a 3.3V PCI slot, and the Mini-ITX 2.0 (2008) boards have a PCI-Express ×16 slot; these boards are not compatible with the standard PCI riser cards supplied with older ITX (Information Technology eXtended) cases.

==History==

In March 2001, the chipset manufacturer VIA Technologies released a reference design for an ITX motherboard, to promote the low power C3 processor they had bought from Centaur Technology, in combination with their chipsets. Designed by Robert Kuo, VIA&#x27;s chief R&amp;D expert, the 215×191 mm VT6009 ITX Reference Board was demonstrated in &quot;Information PC&quot; and set-top box configurations. At that point, few manufacturers took up the ITX design, but Shuttle, Jetway, etc. produced many ITX based cube computers. Other manufactures instead produced smaller boards based on the very similar 229×191 mm FlexATX configuration.

In October 2001, VIA announced their decision to create a new motherboard division, to provide standardized infrastructure for lower-cost PC iterations, and focus on embedded devices. The result was the November 2001 release of the VT6010 Mini-ITX reference design (again by Robert Kuo), once again touted as an &quot;Information PC&quot;, or low cost entry level x86 computing platform. Manufacturers were still reluctant, but customer response was much more receptive, so VIA decided to manufacture and sell the boards themselves. In April 2002 the first Mini-ITX motherboards—VIA&#x27;s EPIA 5000 (fanless 533 MHz Eden processor) and EPIA 800 (800 MHz C3)—were sold to industrial customers.

Enthusiasts soon noticed the advantages of small size, low noise and power consumption, and started to push the boundaries of case modding into something else—building computers into nearly every object imaginable, and sometimes even creating new cases altogether. Hollowed out vintage computers, humidors, toys, electronics, musical instruments, and even a 1960s-era toaster have become homes to relatively quiet, or even silent Mini-ITX systems, capable of many of the tasks of a modern desktop PC.

Mini-ITX boards primarily appeal to the industrial and embedded PC markets, with the majority sold as bulk components or integrated into a finished system for single-purpose computing applications. They are produced with a much longer sales life-cycle than consumer boards (some of the original EPIAs are still available), a quality that industrial users typically require. Manufacturers can prototype using standard cases and power supplies, then build their own enclosures if volumes get high enough. Typical applications include playing music in supermarkets, powering self-service kiosks, and driving content on digital displays.

VIA continues to expand its Mini-ITX motherboard line. Some earlier generations included the original PL133 chipset boards (dubbed the &quot;Classic&quot; boards), CLE266 chipset boards (adding MPEG-2 acceleration), and CN400 boards (which added MPEG-4 acceleration). Second generation boards featured the EPIA M, MII, CL, PD, TC and MS — all tailored to slightly different markets. Legacy VIA boards use their x86-compatible CPUs — the C3, C7 or low-power Eden variants, with newer boards featuring the VIA Nano CPU, launched in May 2008. Other manufacturers have also produced boards designed around the same layout, using VIA, but also Intel, AMD, Transmeta and PowerPC technology.

Intel introduced a line of Mini-ITX boards for the Atom CPU, which demonstrates a significant increase in processing performance (but without added power consumption) over older VIA C3 and C7 offerings and helps make the design viable for personal computers. Other manufacturers saw the potential of the design, and followed suit, some even not limiting themselves to the Atom, as evidenced by Zotac GeForce 9300-ITX board that supports Core 2 Duo CPUs with FSB frequencies up to 1333 MHz, two separate-channeled 800 MHz memory slots and fully functional PCI Express 2.0 x16 slot that could connect through SLI to the onboard video. This new wave of offerings made Mini-ITX much more popular among home users, hobbyists, and even overclockers.

==Intel-based products==
===Onboard CPU===

A number of manufacturers have released Mini-ITX motherboards that feature embedded CPUs, often mobile or low-TDP versions. These processors are designed to draw minimal power resulting in lower TDP ideal for fanless (passively cooled) configurations and embedded applications.

===Socketed CPU===
Starting from LGA 775, socketed Intel Mini-ITX motherboards have been released by Intel and Zotac. This was followed by LGA 1156 motherboards Starting from LGA 1155, Mini-ITX motherboards have started to become mainstream, with many different manufacturers releasing products. This is partly because almost all Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge Intel Celeron, Pentium and Core series CPUs have integrated processor graphics, eliminating the need for motherboard graphics or discrete graphics cards. This trend continues with LGA 1150, LGA 1151, and LGA 1200 CPUs.

Due to the limitations of the Mini-ITX design, and the physical size of the LGA 2011 socket, Mini-ITX motherboards with the socket only support a single PCI Express expansion slot, and they require using the narrow-ILM version of the LGA 2011 socket. Despite this, manufacturers have released LGA 2011 based Mini-ITX motherboards.

Also, Mini-ITX motherboards with the LGA 2066 socket have been released, with four SODIMM slots.

==AMD-based products==
A number of manufacturers have released several socketed AMD Mini-ITX motherboards, supporting Socket AM2, Socket AM2+, Socket AM3, Socket FM1, Socket FM2, Socket FM2+, Socket AM1 and Socket AM4 CPUs. Socket AM2+ and AM3 ITX motherboards have integrated motherboard graphics, while discrete graphics or processor integrated graphics are required for other platforms.

Mini-ITX motherboards with integrated AMD CPUs are also released. These motherboards often use mobile CPUs and passive cooling, and feature more powerful integrated graphics compared to their Intel counterparts, which makes them suitable for HTPC.

==Transmeta-based products==
IBASE made the first Transmeta-based Mini-ITX motherboard, the MB860. The board uses Transmeta Efficeon processors that run at up to 1.2 GHz. It supports SODIMM DDR modules with capacities up to 1 GB. An onboard 16 MB ATI M7 graphics controller supports 3D games and graphical intensive programs. It provides four USB 2.0 ports, a Realtek 8100C 10/100 Mbit/s BaseT Ethernet and an optional 8110S Gigabit Ethernet controller.

==PowerPC-based products==
The first PowerPC motherboards were produced by Eyetech in 2005 but they stopped any activity in 2005. In 2007 ACube Systems produced a new board, the Sam440ep, primarily for the AmigaOS market.

==ARM-based products==

Cadia Networks developed a Mini ITX ARM board, which comes with an ARM Cortex-A8 Freescale i.MX53 series CPU. According to the official website, the board &quot;offers an ultra-low power SoC with a variety of I/O and OS support for Android / Linux2.6 / Windows Embedded Compact 7&quot;.

Kontron also developed a mini ITX ARM board. According to the website, it features an &quot;ARM Cortex-A9 Quad Core 900MHz Processor with NEON Technology&quot;, an Nvidia graphics processor, 2 GB of RAM, and a targeted power consumption of &lt; 7W for the entire board.

AppliedMicro offers the XC-1 Server Development Platform motherboard, which uses the X-Gene ARMv8 system on a chip with 8 2.4 GHz CPU cores, supports 128 GB DDR3 DRAM using 16 GB DIMMs, and has a baseboard management controller.

==Power==

The Mini-ITX standard does not define a standard for the computer power supply, though it suggests possible options. Conventionally Mini-ITX boards use a 20- or 24-pin &quot;original ATX&quot; power connector. This is usually connected to a DC-DC converter board, which connects to an external power adapter. Generally, vendors provide both power adapter and DC-DC board with the case.

Some boards have built in DC-DC converters and converters have also been made to plug directly into the ATX connector (e.g. the PicoPSU), either of these options avoids the need to mount a separate DC-DC converter into the case, saving space and design effort. Boards using full-power Intel or AMD CPUs typically use ATX12V 2.x connections and require a case with appropriate power supply and cooling for these more power-hungry chips. Defined by the ATX specification, power supplies with ATX12V connector on a separate 12 volts rail must not idle that 12 volts rail.

<doc id="455915" wikidata="Q209671" url="?curid=455915" title="Faience">
<text>Faience or faïence (; ) is the general English language term for fine tin-glazed pottery. The invention of a white pottery glaze suitable for painted decoration, by the addition of an oxide of tin to the slip of a lead glaze, was a major advance in the history of pottery. The invention seems to have been made in Iran or the Middle East before the ninth century. A kiln capable of producing temperatures exceeding was required to achieve this result, after millennia of refined pottery-making traditions. The term is now used for a wide variety of pottery from several parts of the world, including many types of European painted wares, often produced as cheaper versions of porcelain styles.

English generally uses various other terms for well-known sub-types of faience. Italian tin-glazed earthenware, at least the early forms, is called maiolica in English, Dutch wares are called Delftware, and their English equivalents English delftware, leaving &quot;faience&quot; as the normal term in English for French, German, Spanish, Portuguese wares and those of other countries not mentioned (it is also the usual French term, and &quot;fayence&quot; in German). The name &quot;faience&quot; is simply the French name for Faenza, in the Romagna near Ravenna, Italy, where a painted majolica ware on a clean, opaque pure-white ground, was produced for export as early as the fifteenth century.
Technically, lead-glazed earthenware, such as the French sixteenth-century Saint-Porchaire ware, does not qualify as faience, but the distinction is not usually maintained. Semi-vitreous stoneware may be glazed like faience. Egyptian faience is not really faience, or pottery, at all, but made of a vitreous frit, and so closer to glass.

In English 19th-century usage &quot;faience&quot; was often used to describe &quot;any earthenware with relief modelling decorated with coloured glazes&quot;, including much glazed architectural terracotta and Victorian majolica, adding a further complexity to the list of meanings of the word.

== History ==
===Western Mediterranean===

The Moors brought the technique of tin-glazed earthenware to Al-Andalus, where the art of lustreware with metallic glazes was perfected. From at least the 14th century, Málaga in Andalusia and later Valencia exported these &quot;Hispano-Moresque wares&quot;, either directly or via the Balearic Islands to Italy and the rest of Europe. Later these industries continued under Christian lords.

&quot;Majolica&quot; and &quot;maiolica&quot; are garbled versions of &quot;Maiorica&quot;, the island of Majorca, which was a transshipping point for refined tin-glazed earthenwares shipped to Italy from the kingdom of Aragon at the close of the Middle Ages. This type of pottery owed much to its Moorish inheritance.

In Italy, locally produced tin-glazed earthenwares, now called &quot;maiolica&quot;, initiated in the fourteenth century, reached a peak in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. After about 1600, these lost their appeal to elite customers, and the quality of painting declined, with geometric designs and simple shapes replacing the complicated and sophisticated scenes of the best period. Production continues to the present day in many centres, and the wares are again called &quot;faience&quot; in English (though usually still &quot;maiolica&quot; in Italian). At some point &quot;faience&quot; as a term for pottery from Faenza in northern Italy was a general term used in French, and then reached English.

===French and northern European faïence===

The first northerners to imitate the tin-glazed earthenwares being imported from Italy were the Dutch. Delftware is a kind of faience, made at potteries round Delft in the Netherlands, characteristically decorated in blue on white. It began in the early sixteenth century on a relatively small scale, imitating Italian maiolica, but from around 1580 it began to imitate the highly sought-after blue and white Chinese export porcelain that was beginning to reach Europe, soon followed by Japanese export porcelain. From the later half of the century the Dutch were manufacturing and exporting very large quantities, some in its own recognisably Dutch style, as well as copying East Asian porcelain.

In France, the first well-known painter of faïence was Masseot Abaquesne, established in Rouen in the 1530s. Nevers faience and Rouen faience were the leading French centres of faience manufacturing in the 17th century, both able to supply wares to the standards required by the court and nobility. Nevers continued the Italian &quot;istoriato&quot; maiolica style, painted with figurative subjects, until around 1650. Many others centres developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by Quimper in Brittany , followed by Moustiers, Marseille, Strasbourg and Lunéville and many smaller centres. The cluster of factories in the south were generally the most innovative, while Strasbourg and other centres near the Rhine were much influenced by German porcelain.

The products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, &quot;faïence blanche&quot; being left in its undecorated fired white slip. &quot;Faïence parlante&quot; (especially from Nevers) bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including &quot;albarelli&quot;, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the &quot;faïence patriotique&quot; that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.

&quot;English delftware&quot; produced in Lambeth, London, and at other centres, from the late sixteenth century, provided apothecaries with jars for wet and dry drugs, among a wide range of wares. Large painted dishes were produced for weddings and other special occasions, with crude decoration that later appealed to collectors of English folk art. Many of the early potters in London were Flemish. By about 1600, blue-and-white wares were being produced, labelling the contents within decorative borders. The production was slowly superseded in the first half of the eighteenth century with the introduction of cheap creamware.
Dutch potters in northern (and Protestant) Germany established German centres of faience: the first manufactories in Germany were opened at Hanau (1661) and Heusenstamm (1662), soon moved to nearby Frankfurt. In Switzerland, Zunfthaus zur Meisen near Fraumünster church houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum in Zürich.

By the mid-18th centuries many French factories produced (as well as simpler wares) pieces that followed the Rococo styles of the French porcelain factories and often hired and trained painters with the skill to produce work of a quality that sometimes approached them.

The products of French faience manufactories, rarely marked, are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, faïence blanche being left in its undecorated fired white slip. Faïence parlante bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Wares for apothecaries, including albarello, can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the Faïence patriotique that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.
In the course of the later 18th century, cheaper porcelain, and the refined earthenwares first developed in Staffordshire pottery such as creamware took over the market for refined faience. The French industry was given a nearly fatal blow by a commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1786, much lobbied for by Josiah Wedgwood, which set the import duty on English earthenware at a nominal level. In the early 19th century, fine stoneware—fired so hot that the unglazed body vitrifies—closed the last of the traditional makers&#x27; &quot;ateliers&quot; even for beer steins. At the low end of the market, local manufactories continued to supply regional markets with coarse and simple wares, and many local varieties have continued to be made in versions of the old styles as a form of folk art, and today for tourists.

===Revival===
In the 19th century two glazing techniques revived by Minton were: 1. Tin-glazed pottery in the style of Renaissance Italian maiolica and, 2. The pottery of coloured glazes decoration over unglazed earthenware molded in low relief. At the Great Exhibition of 1851 and at the International Exhibition of 1862 both were exhibited. Both are known today as Victorian majolica. The coloured glazes majolica wares were later also made by Wedgwood and numerous smaller Staffordshire potteries round Burslem and Stoke-on-Trent. At the end of the nineteenth century, William de Morgan re-discovered the technique of lustered faience &quot;to an extraordinarily high standard&quot;.

===Ancient frit wares called &quot;faience&quot; ===

The term &quot;faience&quot; broadly encompassed finely glazed ceramic beads, figures and other small objects found in Egypt as early as 4000 BC, as well as in the Ancient Near East, the Indus Valley civilisation and Europe. However, this material is not pottery at all, containing no clay, but a vitreous frit, either self-glazing or glazed. The Metropolitan Museum of Art displays a piece known as &quot;William the Faience Hippopotamus&quot; from Meir, Egypt, dated to the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt, –1885 BC. Different to those of ancient Egypt in theme and composition, artefacts of the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma are characterized by extensive amounts of blue faience, which was developed by the natives of Kerma independently of Egyptian techniques. Examples of ancient faience are also found in Minoan Crete, which was likely influenced by Egyptian culture. Faience material, for instance, has been recovered from the Knossos archaeological site.

===England===
English delftware is a term for English faience, mostly of the 17th and early 18th centuries. Not all of it imitated Dutch delftware, though much did. It was replaced by the much better creamware and other types of refined earthenware Staffordshire pottery developed in the 18th century, many of which did not need tin-glazes to achieve a white colour. These were hugely successful and exported to Europe and the Americas. They are not called &quot;faience&quot; in English, but may be in other languages, e.g. creamware was known as &quot;faience fine&quot; in France.

<text>British poetry is the field of British literature encompassing poetry from anywhere in the British world (whether of the British Isles, the British Empire, or the United Kingdom).

Types of poetry which might be considered British poetry include:

*English poetry
*Irish poetry from Northern Ireland
*Scottish poetry (see &quot;Scottish literature&quot;)
*Welsh poetry
*Jèrriais poetry
*Guernésiais poetry
*Manx poetry
*Cornish poetry

The critic Lyn Pykett has written that &quot;A trawl through anthologies of British or English verse quickly discovers the exclusion of women from the traditions of British poetry&quot;.

<text>Michiel Smit (born 21 August 1976) is a former Dutch politician who was leader of Nieuw Rechts, a far-right political party.

==Political office==
Michiel Smit was elected to the Rotterdam city council in 2002 as a member of Leefbaar Rotterdam. In February 2003, he came into conflict with Leefbaar-Rotterdam leader Ronald Sørensen and decided to leave the party. After leaving, he founded a new party: Nieuw Rechts.

==Views==

He released his first book &quot;Nederland op z&#x27;n kop&quot; in June 2004, just before the European elections. In the book he outlines his views on Dutch society and describes what he sees as the threat of Muslim extremists in the Netherlands.

In his latest book, &quot;Veiligheid, doe het ZELF&quot;, Smit says that handguns should be legalised in the Netherlands and that doing so will lead to less violent crime.

Smit has made statements against immigration and Islam. In 2003 Smit started to cooperate with the Jewish Defense League, citing the danger to both from the Arab European League. In the same year he demonstrated in Amsterdam against the pedophile association Vereniging MARTIJN as a leader of the Actiecomité Stop MARTIJN.

In 2004, photos of Smit hanging out with white power skinhead friends started circulating on the internet. The following year, he lost a libel case that he started against a talk show guest who had called him a neo-Nazi in 2002. The judge ruled that Smit had given ample reason for the qualification.

<text>ratpoison is a tiling window manager for the X Window System primarily developed by Shawn Betts. The user interface and much of their functionality are inspired by the GNU Screen terminal multiplexer. While ratpoison is written in C, Betts&#x27; StumpWM re-implements a similar window manager in Common Lisp.

==Overview==

The name &quot;ratpoison&quot; reflects its major design goal: to let the user manage application windows without using a mouse. Unlike other tiling window managers like Ion, ratpoison completely ignores the mouse (or &quot;rat&quot;), and avoids window decorations as much as possible. The default keybindings are specifically designed to not conflict with Emacs.

== Usage ==
ratpoison relies on key chords similar to Emacs to control window management, with all window interactions being done through shortcuts. Each window occupies an entire frame and cannot overlap. Windows can be split either horizontally or vertically. Multiple workspaces and session management are supported. An application menu can be used for navigation to programs. Configuration is controlled via a config file. 

==Reception==

Mark Pilgrim praised it for being &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;configurable.&quot; Jeff Covey, in 2002, found it was &quot;lightning fast and perfectly stable.&quot; Peter Seebach remarked that &quot;the convenience and performance are impressive; the learning curve, however, daunts many users.&quot; Similarly, Brian Proffitt observes that &quot;the key commands are well explained in this window manager&#x27;s man pages, and whatever you do, read these first. The keyboard commands do make sense after some use but initially the learning curve is pretty steep.&quot; In the same vein, Bruce Byfield found it (and stumpwm) &quot;virtually unusable until you read the documentation.&quot; MakeTechEasier gave a positive review of ratpoison in 2013, although noting its steep learning curve. Bryan Lunduke of NetworkWorld gave a negative review, criticizing the key bindings and the difficulty of working with multi-window programs such as GIMP.

<text>Gayatri (Sanskrit: गायत्री, IAST: Gāyatrī) is the personified form of the Gayatri Mantra, a popular hymn from Vedic texts. She is also known as Savitri, and holds the title of &quot;Vedamata&quot; (&#x27;mother of the Vedas&#x27;). Gayatri is the manifestation of Saraswati and is often associated with Savitṛ, a solar deity in the Vedas, and her consort in the Puranas is the creator god Brahma.
Gayatri is also an epithet for the various goddesses and she is also identified as &quot;Supreme pure consciousness&quot;.

== Origin ==
Gayatri was the name initially applied to a metre of the Rig Veda consisting of 24 syllables. In particular, it refers to the Gayatri Mantra and the Goddess Gāyatrī as that mantra personified. The Gayatri mantra composed in this triplet form is the most famous. Most of the scholars identify Gayatri as the feminine form of Gayatra, another name of the Vedic Solar god which is also one of the synonyms of Savitri and Savitṛ.
==Iconography==

Early bronze images of Gayatri appear in the Himachal Pradesh, where she was revered as the consort of Sadasiva. Some of these forms are terrific in nature. One of the bronze images of Gayatri dated back to 10th century CE was obtained from Champa region and now preserved in Delhi museum. It appears with five faces and ten hands holding, sword, lotus, trident, disc, skull, Varada in left and goad, noose, a manuscript, the jar of ambrosia and Abhaya in right. She resides in the mount Nandi. Modern depictions illustrates swan as her mount. Old iconography of Shaivite Manonmani Gayatri was misunderstood as the same of Brahmanic Gayatri later and paintings of Gayatri appears from 18th century CE in which she is often portrayed with third eye, crescent moon and five heads with five different colors same like Sadasiva.

The well known form of Gayatri with the Saivite influence appears having five heads (Mukta, Vidruma, Hema, Neela, Dhavala) with the ten eyes looking in eight directions plus the earth and sky, and ten arms holding various types of weapons attributed to Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Another recent depiction is accompanied by a white swan holding a book to portray knowledge in one hand and a cure in the other, as the goddess of learning. She is also depicted four-armed, seated on a swan, holding weapons symbolising the Trimurti: The Vedas of Brahma, the discus of Vishnu, the trident of Shiva, and Varada mudra.

She also has an fearsome three-faced depiction; two faces look like that of goddess Kali and one calm one and holding weapons like the deity Mahakali. She is shown mounted on a lotus holding lotus, noose, trident, Scimitar and vard mudra in right whereas conch, discus, bow-arrow, goad and abhaya mudra in left.

==Associations==

In Mahanarayana Upanishad of Krishna Yajurveda, Gayatri is described as white-colored (Sanskrit: , &#x27;), having the gotra of sage Viswamitra (Sanskrit: , &#x27;), composed of 24 letters (Sanskrit: , &#x27;), three-footed (Sanskrit: , &#x27;), six-bellied (Sanskrit: , &#x27;), five-headed (Sanskrit: , &#x27;) and the one used in Upanayana of (Sanskrit: , &quot;&quot;).

As mentioned in Taittiriya Sandhya Bhashyam, the three feet of Gayatri is supposed to represent the first 3 vedas (Ṛk, Yajus, Sāma). The six bellies are supposed to represent 4 cardinal directions, along with the two more directions, Ūrdhva (Zenith) and Adhara (Nadir). The five heads represent 5 among the Vedangas, namely, vyākaraṇa, śikṣā, kalpa, nirukta and jyotiṣa.

== Legends ==
In some Puranas, Gayatri is said to be the other names of Sarasvati, the wife of Brahma. According to the Matsya Purana, Brahma&#x27;s left half emerged as a female, who is celebrated under the names of Sarasvati, Savitri, and Gayatri. The three represent purity in thought, word, and deed (thrikarana shuddhi). Although Gayatri has three names, all three are in each of us as the senses (Gayatri), the power of speech (Saraswathi), and the life force (Savitri). In Kurma Purana, Gautama rishi was blessed by Goddess Gayatri and able to eliminate the obstacles he faced in his life. The Skanda Purana writes that Gayatri is married to Brahma, making her a form of Saraswati.

According to some texts, Brahma&#x27;s first wife is Savitri, and Gayatri is the second. The story goes that Savitri became angry knowing the wedding of Gayatri with Brahma, and cursed all the gods and goddesses engaged in the event.

However, the Padma Purana narrates the same story with some modifications. After Savitri was appeased by Brahma, Vishnu, and Lakshmi, She accepts Gayatri as her sister happily.

Gayatri further developed into a fierce goddess who could even slay a demon. According to Varaha Purana and Mahabharata, Goddess Gayatri slew the demon Vetrasura, the son of Vritra and river Vetravati, on a Navami day.

== Shaivism ==
 Shaivism sees Gayatri as the consort of eternal blissful absolute Parashiva who manifests in the form of Sadasiva. Sadashiva&#x27;s consort Manonmani is none other than the mantra form of Gayatri, who possess the power of her husband Bharga, within her. The popular form of Gayatri with five heads and ten arms was initially found in Saivite iconographies of Manonmani in North India beginning from 10th century CE. The Saivite view on Gayatri seems a later development from the combination of vedic practice of Gayatri reverence and its Saivite inclusion as a manifestation of Shakti. This could be the root for the sublime aspect of Gayatri explained in the later puranas as the killer of demon Vetra identifying her with Adi Parashakti.

<text>The varied triller (Lalage leucomela) like its better-known relative the white-winged triller, is a smaller member of the cuckoo-shrike family, Campephagidae. Varied trillers prefer warm, reasonably moist environments and are found in New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, along much of the tropical and sub-tropical coastal hinterland of eastern Australia, from about the Sydney area to the tip of Cape York Peninsula, in the moister part of the Kimberley, and throughout the Top End.

Common to very common in the north, they are uncommon to rare in the colder south. Typical habitat is rainforest, vine forest, riverine thickets, eucalypt forest and woodland, with a particular preference for the border areas between closed and open forests.

Varied trillers work their way slowly and methodically through foliage at any level (sometimes on the ground), searching in pairs or small groups for insects and fruit, and making repeated rolling contact calls almost continuously.

An alternative name is Pied Caterpillar-eater (Karua Leucomela)

The Mussau triller (&quot;L. conjuncta&quot;) was formerly considered a subspecies.

<text>The Gāyatrī Mantra (), also known as the Sāvitrī Mantra (), is a sacred mantra from the &quot;Ṛig Veda&quot; (Mandala 3.62.10), dedicated to the Vedic deity Savitr. It is known as &quot;Mother of the Vedas&quot;. 

The term Gāyatrī may also refer to a &quot;type&quot; of mantra which follows the same Vedic metre as the original Gāyatrī Mantra (without the first line). There are many such Gāyatrīs for various gods and goddesses. Furthermore, is the name of the Goddess of the mantra and the meter. 

The Gayatri mantra is cited widely in Hindu texts, such as the mantra listings of the Śrauta liturgy, and classical Hindu texts such as the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, and &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;. The mantra and its associated metric form was known by the Buddha. The mantra is an important part of the initiation ceremony. Modern Hindu reform movements spread the practice of the mantra to everyone and its use is now very widespread.

==Text==
The main mantra appears in the hymn RV 3.62.10. During its recitation, the hymn is preceded by &#x27; () and the formula &#x27; (), known as the &#x27;, or &quot;great (mystical) utterance&quot;. This prefixing of the mantra is properly described in the &quot;Taittiriya Aranyaka&quot; (2.11.1-8), which states that it should be chanted with the syllable &#x27;, followed by the three Vyahrtis and the Gayatri verse. 

Whereas in principle the &quot;gāyatrī&quot; mantra specifies three &quot;pāda&quot;s of eight syllables each, the text of the verse as preserved in the Samhita is one short, seven instead of eight. Metrical restoration would emend the attested tri-syllabic &#x27; with a tetra-syllabic &#x27;.

The Gayatri mantra with &quot;svaras&quot; is, in Devanagari:

In IAST:
: &quot;
: &quot;
:– Ṛgveda 03.062.10

==Dedication==
The &quot;Gāyatrī&quot; mantra is dedicated to Savitṛ, a solar deity. The mantra is attributed to the much revered sage Viśvāmitra, who is also considered the author of Mandala 3 of the Rigveda. Many monotheistic sects of Hinduism such as Arya Samaj hold that the Gayatri mantra is in praise of One Supreme Creator known by the name Om as mentioned in the &quot;Yajurveda&quot;, 40:17.

== Translations ==
After splitting the sandhi (Padapatha), the hymn may be glossed as follows:

The Gayatri mantra has been translated in many ways. Quite literal translations include: 
* Swami Vivekananda: &quot;We meditate on the glory of that Being who has produced this universe; may She enlighten our minds.&quot;
* Monier Monier-Williams (1882): &quot;Let us meditate on that excellent glory of the divine vivifying Sun, May he enlighten our understandings.&quot;
* Ralph T.H. Griffith (1896): &quot;May we attain that excellent glory of Savitar the god: So may He stimulate our prayers.&quot;
* S. Radhakrishnan: 
:* (1947): &quot;We meditate on the effulgent glory of the divine Light; may he inspire our understanding.&quot;
:* (1953): &quot;We meditate on the adorable glory of the radiant sun; may She inspire our intelligence.&quot;
* Sri Aurobindo: &quot;We choose the Supreme Light of the divine Sun; we aspire that it may impel our minds.&quot; Sri Aurobindo further elaborates: &quot;The Sun is the symbol of divine Light that is coming down and Gayatri gives expression to the aspiration asking that divine Light to come down and give impulsion to all the activities of the mind.&quot;
* Stephanie W. Jamison and Joel P. Brereton: &quot;Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights.&quot;

More interpretative translations include:
* Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) (1913): &quot;Om. Let us contemplate the wondrous spirit of the Divine Creator (&quot;Savitri&quot;) of the earthly, atmospheric, and celestial spheres. May He direct our minds (that is, &#x27;towards&#x27; the attainment of &quot;dharmma&quot;, &quot;artha&quot;, &quot;kama&quot;, and &quot;moksha&quot;), Om.&quot;
* Ravi Shankar (poet): &quot;Oh manifest and unmanifest, wave and ray of breath, red lotus of insight, transfix us from eye to navel to throat, under canopy of stars spring from soil in an unbroken arc of light that we might immerse ourselves until lit from within like the sun itself.&quot;
* Pandit Shriram Sharma: Om, the Brahm, the Universal Divine Energy, vital spiritual energy (Pran), the essence of our life existence, Positivity, destroyer of sufferings, the happiness, that is bright, luminous like the Sun, best, destroyer of evil thoughts, the divinity who grants happiness may imbibe its Divinity and Brilliance within us which may purify us and guide our righteous wisdom on the right path. 
* Sir William Jones (1807): &quot;Let us adore the supremacy of that divine sun, the god-head who illuminates all, who recreates all, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings right in our progress toward his holy seat.&quot;
* William Quan Judge (1893): &quot;Unveil, O Thou who givest sustenance to the Universe, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, that face of the True Sun now hidden by a vase of golden light, that we may see the truth and do our whole duty on our journey to thy sacred seat.&quot;
* Sivanath Sastri (Brahmo Samaj) (1911): &quot;We meditate on the worshipable power and glory of Him who has created the earth, the nether world and the heavens (i.e. the universe), and who directs our understanding.&quot;
* Swami Sivananda: &quot;Let us meditate on Isvara and His Glory who has created the Universe, who is fit to be worshipped, who is the remover of all sins and ignorance. May he enlighten our intellect.&quot; 
* Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati (founder of Arya Samaj): &quot;Oh God! Thou art the Giver of Life, Remover of pain and sorrow, The Bestower of happiness. Oh! Creator of the Universe, May we receive thy supreme sin-destroying light, May Thou guide our intellect in the right direction.&quot;
* Kirpal Singh: &quot;Muttering the sacred syllable &#x27;Aum&#x27; rise above the three regions, And turn thy attention to the All-Absorbing Sun within. Accepting its influence be thou absorbed in the Sun, And it shall in its own likeness make thee All-Luminous.&quot;

===Syllables of the Gayatri mantra===
Gayatri mantra, called &quot;Gayatri Chandas&quot; in Sanskrit, is twenty-four syllables comprising three lines (Sk. &quot;padas&quot;, literally &quot;feet&quot;) of eight syllables each, in this case starting from &quot;tat savitur vareṇyaṃ&quot;. The first line, oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ, is not part of the gayatri syllables, but an introduction to invoke the mantra to work on three Vyāhṛti or planes (physical, mental and spiritual).

The Gayatri mantra as received is short one syllable in the first line: &quot;&quot;.
Being only twenty-three syllables the Gayatri mantra is &quot;Nichruth Gayatri Chandas&quot; (&quot;Gayatri mantra short by one syllable&quot;). A reconstruction of &#x27; to a proposed historical &#x27; restores the first line to eight syllables. In practise, people reciting the mantra may retain seven syllables and simply prolong the length of time they pronounce the &quot;m&quot;, they may append an extra syllable of &quot;mmm&quot; (approximately va-ren-yam-mmm), or they may use the reconstructed &quot;&quot;.

==Textual appearances==

===Hindu literature===
The Gayatri mantra is cited widely in Hindu texts, such as the mantra listings of the Śrauta liturgy, and cited several times in the Brahmanams and the Srauta-sutras. It is also cited in a number of grhyasutras, mostly in connection with the upanayana ceremony in which it has a significant role.

The Gayatri mantra is the subject of esoteric treatment and explanation in some major Upanishads, including Mukhya Upanishads such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitrayaniya Upanishad; as well as other well-known works such as the Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana. The text also appears in minor Upanishads, such as the Surya Upanishad.

The Gayatri mantra is the apparent inspiration for derivative &quot;gāyatrī&quot; stanzas dedicated to other deities. Those derivations are patterned on the formula , and have been interpolated into some recensions of the Shatarudriya litany. Gāyatrīs of this form are also found in the Mahanarayana Upanishad.

The Gayatri mantra is also repeated and cited widely in Hindu texts such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, and &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;. 

=== Buddhist corpus ===
In Majjhima Nikaya 92, the Buddha refers to the Sāvitri (Pali: &quot;sāvittī&quot;) mantra as the foremost meter, in the same sense as the king is foremost among humans, or the sun is foremost among lights:

In Sutta Nipata 3.4, the Buddha uses the Sāvitri mantra as a paradigmatic indicator of Brahmanic knowledge:

===Upanayana ceremony===
Imparting the Gayatri mantra to young Hindu men is an important part of the traditional upanayana ceremony, which marks the beginning of study of the Vedas. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan described this as the essence of the ceremony, which is sometimes called &quot;Gayatri diksha&quot;, i.e. initiation into the Gayatri mantra. However, traditionally, the stanza RV.3.62.10 is imparted only to Brahmana. Other Gayatri verses are used in the upanayana ceremony are: RV.1.35.2, in the tristubh meter, for a kshatriya and either RV.1.35.9 or RV.4.40.5 in the jagati meter for a Vaishya.

===Mantra-recitation===
Gayatri japa is used as a method of prāyaścitta (atonement). It is believed by practitioners that reciting the mantra bestows wisdom and enlightenment, through the vehicle of the Sun (Savitr), who represents the source and inspiration of the universe.

===Brahmo Samaj===
In 1827 Ram Mohan Roy published a dissertation on the Gayatri mantra that analysed it in the context of various Upanishads. Roy prescribed a Brahmin to always pronounce &quot;om&quot; at the beginning and end of the Gayatri mantra. From 1830, the Gayatri mantra was used for private devotion of Brahmos. In 1843, the First Covenant of Brahmo Samaj required the Gayatri mantra for Divine Worship. From 1848-1850 with the rejection of Vedas, the Adi Dharma Brahmins use the Gayatri mantra in their private devotions.

===Hindu revivalism===
In the later 19th century, Hindu reform movements spread the chanting of the Gayatri mantra. In 1898 for example, Swami Vivekananda claimed that, according to the Vedas and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, a person became Brahmana through learning from his Guru, and not because of birth. He administered the sacred thread ceremony and the Gayatri mantra to non-Brahmins in Ramakrishna Mission. This Hindu mantra has been popularized to the masses, pendants, audio recordings and mock scrolls. Various Gayatri yajñas organised by All World Gayatri Pariwar at small and large scales in late twentieth century also helped spread Gayatri mantra to the masses.

===Indonesian Hinduism===
The Gayatri Mantra forms the first of seven sections of the Trisandhyā Puja (Sanskrit for &quot;three divisions&quot;), a prayer used by the Balinese Hindus and many Hindus in Indonesia. It is uttered three times each day: 6 am at morning, noon, and 6 pm at evening.

<doc id="455946" wikidata="Q2606017" url="?curid=455946" title="Blackhawk (DC Comics)">
<text>Blackhawk is the eponymous fictional character of the long-running comic book series Blackhawk first published by Quality Comics and later by DC Comics. Primarily created by Chuck Cuidera with input from both Bob Powell and Will Eisner, the Blackhawk characters first appeared in &quot;Military Comics&quot; #1 (August 1941).

Led by a mysterious man known as Blackhawk, the Blackhawks (or more formally, the Blackhawk Squadron) are a small team of World War II-era ace pilots of varied nationalities, each typically known under a single name, either their given name or their surname. Though the membership roster has undergone changes over the years, the team has been portrayed most consistently as having seven core members.

In their most well-known incarnation, the Blackhawks operate from a hidden base known only as Blackhawk Island, fly Grumman XF5F Skyrocket fighter aircraft, and shout their battle cry of &quot;Hawk-a-a-a!&quot; as they descend from the skies to fight tyranny and oppression. Clad in matching blue and black uniforms (with Blackhawk himself boasting a hawk insignia on his chest), early stories pitted the team against the Axis powers, but they would also come to battle recurring foes such as King Condor and Killer Shark, as well as encounter an array of gorgeous and deadly femmes fatale. They also frequently squared off against fantastical war machines ranging from amphibious &quot;shark planes&quot; and flying tanks, to the aptly named War Wheel, a gigantic rolling behemoth adorned with spikes and machine guns.

At the height of his popularity in the early 1940s, Blackhawk titles routinely outsold every other comic book but Superman. Blackhawk also shares the distinction of being just one of five comic book characters to be published continuously in their own titles from the 1940s up to the 1960s (the others being Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and The Phantom).

The comic book series has spawned a film serial in 1952 which starred Kirk Alyn as Blackhawk himself, a radio series, a novel, and has been announced as a forthcoming Steven Spielberg feature film. A grounded version of Blackhawk named Ted Gaynor appeared on television in the first season of the Arrowverse series &quot;Arrow&quot;, played by Ben Browder.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Like many of his golden age and silver age comic book counterparts, the creation of Blackhawk has been the subject of sometimes-contentious debate. Will Eisner has at times been considered the characters&#x27; primary creator, with Eisner himself acknowledging the contributions of Chuck Cuidera and writer Bob Powell.

Over the years, Cuidera became increasingly vocal that he did much more work on Blackhawk than Eisner and that he had in fact already started creating the characters prior to joining Eisner&#x27;s studio. According to Cuidera, he and Powell fleshed out the concept, deciding on everything from names and nationalities, to the characters&#x27; distinguishing traits, uniforms, and the aircraft they would fly.

In 1999, Eisner addressed his view of the matter during a Comic-Con panel:

===The Quality Comics years===

The Blackhawks debuted in August 1941 as the lead feature in the first issue of Quality Comics&#x27; anthology series &quot;Military Comics&quot;, billed as featuring &quot;stories of the Army and Navy&quot;. Viewed by Will Eisner as &quot;a modern version of the Robin Hood legend&quot;, the team&#x27;s first appearance was co-written by Chuck Cuidera and Bob Powell, with art by Cuidera. Although the exact nature of Eisner, Cuidera, and Powell&#x27;s individual contributions to the creation of the Blackhawks will never be known, it is confirmed that each performed some level of writing duties at different times during the first eleven issues, with Eisner working on early covers with Cuidera and Cuidera providing interior artwork.

When Cuidera joined the armed services in 1942, Reed Crandall took over as artist, beginning a long association with the characters that would last until 1953. Jim Steranko has observed, &quot;where Cuidera made Blackhawk a best-seller, Crandall turned it into a classic, a work of major importance and lasting value&quot;. It was during Crandall&#x27;s run that the series hit its sales and popularity zenith.

The Blackhawks&#x27; success earned them their own title in Winter 1944. That issue, &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #9, picked up the numbering of Quality&#x27;s canceled &quot;Uncle Sam Quarterly&quot;. They meanwhile continued to be featured prominently in &quot;Military Comics&quot;, later renamed &quot;Modern Comics&quot;, until that book&#x27;s cancellation with #102 (October 1950).

During the Quality years, a whole host of well-respected talent worked on the character, including writers Manly Wade Wellman, Bill Woolfolk, Bill Finger, and Dick French, as well as artists Al Bryant, Bill Ward, and Dick Dillin.

It was French, also an accomplished songwriter, who infused the team with the quirky desire to sing celebratory songs from their cockpits as they swooped in and out of battle.

Quality Comics ceased operations with comics cover-dated December 1956, with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #107 being the final issue published by Quality. The character and title trademarks were initially leased on a royalty basis to National Periodical Publications (now DC Comics) before eventually being sold in their entirety.

===Acquired by DC Comics===
Blackhawk was one of the few Quality series that DC chose to keep running uninterrupted. Penciller Dick Dillin and inker Chuck Cuidera remained on the title, ensuring a near-seamless transition. The duo would stay with the title through nearly its entire first run at DC.

Steering deeper and deeper into the realm of science fiction, the Blackhawks found themselves confronting a steady stream of unmemorable and mostly one-off supervillain-like adversaries bent on world domination.

The Blackhawks also gained a new ally in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #133 (February 1959): Lady Blackhawk, a pilot named Zinda Blake who was determined to become the first female member of the team. After a couple of appearances, she was granted honorary status and became a semi-frequent member of the supporting cast.

In an effort to update the characters, DC gave the team its first ever major wardrobe overhaul in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #197 (June 1964), replacing their longtime uniforms with red and black shirts and green pants. On a dramatic level, Lady Blackhawk was transformed into a supervillain, Queen Killer Shark, in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #200 (September 1964).

Then, in a much more drastic attempt to combat flagging sales due to the rising popularity of superhero books and the Batman TV series, DC proclaimed with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #228 (January 1967) the beginning of &quot;the New Blackhawk Era&quot; with a cover featuring Justice League of America members Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and the Flash observing that the Blackhawks are (in Superman&#x27;s words) &quot;washed up&quot; and (in Batman&#x27;s words) &quot;junk-heap heroes&quot;. In the issues that followed, all but Blackhawk gained a costumed superhero alter ego at the behest of a shadowy government agency.

With sales continuing to sink, the Blackhawks were restored to something that more closely resembled their original roots in &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #242 (August 1968), losing the superhero identities in favor of their traditional blue and black uniforms. It was too late though; the comic was canceled for the first time one issue later.

===1970s===
Just over seven years later, DC Comics resurrected the series with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #244 (January 1976) as part of an ongoing mid-1970s expansion of the line dubbed &quot;Conway&#x27;s Corner&quot; in house ads. The Blackhawks were transplanted to the 1970s and now portrayed as mercenaries-for-hire, matching wits against fancifully bizarre new villains, as well as a re-imagined Killer Shark and War Wheel. This run ended with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #250 (January 1977).

===1980s–1990s===
Amid rampant rumors that Steven Spielberg was interested in Blackhawk as a possible film project, DC Comics once again resumed the series. Initially conceived as being published quarterly, editor Len Wein convinced DC to make the book monthly and eventually assembled a team that included writer Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle. &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #251 (October 1982) returned the team to a World War II setting and restored many of the familiar trappings that had been shed over the years during the various attempts to modernize the characters. Numerous new supporting characters were introduced during the run, most notably Domino, a buxom Nazi assassin and love interest to Blackhawk who was reminiscent of the femmes fatales so common during the Quality Comics era. Evanier also reintroduced arch-villain Killer Shark, and has said he would have likely added Lady Blackhawk to the cast had the series lasted longer. But faced with stagnant sales that Evanier attributed largely to DC&#x27;s lack of interest in publicizing the series, the book was canceled with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #273 (November 1984). Though it wouldn&#x27;t be known at the time, that issue would mark the definitive end of the series&#x27; original issue numbering.

Sometime after the cancellation, DC employed writer Bill DuBay and artist Carmine Infantino to produce a Blackhawk mini-series. Though never published, numerous finished pages exist.

In 1988, a three-issue mini-series by Howard Chaykin re-imagined the team during World War II yet again, this time with a notably more adult and gritty take on the characters. Chaykin, for the most part, eschewed the team dynamic so familiar to Blackhawk readers, instead crafting a politically charged espionage thriller that focused prominently on Blackhawk and a new version of Lady Blackhawk. Post-war stories respecting Chaykin&#x27;s continuity followed in &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; #601–608, #615–622, and #628–635, as well as in a monthly series that restarted with an issue #1 and ran 16 issues from March 1989 to August 1990.

In 1992, DC Comics published &quot;Blackhawk Special&quot; #1. Still respecting Chaykin&#x27;s continuity and set 10 years after the events of &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #16, the story spans a five-year period as Blackhawk seeks to avenge the death of team member André.

===More recent appearances===
Since 1992, mostly modern hints of the team have appeared, usually in the form of the &quot;Blackhawk Express&quot; courier service or the time-displaced Lady Blackhawk. One of the best examples of this is the 1990s appearance of team member Chop-Chop in a few issues of DC&#x27;s &quot;Hawkworld&quot; series.

Other Blackhawk air pilot groups have been shown during present time or alternate future events such as &quot;Our Worlds At War&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. It is unknown which connection beyond homage and inspiration, if any, those groups have to the classic Blackhawks. Blackhawk at this time is an extension of Checkmate.

DC Comics reprinted the Blackhawk features from the first 17 issues of &quot;Military Comics&quot; in &quot;The Blackhawk Archives Volume 1&quot; (2001) as part of its hardcover DC Archive Editions series.

Blackhawk made an appearance in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; (Vol. 3) #9 (February 2008), teaming up with the Boy Commandos during a World War II tale.

The Blackhawks appeared in &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 2&quot;, in which they help Superman, Spectre, and Hawkman battle a robot during the war. During the battle, Chuck sacrifices himself to destroy a missile. During the same storyline in 1997, a heroine named Blackhawk appears, battling Sinestro. According to John Byrne&#x27;s liner notes in &quot;Generations 3&quot; #1, this character is Janet Hall, the granddaughter of the original Blackhawk, as well as Hawkman (Carter Hall) and Hawkgirl (Shiera Sanders).

===The New 52===

In September 2011 as part of its New 52 publishing revamp, DC Comics launched a monthly series titled &quot;Blackhawks&quot; with no direct ties to the previous incarnations. The book is set in the present day with no appearances by, or mention of, prior Blackhawks, although there is a new version of the Lady Blackhawk character. The book shares the setting of the rebooted DC Universe continuity set up in the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; mini-series. The series ended with &quot;Blackhawks&quot; #8 (April 2012) to make way for a &quot;second wave&quot; of New 52 titles.

==Fictional team history==
===Original incarnation===
With the overwhelming forces of Nazi Germany flooding into Poland in September, 1939, only the Polish Air Force remains as the last major line of resistance. Captain von Tepp and his Butcher Squadron swarm the skies in response, outnumbering the Polish four to one. The Germans decimate their foes until just one lone plane — painted jet black — remains. After gallantly shooting down six Nazi planes, the mysterious pilot is forced to crash land on the countryside. Running to a nearby farmhouse, he&#x27;s tracked from the air by von Tepp, who drops a bomb and destroys the building. The pilot locates his dead sister and mortally wounded brother inside. He vows to kill von Tepp before disappearing into the darkness.

Months later, with most of Europe collapsing under the might of the Nazis, the pilot reemerges with his own private squadron and &quot;like an angel of vengeance, Blackhawk and his men swoop down out of nowhere, their guns belching death, and on their lips the dreaded song of the Blackhawks&quot;.

In France, Captain von Tepp receives a note from Blackhawk demanding the release of one of Blackhawk&#x27;s men or face death. Infuriated, von Tepp orders the prisoner&#x27;s execution by firing squad. At dawn, the man and two others, including a cool-headed English Red Cross nurse (identified as &quot;Ann&quot; in &quot;Military Comics&quot; #3), are lined against a wall and mocked by von Tepp. As his men prepare to fire, the song of the Blackhawks fills the air:

With the Blackhawks lining the walls of the courtyard, Blackhawk himself confronts von Tepp. After a brief skirmish, von Tepp is abducted and flown to the Blackhawks&#x27; secret base in the Atlantic Ocean, Blackhawk Island. It&#x27;s there that Blackhawk challenges the Nazi captain to an aerial duel. During the ensuring dogfight, both of the men&#x27;s planes are crippled and forced to crash. On the ground, von Tepp and Blackhawk, both badly injured, draw guns. Von Tepp falls in a hail of bullets.

Blackhawk&#x27;s team is mostly depicted in &quot;Military Comics&quot; #1 as shadowy, nondescript soldiers, save for an Englishman named Baker who&#x27;s never seen or mentioned again. &quot;Military Comics&quot; #2 (September 1941) expands the role of the team in the featured adventure and introduces five members: Stanislaus, André, Olaf, Hendrick (Hendrickson within a few issues), and Zeg. A sixth, Boris, is also shown, but, like Baker, only makes a single appearance. The designer of their planes, Vladim, is also mentioned.

By &quot;Military Comics&quot; #3 (October 1941), the roster is firmed up and it&#x27;s stated that seven men belong to the team. The group also receives a Chinese mascot and cook, Chop-Chop, when his plane happens to crash on Blackhawk Island during a desperate run for help. The adventure concludes with the first on-page death of a team member: André, who seemingly perishes in an avalanche that buries a large group of Nazis. In &quot;Military Comics&quot; #9 (April 1942), the roster is down to five plus Chop-Chop, with Zeg presumably the absent member. In that adventure, the team crosses paths with the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask; André, in fact, now horribly disfigured, but still an enemy of the Nazis.

The most familiar version of the team is finally locked down in &quot;Military Comics&quot; #11 (August 1942) shown as consisting of Blackhawk, Olaf, Chuck, André (his face now reconstructed), Stanislaus, Hendrickson, and Chop-Chop.

In &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #50 (March 1952), the team&#x27;s origin is documented. Blackhawk himself is no longer identified as being Polish, but rather a Polish-American who is a volunteer flyer in the Polish Air Force. His sidekick in the squadron is Stanislaus, a &quot;brilliant young student&quot; from the University of Warsaw. After facing defeat against the Nazis, Blackhawk attempts to flee to Russia, only to discover that Russian forces are invading from the east. He then seeks refuge in England where he attempts to join the Royal Air Force. It&#x27;s in London where he and Stanislaus reunite and then meet the four others who will ultimately join them in their crusade: Chuck, another American volunteer; Hendrickson, a recent escapee from a Nazi concentration camp; Olaf, a Swede who had fought for Finland against the Russians; and André, a &quot;valiant Frenchman&quot;. The six men wait to enlist in the R.A.F., but because none are British subjects, they are &quot;held up by miles of red tape&quot;. Finally, Blackhawk suggests they strike out on their own. They pool their resources and buy planes, setting up a base of operations first on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean, then later in the Pacific. They&#x27;re eventually joined by Chop-Chop, described in this account as having &quot;fled from China when the Japanese overpowered the Nationalist army&quot;. Chop-Chop first acts as the team&#x27;s cook, but in time becomes an expert pilot and full member of the team.

===Post-Crisis===
After the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Blackhawk is once again Polish by birth and now given a definitive name, Janos Prohaska. Having joined the Polish Air Force at a young age, he had already become a national hero by 1936 alongside his trusted friends Stanislaus Drozdowski and Kazimierc &quot;Zeg&quot; Zegota-Januszajtis. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the trio travel across Europe, providing freelance service and even fighting for a time in the Spanish Civil War as members of the Communist party.

At one point finding himself in America in hopes of gathering funds to build a European resistance group, Prohaska is framed for a series of murders. With the help of the Sandman, he&#x27;s ultimately exonerated, but a report soon surfaces that he has been shot down and killed by Nazis somewhere in the Mediterranean.

When the forces of Nazi Germany invade Poland in 1939, Prohaska returns home to help defend his homeland. He&#x27;s unable to save his younger siblings, Józek and Staszka, and soon forced to flee to Britain with Stanislaus and Zeg. It&#x27;s there he meets the others who will form the foundation of the Blackhawk Squadron.

In the midst of the war, Prohaska finds himself under suspicion by the U.S. government for his Communist ties. Around this same time, the Blackhawks are joined by Captain Natalie Reed (born Natalie Gurdin), a brilliant Russian-American flight engineer who redesigns the Blackhawks&#x27; aircraft and is dubbed Lady Blackhawk by the U.S. press. It&#x27;s with her help that Prohaska is able to stop Nazi agent and onetime Hollywood actor Death Mayhew from detonating an atomic bomb in New York City. The victory restores Blackhawk&#x27;s reputation.

===The New 52===
In 2011, the entire line of DC Comics was rebooted as part of &quot;The New 52&quot;. In this new version the Blackhawks are an elite covert military unit taking care of High Technology Criminals. During this period their main mission was to deal with terrorist group &quot;Mother Machine&quot;. During this storyline their cover is exposed and their existence becomes known to the public and the team must deal with the backlash as well.

===Rebirth===
In &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; #1, Kendra Saunders is introduced as Lady Blackhawk, she is now the leader of the Blackhawks, an anti-apocalyptic team with the mission to prevent the Dark Multiverse from destroying Earth-0. She also introduces the Blackhawk Island, a place where cosmic energy conducted through the earth&#x27;s metal core cancels itself out, creating a kind of static that disrupts space-time, the Island served as well for many years as a base of operations for Hawkman and Hawkgirl.

Lady Blackhawk and the Blackhawks are featured in &quot;All-Star Batman&quot; second arc, &quot;Ends of Earth&quot;, they are seen hounding Batman, and they are shown to possesses an armor that has the ability to track eye-line movement, the armor also turns them invisible.

==Team depictions==
===Original incarnation===
After a period of membership fluctuations during the first 10 issues of &quot;Military Comics&quot;, the team finally settles into its most famous roster. Although minor character details would shift and change over time, this original version of the team would stay largely intact from the characters&#x27; debut in 1941 to the end of their first run in 1968. At one point or another, every member of the team except Blackhawk is depicted in ways stereotypical for the time, and over the course of the series several would develop their own catchphrases.

* Blackhawk – first Polish, then American, the man known as Blackhawk is portrayed as a strong, decisive leader. He&#x27;s not always easy on his men—calling Olaf a &quot;big fat-head&quot;, for example—but always appears to command their unquestionable respect. At one point late in the first series&#x27; run, he&#x27;s given a name, Bart Hawk.
* Stanislaus – Blackhawk&#x27;s second-in-command. Polish, Stan is initially depicted like his teammates with various ethnic distinctions, but those disappear as the series progresses to the point that he could very well pass for an American. He is often portrayed as an acrobat, then later as the team&#x27;s strongman.
* Chuck – at different times stated as being from Brooklyn or Texas, Chuck is often shown as the team&#x27;s communications specialist. His words are peppered with frequent American colloquialisms like &quot;I reckon!&quot; and &quot;Dagnabbit!&quot;
* Hendrickson – known as &quot;Hendy&quot; for short, the oldest of the Blackhawks is also their ever-dependable sharpshooter. Heavyset with white hair and a thick, Germanic mustache, he&#x27;s usually portrayed as Dutch (though German in some accounts), and often exclaims, &quot;Himmel!&quot; (German for &quot;sky&quot; and &quot;heaven&quot;) or &quot;Ach du lieber!&quot; (a German phrase akin to &quot;Oh, dear!&quot;).
* André – with his pencil-thin mustache and natural born suavity, André&#x27;s appreciation of beautiful women often leads the team into precarious situations. Their demolitions expert, he frequently utters &quot;Sacre bleu!&quot; (an old French profanity).
* Olaf – a giant of a man, Olaf is usually portrayed as Swedish, his brutish size and poor English playing into the &quot;big, dumb Swede&quot; stereotype. He often shouts, &quot;Py Yiminy!&quot; and demonstrates impressive acrobatic abilities (a trait that Stanislaus&#x27; character loses over time).
* Chop-Chop – Chop-Chop is originally the team&#x27;s Chinese cook and essentially Blackhawk&#x27;s sidekick, riding along in Blackhawk&#x27;s plane as opposed to piloting his own. He evolves over time from comic relief mascot to a valued member of the team proficient in the martial arts. His full name is eventually revealed to be Liu Huang.

Other short-term members are Baker, an Englishman, and Boris, a Russian. Both characters only make single panel appearances. Zeg, Polish like Blackhawk and Stanislaus, manages to last a bit longer, but is gone by the Blackhawk&#x27;s ninth appearance in &quot;Military Comics&quot;.

A significant ally to the team throughout the 1940s is Miss Fear, who never formally joins the group but appears frequently during their Asian missions, developing a romantic interest in Blackhawk himself.

The strip&#x27;s most significant supporting character is Zinda Blake, also known as Lady Blackhawk. After a failed attempt to become the team&#x27;s first female member, she is eventually awarded honorary status and makes numerous appears from 1959 to 1968, even becoming the villainess Queen Killer Shark for a time.

The team acquires an animal mascot in the 1950s, Blackie the hawk. Possessing remarkable intelligence he can type notes in plain English, among other skills and fitted with his own miniature belt radio, he&#x27;s often shown perched on Blackhawk&#x27;s shoulder.

===1967&#x27;s New Blackhawk Era===
When the Blackhawks are proven by the secret spy organization G.E.O.R.G.E. (the Group for Extermination of Organizations of Revenge, Greed, and Evil) to be inept and ineffective as a modern-day fighting force against the evils of the world, the team regroups and dons dramatic new identities that, as the U.S. president happily observes, returns them to their rightful place as one of America&#x27;s &quot;top trouble-shooting teams&quot;. For 14 issues beginning with &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #228 (January 1967), the Blackhawks become:

* The Big Eye (Blackhawk) – Constantly monitoring the activities of his squad from the Hawk-Kite, a mammoth dirigible made to look like a two-headed hawk, Blackhawk is the only one of the seven to not take on a new alter-ego.
* The Golden Centurion (Stanislaus) – Clad in the gleaming gold armor of a dead foe, Stan not only gains the ability to fly, but can also fire bolts of &quot;ionized pure gold&quot;.
* The Listener (Chuck) – Chuck facilitates communication between the team, wearing what resembles pajamas covered with drawings of ears.
* The Weapons-Master (Hendrickson) – Hendy is the team&#x27;s master of weaponry.
* M&#x27;sieu Machine (André) – André becomes designer of exotic crime-fighting gadgets.
* The Leaper (Olaf) – Donning a rubber-titanium outfit reminiscent of a human cannonball circus performer, Olaf&#x27;s natural acrobatic abilities are now complemented with the ability to leap and bounce great distances.
* Dr. Hands (Chop-Chop) – Mixing martial arts with beryllium-encased hands, Chop-Chop is able to &quot;smash through practically anything&quot;.

The change was very unpopular; in the span of a year, the series lost an average 71,000 readers per issue. The &quot;New Blackhawk Era&quot; ends after just 14 issues when G.E.O.R.G.E. headquarters is unceremoniously destroyed, leaving the Blackhawks with only their classic blue and black uniforms.

===1976–1977===
When the series resumes in 1976, it features a mercenary team composed of familiar unaged faces. Their origins and place in the DC Universe are never explained, though it is firmly stated that this version of the Blackhawks consists of &quot;the original seven&quot; and surmises that they had &quot;first banded together in the fifties to battle a growing number of costumed villains and foes&quot;. The members of the team are described as follows:

* Blackhawk (also referred to as &quot;Bart Hawk&quot; and &quot;Mr. Cunningham&quot;) – The head of one of the largest aircraft manufacturing companies in the world, and a man who commands &quot;a working knowledge of science with specialties in aviation and aerodynamics&quot;.
* Stanislaus – The Polish &quot;financial wizard&quot; of Cunningham Aircraft.
* André – The French mechanics expert.
* Olaf – The Swedish junior member of the group.
* Hendrickson – The Dutch elder of the group and the full-time &quot;sentinel&quot; of the team&#x27;s secret base, Blackhawk Island.
* Chuck – The American communications expert and team scientist.
* Chopper (formerly known as Chop-Chop) – The Chinese master of martial arts and the team&#x27;s most skilled flier, &quot;save for Blackhawk himself&quot;.

Early in the run, Boris - &quot;the eighth Blackhawk&quot;, as he refers to himself - reemerges as the super-powered villain Anti-Man, hellbent on destroying the team as revenge for leaving him for dead on a long ago mission. Shown in flashback wearing the Blackhawks&#x27; classic blue and black uniform, even then as a member he exhibits surprising aggression toward his teammates.
With Hendrickson left ailing in the final issue of the run, and Chuck seemingly killed in battle, it&#x27;s possible that big changes were in store for the team&#x27;s line-up had the series continued past &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #250. Two possible replacements are set up, either of whom could have also taken the mantle of Lady Blackhawk: Duchess Ramona Fatale (also referred to as &quot;Patch&quot;), a mercenary with questionable allegiances, but harboring love for Blackhawk; and Elsa, Hendrickson&#x27;s daughter.

===1982–1984===
With the team&#x27;s return to a World War II setting, many basic aspects of the original incarnation are restored, complemented by what writer Mark Evanier called &quot;a more contemporary attitude towards characterization&quot;. The core members are:

* Blackhawk – Described as &quot;Polish American&quot; and referred to as Bart on a few occasions. He abhors killing, doing so only in self-defense. He&#x27;s strong and level-headed, not always reacting as swiftly or as violently as some of his men might like.
* Stanislaus – Blackhawk&#x27;s Polish second-in-command and loyal friend. Lacking confidence from being in Blackhawk&#x27;s shadow for so long, he envies Blackhawk&#x27;s strong leadership capabilities.
* André – A former member of the French resistance, he&#x27;s the team&#x27;s experienced military planner and full-time ladies&#x27; man.
* Olaf – A Swede whose tall height and thick accent plays into a common stereotype, but in actuality conceals amazing acrobatic skills and a savvy mind in combat.
* Hendrickson – The team&#x27;s Dutch weapons master and sharpshooter. The oldest of the group, he grapples with feelings of resentment, often left feeling like his much-younger teammates don&#x27;t always make full use of his wisdom.
* Chuck – A Texan who volunteered for the British R.A.F. before bringing his expert piloting and mechanic skills to the Blackhawks. He is portrayed as tougher and more rude than previous depictions.
* Chop-Chop – Both the youngest and the newest member of the team, he&#x27;s a martial arts master named Wu Cheng.

Also introduced during the run is Lieutenant Theodore Gaynor of the United States Marine Corps, who joins the team when Chop-Chop takes a leave of absence to fight the Japanese in China. Gaynor leaves the team after it is learned his hardline stance against the Germans includes the execution of not only Nazi soldiers, but also civilians.

===1988–present===
After the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; rewrites the history of the DC Universe, the Blackhawks&#x27; own history, both during World War II and after, undergoes yet more transformation. The members are:

* Major Janos Prohaska (Blackhawk) – Reestablished as being born and raised in Poland, Prohaska is portrayed as the consummate leader, but also as a brash, hard-drinking womanizer. He is also revealed to have been a member of the Communist Party, expelled by Joseph Stalin after opposing the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a 1939 treaty of non-aggression between the Soviets and Nazi Germany.
* Captain Stanislaus Drozdowski – Longtime friend of Blackhawk&#x27;s who fights alongside him in the Polish Air Force before becoming one of the earliest members of the Blackhawks—and one of the team&#x27;s first casualties.
* Captain André Blanc-Dumont – An excellent but slightly reckless pilot, the Frenchman is second-in-command of the team, as well as Prohaska&#x27;s closest confidant and frequent co-pilot.
* Captain Olaf Friedriksen – Danish in this version, athletic Olaf is a savant with languages and skilled at radio operations.
* Captain Ritter Hendricksen – The Dutch marksmen and demolitions expert, as well as the oldest member of the team.
* Captain Carlo &quot;Chuck&quot; Sirianni – An Italian-American from New Jersey who served with the U.S. Office of Strategic Services before joining the team and becoming their chief navigation officer. Chuck is also a dabbler in electronics and aeronautic technology.
* Lieutenant Weng Chan (Chop-Chop) – Chinese and said to be just 17 when he first joins the team, Weng is a skilled pilot, flight mechanic, and cook.
* Captain Natalie Reed (Lady Blackhawk) – Brilliant Russian-American flight engineer who redesigns the Blackhawks&#x27; aircraft and fights alongside them. She gives birth to a son in 1945, the product of a brief affair with Hendricksen.

Other early members of the team include Russians Boris Zinoviev and Kazimierc &quot;Zeg&quot; Zegota-Januszajtis, and Englishman Ian Holcomb-Baker, who are &quot;the first to fall in battle&quot;. Later team members include African-American Grover Baines, Malaysian Quan Chee Keng (known as &quot;Mairzey&quot;), and Mexican Paco Herrera.

===2011–present===
Core members of the Blackhawk Squadron as depicted in the New 52 era:

* Colonel Andrew Lincoln – Deputy of operations.
* Lady Blackhawk
* Kunoichi – Nikki Nemzer, Japanese field operative.
* The Irishman – Ukrainian field operative.
* Attila – Hungarian field operative.
* Canada
* Wildman – Randall Wildman, Field support operative.

==Evolution of Chop-Chop==

Throughout the 1940s and well into the 1950s, Chop-Chop provides comic relief in the Blackhawk strip and is depicted as more of a highly exaggerative caricature amid the realistic art style that otherwise surrounds him. Fat, buck-toothed, and orange-skinned, he speaks in broken English, wears a queue hairstyle complete with a bow, and dresses in colorful coolie garb. This depiction, although now considered offensive, was not atypical of World War II-era depictions of Asians especially the Japanese. A popular character at the time, Chop-Chop also appears in his own humor feature in the &quot;Blackhawk&quot; series from 1946 to 1955.

Even in his very earliest appearances, he demonstrates tremendous competency and bravery, arriving on Blackhawk Island in a plane of his own construction, and then, relatively soon after, is shown fighting right alongside Blackhawk in a hand-to-hand melee. Despite this, he&#x27;s long portrayed as essentially Blackhawk&#x27;s sidekick, riding along in Blackhawk&#x27;s plane as opposed to piloting his own and often brandishing a cleaver in battle.

In 1952, it&#x27;s firmly stated that he&#x27;s a full member of the team, and from 1955 to 1964, he slowly transforms into a more realistically drawn character, changes that culminate when the Blackhawks take on a major uniform change for the first time in their history and Chop-Chop finally joins them in his choice of wardrobe. When the team later reverts to their traditional blue and black uniforms, he dons one for the first time.

When the 1980s World War II-set revival of the series begins, Chop-Chop is again shown in a variation of his original outfit (and even clutches a cleaver on the cover of the first issue). It&#x27;s quickly apparent, however, that the similarities end there and that he&#x27;s far from comic relief. As the run progresses, it&#x27;s revealed that he feels slighted by his teammates, not given proper enough respect to even wear the same uniform as them. Realizing their embarrassing oversight, they bestow to him with great ceremony a standard uniform and his own plane to mark him as a respected member of the group.

After DC Comics&#x27; company-wide crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; revamped and streamlined many of DC&#x27;s properties, Chop-Chop has almost exclusively been depicted with a build similar to his comrades and wearing the Blackhawks&#x27; standard uniform. His past likeness and role as sidekick is addressed, shown as a character in a comic book about the Blackhawks, which he finds infuriatingly insulting.

===1983 controversy===
In &quot;Blackhawk&quot; #263 (October 1983), writer Mark Evanier took over the &quot;Blackhawk Bylines&quot; letter column to address an anonymous editorial written by a staff member of the &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot; that ran in the paper&#x27;s February 6, 1983, edition. Evanier wrote of the piece:

An admittedly stunned Evanier readily denounced the column, challenging the editorial writer&#x27;s assertion that Steven Spielberg, at the time rumored to be interested in making a &quot;Blackhawk&quot; film, should be faithful to the original depiction of Chop-Chop. Evanier wrote that it&#x27;s amazing to him that &quot;anyone could believe that Chinese folks were really obese and stupid in the forties&quot; or that Spielberg would ignore the box office and &quot;commit professional suicide by so depicting them&quot;.

When asked later if the editorial hastened Evanier&#x27;s own approach to evolving the character, Evanier said he thought he would have pursued the same course regardless, giving the editorial &quot;probably more attention than it deserved&quot;.

==Aircraft==
===Grumman XF5F Skyrocket===
The Grumman XF5F Skyrocket is the twin-engine fighter most identified with the Blackhawks. The team is nearly always shown flying modified versions of the plane during their World War II adventures and for some time thereafter. As Will Eisner remembered:

===Other notable aircraft===

Additionally, other planes made appearances during the course of strip:
* PZL.50A Jastrząb – This is the plane that Blackhawk flew in Poland during the Nazi invasion of 1939.
* Republic F-84 Thunderjet – By the early 1950s, the Blackhawks converted the squadron to jets. This was the Blackhawk Squadron&#x27;s first jet aircraft:
* Lockheed XF-90 – This actual experimental fighter was adapted to become the fictional:
: F-90 &quot;B&quot; – The Blackhawks flew this plane from 1950 to 1955.
: F-90 &quot;C&quot; – The Blackhawks were flying this model by 1957.
* Republic F-105 Thunderchief – The Blackhawks modified this plane to have VTOL capability.
* Lockheed F-94 Starfire – This is the plane that Lady Blackhawk flew.

==International incarnations==

The Blackhawk concept and characters proved to be popular on the international market as well as in the United States. Quality Comics licensed the rights along with many of their other characters to London&#x27;s Boardman Books, which used them in a series of three-color reprints from 1948 to 1954. Boardman also reprinted Blackhawk stories in their &quot;Adventure Annual&quot; series of hardcover Christmas publications. Many of the British Blackhawk reprints were repackaged by Boardman art director Denis McLoughlin, who created at least one British original Blackhawk story, as well as the illustrations for several &quot;Blackhawk&quot; text stories. After Boardman&#x27;s contract lapsed, Strato Publications launched a square-bound 68-page &quot;Blackhawk&quot; series which ran for 37 issues between 1956 and 1958.

==Early crossover==
In &quot;Hit Comics&quot; #26 (February 1943), Blackhawk participated in an early example of a crossover when fellow Quality Comics character Kid Eternity summons him to stop a mad scientist.

==Other versions==
===Flashpoint===
* In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; reality, the Blackhawk Squadron, equipped with F-35s and with Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris among its pilots, respond to attacks on New Themyscira, but are killed by Amazonian forces.

==In other media==
===Television===

* A 1968 &quot;presentation drawing&quot; from Filmation depicts a red-shirted interpretation of Blackhawk and a member of the squadron fighting a group of aliens. Created during the height of &quot;The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure&quot;″s popularity, the artwork is believed to have been part of an attempt to convince CBS of the animation viability of other DC Comics properties.

===Film===
* Blackhawk appears in a self-titled serial, portrayed by Kirk Alyn.
* The Blackhawk squadron appears in &quot;Justice League: The New Frontier&quot;.
* In the early 1980s, Steven Spielberg announced plans to direct a film adaptation of the Blackhawk comic book series, with Dan Aykroyd attached to play the title character. However, the project was canceled and Spielberg chose to direct &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; instead. In April 2018, Warner Bros. Pictures revived the &quot;Blackhawk&quot; project, with Spielberg returning to direct and produce and David Koepp writing the screenplay. Additionally, Spielberg would co-produce the film with Kristie Macosko Krieger and Sue Kroll and it was initially expected to begin after he completed &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Koepp later added that he is now working on the script, but is unsure if Spielberg will direct. In March 2022, Koepp confirmed that a script had been written, though he suggested Spielberg&#x27;s involvement in the project was currently unknown due to other commitments. He also confirmed there were no plans for the film to be part of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).

<text>The RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF) was one of three tactical air forces within the Royal Air Force (RAF) during and after the Second World War. It was made up of squadrons and personnel from the RAF, other British Commonwealth air forces, and exiles from German-occupied Europe. Renamed as British Air Forces of Occupation in 1945, 2TAF was recreated in 1951 and became Royal Air Force Germany in 1959.

==Formation==

2TAF was formed on 1 June 1943 as HQ Tactical Air Force from Army Co-operation Command, in connection with preparations then in train to invade Europe a year later. It took units from both Fighter Command and Bomber Command in order to form a force capable of supporting the Army in the field. Bomber Command provided No. 2 Group with light bombers; Fighter Command was split into the Air Defence of Great Britain, retaining fighter units for home defence, and No. 83 Group and No. 84 Group operating aircraft, and No. 85 Group controlling ground-based units, for the Second Tactical Air Force. In addition, No. 38 Group for towing assault gliders and No. 140 Squadron, providing strategic photo-reconnaissance, were also part of the tactical air force at its inception.

== Second World War ==

2TAF&#x27;s first commander was Air Marshal Sir John d&#x27;Albiac, who, on 21 January 1944, was succeeded by the man most associated with Second TAF, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham. Coningham had great experience of the type of operations required for supporting fast moving ground warfare due to his command of the Desert Air Force in North Africa and Italy. He honed Second TAF into a command up to the challenges presented to it, and incorporated many of the lessons from Italy, including the use of the &quot;cab rank&quot; system for aircraft for close air support, into the doctrine of Second TAF.
No. 34 (Photo Reconnaissance) Wing, commanded by Royal Navy Commodore E.C. Thornton, served as the air spotting pool for naval gunfire support throughout Operation Overlord. The wing included No. 2 Squadron RAF, No. 26 Squadron RAF, No. 63 Squadron RAF, No. 268 Squadron RAF, No. 414 Squadron RCAF, 808 Naval Air Squadron, 885 Naval Air Squadron, 886 Naval Air Squadron, 897 Naval Air Squadron and, briefly, the United States Navy&#x27;s VOS-7.

By this late stage in the war, the Luftwaffe was but a pale shadow of the organisation it had once been. Mostly Second TAF spent its time supporting the British and Canadian forces on the left flank of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force&#x27;s command. One notable exception was the last great attack of the Luftwaffe, Operation Bodenplatte, mounted on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945, when the Second TAF suffered serious losses on the ground.

On 20 January 1945, four Gloster Meteors jets from 616 Squadron were moved to Melsbroek in Belgium and attached to the Second Tactical Air Force.

In February 1945 No. 87 Group RAF was established, a transport formation. It became part of 2nd TAF/BAFO, but was reduced to No. 87 Wing RAF on 15 July 1946.

== Post Second World War ==
The Second TAF was renamed as the British Air Forces of Occupation on 15 July 1945. It began as a large force of four groups (2, 83, 84, 85 Groups) but 2 Group disbanded on 1 May 1947.

By the end of 1947, the forces had shrunk to ten squadrons at three airfields, all directly under control of the Air Headquarters at Bad Eilsen. In 1951, the British Air Forces of Occupation reverted to their former name with the re-creation of the Second Tactical Air Force on 1 September 1951.

No. 2 Group was transferred again to Second Tactical Air Force on 1 September 1951, but was disbanded on 15 November 1958. No. 83 Group RAF controlled 2TAF&#x27;s southern area from 1952 to 1958. On 1 July 1956, No. 2 Group appeared to encompass wings at Ahlhorn (No. 125 Wing RAF), RAF Fassberg (No. 121 Wing RAF), Gutersloh (No. 551 Wing RAF, under the control of Bomber Command), Jever (No. 122 Wing RAF), Laarbruch (34 Wing), RAF Oldenburg (No. 124 Wing RAF), and RAF Wunstorf (No. 123 Wing RAF), while No. 83 Group directed wings at RAF Bruggen, Celle, RAF Geilenkirchen, RAF Wahn, and RAF Wildenrath.

The Second Tactical Air Force was redesignated Royal Air Force Germany on 1 January 1959, at which point C.-in-C. RAF Germany became commander of the NATO Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF).

<text>The Tseung Kwan O line () is one of the ten lines of the MTR system in Hong Kong, indicated by the colour purple. It is currently long, taking 15 minutes to travel throughout the entire line.

The line runs from North Point on the Hong Kong Island to the new town of Tseung Kwan O. It bifurcates east of Tseung Kwan O station into two branches, one northward to Po Lam and one southward to LOHAS Park. The Tseung Kwan O Depot at LOHAS Park is responsible for the maintenance of the line&#x27;s rolling stock.

During the morning peak period, the Tseung Kwan O line uses 15 trains to maintain a frequency of 2.5 minutes between Tseung Kwan O and North Point.

==Route map==
== Route description ==
The Tseung Kwan O line is the first MTR line with no tracks on viaducts. It was the only line with tracks completely in tunnels until the completion of LOHAS Park station, which there are two short sections nearby that are not in tunnels. The stations of Yau Tong, Po Lam and LOHAS Park are at ground level, but are completely shielded to minimise noise to the surrounding development. The rest of the line has its tracks located underground.

The western terminus of the line is North Point, providing cross-platform interchange with the Island line. However, the next station, Quarry Bay, still interchanges with the Island Line but does not provide such a cross-platform interchange. East of Quarry Bay, the line passes under Victoria Harbour to Yau Tong station, a station serving the East Kowloon neighbourhood of the same name, using the rail tunnel of the Eastern Harbour Crossing. From Yau Tong, the line passes through the Black Hill Tunnels to enter Tseung Kwan O New Town at Tiu Keng Leng.

Within Tseung Kwan O new town, the line splits into two branches east of Tseung Kwan O station. One branch reaches Hang Hau and Po Lam stations in the northern part of the new town, whereas the southward branch connects LOHAS Park station in Area 86. LOHAS Park is a large residential development built above the Tseung Kwan O Depot, where the trains of the line are maintained.

=== Train operations ===
Operation of the line is relatively complex because of the split into two branches at Tseung Kwan O.

The majority of trains on the line run through from Po Lam to North Point and vice versa. Through service between LOHAS Park and North Point is only provided during rush hour; during non-peak periods, LOHAS Park is only served by &quot;shuttle trains&quot; that terminate at Tiu Keng Leng, operating at 12-minute intervals. Passengers travelling to and from LOHAS Park during non-peak hours are required to change trains at Tiu Keng Leng or Tseung Kwan O in order to continue their journey.

Train headways are as follows:
* Rush hour: One through train to/from LOHAS Park after two trains to/from Po Lam
** North Point - Po Lam trains: every 2.5 or 4 minutes
** North Point - LOHAS Park trains: every 7–8 minutes
** combined headway between North Point and Tseung Kwan O is 2.5 minutes.
* Non-peak period:
** Mon-Fri, Sat (10:00-20:00) and Sun (09:00-20:00)
*** North Point - Po Lam trains: every 4 minutes
*** Tiu Keng Leng - LOHAS Park shuttle trains: every 12 minutes
*** No through service from LOHAS Park to North Point, vice versa
** Every day between 20:00 and 00:00
*** North Point - Po Lam trains: every 5 minutes
*** Tiu Keng Leng - LOHAS Park shuttle trains: every 12 minutes
*** No through service from LOHAS Park to North Point, vice versa
** Every day after 00:00
*** North Point to Po Lam trains: every 6 minutes
*** Po Lam to North Point trains: every 8–9 minutes
*** Tiu Keng Leng - LOHAS Park shuttle trains: every 12 minutes

== History ==
The Tseung Kwan O line was planned to serve the new town of Tseung Kwan O and was first proposed in 1981 as part of the &quot;Junk Bay New Town Transport Study&quot;. The report proposed four corridors, all of which called for the Kwun Tong line to be extended to Lam Tin station and placed the terminus of the Tseung Kwan O line at the vicinity of Tsui Ping Estate. The construction cost was estimated at HK$3 billion. The construction of the Tseung Kwan O line was approved by the Hong Kong Government in 1985 and under the 1985 plan, a branch line from Lam Tin station to Tseung Kwan O station, consisting of 5 or 6 stations, was to be built beginning in 1992 and to open by the end of 1996. This plan was cancelled by the MTR Corporation in August 1990.

MTR re-proposed the line in 1993, and the plan was approved by the Hong Kong Executive Council on 20 October 1998. Construction commenced on 24 April 1999 and the line opened on 18 August 2002, at a cost of HK$18 billion. The new line took over the cross-harbour segment, via the Eastern Harbour Crossing to North Point station, from the Kwun Tong line. The Kwun Tong line was extended to Yau Tong and Tiu Keng Leng stations to interchange with the new line.

=== Trains ===
The line is served by the K-Stock and M-Trains. The K-Stock trains were manufactured by a consortium of Hyundai Rotem and Mitsubishi Corporation, and were expected to be quieter and to use energy generated from deceleration.

Although tailor-made for the line, the K-Stock trains actually ran on the Kwun Tong line temporarily from launch through April 2010, and the original M-Trains ran on this line instead. The K-Stock trains were finally transferred to this line in April 2010.

==Stations==
This is a list of the stations on the Tseung Kwan O line.

===Notes===

== Future development ==

The Tseung Kwan O line will probably be extended to Tamar station and interchange with an extended Tung Chung line there. This is according to the &quot;interchange scheme&quot; devised for the North Island line, which would also see the line serve stations at Fortress Hill, Causeway Bay North and Exhibition Centre, the latter of which would provide a connection with the Sha Tin to Central Link extension of the North South Corridor (East Rail Line to Admiralty). Construction is not expected to begin before 2021.

Under an earlier proposal, called the &quot;swap scheme&quot;, the line would have taken over the section of the Island line from Fortress Hill to Kennedy Town; with the remaining section east of Tin Hau being transferred to the Tung Chung line. This was rejected as the existing Island line would be interrupted and require an interchange.

In the Chief Executive&#x27;s 2022 Policy Address, it was announced that the Tseung Kwan O line would be extended southwards to Tseung Kwan O Area 137, an 80 hectare plot of land the Development Bureau has identified suitable for the development of 50,000 new housing units. Area 137 is expected to take in new populations in 2030, but there has been no expected timeline for the completion of the extensions or the opening of the new station.

<doc id="455961" wikidata="Q2342396" url="?curid=455961" title="Bounded operator">
<text>In functional analysis and operator theory, a bounded linear operator is a linear transformation formula_1 between topological vector spaces (TVSs) formula_2 and formula_3 that maps bounded subsets of formula_2 to bounded subsets of formula_5 
If formula_2 and formula_3 are normed vector spaces (a special type of TVS), then formula_8 is bounded if and only if there exists some formula_9 such that for all formula_10
formula_11
The smallest such formula_12 is called the operator norm of formula_8 and denoted by formula_14 
A linear operator between normed spaces is continuous if and only if it is bounded.

The concept of a bounded linear operator has been extended from normed spaces to all topological vector spaces.

Outside of functional analysis, when a function formula_15 is called &quot;bounded&quot; then this usually means that its image formula_16 is a bounded subset of its codomain. A linear map has this property if and only if it is identically formula_17 
Consequently, in functional analysis, when a linear operator is called &quot;bounded&quot; then it is never meant in this abstract sense (of having a bounded image).

==In normed vector spaces==

Every bounded operator is Lipschitz continuous at formula_17

===Equivalence of boundedness and continuity===

A linear operator between normed spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous.

==In topological vector spaces==

A linear operator formula_19 between two topological vector spaces (TVSs) is called a &#x27; or just &#x27; if whenever formula_20 is bounded in formula_2 then formula_22 is bounded in formula_5 
A subset of a TVS is called bounded (or more precisely, von Neumann bounded) if every neighborhood of the origin absorbs it. 
In a normed space (and even in a seminormed space), a subset is von Neumann bounded if and only if it is norm bounded. 
Hence, for normed spaces, the notion of a von Neumann bounded set is identical to the usual notion of a norm-bounded subset.

===Continuity and boundedness===

Every sequentially continuous linear operator between TVS is a bounded operator. 
This implies that every continuous linear operator between metrizable TVS is bounded. 
However, in general, a bounded linear operator between two TVSs need not be continuous.

This formulation allows one to define bounded operators between general topological vector spaces as an operator which takes bounded sets to bounded sets. 
In this context, it is still true that every continuous map is bounded, however the converse fails; a bounded operator need not be continuous. 
This also means that boundedness is no longer equivalent to Lipschitz continuity in this context.

If the domain is a bornological space (for example, a pseudometrizable TVS, a Fréchet space, a normed space) then a linear operators into any other locally convex spaces is bounded if and only if it is continuous. 
For LF spaces, a weaker converse holds; any bounded linear map from an LF space is sequentially continuous.

If formula_19 is a linear operator between two topological vector spaces and if there exists a neighborhood formula_25 of the origin in formula_2 such that formula_27 is a bounded subset of formula_28 then formula_29 is continuous. 
This fact is often summarized by saying that a linear operator that is bounded on some neighborhood of the origin is necessarily continuous. 
In particular, any linear functional that is bounded on some neighborhood of the origin is continuous (even if its domain is not a normed space). 

====Bornological spaces====
Bornological spaces are exactly those locally convex spaces for which every bounded linear operator into another locally convex space is necessarily continuous. 
That is, a locally convex TVS formula_2 is a bornological space if and only if for every locally convex TVS formula_28 a linear operator formula_19 is continuous if and only if it is bounded.

Every normed space is bornological.

===Characterizations of bounded linear operators===

Let formula_19 be a linear operator between topological vector spaces (not necessarily Hausdorff). 
The following are equivalent:
#formula_29 is (locally) bounded;
#(Definition): formula_29 maps bounded subsets of its domain to bounded subsets of its codomain;
#formula_29 maps bounded subsets of its domain to bounded subsets of its image formula_37;
#formula_29 maps every null sequence to a bounded sequence;
#* A &quot;null sequence&quot; is by definition a sequence that converges to the origin.
#* Thus any linear map that is sequentially continuous at the origin is necessarily a bounded linear map.
#formula_29 maps every Mackey convergent null sequence to a bounded subset of formula_5
#* A sequence formula_41 is said to be &quot;Mackey convergent to the origin in formula_2&quot; if there exists a divergent sequence formula_43 of positive real number such that formula_44 is a bounded subset of formula_45

if formula_2 and formula_3 are locally convex then the following may be add to this list:
if formula_2 is a bornological space and formula_3 is locally convex then the following may be added to this list:
==Examples==

===Unbounded linear operators===

Let formula_2 be the space of all trigonometric polynomials on formula_51 with the norm 

formula_52

The operator formula_53 that maps a polynomial to its derivative is not bounded. Indeed, for formula_54 with formula_55 we have formula_56 while formula_57 as formula_58 so formula_8 is not bounded.

===Properties of the space of bounded linear operators===
The space of all bounded linear operators from formula_2 to formula_3 is denoted by formula_62.
* formula_62 is a normed vector space.
* If formula_3 is Banach, then so is formula_62; in particular, dual spaces are Banach.
* For any formula_66 the kernel of formula_67 is a closed linear subspace of formula_2.
* If formula_62 is Banach and formula_2 is nontrivial, then formula_3 is Banach.

<text>In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the von Neumann bicommutant theorem relates the closure of a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space in certain topologies to the bicommutant of that set. In essence, it is a connection between the algebraic and topological sides of operator theory.

The formal statement of the theorem is as follows:

:Von Neumann bicommutant theorem. Let be an algebra consisting of bounded operators on a Hilbert space , containing the identity operator, and closed under taking adjoints. Then the closures of in the weak operator topology and the strong operator topology are equal, and are in turn equal to the bicommutant of . 

This algebra is called the von Neumann algebra generated by .

There are several other topologies on the space of bounded operators, and one can ask what are the *-algebras closed in these topologies. If is closed in the norm topology then it is a C*-algebra, but not necessarily a von Neumann algebra. One such example is the C*-algebra of compact operators (on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space). For most other common topologies the closed *-algebras containing 1 are von Neumann algebras; this applies in particular to the weak operator, strong operator, *-strong operator, ultraweak, ultrastrong, and *-ultrastrong topologies.
It is related to the Jacobson density theorem.

== Proof ==
Let be a Hilbert space and the bounded operators on . Consider a self-adjoint unital subalgebra of (this means that contains the adjoints of its members, and the identity operator on ).

The theorem is equivalent to the combination of the following three statements:

:(i) 
:(ii) 
:(iii) 

where the and subscripts stand for closures in the weak and strong operator topologies, respectively.

===Proof of (i)===
For any and in , the map &quot;T&quot; → &lt;&quot;Tx&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&gt; is continuous in the weak operator topology, by its definition. Therefore, for any fixed operator , so is the map

:formula_1

Let &quot;S&quot; be any subset of , and &quot;S&quot;′ its commutant. For any operator in &quot;S&quot;′, this function is zero for all &quot;O&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. For any not in &quot;S&quot;′, it must be nonzero for some &quot;O&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and some &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in . By its continuity there is an open neighborhood of for the weak operator topology on which it is nonzero, and which therefore is also not in &quot;S&quot;′. Hence any commutant &quot;S&quot;′ is closed in the weak operator topology. In particular, so is ; since it contains , it also contains its weak operator closure.

===Proof of (ii)===
This follows directly from the weak operator topology being coarser than the strong operator topology: for every point in , every open neighborhood of in the weak operator topology is also open in the strong operator topology and therefore contains a member of ; therefore is also a member of .

===Proof of (iii)===
Fix . We must show that , i.e. for each &quot;h&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot; and any , there exists &quot;T&quot; in with .

Fix &quot;h&quot; in . The cyclic subspace } is invariant under the action of any &quot;T&quot; in . Its closure in the norm of &quot;H&quot; is a closed linear subspace, with corresponding orthogonal projection : &quot;H&quot; → in &quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;). In fact, this &quot;P&quot; is in , as we now show.

:Lemma. .

:Proof. Fix . As , it is the limit of a sequence with in . For any , is also in , and by the continuity of , this sequence converges to . So , and hence &quot;PTPx&quot; = &quot;TPx&quot;. Since &quot;x&quot; was arbitrary, we have &quot;PTP&quot; = &quot;TP&quot; for all in . 

:Since is closed under the adjoint operation and &quot;P&quot; is self-adjoint, for any we have

::formula_2

:So &quot;TP&quot; = &quot;PT&quot; for all , meaning &quot;P&quot; lies in .

By definition of the bicommutant, we must have &quot;XP&quot; = &quot;PX&quot;. Since is unital, , and so . Hence . So for each , there exists &quot;T&quot; in with , i.e. is in the strong operator closure of .

=== Non-unital case ===
A C*-algebra acting on H is said to act &quot;non-degenerately&quot; if for &quot;h&quot; in , implies . In this case, it can be shown using an approximate identity in that the identity operator &quot;I&quot; lies in the strong closure of . Therefore, the conclusion of the bicommutant theorem holds for .

<text>In algebra, the bicommutant of a subset &quot;S&quot; of a semigroup (such as an algebra or a group) is the commutant of the commutant of that subset. It is also known as the double commutant or second commutant and is written formula_1.

The bicommutant is particularly useful in operator theory, due to the von Neumann double commutant theorem, which relates the algebraic and analytic structures of operator algebras. Specifically, it shows that if &quot;M&quot; is a unital, self-adjoint operator algebra in the C*-algebra &quot;B(H)&quot;, for some Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, then the weak closure, strong closure and bicommutant of &quot;M&quot; are equal. This tells us that a unital C*-subalgebra &quot;M&quot; of &quot;B(H)&quot; is a von Neumann algebra if, and only if, formula_2, and that if not, the von Neumann algebra it generates is formula_3.

The bicommutant of &quot;S&quot; always contains &quot;S&quot;. So formula_4. On the other hand, formula_5. So formula_6, i.e. the commutant of the bicommutant of &quot;S&quot; is equal to the commutant of &quot;S&quot;. By induction, we have:

:formula_7

and

:formula_8

for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.

It is clear that, if &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2 are subsets of a semigroup,

If it is assumed that formula_10 and formula_11 (this is the case, for instance, for von Neumann algebras), then the above equality gives

<text>The grey shrikethrush or grey shrike-thrush (Colluricincla harmonica), formerly commonly known as grey thrush, is a songbird of Australasia. It is moderately common to common in most parts of Australia, but absent from the driest of the inland deserts. It is also found in New Guinea.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The grey shrikethrush was originally described in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;. Alternate names include the brown shrike-thrush, buff-bellied shrike-thrush, grey shrike-flycatcher, northern shrike-thrush and south-western shrike-thrush.

===Subspecies===
Five subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;C. h. brunnea&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in northern Australia and Melville Island
* &quot;C. h. superciliosa&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in eastern New Guinea, islands in the Torres Strait and north-eastern Australia
* &quot;C. h. harmonica&quot; - : Found in eastern Australia
* &quot;C. h. strigata&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in Tasmania and the islands in the Bass Strait (Australia)
* Western shrikethrush (&quot;C. h. rufiventris&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in western, southern and central Australia

==Description==
Of medium size (about long) and lacking bright colours, the grey shrikethrush—usually just &quot;thrush&quot; in casual conversation—has an extraordinary gift for ringing melody, unmatched by any other Australasian species save perhaps the two lyrebirds and its northern relative, the sandstone shrikethrush.

==Status==
The grey shrikethrush is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<text>Leh () is a city in Indian-administered Ladakh in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the largest city and the joint capital of Ladakh. It is the capital of Ladakh since the Medieval Period. Leh, located in the Leh district, was also the historical capital of the Kingdom of Ladakh. The seat of the kingdom, Leh Palace, the former residence of the royal family of Ladakh, was built in the same style and about the same time as the Potala Palace in Tibet. Since they were both constructed in a similar style and at roughly the same time, the Potala Palace in Tibet and Leh Palace, the royal residence, are frequently contrasted. Leh is at an altitude of , and is connected via National Highway 1 to Srinagar in the southwest and to Manali in the south via the Leh-Manali Highway (part of National Highway 3).

==Etymology==
==History==

Leh was for centuries an important stopover on trade routes along the Indus Valley between Tibet, Kashmir, India and China. The main goods carried were salt, grain, &quot;pashm&quot; or cashmere wool, &quot;charas&quot; or cannabis resin from the Tarim Basin, indigo, silk yarn and Banaras brocade.

Although there are a few indications that the Chinese knew of a trade route through Ladakh to India as early as the Kushan period (1st to 3rd centuries AD), and certainly by the Tang dynasty, little is actually known of the history of the region before the end of the 10th century, when Tibetan prince &quot;Skyid lde nyima gon&quot; (or Nyima gon), a grandson of the anti-Buddhist Tibetan king, Langdarma (r. c. 838 to 841), founded the kingdom. He conquered Western Tibet, although his army originally numbered only 300 men. Several towns and castles are said to have been founded by Nyima gon, and he apparently ordered the construction of the primary sculptures at Shey. &quot;In an inscription, he says he had them made for the religious benefit of the &quot;Tsanpo&quot; (the dynastical name of his father and ancestors), and of all the people of &quot;Ngaris&quot; (Western Tibet). This shows that already in this generation Langdarma&#x27;s opposition to Buddhism had disappeared.&quot; Shey, 15 km east of modern Leh, was the ancient seat of the Ladakhi kings.

During the reign of Delegs Namgyal (1660–1685), the nawab of Kashmir, then a province in the Mughal Empire, arranged for the Mongol army to temporarily leave Ladakh, though it returned later. As payment for assisting Delegs Namgyal in the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal War of 1679–1684, the nawab made a number of onerous demands. One of the least was construction of a large Sunni Muslim mosque in Leh, at the upper end of the bazaar in Leh below Leh Palace. The mosque reflects a mixture of Islamic and Tibetan architecture and can accommodate more than 500 people. This was apparently not the first mosque in Leh; there are two smaller ones that are said to be older.

Trade routes have traditionally converged on Leh from all four directions. The modern-day highway follows the most direct route from the Punjab via Mandi, the Kulu valley, the Rohtang Pass, and Lahaul to the Indus Valley, then downriver to Leh. The route from Srinagar was roughly the same as the road that today crosses the &quot;Zoji La&quot; (pass) to Kargil, then up the Indus Valley to Leh. From Baltistan there were two difficult routes: the main one ran up the Shyok Valley from the Indus, over a pass and then down the Hanu River to the Indus again below Khalsi (Khalatse). The other ran from Skardu straight up the Indus to Kargil and on to Leh. Both summer and winter routes ran from Leh to Yarkand via the Karakoram Pass and Xaidulla. A couple of possible routes also ran from Leh to Lhasa.

The first recorded royal residence in Ladakh, built at the top of the high Namgyal (&#x27;Victory&#x27;) Peak overlooking the present palace and town, is the now-ruined fort and &quot;gon-khang&quot; (Temple of the Guardian Divinities) built by King Tashi Namgyal. Tashi Namgyal ruled in the final quarter of the 16th century CE. The Namgyal (also called &quot;Tsemo Gompa&quot; (Red Gompa), or &quot;dGon-pa-so-ma&quot; (New Monastery), a temple, is the main Buddhist centre in Leh. There are some older walls of fortifications behind it which Francke reported were once known as the &quot;Dard Castle.&quot; If it was indeed built by Dards, it must pre-date the establishment of Tibetan rulers in Ladakh over a thousand years ago.
The Sankar Labrang (Bsam dkar bla brang) is a small, two-storeyed building owned by Sankar monastery. Sankar monastery is the seat of Bakula Rinpoche, immediately to the northwest of Leh. The monastery&#x27;s Labrang building is located in the old town of Leh, in the Manikhang neighbourhood. Manikhang is the area between the main bazaar of Leh and the historic Stalam path that leads up to the royal palace. Four huge &quot;stūpas&quot; standing at this point mark the beginning of historic Leh. In recent memory, the Sankar Labrang had a metalsmith&#x27;s workshop downstairs, while upstairs lived the monk caretaker of the White Maitreya Temple (Byams khang dkar po), also known locally as &quot;Street Maitreya&quot;. The White Maitreya Temple dates back to the reign of King Drakpa Bumd´e (Grags pa &#x27;bum lde, r. ca 1410–1435), following the arrival of a mission sent to Ladakh by the Tibetan lama Tsongkhapa.
Below this are the Chamba (Byams-pa, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Maitreya) and Chenresi (sPyan-ras-gzigs, i.e. Avalokiteshvara) monasteries which are of uncertain date.

===Leh Palace===

The royal palace, known as Leh Palace, was built by King Sengge Namgyal (1612–1642), presumably between the period when the Portuguese Jesuit priest Francisco de Azevedo visited Leh in 1631, and made no mention of it, and Sengge Namgyal&#x27;s death in 1642.

The Leh Palace is nine storeys high; the upper floors accommodated the royal family, and the stables and storerooms are located on the lower floors. The palace was abandoned when Kashmiri forces besieged it in the mid-19th century. The royal family moved their premises south to their current home in Stok Palace on the southern bank of the Indus River.

:As has already been mentioned, the original name of the town was not &quot;sLel&quot;, as it is nowadays spelled, but &quot;sLes&quot;, which signifies an &quot;encampment of nomads&quot;. These [Tibetan] nomads probably visited the Leh valley at when it began to be irrigated by Dard colonisers. The most ancient part of the ruins, atop rNam-rgyal-rtse-mo hill, are called &#x27;aBrog-pal-mkhar (Dard castle).

In 2010, Leh was heavily damaged by the sudden floods caused by a cloud burst.

==Administration==
The Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) is in charge of governance in Leh.

It has 30 councillors, 4 nominated and 26 elected. The Chief Executive Councillor heads and chairs this council. The Deputy Commissioner of Leh also holds the power of chief executive officer of the LAHDC. The current Deputy Commissioner of Leh district is Santosh Sukhdeve. 

==Leh Old Town==

The old town of Leh was added to the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s list of 100 most endangered sites due to increased rainfall, due to climate change among other reasons. Neglect and changing settlement patterns in the old town have also threatened the long-term preservation of the site.

The rapid and poorly planned urbanisation of Leh has increased the risk of flash floods in some areas, while other areas, according to research by the Climate and Development Knowledge Network, suffer from the less dramatic, gradual effects of &#x27;invisible disasters&#x27;, which often go unreported.

==Geography==

The city is located on the bank of the Indus River. The mountains dominate the landscape around the Leh, as it is at an altitude of . Peaks such as Nanga Sago can reach well above . The principal access roads include the Srinagar-Leh highway and the Leh-Manali Highway. Both roads are only open on a seasonal basis. Although the roads from Srinagar and Manali are often blocked by snow in winter, the local roads in the Indus Valley usually remain open due to the low levels of snowfall.
===Climate===

Leh has a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;) with long, cold winters from late November to early March, with minimum temperatures well below freezing for most of the winter. The city gets occasional snowfall during winter, which is very cold by Indian standards, mainly due to its high elevation. The weather in the remaining months is generally fine and warm during the day. Average annual rainfall is only 35 mm (1.37 inches). In 2010, the city experienced flash floods that killed more than 100 people.

==Agriculture==

Leh is located at an average elevation of about 3500 metres, which means that only one crop a year can be grown there, while two can be grown at Khalatse. By the time crops are being sown at Leh in late May, they are already half-grown at Khalatse. The main crop is &quot;grim&quot; (naked barley, &quot;Hordeum vulgare&quot; L. var. &quot;nudum&quot; Hook. f., an ancient form of domesticated barley with an easier-to-remove hull. Tsampa, the staple food in Ladakh, is made from this barley. The water for agriculture of Ladakh comes from the Indus, which runs low in March and April when barley-fields have the greatest need for irrigation. Grapes, apricots, currants, walnuts, and apples are also grown in the arid temperate climate.

==Demographics==

As of the 2011 India census, Leh had a population of 30,870. Males constituted 70% of the population and females 30%, due to a large presence of transient labourers, traders and government employees. The child sex ratio was 987. Leh had an average literacy rate of 90%, higher than the national average of 74.04%; male literacy was 94.89%, and female literacy was 78.85%. In Leh, 5.5% of the population was under 6 years of age. The people of Leh are ethnic Tibetans who speak
Ladakhi, a Tibetic language.

The Muslim presence dates back to the annexation of Ladakh by Kashmir, after the Fifth Dalai Lama came to Ladakh from Tibet. Since then, there has been further migration from the Kashmir Valley, due to trade and recently to the transfer of tourism from the Kashmir Valley to Ladakh.

Ladakh receives very large numbers of tourists for its size. In 2010, 77,800 tourists visited Leh. Visitor numbers have swelled rapidly in recent years, increasing 77% from 2005 to 2010. This growth is largely caused by an increase in domestic Indian travellers.

===Religion===
Buddhism is the largest religion in Leh, followed by over 43.8% of people. Hinduism is the second-largest religion with 35.4% adherents. Islam and Sikhism form 15.14% and 2.7% of the population respectively.
Since the 8th century, people of different religions, particularly Buddhism and Islam, have lived in Leh. They co-inhabited the region from the early Namgyal dynasty and there are no records of any conflict between them. Meer Izzut-oollah wrote in the early 19th century:

This mosque was built by Ibraheem Khan (in the mid 17th century), who was a man of noble family in the service of the descendants of Timoor. In his time the Kalimaks (Calmuck Tartars), having invaded and obtained possession of the greater portion of Thibet [Ladakh], the Raja of that country claimed protection from the Emperor of Hindoostan. Ibraheem Khan was accordingly deputed by that monarch to his assistance, and in a short time succeeded in expelling the invaders and placing the Raja once more on his throne. The Raja embraced the Mahomedan faith, and formally acknowledged himself as a feudatory of the Emperor, who honored him with the title of Raja Akibut Muhmood Khan, which title to the present day is borne by the Ruler of Cashmere.

In recent times, Muslim migration to Leh from neighbouring Kargil and Kashmir has increased due to better opportunities, and relations between the Buddhist and Muslim communities have soured due to socio-political conflicts.

Other religions such as Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism do exist in Leh. The small Christian community in Leh descend from Tibetan Buddhists converted by German Moravian missionaries, who established a church at Keylong in Lahaul in the 1860s, and were allowed to open another mission in Leh in 1885 and had a sub-branch in Khalatse. They stayed until Indian Independence in 1947. In spite of their successful medical and educational activities, they were able to make only a few converts.

Every year Sindhu Darshan Festival is held at Shey, 15 km from town, to promote religious harmony and the glory of the &quot;Sindhu&quot; river. Many tourists come to Leh for this.

==Transportation==

===Road===
Leh is connected to the rest of India by two high-altitude roads, both of which are subject to landslides and impassable in winter due to snows. The National Highway 1 from Srinagar via Kargil is generally open longer. The Leh-Manali Highway can be troublesome due to very high passes and plateaus. A third road is under construction.

*National Highway 1
The overland approach to Ladakh from the Kashmir valley via the 434-km. National Highway 1 typically remains open for traffic from April/May to October/November. The most dramatic part of this journey is the ascent up the Zoji-la, a tortuous pass in the Great Himalayan Wall. The Jammu and Kashmir State Road Transport Corporation (JKSRTC) operates regular deluxe and ordinary bus services between Srinagar and Leh on this route, with an overnight halt at Kargil. Taxis (cars and jeeps) are also available at Srinagar for the journey.

*National Highway 3 or Leh-Manali Highway
Since 1989, the Leh-Manali Highway has served as the second land approach to Ladakh. Open from June to late October, this high road traverses the upland desert plateaux of Rupsho, whose altitude ranges from to . There are a number of high passes en route among which the highest one, known as Tanglang La, is sometimes incorrectly claimed to be the world&#x27;s second-highest motorable pass at an altitude of 

*Nimmu–Padam–Darcha road
As of 2024, this third road to Leh is currently under construction.

===Air===

Leh Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport has flights to and from Delhi, Jammu, Srinagar and Chandigarh. Air India, SpiceJet, IndiGo &amp; Vistara operate Delhi to Leh daily with multiple flights at peak times.

===Rail===
There is currently no railway service in Ladakh, however two railway routes are proposed: the Bhanupli–Leh line and Srinagar–Kargil–Leh line.

==Banking facilities==

*State Bank of India, Leh
*HDFC Bank, Leh
*Axis Bank, Leh
*IDBI Bank, Leh

==Media and communications==
State-owned All India Radio Leh has a local station in Leh, which transmits various programs of mass interest. Leh head post office owned by India Post also serves as a major means of communications. On 14 December 2021, the first FM radio station in Ladakh was established in Leh making the total FM stations 4 and one medium wave station as of February 2024.

<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, an operator algebra is an algebra of continuous linear operators on a topological vector space, with the multiplication given by the composition of mappings.

The results obtained in the study of operator algebras are often phrased in algebraic terms, while the techniques used are often highly analytic. Although the study of operator algebras is usually classified as a branch of functional analysis, it has direct applications to representation theory, differential geometry, quantum statistical mechanics, quantum information, and quantum field theory.

==Overview==

Operator algebras can be used to study arbitrary sets of operators with little algebraic relation &quot;simultaneously&quot;. From this point of view, operator algebras can be regarded as a generalization of spectral theory of a single operator. In general, operator algebras are non-commutative rings.

An operator algebra is typically required to be closed in a specified operator topology inside the whole algebra of continuous linear operators. In particular, it is a set of operators with both algebraic and topological closure properties. In some disciplines such properties are axiomatized and algebras with certain topological structure become the subject of the research.

Though algebras of operators are studied in various contexts (for example, algebras of pseudo-differential operators acting on spaces of distributions), the term &quot;operator algebra&quot; is usually used in reference to algebras of bounded operators on a Banach space or, even more specially in reference to algebras of operators on a separable Hilbert space, endowed with the operator norm topology.

In the case of operators on a Hilbert space, the Hermitian adjoint map on operators gives a natural involution, which provides an additional algebraic structure that can be imposed on the algebra. In this context, the best studied examples are self-adjoint operator algebras, meaning that they are closed under taking adjoints. These include C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, and AW*-algebras. C*-algebras can be easily characterized abstractly by a condition relating the norm, involution and multiplication. Such abstractly defined C*-algebras can be identified to a certain closed subalgebra of the algebra of the continuous linear operators on a suitable Hilbert space. A similar result holds for von Neumann algebras.

Commutative self-adjoint operator algebras can be regarded as the algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on a locally compact space, or that of measurable functions on a standard measurable space. Thus, general operator algebras are often regarded as a noncommutative generalizations of these algebras, or the structure of the &quot;base space&quot; on which the functions are defined. This point of view is elaborated as the philosophy of noncommutative geometry, which tries to study various non-classical and/or pathological objects by noncommutative operator algebras.

Examples of operator algebras that are not self-adjoint include:
*nest algebras,
*many commutative subspace lattice algebras,
*many limit algebras.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney PW2000, also known by the military designation F117 and initially referred to as the JT10D, is a series of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines with a thrust range from . Built by Pratt &amp; Whitney, they were designed for the Boeing 757. As a 757 powerplant, these engines compete with the Rolls-Royce RB211.

==Design and development==

Pratt &amp; Whitney began working on the JT10D in October 1971 intended for the McDonnell Douglas YC-15 into the Advanced Medium STOL Transport project and the Boeing 767, then code named 7X7, which first ran in August 1974. In December 1980, Pratt &amp; Whitney changed to a new naming system for its engines and the JT10D became the PW2037.

The PW2000 is a dual-spool, axial air flow, annular combustion, high bypass turbofan with a dual-channel full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. It was certified in 1984 as the first civilian FADEC-controlled aviation engine.

MTU Aero Engines holds a 21.2% stake in the engine project, having developed the low-pressure turbine and turbine exit casing as well as producing critical parts of the low-pressure turbine, the turbine exhaust casing, high-pressure compressor and high-pressure turbine components.

The first PW2000 series engine, the PW2037, powered the Boeing 757-200 and entered service with Delta Air Lines as the launch customer for the civil aviation version of the engine.

Other than the 757, the PW2000 series engines also power the C-17 Globemaster III military transport; the United States Department of Defense designation for the engine is F117, with the specific variant used on the C-17 being the F117-PW-100. The powerplant first flew on the C-17 in 1991. Still maintaining the F117 engine for the U.S. military, Pratt &amp; Whitney received a $5.5 billion contract modification in June 2023 for engine sustainment in San Francisco, California; Columbus, Georgia; and Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, through September 2027.

The PW2000 also powered the abortive Ilyushin Il-96M; the engine first flew on the Il-96M in 1993.

On October 16, 2008 the NTSB recommended that the FAA issue urgent new inspection procedures on the PW2037 model of the engine, following an uncontained turbine failure event in August 2008. The NTSB recommended that the FAA order PW2037 engines inspected beyond a threshold of flight hours or flight cycles less than that of the event engine, and be reinspected at regular intervals.

The latest build standard, named PW2043, launched in 1994. It provides over of thrust. Previous generations of engines can be converted to the PW2043 version.

<doc id="455990" wikidata="Q7689423" url="?curid=455990" title="Tax cut">
<text>A tax cut typically represents a decrease in the amount of money taken from taxpayers to go towards government revenue. This decreases the revenue of the government and increases the disposable income of taxpayers. Tax rate cuts usually refer to reductions in the percentage of tax paid on income, goods and services. As they leave consumers with more disposable income, tax cuts are an example of an expansionary fiscal policy. Tax cuts also include reduction in tax in other ways, such as tax credit, deductions and loopholes.

However, sometimes a tax cut can increase tax revenue, as economist Thomas Sowell explains:
:&quot;What actually followed the cuts in tax rates in the 1920s were rising output, rising employment to produce that output, rising incomes as a result and rising tax revenues for the government because of the rising incomes, even though the tax rates had been lowered.&quot;

How a tax cut affects the economy depends on which tax is cut. Policies that increase disposable income for lower- and middle-income households are more likely to increase overall consumption and &quot;hence stimulate the economy&quot;. Tax cuts in isolation boost the economy because they increase government borrowing. However, they are often accompanied by spending cuts or changes in monetary policy that can offset their stimulative effects. 

==Types==
Tax cuts are typically cuts in the tax rate. However, other tax changes that reduce the amount of tax can be seen as tax cuts. These include deductions, credits, exemptions, and adjustments. Additionally, adjusting tax brackets may indirectly reduce the amount of income that is subjected to higher tax rates.
== Effects ==

Since a tax cut represents a decrease in the amount of tax a taxpayer is obliged to pay, it results in an increase in disposable income. This greater income can then be used to purchase additional goods and services that otherwise would not have been possible.

Tax cuts result in workers being better off financially. With more money to spend, we would expect to see consumer spending to increase. Consumer spending is a large component of aggregate demand. This increase in aggregate demand can lead to an increase in economic growth, if other factors hold even. Thus, income tax cuts increase the after-tax rewards of working, saving, and investing, increasing work effort and leading to contributing to economic growth.

If tax cuts are not financed by immediate spending cuts, there is a chance that they can lead to an increase in the national deficit, which can hinder economic growth in the long-term from increases in interest rates hindering investment. It also decreases national saving, and therefore decreases the national capital stock and income for future generations. For this reason, the structure of the tax cut and the way it is financed is crucial for achieving economic growth.

=== Supply-side tax cut ===
Supply-side tax cuts are designed to stimulate capital formation by lowering the price level of a good and therefore increasing the demand for the good. Aggregate supply and aggregate demand will be shifted as a result.

=== Corporate income tax cut ===
Corporate income tax cuts generate sustained effects on research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures, productivity, and output, therefore increasing GDP. To evaluate the impact of appointed tax policy, studying R&amp;D expenditure and technological adoption are crucial.

=== Personal income tax cut ===
Personal income tax cuts only lead to a momentary boost to GDP and productivity, having no long-term effect on the GDP as they trigger extensive but short-lived response of capital expenditure, productivity and output. The key to evaluating the effect of personal income tax cut is the variable of labor utilization.

=== Value-added Tax ===
Value-added tax (VAT) is a general, broadly based consumption tax assessed on the value added to goods and services collected fractionally.

Cutting VAT can have significant repercussions on a country&#x27;s economy. While it may stimulate short-term consumer spending and encourage business investment, there are trade-offs. Lower VAT rates reduce immediate government revenue, potentially impacting public services and infrastructure. However, if managed well, such cuts can contribute to long-term economic growth and fiscal stability. Policymakers must carefully balance the benefits of VAT reduction with the need for sustainable revenue collection.

One notable example of a focused VAT cut occurred in the UK during the pandemic. The standard rate of VAT dropped from 20% to 5%, specifically applying to the hospitality sector. This reduction aimed to support struggling businesses and boost consumer spending. However, it&#x27;s essential to recognize that the main drawback of a VAT reduction lies in the fact that suppliers are not obligated to pass those savings directly to consumers. Therefore, while a VAT cut may create a small hole in overall VAT revenue, its impact on prices remains uncertain. EU regulations also allow for reduced VAT rates, but several countries have maintained VAT levels above the minimum thresholds.

== Costs and Benefits Study ==
The working paper from 2017 for IMF listed three major factors regarding the effects of tax cuts:

1.     &quot;The tax cuts can boost the economy in the short term; however, these effects are never strong enough to prevent loss of revenue.&quot;

Any tax cuts will significantly reduce tax revenues in the first place. The growing tax revenue from economic growth will never fully offset this fact. Thus, the gap needs to be compensated and financed by an increase in public debt, raising other taxes, or cutting spending. Usually, cuts in income tax are compensated by an increase in consumption taxes, but there are several ways a government may compensate for tax cuts:

a)     By spending cuts

The final equity and change in aggregate demand will be equal to zero as some individuals will be better of from tax cuts while others will have to cut their spending as the government decreases welfare payments. At the end of the day, there is no change in overall welfare circulating in the economy.

b)    By government borrowing

The government may compensate for the loss in revenue by borrowing money and issuing bonds. The overall result of this type of compensation may vary based on the situation of the economy. In a recession, borrowing would probably result in higher aggregate demand. In the boom, the borrowing may result in crowding out – a situation in which the private sector has fewer finances for their investments as they buy the bonds.

c)     By cutting taxes in boom

Chancellor Nigel Lawson&#x27;s tax cuts in 1988 occurred during a period of economic growth. These taxes led to a further increase in economic growth, however, also led to an increase of inflation causing a boom-and-bust cycle.

d)    By improved productivity

If the tax cuts leads to a more productive economy, the tax revenue may counterintuitively stabilize following tax cuts, given that the economy grows in a stable manner for a few years.

2.     &quot;The tax cuts may help low-income groups even if they do not get the tax cuts directly.&quot;

When the middle or upper class receives tax cuts, they often spend more money on the services which are provided by low-income individuals. On average, wealthier people tend to spend proportionally more of their income on services. With tax cuts, the expenditures of wealthier people increase together with the demand for services.

3.     &quot;There is a tradeoff between growth and income inequality depending on what classes receive tax cuts.&quot;

Even though upper class tax cuts may increase demand for services from the lower class, income inequality and polarization tend to increase. Income tax credits for the lower class do not make as large of an impact on the income gap as tax cuts for the upper class. On the other hand, targeting the middle class with tax cuts reduces income inequality and polarization but may provide lower dividends from growth.

== Countries ==

=== United States ===
Notable examples of tax cuts in the United States include:
*The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 lowered the corporate tax rate to 20%, while also lowering income tax rates, among other changes.
*The 2008 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included a tax credit of $400, lower payroll tax rates, and higher earned income tax credits.
* The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 reduced business and investment taxes.
Tax policy varies from president to often propose tax changes, but Congress passes legislation that may or may not reflect those proposals.

==== John F. Kennedy ====

John F. Kennedy&#x27;s plan was to lower the top rate from 91% to 65%, however, he was assassinated before implementing the change.

==== Lyndon B. Johnson ====
Lyndon B. Johnson supported Kennedy&#x27;s ideas and lowered the top income tax rate from 91% to 70%. He reduced the corporate tax rate from 52% to 48%. Federal tax revenue increased from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968.

==== Ronald Reagan ====

Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policies included tax reforms. His administration implemented two significant tax acts. First, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) was implemented to stimulate economic growth, incentivize investment, and reduce the tax burden on individuals and businesses. Key provisions included lowering the highest personal income tax rate from 70% to 50%, and lowering the capital gains tax rate from 28% to 20%. The ERTA decreased federal revenue initially. Following the ERTA was the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA). The TRA built upon the ERTA, further reshaping the tax code with tax cuts. The highest personal income tax rate was reduced to 38.5% initially and eventually to 28%. The corporate tax rate also decreased, benefiting businesses. In 1988, Reagan cut the corporate tax rate from 48% to 34%. The TRA simplified the tax structure by reducing the number of brackets. While the TRA aimed for efficiency and fairness, it did not fully offset the revenue losses from previous tax cuts.

The 1980s witnessed economic expansion, often referred to as the &quot;Reagan boom&quot;. In 1983, 1984, and 1985, the GDP grew by 4.6, 7.2, and 4.2% respectively.

While the tax cuts contributed to this growth, other factors, such as Federal Reserve actions, increased federal spending, and business investment, also played roles. The tax cuts worsened budget deficits in the short term, but the economic expansion eventually lead to lower deficits. After peaking in 1986, the federal deficit gradually declined by 1989.

==== George W. Bush ====

George W. Bush&#x27;s tax cuts were implemented to stop the 2001 recession. They reduced the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%, the long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to 15%, and the top dividend tax rate from 38.6% to 15%.

Although these tax cuts boosted the economy, these tax cuts increased the U.S. debt by $1.35 trillion over a 10-year period. These tax cuts primarily targeted high-income individuals. 

==== Barack Obama ====

Barack Obama arranged for several tax cuts to defeat the Great Recession.

The $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 promised $288 billion in tax cuts and incentives. Its taxation aspects included a payroll tax cut of 2%, health care tax credits, a $400 reduction in income taxes for individuals and improvements to child tax credits and earned income tax credits.

To prevent the fiscal cliff in 2013, Obama extended the Bush tax cuts on incomes below $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples. Incomes exceeding the threshold were taxed at the rate of 39.6% (the Clinton-era tax rate), following the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

==== Donald Trump ====

Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.

Other changes included income tax rate cuts, doubling of the standard deduction, capping the state and local tax deduction and eliminating personal exemptions.

GDP growth rate increased by 0.7% in 2018, however, in 2019 it fell below 2017. In 2020, GDP took a sharp downturn, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Joe Biden ====
Joe Biden has proposed several tax policies during his tenure. His 2025 budget includes tax breaks for millions of families, low-income workers, and senior citizens. One significant proposal is the revival of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC), which helped lift millions of children out of poverty during the pandemic. Under Biden&#x27;s plan, the expanded CTC would provide $3,000 per child six years and older and $3,600 for each child under six. Additionally, Biden supports continuing tax cuts for families making less than $400,000 but opposes extending tax cuts for higher earners. His goal is to pay for these tax breaks by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

=== United Kingdom ===

==== Margaret Thatcher ====
Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s policies included several tax cuts. Thatcher&#x27;s government significantly lowered income tax rates. The top rate reduced from 83% in 1979 to 40% by 1988. The basic rate also decreased from 33% to 25% during the same period. These cuts aimed to encourage work, entrepreneurship, and investment, ultimately stimulating economic growth. To offset the revenue loss from income tax cuts, Thatcher&#x27;s administration raised the VAT rate from 8% to 15%. The increased VAT became a crucial source of government revenue. The trade-off between income tax reduction and higher VAT sparked debates. Thatcher&#x27;s strategy also included tax cuts for corporations. By 1986, the rate had fallen to 35%, down from the 52% burden on businesses in the late 1970s. These cuts aimed to enhance the UK&#x27;s competitiveness, attract investment, and foster business growth. 

While the tax cuts spurred economic activity, critics argued that they disproportionately benefited the wealthy. Poverty rates increased during Thatcher&#x27;s tenure, with child poverty more than doubling.

=== Germany ===

==== Gerhard Schröder ====
During his tenure as Chancellor of Germany from 1998 to 2005, Gerhard Schröder implemented significant tax cut policies aimed at stimulating economic growth and improving the country&#x27;s competitiveness. One notable move was the acceleration of income tax reductions in 2004, which lowered income tax levels by 10%. This reduction left approximately €18 billion in federal, state, and local coffers. Schröder planned to pay for these tax cuts through a combination of measures: reducing subsidies, privatization revenues, and increasing state debt. His goal was to provide a signal of economic revival and boost consumer confidence. However, Schröder faced criticism and pressure to denounce his business and political ties to Russia, particularly in light of Moscow&#x27;s war in Ukraine. Despite the controversies, Schröder&#x27;s tax policies left a lasting impact on Germany&#x27;s fiscal landscape.

=== Argentina ===

==== Javier Milei ====
Javier Milei&#x27;s tax cut policies were aimed at transforming the country&#x27;s financial landscape. Milei proposed a tax reform known as the Ómnibus Law. One of its central tenets was the elimination of the maximum marginal tax rate. Over time, this would gradually reduce the tax burden for high-net-worth individuals, from 1.75% to 0.5% by 2027.

== Multiplier Effect ==

With cuts in tax rates, households have higher disposable income. Some of this disposable income is spent or invested, stimulating the economy. This phenomena is known as the multiplier effect. The effect represents the relation between the money spent on economic activity and the quantitative money reduction in taxes or an increase in government spending. &quot;The Fiscal Multiplier and Economic Policy Analysis in the United States&quot;, a 2015 study by J. Whalen and F. Reichling, focused on the short-term effects of tax cuts and the potential of the economy. The results showed that the tax cuts or spending increases are dependent on the economic situation. If the economy is close to its potential and the Federal Reserves were not affected by the zero interest rates, tax cuts had small short-run economic effects mostly because the fiscal stimulus was outperformed by interest rate hikes. On the other hand, if the economy performs further from the economic potential and is bounded by zero interest rates the effect of fiscal stimuli is much higher. Congressional Budget Office estimated that the weak economy&#x27;s multiplier effect potential is three times higher than the one of a strong economy. The study has mostly shown the uncertainty about fiscal policies. The study has shown the large differences between the low and high estimates of the multipliers effect of tax cuts. On the other hand, the study indicated that government spending is a more reliable form of fiscal policy than tax cuts.

== Tax Cuts and Productivity ==
The relation between the tax rate and government revenue is often depicted by the Laffer curve. Experience has shown that with a continuous increase in the tax rate, at one point, the tax revenues start to decrease. This phenomenon can be explained by a decrease in the willingness of individuals to work as the government takes away their money. The apex point of the parabola represents the revenue-maximizing point for the government. 

The Laffer curve is often criticized for its abstractness as it is in reality very difficult to find the revenue-maximizing point. It is hugely dependent on society and its tastes which is mostly fluid while the model simplifies the reality into general tax revenues and tax rates. It also considers the single tax rate and single labor supply. Furthermore, it does not take into account that tax revenues are not often a continuous function, although with higher tax rates people try to avoid taxes through tax avoidance and tax evasion. All these facts bring uncertainty into the position of the revenue-maximizing point. Nevertheless, the theoretical ground of the Laffer curve is often used as the justification for tax increases or decreases.

==Reasons==

Governments may cite several reasons for cutting taxes.

=== Fairness ===
To begin with, money belongs to the person who possesses it, particularly if they earned it. Reducing the amount of money that is taken by the government can be seen as increasing fairness. However, if tax cuts are financed by cutting government spending, it can be argued that this disproportionately disadvantages low-income earners, as cuts in spending will affect services used mostly by low-income earners, who pay proportionately less tax.

=== Tax Equity ===
There are two main concepts focused on equity in taxation - horizontal equity and vertical equity. The former focuses on the belief, that all individuals should be affected by the same tax burden. The latter highlights the importance of the equal relative tax burden, the so-called ability-to-pay principle resulting in the belief that those with higher income should be taxed more heavily.

=== Efficiency ===
Tax cuts can serve to increase efficiency in the market. Cutting taxes can lead to more efficient allocation of resources than would have been the case with higher taxes. Generally, private entities are more efficient with their spending than governments. Tax cuts allow private entities to use their money in a more efficient manner.

=== Incentives ===
High taxes generally discourage work and investment. When taxes reduce the return from working, it is not surprising that workers are less interested in working. Taxes on income create a wedge between what the employee keeps and what the employer pays. Higher taxes encourage employers to create fewer jobs than they would with lower taxes.

=== Tax burden ===
Tax burden refers to the indirect responsibility of paying taxes irrespective of the legal taxpayer. In the US, the overall tax burden in 2020 was equal to 16% of the total gross domestic product.

<doc id="455994" wikidata="Q6141561" url="?curid=455994" title="USS Tullibee (SS-284)">
<text>USS &quot;Tullibee&quot; (SS-284), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tullibee. Her keel was laid down on 1 April 1942 at Mare Island, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 11 November 1942 sponsored by Mrs. Kenneth C. Hurd; and commissioned on 15 February 1943, Commander Charles Frederic Brindupke in command.

&quot;Tullibee&quot; held shakedown training from 8–30 April 1943 and departed for Hawaii on 8 May. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 May and held further training exercises in Hawaiian waters. Numerous air fitting leaks developed, and she was docked for repairs twice. When this proved ineffective, the submarine entered the navy yard until 11 July.

&quot;Tullibee&quot; started her first war patrol on 19 July 1943. She was sunk by one of her own torpedoes on 26 March 1944 while on her fourth patrol. One crew member survived the sinking of &quot;Tullibee&quot;.

==First war patrol==
On 19 July, &quot;Tullibee&quot; got under way for the Western Caroline Islands and her first war patrol. On 28 July, she sighted a passenger-cargo ship, accompanied by an escort and an aircraft that prevented her attack. On 5 August, the submarine began patrolling the Saipan-Truk traffic lanes. Five days later, she sighted smoke on the horizon that proved to be three freighters with an escort. &quot;Tullibee&quot; closed the range to ; launched one torpedo at the ship on the right and three at the vessel on the left. As the submarine fired the first torpedo, a ship rammed her and bent her number one periscope. She went deep and was depth charged by the escort as the ships sped away. As the torpedoes had been set to run at a depth of – too deep for the draft of the largest target – none of the torpedoes exploded.

On 14 August, &quot;Tullibee&quot; sighted a convoy of three freighters with an escort and began an end-around run to get into good attack position. She launched a torpedo from a range of and went deep. It missed, and she returned to periscope depth to fire three torpedoes at the last ship. It apparently saw their wakes as it turned and combed them. The submarine again went deep. When she surfaced, the targets had escaped. On 22 August, &quot;Tullibee&quot; sighted a convoy of five ships escorted by two destroyers; closed to ; and launched three torpedoes at the nearest freighter. Two minutes later, she fired three more at another ship. As she went deep to avoid a destroyer heading her way, she heard one explosion. She soon heard the bursts of two more torpedo explosions, followed by breaking up noises. When she surfaced, she sighted over 1000 empty oil drums, but no ships. Postwar examination of Japanese records indicated that &quot;Tullibee&quot; had damaged one freighter and had sunk the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kaisho Maru&quot;. The patrol terminated when the submarine reached Midway Island on 6 September.

==Second war patrol==
On 28 September, &quot;Tullibee&quot; began her second war patrol. Her assigned area was in the East China Sea between the Ryukyu Islands and the China coast. On 4 October, she sighted a convoy of nine passenger-cargo ships with three destroyer escorts. The submarine pulled well ahead of the convoy and tracked them until the next morning. At 00:58, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a large freighter, with one hitting the target a minute later. Another spread of three from the bow tubes produced two hits on a heavily laden cargo ship. Minor explosions and breaking up noises began immediately as &quot;Chicago Maru&quot; sank. Twelve days later, &quot;Tullibee&quot; contacted a convoy of seven ships with three escorts that later separated into two groups; one hugging the China coast and the other heading for Pescadores Channel. She attacked the largest ship in the latter group with six torpedoes; one hit the target. The submarine began an end-around run and launched four torpedoes at another ship. Two torpedoes soon broached, and &quot;Tullibee&quot; broke off the attack. She went deep and rigged for silent running to evade the escorts. On 5 November, the submarine was running submerged near Okinoyerabu Shima when she sighted a large, three-story building on the island. She surfaced and fired 55 shells into the barracks before retiring at full speed. She began the voyage back to Hawaii the next day and reached Pearl Harbor, via Midway Island, on 16 November. Her official score for this patrol was one passenger-cargo ship sunk, a tanker damaged, and a passenger-cargo ship damaged.

==Third war patrol==
&quot;Tullibee&quot;″s third patrol was in a &quot;wolfpack&quot; with sister ships and . The trio sortied from Pearl Harbor on 14 December 1943 for the Mariana Islands to intercept enemy shipping plying between Truk and Japan. On 2 January 1944, &quot;Tullibee&quot; sighted a Japanese on the surface and launched four torpedoes at a range of . The enemy saw the wakes and combed the four of them as &quot;Tullibee&quot; was forced deep by an enemy floatplane that dropped six bombs.

On 19 January, &quot;Haddock&quot; reported that she had damaged the Japanese escort carrier , which limped to Saipan. &quot;Tullibee&quot; sighted the carrier there on 25 January, close ashore and well protected by escorts and aircraft. The submarine remained on station for several days awaiting an opportunity to sink the aircraft carrier. However, when she surfaced on 28 January, she learned that the carrier had slipped away. Three days later, the submarine made radar contact with two targets. She launched three torpedoes at what appeared to be a freighter and swung left to fire one at the escort. The first target, net tender &quot;Hiro Maru&quot;, took two hits and disintegrated in about one minute. The torpedo fired at the escort missed, and the submarine went deep to evade. &quot;Tullibee&quot; cleared the area the following day and returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 February.

==Fourth war patrol and loss==
On 5 March, &quot;Tullibee&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor to begin her fourth war patrol. Nine days later, she called at Midway Island to top off her fuel and then proceeded to her patrol area in the Palau Islands. She was scheduled to support aircraft carrier strikes against those islands on 30–31 March. On 25 March, &quot;Tullibee&quot; arrived on station and began patrolling. The next day, off the Palau Islands she made radar contact on a convoy consisting of a large passenger-cargo ship, two medium-sized freighters, a destroyer, and two other escorts. The submarine made several surface runs on the transport but kept losing her in rain squalls. &quot;Tullibee&quot; finally closed to and launched two torpedoes from her bow tubes at the target. About two minutes later, the submarine was rocked by a violent explosion. It was only learned after the war that &quot;Tullibee&quot;″s torpedo had run a circular course and she had sunk herself.

Gunner&#x27;s Mate Second Class Clifford Weldon Kuykendall, on the bridge at the time, was knocked unconscious and thrown into the water. When he regained consciousness, the submarine was gone. He heard voices in the water for about ten minutes before they stopped. The next day, he was picked up by Japanese destroyer &quot;Wakatake&quot;. Kuykendall survived as a prisoner of war and was released after V-J Day.

&quot;Tullibee&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service.

&quot;Tullibee&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 July 1944. As with other US submarines lost at sea, &quot;Tullibee&quot; was not decommissioned by the U.S. Navy and officially remains on &quot;Eternal Patrol&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Scamp&quot; (SS-277), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the scamp grouper, a member of the family Serranidae.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Scamp&quot;′s keel was laid down on 6 March 1942 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 20 July 1942, sponsored by Miss Katherine Eugenia McKee, and commissioned on 18 September 1942.

==Service history==
On 19 January 1943, after training from New London, Connecticut, &quot;Scamp&quot; set course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, via the Panama Canal. She arrived in Hawaii on 13 February 1943 and commenced final training in the local operating area.

===First war patrol===

&quot;Scamp&quot; began her first war patrol by departing Pearl Harbor on 1 March 1943. She stopped at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 5 March 1943, debarked her passenger, Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Jr., Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, fueled, and then headed for the coast of Honshū, Japan.

Her first two attacks on the Japanese were doomed to failure by the faulty magnetic exploders in her torpedoes. After the inactivating of the magnetic features on her remaining torpedoes, &quot;Scamp&quot; scored two hits, one on an unidentified ship on the night of 20 March 1943 and one which damaged the merchant ship &quot;Manju Maru&quot; early on the morning of 21 March 1943. The submarine stopped at Midway Atoll again on 26 March 1943 and returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 April 1943.

===Second war patrol===
&quot;Scamp&quot; put to sea again on 19 April 1943, bound for the Southwest Pacific. She took on fuel at Johnston Atoll, then slipped between the Marshall Islands and the Gilbert Islands to reconnoiter Ocean Island and Nauru Island. She completed this reconnaissance on 27 and 28 April 1943 and then shaped a course for the Bismarck Archipelago. She had to hold fire on each of her first three enemy contacts because they were hospital ships. However, on the afternoon of 28 May 1943, she succeeded in pumping three torpedoes into the converted seaplane tender , which already had been damaged in an attack by the submarine on 4 May 1943. &quot;Scamp&quot; evaded the Japanese escorts and came up to periscope depth to observe the results of her attack. &quot;Kamikawa Maru&quot; was down by the stern and loading men into boats. A little after midnight, &quot;Scamp&quot; finished off &quot;Kamikawa Maru&quot; with two more torpedoes. &quot;Scamp&quot; ended her second war patrol at Brisbane, Australia, on 4 June 1943.

===Third war patrol===

From Brisbane, &quot;Scamp&quot; departed on her third war patrol on 22 June 1943. She patrolled a scouting line off the Solomon Islands and north to the Bismarck Sea. She passed the Shortland Islands on 14 July 1943, and on 27 July 1943 encountered a Japanese convoy. During her approach, a Japanese destroyer passed over her and dropped two depth charges some distance from her. &quot;Scamp&quot; continued her approach and loosed a spread of six torpedoes at a Japanese tanker. She scored a hit but had to dive in order to escape the escorts. When she surfaced a little over an hour later, all Japanese ships were out of sight.

Continuing her patrol into the Bismarck Archipelago, &quot;Scamp&quot; patrolled to the southeast of Steffen Strait, between New Ireland and New Hanover. At 17:54 on 27 July 1943, the same day she had attacked the convoy, she sighted a submarine, which launched a torpedo at &quot;Scamp&quot;. &quot;Scamp&quot; went ahead full, crash-dived, and leveled off at , letting the torpedo pass above her. Less than ten minutes later, she returned to periscope depth to engage the Japanese submarine. At 18:12, she launched four torpedoes, and the Japanese submarine erupted in a tremendous explosion. At the time, Allied analysts believed that the submarine she sank was , but postwar analysis of Japanese records indicated that it instead was , which had sunk the disabled aircraft carrier and the destroyer during the Battle of Midway on 7 June 1942. On 8 August 1943, &quot;Scamp&quot; returned to Brisbane.

===Fourth war patrol===
After almost a month in port at Brisbane, &quot;Scamp&quot; stood out on her fourth war patrol. She again patrolled off the Solomon Islands and into the Bismarck Sea. On 18 September 1943, she attacked a Japanese three-ship convoy and crippled the 8,614-gross register ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Kansai Maru&quot;. Another ship changed course and avoided her torpedoes. &quot;Scamp&quot; passed close under the stricken &quot;Kansai Maru&quot;, trying to evade the Japanese escorts, and came under machine gun fire from &quot;Kansai Maru&quot;. She escaped the escorting Japanese destroyers, but lost the undamaged ship in a rain squall. She returned to finish off &quot;Kansai Maru&quot; late that night.

On the morning of 21 21 September 1943, &quot;Scamp&quot; happened upon a heavily guarded Japanese convoy and began to stalk it. After dark, she moved in, launched three torpedoes and heard two double explosions. Her second attack was foiled by a severe rain squall. However, &quot;Scamp&quot; hounded the convoy all through the day on 22 September 1943, and at around 03:00 on 23 September fired four torpedoes at the convoy. While still maneuvering to attack the convoy, she passed through the wreckage of &quot;Kansai Maru&quot; and came upon an empty boat containing the sunken ship&#x27;s logs and other documents. She took these on board and later turned them over to intelligence. &quot;Scamp&quot; made one more attempt on the convoy, but was driven off by Japanese planes and kept down by aerial bombs. On 24 September 1943, she was ordered to terminate her patrol, and she arrived at Brisbane on 1 October 1943.

===Fifth war patrol===

&quot;Scamp&quot; cleared port again on 22 October 1943 and began her fifth war patrol with a mission in support of the invasion of Treasury Island from 28 to 30 October 1943. From there, she moved to her patrol area, between Kavieng and Truk. On 4 November 1943, she launched three torpedoes at a passenger-cargo ship. One exploded prematurely, but one reached its mark. By the time of the explosion indicating success, &quot;Scamp&quot; was already in a dive evading a depth charge attack. On 10 November 1943, she disabled the 6,481-gross register ton merchant ship &quot;Tokyo Maru&quot;, then, after evading the escorts, fired three more torpedoes into the listing ship. At about 21:00, &quot;Scamp&quot; observed the Japanese towing away the crippled &quot;Tokyo Maru&quot;; later it was learned that &quot;Tokyo Maru&quot; sank before daybreak. On 12 November 1943, &quot;Scamp&quot; damaged the Japanese so severely that &quot;Agano&quot; remained in repair at Truk until Operation Hailstone, the American strike on Truk of 16–17 February 1944. On 18 November 1943, &quot;Scamp&quot; suffered minor shrapnel damage from two bombs dropped by a Japanese floatplane. On 26 November 1943, she returned to Brisbane.

===Sixth war patrol===
On 16 December 1943, &quot;Scamp&quot; left Brisbane and headed back to the Bismarck Archipelago for her sixth war patrol. On the night of 6 January 1944, she fired at but missed a small Japanese tanker and was boxed in by the sound search of two Japanese destroyers. At 2323, she surfaced and cleared the area while the convoy escorts hunted for her about astern. On 14 January 1944, she slipped by two destroyers to launch six torpedoes at the 9,975-gross register ton tanker &quot;Nippon Maru&quot;. &quot;Nippon Maru&quot; sank as &quot;Scamp&quot; made her escape. Foiled in an attempt to return to the area, she headed south to act as plane guard north of Lyra Reef for United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bombers. On 6 February 1944, she put into Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit.

===Seventh war patrol===

&quot;Scamp&quot; spent her seventh war patrol searching the shipping lanes between New Guinea, Palau, and Mindanao in the Philippines. She departed Milne Bay on 3 March 1944 and, after uneventful patrolling, put in at Langemak Bay from 29 to 31 March 1944 for repairs to her Torpedo Data Computer. Following her resumption of patrol, she battle-surfaced on 4 April 1944 and set fire to a 200-gross register ton trawler, but broke off the action when her deck gun failed.

On 7 April 1944 &quot;Scamp&quot; encountered six Japanese cruisers escorted by destroyers and planes south of Davao Gulf. She dived to and the destroyers passed overhead without noticing her. She returned to the surface at 1405 but was forced down by a plane. A little later, she tried to surface again but was attacked by a diving floatplane. As she crash-dived to escape the floatplane, an aerial bomb exploded. All hands were knocked off their feet by the explosion and all power was lost. &quot;Scamp&quot; began to take an up angle and started to settle rapidly. At just below , she began to hang on, then started up. The diving officer reported that the hydraulic controller had been jarred to &quot;off&quot; in the attack and that the hydraulic plant started closing all the main vents as fire started filling the maneuvering and aft torpedo rooms with a thick, toxic smoke.

Fortunately, &quot;Scamp&quot; caught at , the decision having been made to surface and fight it out with the Japanese using the deck gun if she could not be held below . &quot;Scamp&quot; started down again, &quot;see-sawed&quot; three times, and started down a third time before power was regained. Soon &quot;Scamp&quot; was making two-thirds speed on each shaft and had leveled off at . She released oil and air bubbles to appear to have sunk and then headed for the Admiralty Islands. At 21:06, she surfaced and, with a 17-degree list, made for Seeadler Harbor on Manus Island, where she arrived on 16 April 1944.

&quot;Scamp&quot; made emergency repairs at Manus, shifted to Milne Bay on 22 April 1944, and then moved on to Pearl Harbor for a thorough overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard.

===Eighth war patrol and loss===

&quot;Scamp&quot; set out on her eighth war patrol on 16 October 1944. She fueled at Midway Atoll on 20 October 1944, then set course for the Bonin Islands. On 9 November 1944, she acknowledged a message changing her patrol area. She reported her position to be about north of the Bonin Islands with all 24 torpedoes aboard and of fuel remaining. &quot;Scamp&quot; was never heard from again. On 14 November 1944, &quot;Scamp&quot; was ordered to take up the life guard station off Tokyo Bay in support of U.S. Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bomber strikes, but failed to acknowledge the message.

From an examination of Japanese records after World War II, it appears that &quot;Scamp&quot; was sighted by Japanese planes and depth-charged by the Japanese &quot;kaibōkan&quot; &quot;CD-4&quot; to the south of Tokyo Bay on 11 November 1944. &quot;CD-4&quot; expended some 70 depth charges against &quot;Scamp&quot; and apparently sank her.

&quot;Scamp&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 April 1945.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Scamp&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="456001" wikidata="Q7995182" url="?curid=456001" title="White Peak">
<text>The White Peak, also known as the Low Peak, is a limestone plateau that forms the central and southern part of the Peak District in England. It is mostly between and above sea-level and is enclosed by the higher altitude Dark Peak (also known as the High Peak) to the west, north and east.

==Area==
Broadly speaking, the White Peak covers the Derbyshire and Staffordshire parts of the Peak District from the Hope Valley southwards to the Weaver Hills near the Churnet Valley. As defined by Natural England, the White Peak national character area covers and includes the area approximately bounded by Ashbourne, Buxton, Castleton, Matlock and Wirksworth.
==Geology and soils==
The geology of the White Peak has its origins in the Carboniferous Period, when the area was under a shallow sea that was fringed by reefs, leading to thick deposits of shelly calcareous material. Over millions of years the area rose up and subsided several times, leading to muddy, sandy and peaty deposits overlying the calcareous shells. Compression turned the deposits into rock - the shells became limestone, and the overlying deposits became gritstone, shales and coal. Further uplifting and folding raised the area into an anticline (the Derbyshire Dome), then subsequent erosion removed the younger deposits to expose the limestone. The limestone consists of three types: pale grey, thickly bedded, gently dipping shelf limestone of much of the central plateau; darker grey, more thinly bedded, more folded basin limestone in the south west; and hard, unbedded reef limestone that forms cone-like hills on the plateau periphery.

Limestone is porous, so caves, limestone gorges and dry valleys are common features of the area. The soils are mostly derived from loess deposited by cold winds in the last part of the last glacial period. Notable valleys in the White Peak include Dovedale, Monsal Dale, Lathkill Dale and the Manifold Valley. The area is of interest to geologists, since much of the underlying strata have been exposed by extensive quarrying, and can be seen in the old railway cuttings along the Monsal Trail through Monsal Dale and Millers Dale.

==Ecology==
The generally good quality loess soil means much of the area is agriculturally productive pasture, though hay meadows - containing species such as &quot;Rhinanthus minor&quot; (yellow rattle) and &quot;Galium verum&quot; (lady’s bedstraw)- occur in places. On steep slopes and higher points where soils are shallower and pasture improvement difficult, species-rich calcareous grassland can be found, containing species such as &quot;Orchis mascula&quot; (early purple orchid), &quot;Primula veris&quot; (cowslip) and &quot;Thymus serpyllum&quot; (wild thyme). On high ground leaching has resulted in acidic grassland - where &quot;Viola lutea&quot; (mountain pansy) and &quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot; (bilberry) occur - and, in a few places, remnants of limestone heath. Minimally grazed north-facing slopes of dales are a national stronghold of &quot;Polemonium caeruleum&quot; (Jacob&#x27;s ladder), the county flower of Derbyshire.
==Settlements==
The largest towns in the White Peak are outside the area of the Peak District national park. These towns include Matlock, Wirksworth and Buxton, while Bakewell and most of the villages in the park are in the White Peak area. Around the areas of Tideswell, Hartington, Flagg, Chelmorton and Youlgrave, long thin fields created by the enclosure of medieval strip fields can be seen.

==Footpaths==
The region is rich in footpaths, bridleways and green tracks that give access to the area. Longer-distance routes include the Limestone Way, the Peak District Boundary Walk and the Pennine Bridleway, and former railway trackbeds such as the Monsal Trail, the High Peak Trail, the Tissington Trail and the Manifold Way.

<doc id="456004" wikidata="Q11964773" url="?curid=456004" title="Dark Peak">
<text>The Dark Peak is the higher and wilder part of the Peak District in England, mostly forming the northern section but also extending south into its eastern and western margins. It is mainly in Derbyshire but parts are in Staffordshire, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.

It gets its name because (in contrast to the White Peak), the underlying limestone is covered by a cap of Millstone Grit sandstones with softer shale underneath, meaning that in winter the soil is almost always saturated with water. The land is thus largely uninhabited moorland plateaux where almost any depression is filled with sphagnum bogs and black peat. The High Peak is an alternative name for the Dark Peak, but High Peak is also the name of an administrative district of Derbyshire which includes part of the White Peak.

The areas of Millstone Grit form an &#x27;inverted horseshoe&#x27; around the lower uncapped limestone areas of the White Peak, enclosing it to the west, north and east. Hence the Dark Peak is said to cover the higher, northern moors between the Hope Valley to the south and the Tame Valley, Standedge and Holme Valley to the north, separating it from the South Pennines, the Western Moors stretching south to near the Churnet Valley, and the Eastern Moors southwards towards Matlock. The Dark Peak is one of 159 National Character Areas defined by Natural England; as defined by Natural England, the Dark Peak NCA covers and includes the northern block of hills approximately bounded by Marsden, Stocksbridge, Hathersage and Chapel-en-le-Frith, plus the eastern moors between Hathersage and Matlock, but excludes the western moors between Chapel and the Churnet Valley (which it places in NCA 53, the South West Peak), and the area around Glossop (in NCA 54, Manchester Pennine Fringe).

An area of is designated as the Dark Peak Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which excludes the separately designated Eastern Moors. The SSSI extends over the borders into Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. A large part of the SSSI is included in the South Pennine Moors Special Area of Conservation. Part of the land area designated as Dark Peak SSSI is owned by United Utilities.

Principal upland areas within the Dark Peak include Kinder Scout, Bleaklow (both of which rise to over ), Black Hill, the Roaches, Shining Tor, Mam Tor, Win Hill and Stanage Edge.

== Aircraft crashes ==
Over the years, military aircraft have crashed on the Dark Peak, generally because of a combination of numerous nearby air bases, inexperienced pilots, primitive or faulty equipment and poor visibility. Because of the bleakness and emptiness of the high moorlands and the consequent difficulties of recovery, substantial wreckage remains at some sites in remote parts of the moorland, though militarily sensitive materials were removed and salvage teams sometimes gathered debris into piles, or burned or buried it.

<text>A press secretary or press officer is a senior advisor who provides advice on how to deal with the news media and, using news management techniques, helps their employer to maintain a positive public image and avoid negative media coverage.

==Duties and functions==
They often, but not always, act as the organization&#x27;s senior spokesperson. Many governments also have deputy press secretaries. A deputy press secretary is typically a mid-level political staffer who assists the press secretary and communications director with aspects of public outreach. They often write the press releases and media advisories for review by the press secretary and communications director. There are usually assistant press secretaries and press officers that support the press secretary. Press secretaries also give declarations to the media when a particular event happens or an issue arises inside an organization. They are expected, therefore, to have in-depth knowledge about the institution or organization they represent, and to be able to explain and answer questions about the organization&#x27;s policies, views upon a particular issue and its official standpoint on problematic questions.

== History ==
The role of the press officer originated in Europe in the 19th century, created by governments.

In the United States, Stephen T. Early, who worked for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is credited as being America&#x27;s first modern presidential press secretary.

<doc id="456014" wikidata="Q10429" url="?curid=456014" title="Regensburg (district)">
<text>Regensburg is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north, in clockwise direction) the districts of Schwandorf, Cham, Straubing-Bogen, Kelheim and Neumarkt. The city of Regensburg is enclosed by it, but is not part of the district; nonetheless it is its administrative seat.

==History==
The region became a part of Bavaria in the late 12th century, when the line of the counts of Regensburg and Stefling came to an end. While Regensburg became a Free Imperial City (meaning subordinate to the emperor only), the surrounding lands were Bavarian property.

While the district dates back to medieval times, its present shape was established in 1972.

==Geography==

The district is located on either side of the Danube. Another major river is the Regen which joins the Danube in Regensburg. The northernmost parts of the district are occupied by the foothills of the Bavarian Forest.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and white checked pattern of Bavaria
* the red and white arms of the Regensburg abbey
* the red cross from the arms of Prüfening Abbey

==Towns and municipalities==

==Notable people==
* Alexander Braun, Botanist
* Edith Kellnhauser (1933–2019), nursing scientist, educator, and writer
* Wolfram Menschick (1937–2010), Catholic church musician, composer and academic teacher

<doc id="456017" wikidata="Q385978" url="?curid=456017" title="Tideswell">
<text>Tideswell is a village, civil parish, and ward in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England. It lies east of Buxton on the B6049, in a wide valley on a limestone plateau, at an altitude of above sea level, and is within the District of Derbyshire Dales. The population (including Wheston) was 1,820 in 2001, increasing slightly to 1,827 at the 2011 Census, making it the second-largest settlement within the National Park, after Bakewell. Tideswell Dale is a short limestone valley leading south from the village to the River Wye valley.

==Name==
There is some debate as to how the village got its name. The English Place Name Society accepts it as being named after a Saxon chieftain named Tidi, others that the name comes from a &quot;tiding well&quot; situated in the north of the village. This &#x27;ebbing and flowing&#x27; well was declared to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book &quot;De Mirabilibus Pecci.&quot;

Tideswell is known locally as &quot;Tidza&quot; or &quot;Tidsa&quot;. In addition, local residents are known as &quot;Sawyeds&quot;, owing to a traditional story about a farmer who freed his prize cow from a gate in which it had become entangled, by sawing its head off. Today the story is re-enacted raucously and colourfully every Wakes week by a local mummers group called the Tidza Guisers.

==History and heritage==


In the Middle Ages, Tideswell was a market town known for lead mining. The Tideswell lead miners were renowned for their strength and were much prized by the military authorities. The Domesday Book of 1086 lists TIDESUUELLE as the King&#x27;s land in the charge of William Peverel with fewer than five households.

Tideswell is now best known for its 14th-century parish church, the Church of St John the Baptist, known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Peak&quot;, which contains three 15th-century misericords.

A sundial lies in the churchyard; it is positioned on steps which local historian Neville T. Sharpe thinks likely to be those of the village&#x27;s market cross. A market and two-day fair were granted to the village in 1251. The Foljambe family, later the Foljambe baronets, were the principal landowners from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries.

The town has a week-long festival near the summer solstice known as the Wakes, culminating in &quot;Big Saturday&quot;, which includes a torchlight procession through the streets, led by a brass band playing a unique tune called the Tideswell Processional, and townsfolk dancing a traditional weaving dance.

===Markeygate House===
Markeygate House on Bank Square is thought to be the oldest dwelling in Tideswell, built in 1432. It is an English Heritage Grade II listed building (Entry Number: 1288059) that has undergone significant remodelling over time, having served as an ale house and family butcher.

===Taste Tideswell===
In May 2009, Tideswell won a £400,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund&#x27;s &quot;Village SOS&quot; programme. In a bid to help keep its village shops open and thriving—over 20 shops had closed in the preceding decade—&quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; was created, to reconnect local people with their food and make Tideswell famous as a food destination. On 6 December 2010 the Tideswell School of Food opened, running full-priced cookery and brewing courses as well as subsidised community courses. The School of Food was intended to be the financial engine for the project that would help to develop work in the community. It closed during 2014 because of cashflow issues.

&quot;Tideswell Made&quot; is a quality mark that local food producers, retailers, public houses and holiday accommodation can buy into. Ensuring products are sourced as locally as possible and made locally, &quot;Tideswell Made&quot; is marketed by &quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; and helps local business get wider recognition for their locally made produce. &quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; has an education service, visiting schools with a variety of food- and growing-related activities. School groups also visit the School of Food for practical hands-on activities.

Behind the Parish Church, a small community garden has been developed to provide a training ground for those wanting to learn more about growing. There is also a small commercial kitchen available for hire by local food producers, particularly those who are looking to make the step up from home-based production. In May 2011, the first Tideswell Food Festival was held, attracting over 2,000 people, despite poor weather.

On 7 September 2011, the &quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; story was broadcast as part of the &quot;Village SOS&quot; series on BBC One. It showed the rapid development of the project, along with the individual story of Tim Nicol, the &#x27;Village Champion&#x27; who moved to live in Tideswell for a year and helped the volunteer directors get &quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; established. As of August 2011, &quot;Taste Tideswell&quot; employed eight members of staff, most of whom lived in the village, and had ten visiting chef/tutors on its books. Although the School of Food had to close, Tideswell&#x27;s annual Food Festival has continued to be a success each year.

==Facilities and activities==
Tideswell Sports Complex was built in 2001 following a £1.2 million Sports Lottery grant and substantial fund-raising in the village. There are two football pitches, a floodlit multi-use area with two tennis courts and five-a-side pitches marked out, a cricket ground, crown-green bowling area, a skate-park and two pavilions. The town has a football team, Tideswell United, and they play in the Hope Valley League &#x27;A&#x27; Division. They also run a reserve side competing in the Hope Valley League B Division as Tideswell United Blue Star. The ground has floodlights for midweek games, one of few sides at such a low level to use them. The bowling club competes in local leagues, and the cricket and tennis clubs compete in local friendly matches.

The village has a long theatrical tradition, Tideswell Theatre having been formed over 200 years ago to perform leading plays of the time. It was revived in 2002 to bring professional-quality theatre, music, dance and comedy to the area. Tideswell Community Players are one of the oldest drama groups in the country, formed in 1929. Until the 1960s the village also had its own cinema, The Picturehouse. Tideswell Cinema was revived in 2005 to bring film once more to the community, with screenings for three seasons at Bishop Pursglove School&#x27;s hall, before relocating in 2008 to the upper storey of The George Hotel. A number of musical ensembles are also active in the village – notably Tideswell Male Voice Choir and the Tideswell Singers.

<text>Frederick James Archer (11 January 1857 – 8 November 1886), also known by the nickname The Tin Man, was an English flat race jockey of the Victorian era, described as &quot;the best all-round jockey that the turf has ever seen&quot;.

He was Champion Jockey for 13 consecutive years until 1886, riding 2,748 winners from 8,084 starts, in so doing setting records for the number of Champion Jockey titles (13), number of wins in a season (246) and number of race wins (2748) which remained unthreatened until the arrival of Steve Donoghue and Sir Gordon Richards well into the 20th century.

Delirious from wasting and the loss of his wife during childbirth, he committed suicide at the age of 29.

==Early life==
Archer was born at St. George&#x27;s Cottage, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on 11 January 1857, the second son of jockey William Archer and Emma Hayward, daughter of publican William Hayward. His elder brother, William, was also a jockey. His younger brother, Charles, was also a jockey, and later a trainer. He had at least one sister, Alice.

William Archer was a short, squat man, who had taken a stud of English horses to Russia in 1842, and the year after Fred was born won the Grand National on Little Charlie. He eventually became landlord of the King&#x27;s Arms public house in Prestbury, near Cheltenham, of which his father-in-law was formerly proprietor. He taught Fred to box.

Emma was &quot;a big, fine-looking woman with handsome aquiline features&quot; who some presumed to have been of good stock. Fred was said to have inherited his spirit from her, even if he adopted his profession from his father. He was only semi-literate.

When Archer was two, the family moved to Prestbury, where he was educated a first learned to ride. A &quot;quick, retentive, and exceedingly secretive boy&quot;, by the age of eight he was riding in pony and donkey races, losing his first match on a pony, against a donkey. This may have been one of two races he rode on a pony called Mossrose at Great Malvern. William disciplined him sternly to make him improve. He soon began winning races, even after breaking his leg while out hunting.

In contradiction of his later reputation as a miser, Archer would send money home to his family, who were always in debt. At first it was postal orders for a few shillings, but as his success grew, this increased to fivers and latterly big sums.

==Career==

At the suggestion of a hunting acquaintance, William Le Terriere, Archer was apprenticed to trainer Mathew Dawson at Heath House in Newmarket, Suffolk, now home to trainer Mark Prescott, for five years. Some sources say this was in February 1868, others that it was the day before his 10th birthday. He weighed 4st 11 lb. William and Fred spent a week there, after which Dawson told William, &quot;He will do, Archer, you may leave him.&quot; Archer served Dawson as a stable jockey from 1874 until 1886. He married Dawson&#x27;s niece, Helen Rose Dawson.

At Dawson&#x27;s stable, the delicate Archer was bullied by the older boys, but with no children of their own, the Dawsons took him almost as a surrogate. Mrs Dawson called him &quot;the little cat&quot;, and to Mr Dawson the relationship was close to father and son. His fondness for Mrs Dawson&#x27;s cake and blackberry jam contributed to his weight gain, and over a good dinner, his weight could rise by 3 or 4 lb He grew to around 5 ft 10 and, over the winter, weighted 11st. He was largely illiterate when he left home but attended a night school run by Mrs Dawson during his early years there.

While at Dawson&#x27;s, Archer came under the tutelage of Dawson&#x27;s right-hand man Jockey Swift, who claimed to have taught Archer all he knew, and Tom French. Archer was evidently in high regard at the stable, receiving wages of seven guineas compared to the five guineas typical of apprentices. One of his fellow apprentices was in fact thrown from his horse and killed during Archer&#x27;s time there. Dawson demanded the same discipline of Archer as he did of other apprentices, making him stand to attention for visitors the same as any other lad. But he was aware of his ability. &quot;I have a wonderful boy here who will do marvellous things,&quot; he commented.

Because of this, and his father&#x27;s reputation, he was soon given race-riding opportunities. Aged 12, he was allowed to ride in the Newmarket Town Plate on 14 October 1869, on a three-year-old filly called Honoria. Acting as pacemaker for stablemate Stomboli, who won, Honoria came last. His first win was a steeplechase at Bangor-on-Dee in either 1869 or 1870 on a horse called Maid of Trent for an old pony-racing acquaintance of his family. His first official win under Jockey Club rules was in a two-year-old nursery handicap at Chesterfield on 28 September 1870 on a horse called Atholl Daisy. The horse was trained by John Peart at Malton, rather than Dawson. He finished the season with 2 wins and 9 seconds from 15 rides. His other winner was Lincoln Lass at Ayr.

There is a story, probably apocryphal, that Archer cried because he had not ridden both winners in a dead-heat.

===1870s===
Archer&#x27;s first important win was on Salvanos in the 1872 Cesarewitch, for which he weighed out at 5st 7 lb. It is said he &quot;rode Salvanos with the coolness and steadiness of a veteran and thus made his mark as one of the rising lightweights.&quot; When Jem Snowden rode against him for the first time, however, he commented, &quot;Tha cassn&#x27;t ride for nuts&quot;. His apprenticeship ended that year, and Dawson presented him with a gold watch inscribed for &quot;good conduct&quot;. Archer in return commented, &quot;I value this more than anything I have and shall keep it as long as I live.&quot;

In 1873, with leading stable jockey Tom French sick, Archer had more opportunity to succeed. He rode 107 winners and came second in the championship to Harry Constable. French, who was an influence on the young Archer, died later that year from consumption, brought on by excessive wasting.

The first of Archer&#x27;s Classic wins followed the next season on Atlantic in the 1874 2,000 Guineas. This made him a &quot;veritable mascotte&quot; for his stable. After this, he became retained jockey for Lord Falmouth, for whom he won over half of his Classics. Falmouth was Dawson&#x27;s principal owner between 1870 and 1883. Archer&#x27;s retainer for him was a nominal £100. He finished 1874 with 147 wins from 530 rides. By now, he was riding at 6st, but weight was becoming a problem. For the Cesarewitch Handicap, he failed to make a riding weight of 6st 1 lb, putting up 3 lbs overweight and losing by a neck. Archer blamed wasting for taking his strength away.

Spinaway was the star filly of the following season, winning the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks double.

In 1877, he won his first Derby, on Lord Falmouth&#x27;s Silvio, and followed up in the St. Leger.

1879 was the championship year of Wheel of Fortune, one of Archer&#x27;s favourite horses, that he thought was &quot;wonderfully good&quot;. She was small, at , leading the Duke of Portland to say she &quot;looked like a polo pony&quot; with Archer&#x27;s long legs round her. Like Spinaway four years earlier, Wheel of Fortune won both the 1,000 Guineas and Oaks. She won the Yorkshire Oaks in August as well but was prevented an attempt at the Triple Crown when she broke down going for a second race at York two days later.

One of Archer&#x27;s most notable victories came in the 1880 Derby. He came from behind on Bend Or with an &quot;extraordinary rush&quot;, to beat Robert the Devil by a head. He took the inside of the turn at Tattenham Corner, along the rails, with a &quot;nerve of iron&quot;.

By the end of the 1870s, he was struggling to make 8st 7 lb.

===1880s===
By the 1880s, his annual income was around £10,000 (equivalent to about £1.2 million in 2020), made up of retainers, gifts from owners and gamblers, and nearly £2,500 in riding fees.

Archer&#x27;s win on Dutch Oven in the St Leger caused controversy. It had been presumed that the filly had not stayed the distance when losing the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York, so she was sent off at odds of 40/1 for the Leger. When she won, Archer was accused of pulling the horse at York to get longer odds for the Leger. In fact, Archer had not wanted to ride Dutch Oven in the race at all, preferring the John Porter-trained Geheimniss.

Falmouth withdrew from racing in 1883. It has been suggested that this was prompted by a suspicion that Archer pulled Galliard in the Derby, being beaten into third by St Blaise and Highland Chief. Archer was accused of not showing the same will to win that he had on Bend Or or Iroquois, and Highland Chief was trained by his brother Charles, which seemed to be circumstantial evidence of his guilt. Against this, Fred had no previous history of helping his brother in this way, and Charles had once sent him through the rails when riding against him. It seems highly unlikely Archer would have thrown the Derby in this way.

Retainers with the Duke of Portland and Lord Hastings brought him a combined £2,000 per year, the Duke of Westminster £1,000, and Lord Alington £500.
He married Rose Nellie Dawson, eldest daughter of John Dawson, on 31 January 1883 at All Saints&#x27; Church in Newmarket. It was called the celebrity wedding of the decade. The whole town was involved, and it concluded with a firework display which had spelled out &quot;May they be happy”.

In January 1884, the couple&#x27;s infant son, William, died at birth. He had been named after Archer&#x27;s brother, who had been killed in a hurdle race at Cheltenham. Nellie was left in a critical condition but recovered to become pregnant again almost immediately. On 6 November 1884, she gave birth to a daughter, also Nellie. Fred received a telegram about the birth after riding Thebais to victory in the Liverpool Cup. But the mother was again left dangerously ill after the birth, with symptoms of post-natal eclampsia. Archer arrived home to find his wife was dying. Her convulsions continued until she died. Archer later told a friend, “She did not know me and never spoke to me again.&quot;

In 1884, on his only visit to Thirsk Racecourse, his arrival was announced in the market place by the town crier. He had only two rides, but both won Jovial for Tom Green in the High-weight Selling Handicap and Laverock for Matt Dawson in the Sixth Great Yorkshire Foal Stakes. That year, of 377 rides, he won 241.

His most successful year was probably 1885, when he won the 2,000 Guineas on Paradox, the Oaks on Lonely, the Derby and St. Leger on Melton, and the Grand Prix, also on Paradox. In his final season, he won the Derby and St. Leger on Ormonde.

Archer took his sport very seriously and was noted for his ruthlessness. In 1882, he built Falmouth Lodge and Stables (now Pegasus Stables).

In 1885, he rode 246 winners, a record that was unbroken until Gordon Richards&#x27; 1933 season. He won The Derby five times and won a total of 21 classic races. In total, he rode 2,748 winners in 8,084 races (some sources say 8,004), a win percentage of over 34%.

==Appearance==
He was slim, graceful, with remarkably small hands and feet, and eyes of a cold blue-grey, or, according to other sources, sorrowful brown eyes, in a long pale face. He had pronounced front teeth, meaning his lips did not quite meet. He also had a round-shouldered stoop, typical of tall jockeys. He could have passed as a gentleman, and some, including Lord Rosebery, thought he may have been the son of Lord Wilton.

==Personality and critical opinion==

Archer &quot;captured the public imagination as no other jockey had ever done&quot;.

In his early career he was known as a severe rider, who was not sparing with whip and spurs on the horse. This was a style he may have adopted under the influence of stable jockey Tom French.

He was always first down to the start, so as to get the best starting place and was obedient to the starter, unlike some other jockeys. He was always quick away, &quot;like a greyhound from the slips&quot;. He would let his horse&#x27;s head hang loose, and get the horse going with a touch of the spur.

===Miserliness===
He was a taciturn and morose character, known for being miserly with money, hence the nickname &quot;Tin Man&quot;. He made shrewd investments of most of his income, but the squandering of much of a reputed £250,000 fortune (equivalent to £32.7 million in 2020) by the time of his death challenges the perception of acquisitiveness, which may have been partly cultivated. He seemed to take perverse satisfaction in it. He is reputed to have asked bystanders for coins he could put in his breeches to increase his weight when he was short a few pounds for his race, only never to return them. But he could also be generous. He was also known to throw a ball for colleagues each winter, and once, before a trip to America in November 1884, he left a blank cheque for his friend Herbert Mills, in case he was in need.

He was a reckless gambler, with losing runs bringing him close to running out of cash, but he always maintained his integrity, sometimes winning against his own money.

===Trainer opinion===
Trainer John Porter said of Archer, &quot;His whole heart and soul were in the business he had in hand. He was almost invariably the first to weigh out, the first at the starting post, the first away as the flag fell, and, as the record shows, very often the first to pass the winning post. I am afraid he was not too scrupulous. Very masterful, he generally had pretty much his own way, especially in minor races. If he did not want a horse to run, he never hesitated to suggest to the owner he should keep the animal in the stable that day. In short, Fred Archer was a powerful personality as well as a brilliantly successful jockey.&quot;

Another trainer, John Osborne Jr., said, &quot;He became so conceited that no man believed more in Mr Archer than Fred Archer the jockey&quot;, but this was not a universal opinion. In 1879, The World newspaper wrote: &quot;a very large income, the unbounded confidence of employers and public might help to turn less ordinary heads, but Fred Archer quietly goes his own way and studies diligently to improve his calling&quot;. And after his death, George Lambton said, &quot;Even when quite a boy he was courted and flattered by every kind of man and woman, and early in life he became the idol of the public... and yet he never suffered from that prevalent and disagreeable complaint, &#x27;swollen head&#x27;. I think the shrewd, hard common sense of Mat Dawson, for whom he had the greatest affection and respect, was a great help to him.&quot;

Dawson was not entirely complimentary about him, calling him &quot;that damned, long-legged, tin-scrapping young devil&quot;.

===Other comments===
His sister Alice spoke of him thus: &quot;He was gentle, but he took no liberties himself and no one ever thought of taking one with him. And he was always so quiet. There was never any ranting and raving. He would also rather be two minutes early than two minutes late.&quot;
Others have said similar. &quot;He was a polite and driven man, whose life would have been so much easier had he been five inches shorter.&quot;

Lambton described him as having &quot;the shadow of melancholy in his face which indicated a side to his nature never far absent even in his brightest days&quot;. Friend and fellow jockey, Fred Webb, &quot;It is not wasting that makes Archer so thin and worn. He wears that worried look because he cannot ride two winners in one race.&quot;

Archer &quot;rode like a man possessed&quot; and &quot;had the devil at his elbow&quot;. He could ride rough when necessary, but his success has been attributed primarily to his coolness and to judgement of pace.
He had the &quot;passion of a lover for what he did&quot;. One contemporary newspaper described him as &quot;all jockey, from the button of his cap to the tips of his spurs, and rode irrespective of the odds. Whether on a 6 to 4 or a 20 to 1 chance he equally strove to win.&quot;

In his lifetime, his fame rivalled that of royalty. Once, leaving Ascot Racecourse, the first-class train, full of MPs and members of the aristocracy, was held up for him.

He was particularly popular with women. Lady Hastings wrote &quot;the way in which some women ran after Archer was amazing&quot;, and it was widely believed that the Duchess of Montrose (1818–1894) (who raced under the pseudonym &quot;Mr Manton&quot;), who was 40 years older than Archer, wanted to marry him, and she invited him to her home and the theatre. In 1888, aged 70, she married her third husband, aged 24.

In the end, Archer outgrew his profession. London cab drivers would shout &quot;Archer&#x27;s up&quot; to mean that everything was all right with the world.

==Death==

Because of his height (5 ft 10in/1.78 m) Archer had to diet far more than other jockeys. His racing weight was 8st 10 lb in later years, and to keep to it he used Victorian Turkish baths, abstained almost totally from solid food, and used alkaline medicines to purge. A Newmarket doctor, JR Wright, created a special purgative which became known as &quot;Archer&#x27;s Mixture&quot;, which he drank by the sherry glass. His diet consisted of half an orange, a sardine and a nip of champagne, or castor oil, a biscuit and a small champagne at midday, and he once left the dining room on the sight of a steak and kidney pie. He was a poor walker, and could hardly run, which reduced his ability to lose weight through exercise.

In October 1886, he had to lose 6 lbs over two days for his first and, ultimately, only ride in Ireland: Cambusmore for Lord Londonderry in the Lieutenant&#x27;s Plate at the Curragh, a race he won easily. On his return, he wasted down to 8st 7 lb for the Cambridgeshire by going three days without food. This was still 1 lb overweight and cost him the race on St Mirin, as he was beaten by a head. The afternoon was very cold, and he fell seriously ill. He still undertook engagements at Brighton and on the first day at Lewes on the Thursday, but here he is reported to have &quot;taken a chill&quot; which &quot;developed into fever of a typhoid character&quot;, forcing him to return home. He was declared ill on the Saturday, and by Sunday he was in a state of high fever.

The next day, Monday 8 November 1886, he was at his residence, Falmouth House, Newmarket, under medical supervision. About 2.25pm his sister, Mrs Colman, visited him in his room and he asked her to send the nurse away. Colman was looking out of the window when Archer got out of bed. She then heard him say &quot;Are they coming?&quot; and saw he had the gun in his hand. She sprang towards him, and while she was struggling with him, he put the gun in his mouth and fired the revolver. He died bleeding in her arms, the bullet having passed out of the back of his neck. The doctor was on the scene very quickly and pronounced him dead. The verdict of the jury at the inquest was: &quot;That the deceased committed suicide whilst in a state of unsound mind&quot;. His death at the age of 29 occurred on 8 November 1886; his wife had died on 7 November, two years earlier.

The death of his wife was a factor. &quot;Poor Nellie! She was my glory, my pride, my life, my all,&quot; he had earlier told a friend. &quot;She was taken from me at the very moment that my happiness did really seem to me to be so great and complete as to leave nothing else in this world that I could wish for.&quot; He was also £30,000 in debt on his betting, exacerbated by having heavily backed St Mirin. He had reportedly not been his &quot;old self&quot; for the past year.

The gun had been bought because Falmouth House was in an exposed location and he had had trouble with housebreakers.

He was buried in Newmarket cemetery on 12 November. Wreaths were sent by the Duke of Westminster and the Prince of Wales. His burial plot can be found there to the right of the chapel.

He left a fortune of £66,662 (equal to about £ million today) to his only daughter, the inheritance being looked after by trustees during her minority. At one time, he was rumoured to be worth £250,000. Some of his effects are now on display at the National Horseracing Museum, including the gun with which he shot himself.

News of Archer&#x27;s death reached far beyond racing. In London, special editions of the evening newspapers were issued, with crowds queuing in Fleet Street to buy them, and omnibuses stopped to allow commuters to read the billboards. The adoration the public showed for him was close to that shown for Diana, Princess of Wales over a century later.

He was survived by his second child, Nellie, who was brought up by her grandparents in the Newmarket area. She married shipping magnate Max Tosetti in 1911.

==Legacy==
Archer&#x27;s life has been fictionalised in two books: &quot;The Tinman&#x27;s Farewell&quot; by Michael Tanner and &quot;Just One More Smile&quot; by his great-granddaughter Diana Foster.

His ghost is said to ride a light grey horse over Newmarket Heath.

<doc id="456026" wikidata="Q752369" url="?curid=456026" title="Capitate bone">
<text>The capitate bone is a bone in the human wrist found in the center of the carpal bone region, located at the distal end of the radius and ulna bones. It articulates with the third metacarpal bone (the middle finger) and forms the third carpometacarpal joint. The capitate bone is the largest of the carpal bones in the human hand. It presents, above, a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the scaphoid and lunate bones; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the body.
The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the &quot;third distal carpal&quot; of reptiles and amphibians.

==Structure==
The capitate is the largest carpal bone found within the hand. The capitate is found within the distal row of carpal bones. The capitate lies directly adjacent to the metacarpal of the ring finger on its distal surface, has the hamate on its ulnar surface and trapezoid on its radial surface, and abuts the lunate and scaphoid proximally. 

===Surfaces===
The &quot;proximal surface&quot; is round, smooth, and articulates with the lunate bone.

The &quot;distal surface&quot; is divided by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and fourth metacarpal bones, that for the third being the largest.

The &quot;dorsal surface&quot; is broad and rough.

The &quot;palmar surface&quot; is narrow, rounded, and rough, for the attachment of ligaments and a part of the adductor pollicis muscle.

The &quot;lateral surface&quot; articulates with the lesser multangular by a small facet at its anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment of an interosseous ligament. Above this is a deep, rough groove, forming part of the neck, and serving for the attachment of ligaments; it is bounded superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the scaphoid bone.

The &quot;medial surface&quot; articulates with the hamate bone by a smooth, concave, oblong facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in front, for the attachment of an interosseous ligament.

===Variation===
The capitate bone variably articulates with the metacarpal of the index finger. However, its normal articulation is with the middle finger.

===Development===
The ossification of capitate starts at 1 – 5 months.

==Function==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. They allow movements of the wrist from side to side (medial to lateral) as well as up and down (anterior to posterior). H. A. Harris wrote in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1944 that &quot;the strength of construction of the hand in a man is concentrated in the radius, thumb, and index and middle fingers.&quot; Therefore, the capitate is larger to support the strength and stress that the middle finger undergoes.

==Clinical significance==
A capitate fracture accounts for 1.3% of all wrist fractures. Isolated fractures of the capitate comprise only 0.3% and are often non-displaced. This is since the capitate is at the centre of the carpal region and is therefore quite well protected.
Capitate fractures occur together with fractures of another carpal bone, the scaphoid.

Various mechanisms for fractures of the capitate have been postulated. Adler et al. described three mechanisms—the first is direct trauma to the dorsal surface of the bone, the second is fall on the palm with the wrist in forced extension and the third is fall on the forcefully flexed hand; the second being the most frequent and the third rarest.

In the case of an acute capitate fracture where there is X-ray evidence of excellent alignment of the fracture fragments, the attending doctor will immobilise the wrist in a plaster or lightweight wrist brace. Once the cast has been removed, the patient begins physiotherapy to regain the range of movement of the wrist joint and strength in the muscles involved.

If X-rays show that the capitate fracture fragments are out of alignment, surgery is indicated. A surgeon can use small compression screws or K-wires to unite the two pieces of bone. The headless compression screw has advantage over the K-wire as it provides compression across the fracture site and allows early motion. It may be the case that the ligament between the сapitate and the scaphoid bone is also injured; if so, this would be repaired at the same time.

Because the capitate has a poor blood supply there are sometimes complications with the healing process. This may manifest itself as a diffuse ache in the wrist upon activity, and can persist for many months. This is due to a breakdown of the capitate caused by the lack of blood supply and healing (avascular necrosis). Nonunion has been reported as the most common complication; 19.6% to 56% in isolated capitate fractures. Early diagnosis is key to preventing this.

==Etymology==
The name of the bone derives from &quot;&quot; &#x27;having a head&#x27;, from &quot;-&quot; &#x27;head&#x27;.
