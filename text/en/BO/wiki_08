<text>Cochrane is a town in northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is located east of Kapuskasing, northeast of Timmins, south of Moosonee, and north of Iroquois Falls. It is about a one-hour drive from Timmins and Kapuskasing, the other two major population centres of the region. It is the seat of Cochrane District. The town&#x27;s population is made up of about half anglophone and half francophone residents.

==History==

Before Cochrane was founded, it was used as a summer camping ground by indigenous people, and a stopping place for fur traders travelling to Moose Factory.

In the early 20th century, the National Transcontinental Railway was built through the area, and in 1907, the place was selected as the junction point with the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway. In November 1908, the lots were sold by auction and a railway town formed.

It was incorporated on January 1, 1910, and named after politician and merchant Frank Cochrane, a former mayor of Sudbury and the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines in the provincial government from 1905 to 1911, then Minister of Railways from 1911 to 1919.

The settlement was devastated by fire in 1910, 1911, and 1916, but was rebuilt each time and became a transportation hub for northern Ontario.

After the Reesor Siding Strike of 1963, Cochrane was the site of the trial for 20 Reesor Siding farmers charged with the killing of 3 union employees.

In 1969, the Town of Cochrane annexed part of the surrounding Township of Glackmeyer, and in 2000, it amalgamated with the surrounding townships of Glackmeyer and Lamarche to create a newly expanded Town of Cochrane.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Cochrane has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with very cold winters and warm summers. Diurnal temperature variation is moderately high throughout the year. Annual snowfall is heavy, averaging 117 inches (297 cm). Precipitation peaks during early fall. Winter typically lasts from the end of October to well into April.

Until 1977, Timmins was used as the source for all weather readings attributed to Cochrane except for exceptional extremes, due to the overall similar climate due to proximity and topography. However, in December 1977, Cochrane temperature readings began to be taken from downtown after a noticeable difference in temperature was recorded two years prior in January 1976. However, to this day, if Cochrane&#x27;s weather equipment fails at any time, the Timmins temperature readings are used due to the overall similarity.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cochrane had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2011 Census, Cochrane had a population of 5,340, a 2.7% decrease from the 2006 Census (5,487), which was itself a 3.6 percent decrease from the 2001 Census. Like many northern Ontario communities, the population decline is due to lack of employment.

Mother tongue (2021):
* English as first language: 59.3%
* French as first language: 32.9%
* English and French as first language: 4.3%
* Other as first language: 2.6%

==Economy==
The main industries in Cochrane are transportation, railway, tourism, and forestry.

Marginal farming also exists around Cochrane. Though the soil is considered to be of good quality, the growing season is too short to have substantial crop production.

==Attractions==
=== Polar bears ===
The town contains many references to polar bears. Its mascot is a large polar bear statue known as Chimo, erected in the early 1970s.

There are also live polar bears at the Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat, which opened in the summer of 2004. Polar bears from the Toronto Zoo were relocated to Cochrane while a new pavilion was being constructed. Those two polar bears were returned to the Toronto Zoo in the summer of 2009. In late May 2012, a new bear arrived at the Polar Bear Habitat, Ganuk. Also in 2012, a second bear, Inukshuk, was brought from the Toronto Zoo to The Polar Bear Habitat as a part-time resident. After successfully breeding 5 times in both the Toronto and Quebec Zoos, Inukshuk is now a permanent resident in Cochrane. In 2016 the habitat gained a third bear named Henry who came all the way from Sea World on the Gold Coast in Australia.

=== Cochrane Heritage Village ===
Located on the grounds of the Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat, the Cochrane Heritage Village has multiple replica buildings housing historic settings, which reflect life in Cochrane in the early 1900&#x27;s. The railway station has a set up to view a video of a history of the Town of Cochrane as well as artifacts and photos representing railroad history. There are train rides available in a small motor train. There is a historic butcher shop, doctor’s office, a shoe repair shop, blacksmith shop and hardware store. Other buildings include a homestead house, barn, a one room schoolhouse and a trapper’s cabin. There is a sit in restaurant for fast foods and snacks. The Heritage Village is open year round and often has costumed hosts.

=== Cochrane Classic Vintage Riders Snowmobile Museum ===
Also located on the grounds of the Polar Bear Habitat, is the Cochrane Classic Vintage Riders Snowmobile Museum. This museum is the second largest snowmobile museum in Canada, but the largest that is open to the public. This exhibit is open year round, and attracts sledders from across the province and out of province as well.

=== Cochrane Public Library ===
The Cochrane Public Library was established in 1917 and houses a large collection of books, DVDs, puzzles, video games, and other material. It offers tourists snowshoes and skis for lending in the winter and a safe place to enjoy. Downstairs there is an Art Gallery as well as a book saleroom. Coffee is available for purchase. The library houses the town&#x27;s archives, which is a wealth of local history.

==Sports==
===Ice hockey===
Cochrane residents traditionally place hockey highly among their cultural values and native French and English speakers use the sport as a common ground to connect on.

The town of Cochrane built and maintains the Tim Horton&#x27;s Event Centre, which opened in 2006 and seats a capacity of over 800. Numerous construction delays hindered its official opening. The Tim Horton Museum is also situated in the facility and contains hockey memorabilia.

From 2014 to 2023, the arena was home to the Cochrane Crunch, a Canadian Jr. A hockey team. The Crunch played in the NOJHL, and in 2014/15 captured their first Eastern Division Championship. With an average attendance of 466, the small town placed third in the league. In the 2017/2018 season, the team became the East division champions and later going on to become league champions, who would go on to compete for the Dudley Hewitt Cup. The team and the town of Cochrane successfully won their bid to host the Dudley Hewitt Cup in 2019.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Cochrane is situated along Ontario Highway 11. The town is close to the northern end of the road system in the area. The last roads in this part of Ontario end about halfway between Cochrane and Moosonee at Otter Rapids.

===Railway===
The Cochrane railway station is operated by the Ontario Northland Railway and serves as the southern terminus of the &quot;Polar Bear Express&quot; which operates five days per week to and from Moosonee.

===Airport===
The town is served by the Cochrane Aerodrome, but has no scheduled flights.

<doc id="447850" wikidata="Q1150289" url="?curid=447850" title="System X (supercomputer)">
<text>System X (pronounced &quot;System Ten&quot;) was a supercomputer assembled by Virginia Tech&#x27;s Advanced Research Computing facility in the summer of 2003. Costing US$5.2 million, it was originally composed of 1,100 Apple Power Mac G5 computers with dual 2.0 GHz processors. System X was decommissioned on May 21, 2012. The supercomputer is also known as Big Mac or Terascale Cluster.

System X ran at 12.25 Teraflops, (20.24 peak), and was ranked #3 on November 16, 2003 and #280 in the July 2008 edition of the TOP500 list of the world&#x27;s most powerful supercomputers. The system used error-correcting (ECC) RAM, which is important for accuracy due to the rate of bits flipped by cosmic rays or other interference sources in its vast number of RAM chips.

== Background ==
The supercomputer&#x27;s name originates from the use of the Mac OS X operating system for each node, and because it was the first university computer to achieve 10 teraflops on the high performance LINPACK benchmark. In 2003 it was also touted as &quot;the world&#x27;s most powerful and cheapest homebuilt supercomputer.&quot; System X was constructed with a relatively low budget of just $5.2 million, in the span of only three months, thanks in large part to using off-the-shelf Power Mac G5 computers. By comparison, the Earth Simulator, the fastest supercomputer at the time, cost approximately $400 million to build.

== Upgrade to Server-Grade Parts ==
In 2004, Virginia Tech upgraded its computer to Apple&#x27;s newly released, Xserve G5 servers. The upgraded version ranked #7 in the 2004 TOP500 list and its server-grade error-correcting memory solved the problem of cosmic ray interference. In October 2004, Virginia Tech partially rebuilt System X at a cost of about $600,000. These improvements brought the computer&#x27;s speed up to 12.25 Teraflops, which placed System X #14 on the 2005 TOP500 list.

== Similar Projects ==
Virginia Tech&#x27;s system was the model for Xseed, a smaller system also made from Xserve servers and built by Bowie State University in Maryland. Xseed was ranked #166 in the 2005 TOP500.

System G has 324 Mac Pros (2592 processor cores) with QDR InfiniBand in Virginia Tech&#x27;s Center for High-End Computing Systems.

<doc id="447851" wikidata="Q1315611" url="?curid=447851" title="Sea angel">
<text>Sea angels (clade Gymnosomata) are a large group of small free-swimming sea slugs, classified into six separate families. They are pelagic opisthobranchs in the clade Gymnosomata within the larger mollusc clade Heterobranchia. Sea angels were previously considered to be pteropods.

Sea angels are also sometimes known as &quot;sea butterflies&quot; but this is potentially misleading because the family Clionidae is just one of the families within this clade, and the term &quot;sea butterfly&quot; is also applied to the shelled Thecosomata.

Recent molecular data suggest the Gymnosomata form a sister group to the Thecosomata (other planktonic, weakly or nonmineralized gastropods), but this long-standing hypothesis has also had some recent detractors.

== Distribution ==

These organisms have a wide geographic range, from polar regions, under sea ice, to equatorial (tropic) seas. From spring to autumn, sea angels live at a depth of 200 m in the Sea of Okhotsk. In winter, they migrate to the coast of north Hokkaido with drift ice.

==Description==
In this clade, the foot of the gastropod has developed into wing-like flapping appendages (parapodia) and larval sea angels discard their embryonic shells a few days after hatching. Both adaptations suit their free-swimming oceanic lives. The adaptations also explain the common name sea angel and the scientific name of the order: From Greek &quot;gymnos&quot; meaning &quot;naked&quot; and &quot;soma&quot; meaning &quot;body&quot;.

The lack of a heavy shell for gymnosomes allows them to hover on the upper water surfaces for longer periods, along with a streamlined body that reduces the drag coefficient. Also, gymnosomes have a low aspect ratio which aids them to maneuver and accelerate quickly.

Sea angels are gelatinous, mostly transparent, and very small, with the largest species (&quot;Clione limacina&quot;) reaching 5 cm. &quot;C. limacina&quot; is a polar species; those found in warmer waters are far smaller. Some species of sea angels feed exclusively on sea butterflies; the angels have terminal mouths with the radula common to mollusks, and tentacles to grasp their prey, sometimes with suckers similar to cephalopods.

=== Wings anatomy ===

The wing comprises seven groups of muscles, anterior oblique muscles for dorsal and ventral sides, posterior oblique muscles for dorsal and ventral sides, the longitudinal and transverse wing retractors muscles, and dorso-ventral muscles. The first four groups form a continuous sheet where the dorsal muscles are perpendicular to the ventral muscles. Transverse and longitudinal retractors muscles retract the wing along the span and the chord. The dorso-ventral muscles control the thickness of the wing by changing the haemocoelic pressure inside the wing, this also ejects the buccal apparatus from &quot;C. limacina’s&quot; head.

== Behavior ==
Gymnosomata are carnivorous, feeding only on their fellow pteropods, the Thecosomata. Their lifestyles have coevolved with those of their prey, with their feeding strategy adapting to the morphology and consistency of the thecosome shell.

By rowing their &quot;wings&quot; back and forth at 1–3 Hz, the sea angels swim at speeds up to . This is about twice as fast as their prey, the sea butterfly. Tracing the wingtip showed a ‘figure-of-eight’ trajectory and stroke plane orthogonal to the caudal-rostral axis, this pattern was observed in some aerial insects, small birds, and sea butterflies such as hummingbirds and &quot;Limacina helicina&quot;. It is not yet clear whether the sea angel uses its swimming appendages as &#x27;rowing paddles&#x27; or as &#x27;wings&#x27;.

However, cold water sea angel &quot;C. antarctica&quot; likely accommodates drag-based force production for several reasons: (1) Low aspect ratio for &quot;C.antarctica&quot; causes deleterious lift-drag ratios. (2) High angle of attack typically ranges from 60 to 80 degrees. (3) The orthogonality between the surface of the wing and ascending trajectory of the sea angel.

Furthermore, &quot;Clione antarctica&quot;, defends itself from predators by synthesizing a previously unknown noxious molecule, &quot;pteroenone&quot;. Because of this secretion, predators will not eat the sea angel. A species of amphipod takes advantage of this trait: The amphipod will seize an individual of &quot;C. antarctica&quot; out of the water column, and carry it around for protection. Local population density of &quot;C. antarctica&quot; may reach extraordinary levels; up to 300 animals per cubic metre have been recorded.

Their hunting strategies are variable; some forms are ambush predators, sitting and waiting for their prey; whilst others actively pursue their prey; their metabolic rate is closely linked to that of their prey species. Even the size of the gymnosomes is correlated to the size of their prey, which they recognize by means of touch and grab using their sometimes-suckered buccal cones. A combination of hooks and a toothed radula are employed to scour the flesh from the thecosomes&#x27; shells.

&quot;C. limacina&quot; stimulates the neuromuscular system to chase the prey, this notably increases the motion of the wings, minimizes the gap between wingtips at the end of each stroke, lessening the aspect ratio, and increases the deflection of the wings. Therefore, reducing the drag forces and overcoming stall. Also, the increment in the angle of attack along with low Reynold number for sea angels resembles the fluid dynamic forces acting on insects such as &quot;Drosophila&quot;.

Gymnosomes slowly beat their wing-like parapodia in a rowing motion to propel their &quot;perfectly streamlined&quot; bodies through the upper 20 m of the water column. Although usually slow-moving, beating their wings once or twice per second, they are capable of bursts of speed when they need to pursue their prey, calling a separate suite of muscles into action to obtain the higher beat frequency.

==Reproduction and development==
Like many gastropods, sea angels are simultaneous hermaphrodites with internal fertilization. A fertilized animal later releases a gelatinous egg mass, and the eggs float freely until hatching. Their embryonic shells are lost within the first few days after hatching.

The gymnosomes, like other shell-less opisthobranchs, discard their shells at metamorphosis, with the retractor muscles being severed and the shell lost.
The group does not truly, therefore, lack a shell. Few larval shells have been described (and consequently an understanding of their fossil record is as yet unknown).

==Taxonomy==

The other suborder of pteropods, Thecosomata, is superficially similar to sea angels, but are not closely related; some authorities include both Thecosomata and Gymnosomata as separate branches of the order Pteropoda, whereas others list them as distinct orders within the subclass Heterobranchia. They have larger, broader parapodia, and most of that species retain a shell; they are commonly known as sea butterflies.

In the new taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005), the clade Gymnosomata is arranged as follows:

*Superfamily Clionoidea:
**family Clionidae
**family Cliopsidae
**family Notobranchaeidae
**family Pneumodermatidae
*Superfamily Hydromyloidea:
**family Hydromylidae
**family Laginiopsidae

The group that used to be the family Thliptodontidae is treated as Thliptodontinae, a subfamily of the family Clionidae.

<text>Mr. Sub (stylized MR.SUB), called Mr. Submarine before the 1990s, is a Canadian chain of over 200 submarine sandwich shops. The first store was opened in 1968 in Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville neighbourhood, which was then known for its &quot;hippie&quot; culture.

As of 2015, Mr. Sub has seven restaurants across India, one in Dubai, and one in Saudi Arabia with the rest being located in Canada.

==History==
Mr. Sub was founded in Toronto, Canada, in 1968 by two friends, Jack Levinson, an accounting clerk, and Earl Linzon, a gym teacher, with $1500 start-up capital ().

The first Mr. Sub restaurant, then called Mr. Submarine, opened at 130 Yorkville Avenue, on the ground floor of a converted Victorian row house. After a positive response, the two founders opened a second restaurant five months later.

In 1972, Mr. Submarine sold its first franchise, and officially became Mr. Sub in 1990.

Mr. Sub was originally the only major franchise retailer of submarine sandwiches in Canada, until going into decline in the mid-1990s after the arrival of American chains such as Subway and Quiznos, facing stiff competition from those chains, notably surviving on its dominance of the small town and countryside markets, and regular take-out food courts of public institutions i.e. hospitals, courthouses, civil, law and financial offices and low-key shopping complexes that cater to an older demographic. There was speculation in 2005 that Michael Bregman, the former owner of the Second Cup coffee chain, was contemplating a purchase of the chain. Other names floated as possible suitors have included Swiss Chalet parent Cara Operations and KFC operator Priszm Canadian Income Fund. The doughnut chain Country Style was briefly interested in Mr. Sub in 2005.

On August 18, 2011, MTY Food Group, which by then owned Country Style, announced that it would acquire Mr. Sub at the end of October 2011 for $23 million.

==Products==
Mr. Sub&#x27;s main product is the submarine sandwich (or &quot;sub&quot;); a long roll, similar to a baguette, filled with meat, cheese, sauces, and vegetables. Other products include, wraps, soups, salads, baked goods, and panini grilled sandwiches. Mr. Sub also purveys some signature products.

==Marketing==
Mr. Sub uses various marketing channels. Some of the marketing methods that Mr. Sub has adapted into its operations include: strategic partnerships with the country&#x27;s most visible sports franchises, national promotions, and ongoing in-restaurant campaigns.

Such marketing initiatives allow Mr. Sub to interact with their large and growing consumer base. Mr. Sub occasionally tries to change its campaigns and promotional activities. It made use of the very relaxed marketing approach and slogan known as &quot;Oh Canada, Oh Mr. Sub!&quot;. Mr. Sub had launched a TV campaign that reminds consumers of the brand&#x27;s Canadian identity. &quot;We wanted to highlight the personality of our Canadian company,&quot; said Rita McParland, vice-president of marketing at Mr. Sub.

The following slogans, in chronological order, have been used by Mr. Sub: &quot;Lub my Sub&quot;; &quot;Fresh thinking is what we are&quot;; &quot;Taste a Canadian Tradition&quot;; &quot;It&#x27;s not a sandwich it&#x27;s a Sub&quot;; &quot;There&#x27;s always something good going down at Mr. Sub&quot;; and &quot;Oh Canada, Oh Mr. Sub&quot;. The business&#x27; current slogan is &quot;Yours Since 1968&quot;.

In 1982 a Toronto store was used as a filming location for the TV movie “When We First Met” starring child star Amy Linker from CBS’s Square Pegs.

<doc id="447858" wikidata="Q1637514" url="?curid=447858" title="29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann">
<text>Comet 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, also known as Schwassmann–Wachmann 1, was discovered on November 15, 1927, by Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachmann at the Hamburg Observatory in Bergedorf, Germany.

== Discovery ==
It was discovered photographically, when the comet was in outburst and the magnitude was about 13. Precovery images of the comet from March 4, 1902, were found in 1931 and showed the comet at 12th magnitude.

== Orbit and physical properties ==
The comet reached its most recent perihelion on March 7, 2019. It also came to its last opposition in late December 2022.

The comet is a member of a class of objects called &quot;Centaurs&quot;, of which at least 500 are known. These are small icy bodies with orbits between those of Jupiter and Neptune. The Centaurs have been recently perturbed inward from the Kuiper belt, a disk of trans-Neptunian objects occupying a region extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. Frequent perturbations by Jupiter will likely accumulate and cause the comet to migrate either inward or outward by the year 4000. A number of Centaurs appear to be dynamically and perhaps even physically related to 29P; such objects may traverse the coma of 29P when in outburst.

The comet nucleus is estimated to be in diameter.

==Outbursts==
The comet is unusual in that while normally hovering at around 16th magnitude, it suddenly undergoes an outburst. This causes the comet to brighten by 1 to 5 magnitudes. This happens with a frequency of 7.3 outbursts per year, fading within a week or two. The magnitude of the comet has been known to vary from 18th magnitude to 10th magnitude, a more than thousand-fold increase in brightness, during its brightest outbursts. On 14 January 2021, an outburst was observed with brightness from 16.6 to 15.0 magnitude, and consistent with the 7.3 outbursts per year noted earlier. Outbursts are very sudden, rising to maximum in about 2 hours, which is indicative of their cryovolcanic origin; and with the times of outburst modulated by an underlying 57-day periodicity possibly suggesting that its large nucleus is an extremely slow rotator.

<text>Chain rhyme is a rhyme scheme that links together stanzas by carrying a rhyme over from one stanza to the next.

A number of verse forms use chain rhyme as an integral part of their structures. One example is terza rima, which is written in tercets with a rhyming pattern ABA BCB CDC. Another is the virelai ancien, which rhymes AABAAB BBCBBC CCDCCD.

Other verse forms may also use chain rhyme. For instance, quatrains can be written to the following pattern: AABA BBCB CCDC.

There are a few well-known examples of chain rhyme in world literature. In the Persian language, chain rhyme is almost exclusively devoted to the poetic form of the Rubaiyat: a poem that makes use of quatrains with the rhyme scheme AABA. Though not necessarily chain rhyme, the Rubiyat form has been mimicked throughout the world. Robert Frost made use of Rubaiyat in chain rhyme form in his poem, &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.&quot;

Chain rhyme also known as “chain verse or interlocking rhyme&quot; is a type of poetic technique where the poet uses the last syllable of a line and repeats it as the first syllable of the line following. Although the syllable is repeated, it carries a different meaning. The word “chain” is defined as a series of things connected or following in succession. The repetition of a word from a verse of stanza following the next creates a chain like connection between the lines. 

Rhymes are pleasing to the ears and help to distinguish similarities and differences. It helps the poet to shape the poem and the reader to understand it; creating a link between sound and thought. 

==Examples==

Two examples of chained verse from William T. Dobson &quot;Poetical ingenuities and eccentricities&quot;, London, 1882 (see text here for the sources of these examples)

Truth

&quot;Nerve thy soul with doctrines noble,&quot; 
&quot;Noble in the walks of time,&quot; 
&quot;Time that leads to an eternal,&quot;
&quot;An eternal life sublime.&quot;
&quot;Life sublime in moral beauty,&quot; 
&quot;Beauty that shall never be;&quot;
&quot;Ever be to lure thee onward,&quot;
&quot;Onward to the fountain free.&quot;
&quot;Free to every earnest seeker,&quot;
&quot;Seeker for the fount of youth;&quot;
&quot;Youth exultant in its beauty,&quot;
&quot;Beauty of the living truth.&quot;

This is also quoted as an example of chained verse in George Lansing Raymond’s &quot;Rhythm and Harmony in Poetry and Music&quot;, where it is described as an example taken from &quot;the excellent manual on &quot;English Versification&quot; of J. C. Parsons&quot; which is probably James C. Parsons &quot;English versification for the use of students&quot;, Boston, 1891, which also quotes this example.

(in the web page Poetry through the ages (Webexhibits) this poem is erroneously described as a translation of an anonymous French poem and Raymond&#x27;s book is erroneously described as &quot;a major anthology in America’s colleges and universities in the 1890s and 1900s&quot;)

An untitled poem by John Byrom:

&quot;My spirit longeth for thee&quot;
&quot;Within my troubled breast,&quot;
&quot;Although I be unworthy&quot;
&quot;Of so divine a guest.&quot;
&quot;Of so divine a guest,&quot;
&quot;Unworthy though I be&quot;
&quot;Yet has my heart no rest,&quot;
&quot;Unless it comes from thee.&quot;
&quot;Unless it comes from thee&quot;
&quot;In vain I look around,&quot;
&quot;In all that I can see,&quot;
&quot;No rest is to be found.&quot;
&quot;No rest is to be found&quot;
&quot;But in thy blessed love,&quot;
&quot;Oh let my wish be crowned,&quot;
&quot;And send it from above.&quot;

This example is also cited in the books by George Lansing Raymond and James C. Parsons.

The form is also used in other languages. For instance, the popular French song &quot;Trois petits chats&quot; consists of chain verse.

<text>Cornelius Ryan (5 June 1920 – 23 November 1974) was an Irish journalist and author known mainly for writing popular military history. He was especially known for his histories of World War II events: &quot;The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day&quot; (1959), &quot;The Last Battle&quot; (1966), and &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1974).

Born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, he began working as a journalist in London in 1940. He became involved in covering World War II and travelled with troops in Europe. After the war, he covered the establishment of Israel. He immigrated to the United States in 1947 to work for &quot;Time&quot;. In 1951 Ryan became a naturalized US citizen and lived there for the remainder of his life.

==Early life and education==
Ryan was born in Dublin and educated at Synge Street CBS, Portobello, Dublin, Ireland. He was an altar boy at St Kevin&#x27;s Church, Harrington Street and studied the violin at the Irish Academy of Music in Dublin. He was a boy scout in the 52nd Troop of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and travelled on their pilgrimage to Rome on the liner &quot;Lancastria&quot; in 1934.

==Career==
Ryan moved to London in 1940, where he became a war correspondent for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1941. He initially covered the air war in Europe. After the US entered the war, he flew along on fourteen bombing missions with the Eighth and Ninth United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). He joined General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army and covered its actions until the end of the European war in 1945. That year he transferred to the Pacific theater until the war ended there. He travelled to Jerusalem in 1946 to cover the end of the Palestinian mandate and rise of an independent Israel.

Ryan emigrated to the United States in 1947 to work for &quot;Time&quot;. He reported on the postwar tests of atomic weapons carried out by the United States in the Pacific. He also reported for &quot;Time&quot; on the Israeli war in 1948. This was followed by work for other magazines, including &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

He married Kathryn Morgan (1925–1993), a novelist. Ryan became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1951.

On a trip to Normandy in 1949, Ryan became interested in telling a more complete story of Operation Overlord than had been produced to date. He began compiling information and conducting over 1000 interviews as he gathered stories from both the Allies and the Germans, as well as French civilians.

In 1956 he began to write down his World War II notes for &quot;The Longest Day: 6 June 1944 D-Day&quot;, which tells the story of the D-Day Invasion of Normandy. He completed it and published it in 1959. It was an instant success, and film rights were purchased. Ryan helped to write the screenplay for the 1962 The Longest Day. Darryl F. Zanuck paid the author US$175,000 for the screen rights to the book.

Ryan&#x27;s 1957 book &quot;One Minute to Ditch!&quot; is about the successful ocean ditching of a Pan American Boeing 377 Stratocruiser. After publishing an article about the ditching for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in their 21 December 1956, issue, Ryan expanded it and developed it as a book.

His next work was &quot;The Last Battle&quot; (1966), about the Battle of Berlin. The book contains detailed accounts from all perspectives: civilian, and American, British, Russian and German military. It deals with the fraught military and political situation in mid-1945, when the western Allies and the Soviet Union competed to liberate Berlin and occupy Germany. The book contains echoes Soviet disinformation about their investigation of the death of Adolf Hitler, namely that they found Hitler&#x27;s body instead of a body double (along with Hitler&#x27;s liberated dental remains).

Ryan followed this work by &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1974), which tells the story of Operation Market Garden, the ill-fated assault by Allied airborne forces on the Netherlands, culminating in the Battle of Arnhem. This work was also adapted for the cinema and released as a major 1977 film of the same name.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1970, and struggled to finish &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; during his illness. He died in Manhattan, while on tour promoting the book, two months after its publication in 1974. He is buried in the Ridgebury Cemetery in northern Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Four years after his death, his widow Kathryn Morgan Ryan published a memoir about his last years, entitled &quot;A Private Battle&quot; (1978). She based it on notes that he had secretly left behind for that purpose.

For many years Ryan&#x27;s editor at Simon &amp; Schuster was Peter Schwed, who was assisted by Michael Korda. Ryan&#x27;s literary agent was Paul Gitlin.

<doc id="447864" wikidata="Q5114" url="?curid=447864" title="Stephan's Quintet">
<text>Stephan&#x27;s Quintet is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four form the first compact galaxy group ever discovered. The group, visible in the constellation Pegasus, was discovered by Édouard Stephan in 1877 at the Marseille Observatory.
The group is the most studied of all the compact galaxy groups. The brightest member of the visual grouping (and the only non-member of the true group) is NGC 7320, which has extensive H II regions, identified as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring.

Four of the five galaxies in Stephan&#x27;s Quintet form a physical association, a true galaxy group, Hickson Compact Group 92, and will likely merge with each other. Radio observations in the early 1970s revealed a filament of emission between the galaxies in the group. This same region is also detected in the faint glow of ionized atoms seen in the visible part of the spectrum as a green arc.

Space telescopes have provided new insight into the nature of the filament, which is now believed to be a shock-wave in the intergalactic gas, caused by one galaxy (NGC 7318B) falling into the center of the group at several million kilometres per hour.

Stephan&#x27;s Quintet was selected as one of the five cosmic objects observed by the James Webb Space Telescope as part of the release of its first official science images.

== Emissions ==

=== X-rays ===
As NGC 7318B collides with gas in the group, a huge shock wave bigger than the Milky Way spreads throughout the medium between the galaxies, heating some of the gas to temperatures of millions of degrees where they emit X-rays detectable with the NASA Chandra X-ray Observatory.

===Molecular hydrogen emission===

The NASA Spitzer Space Telescope, which detects infrared radiation, discovered a very powerful molecular hydrogen signal from the shock wave between the galaxies. This emission is one of the most turbulent formations of molecular hydrogen ever seen, and the strongest emission originates near the center of the green area in the visible light picture discussed earlier. This phenomenon was discovered by an international team led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and including scientists from Australia, Germany and China. The detection of molecular hydrogen from the collision was initially unexpected because the hydrogen molecule is very fragile and is easily destroyed in shock waves of the kind expected in Stephan&#x27;s Quintet. However, one solution is that when a shock front moves through a cloudy medium like the center of the group, millions of smaller shocks are produced in a turbulent layer, and this can allow molecular hydrogen to survive.
===Redshift===

NGC 7320 indicates a small redshift (790 km/s) while the other four exhibit large redshifts (near 6,600 km/s). Since galactic redshift is proportional to distance, NGC 7320 is only a foreground projection and is ~39 million light-years from Earth, making it a possible member of the NGC 7331 group, versus the 210–340 million light-years of the other four.

NGC 7319 has a type 2 Seyfert nucleus.

A sixth galaxy, NGC 7320C, probably belongs to the Hickson association: it has a redshift similar to the Hickson galaxies, and a tidal tail appears to connect it with NGC 7319.

===Infrared===
Using its Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI), the James Webb Space Telescope shows details shrouded by dust in visible light including large shock waves and tidal tails in four of the five galaxies, and previously hidden areas of star formation. These new details will contribute to insights on galaxy evolution.

<text>Kinderdijk () is a town in the municipality of Molenlanden, in the province of South Holland, Netherlands. It is located about east of Rotterdam.

Kinderdijk is situated in the Alblasserwaard polder at the confluence of the Lek and Noord rivers. To drain the polder, a system of 19 windmills was built around 1740. This group of mills is the largest concentration of old windmills in the Netherlands. The windmills of Kinderdijk are one of the best-known Dutch tourist sites. They have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997.

== Etymology ==
The name Kinderdijk is Dutch for &quot;Children dike&quot;. During the Saint Elizabeth flood of 1421, the Grote Hollandse Waard flooded, but the Alblasserwaard polder stayed unflooded. It is often said that when the horrendous storm had subsided, a villager went to the dike between these two areas to inspect what could be salvaged. In the distance he saw a wooden cradle floating on the water. As it came nearer, some movement was noted, and upon closer investigation, a cat was found, trying to keep it in balance by leaping back and forth in such a manner that water couldn&#x27;t flood the cradle. As the cradle eventually came close enough to the dike for a bystander to pick up the cradle, he saw that a baby was quietly sleeping inside it, nice and dry. The cat had kept the cradle balanced and afloat. This folktale and legend has been published as &quot;The Cat and the Cradle&quot; in English.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Kinderdijk first originated its name in 1421 from a legend where a wave was said to have washed ashore a cradle that contained a sleeping baby.

=== Early years ===

In the Alblasserwaard, problems with water became more and more apparent in the 13th century. Large canals, called &quot;weteringen&quot; in Dutch, were dug to get rid of the excess water in the polders. However, the drained soil continued to subside, while the level of the river rose due to the river&#x27;s sand deposits. After a few centuries, an additional way to keep the polders dry was required.

=== Construction ===
It was decided to build a series of windmills, with a limited capacity to bridge water level differences, but just able to pump water into a reservoir at an intermediate level between the soil in the polder and the river.

The reservoir could be pumped out into the river by other windmills whenever the river level was low enough; the river level has both seasonal and tidal variations. Although some of the windmills are still used, the main water works are provided by two diesel pumping stations near one of the entrances of the windmills site.

===World Heritage Site===
Kinderdijk was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. The village is a fascinating rural landscape with a total of 19 monument 18th-century windmills.

== In popular culture ==
* In the 2005 PlayStation 2 video game &quot;Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves&quot;, Kinderdijk is the third playable location. Several missions include utilizing the iconic windmills to aid the main character, Sly, in a biplane dogfight over the village.
* Kinderdijk is a stage in the fighting game &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001&quot;. The players fight in front of the windmills in a verdant field.

<text>Viennese Actionism was a short-lived art movement in the late 20th-century that spanned the 1960s into the 1970s. It is regarded as part of the independent efforts made during the 1960s to develop the issues of performance art, Fluxus, happening, action painting, and body art. Its main participants were Günter Brus, Otto Mühl, Hermann Nitsch, and Rudolf Schwarzkogler. Others involved in the movement include Anni Brus, Heinz Cibulka and Valie Export. Many of the Actionists have continued their artistic work independently of Viennese Actionism movement.

==Art and the politics of transgression==
The work of the Actionists developed concurrently with—but largely independently from—other &quot;avant garde&quot; movements of the era that shared an interest in rejecting object-based or otherwise commodifiable art practices. The practice of staging precisely scored &quot;Actions&quot; in controlled environments or before audiences bears similarities to the Fluxus concept of enacting an &quot;event score&quot; and is a forerunner to performance art.

The work of the Viennese Actionists is probably best remembered for the wilful transgressiveness of its naked bodies, destructiveness and violence. Often, brief jail terms were served by participants for violations of decency laws, and their works were targets of moral outrage. In June 1968 Günter Brus began serving a six-month prison sentence for the crime of &quot;degrading symbols of the state&quot; after an action in Vienna at which he simultaneously masturbated, covered his body with his own faeces and sang the Austrian national anthem, and later fled the country to avoid a second arrest. Otto Mühl served a one-month prison term after his participation in a public event, &quot;Art and Revolution&quot; in 1968. After his &quot;Piss Action&quot; before a Munich audience, Mühl became a fugitive from the West German police. Hermann Nitsch served a two-week prison term in 1965 after his participation with Rudolf Schwarzkogler in the &quot;Festival of Psycho-Physical Naturalism&quot;. The &quot;Destruction in Art Symposium&quot;, held in London in 1966, marked the first encounter between members of Fluxus and the Actionists. It proved to be a landmark international recognition for the work of Brus, Mühl and Nitsch.

Malcolm Green has quoted Hermann Nitsch&#x27;s comment, &quot;Vienna Actionism never was a group. A number of artists reacted to particular situations that they all encountered, within a particular time period, and with similar means and results.&quot; While the nature and content of each artist&#x27;s work differed, there are distinct aesthetic and thematic threads connecting the Actions of Brus, Mühl, Nitsch, and Schwarzkogler. Use of the body as both surface and site of art-making seems to have been a common point of origin for the Actionists in their earliest departures from conventional painting practices in the late &#x27;50s and early &#x27;60s. Brus&#x27; &quot;Hand Painting Head Painting&quot; action of 1964, Mühl and Nitsch&#x27;s &quot;Degradation of a Female Body, Degradation of A Venus&quot; of 1963 are characterized by their efforts to re-conceive human bodies as surfaces for the production of art. The trajectories of the Actionists&#x27; work suggests more than just a precedent to later performance art and body art, rather, a drive toward a totalizing art-practice is inherent in their refusing to be confined within conventional ideas of painting, theatre and sculpture. Mühl&#x27;s 1964 &quot;Material Action Manifesto&quot; offers some theoretical framework for understanding this: ...material action is painting that has spread beyond the picture surface. The human body, a laid table or a room becomes the picture surface. Time is added to the dimension of the body and space.
A 1967 revision of the same manifesto Mühl wrote: ... material action promises the direct pleasures of the table. Material action satiates. Far more important than baking bread is the urge to take dough-beating to the extreme.
Brus and Mühl participated in the &quot;Kunst und Revolution&quot; (&quot;Art and Revolution&quot;) event in Vienna, June 1968, issuing the following proclamation: ... our assimilatory democracy maintains art as a safety valve for enemies of the state ... the consumer state drives a wave of &quot;art&quot; before itself; it attempts to bribe the &quot;artist&quot; and thus to rehabilitate his revolutionising &quot;art&quot; as an art that supports the state. But &quot;art&quot; is not art. &quot;Art&quot; is politics that has created new styles of communication.

==Actionists and experimental film in Vienna==
Much of the existing moving-image documentation of Viennese Actionist work survives because of strong ties between the Actionists and art/experimental filmmaking of the 1960s. The Austrian filmmaker Kurt Kren participated in the documentation of Actions as early as 1964, producing a body of Actionist related works that stand as historic avant-garde films in their own right for their use of rapid editing. As well, Otto Muehl produced a significant body of Actionist related film work that has been celebrated in Amos Vogel&#x27;s &quot;Film as a Subversive Art.&quot;
Films of and related to Actionist performance remain available through the Vienna-based Sixpack film distributor and the U.S. distribution cooperatives Canyon Cinema and The Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative. In 2005 the Actionist films of Kurt Kren were issued on video by the Austrian publisher INDEX DVD.

<text>U.S. Route 41, also U.S. Highway 41 (US 41), is a major north–south United States Numbered Highway that runs from Miami, Florida, to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Until 1949, the part in southern Florida, from Naples to Miami, was US 94. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus is in the Brickell neighborhood of Downtown Miami at an intersection with Brickell Avenue (US 1), and its northern terminus is east of Copper Harbor, Michigan, at a modest cul-de-sac near Fort Wilkins Historic State Park at the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula. US 41 is closely paralleled by Interstate 75 (I-75) from Naples, Florida, all the way through Georgia to Chattanooga, Tennessee.

===Florida===
In Florida, US 41 is paralleled by Interstate 75 all the way from Miami to Georgia (on the northern border), and I-75 has largely supplanted US 41 as a major highway.

Between Miami and Naples, US 41 is signed east–west and cuts across the Florida peninsula, running through the vast Everglades wilderness. This section has been designated a National Scenic Byway. The byway runs east–west through the Big Cypress National Preserve, skirting the northern border of the Everglades National Park for about . The part of the highway between Tampa and Miami is known as the Tamiami Trail (derived from the combination of the names of the road&#x27;s two termini, Tampa and Miami), thus, this section of the road is commonly known as the East Trail, as it runs east–west across the state, in contrast to the road&#x27;s otherwise distinctively north–south route. In Naples, Route 41 changes direction at an intersection with 5th Avenue in Downtown Naples, turning from west to north towards Tampa (or from south to east towards Miami).

As the Trail moves into Hillsborough County the historic communities of Ruskin, Florida and Gibsonton, Florida are south Hillsborough County high points. Ruskin was founded by the Commongood Society. Highway 41 from Ruskin&#x27;s Little Manatee River to Big Bend Rd (CR 672) has been designated by the Florida Senate as the Trooper Kenneth E. Flynt Highway in Memory of Florida Trooper Flynt who was killed in the line of duty. Gibsonton was populated by Carnival workers.

US 41 is in the process of being widened throughout the northern Tampa Bay suburbs. It is currently six lanes wide between Tampa, Lutz, and much of Land o&#x27; Lakes, and again between Garden Grove and Brooksville. It is also four lanes wide in Tampa south of BUS US 41, between a section north of Land o&#x27; Lakes, Masaryktown, and Garden Grove, and south of Inverness. A large portion of US 41 is co-designated along the unmarked State Road 45 between Belle Meade and High Springs.

From US 92 in Tampa to US 41 Business and State Road 676 near the unincorporated Palm River-Clair Mel, US 41 carries the unsigned State Road 599 designation. It contains the northern end of the Tamiami Trail at the SR 60 intersection. It is normally three lanes wide, but between Interstate 4 and the northern terminus of SR 569 it is only two lanes wide. The unsigned state highway is long. At the northern terminus, US 41 turns west. (If one continues straight, 40th Street leads to Busch Gardens Tampa.) Major intersections include State Road 574, SR 569, I-4, SR 60, and the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 618).

In Northern Florida, US 41 runs along the DeSoto Trail between Floral City and Williston and again between High Springs, and Lake City.

===Georgia===
In Georgia, US 41 is paralleled by Interstate 75 all the way from Florida to Tennessee, and I-75 has largely supplanted US 41 as a major highway.

The first major city in Georgia north of Florida is Valdosta, and the primary US 41 has been rerouted to run along Inner Perimeter Road around Valdosta; there is a business route through Valdosta. The highway follows I-75 north of Valdosta from exit 22 to exit 29.

The highway proceeds through South and Central Georgia cities and towns including Adel, Tifton, Cordele, Unadilla, Perry, Warner Robins, Macon, Barnesville, and Griffin as it approaches the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Atlanta Motor Speedway is located on US 19 and US 41 in Hampton, south of Atlanta. Tara Boulevard and Metropolitan Parkway carry the highway, along with its co-signed partner US 19, north into the city. In Hapeville, just outside Atlanta, the highway serves the northeastern part of Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, passing near the headquarters of Delta Air Lines.

In Atlanta, Highway 41 was formerly carried on Spring Street near Five Points, but it has long been re-routed via Northside Drive around the downtown area. (It was a major truck route.) The Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Georgia World Congress Center, and State Farm Arena are located off Northside Drive. North of Atlanta, the stretch of Highway 41 between Atlanta and Marietta was the first four-laned highway in Georgia when it was completed in 1938. Now, the Northside Parkway and the Cobb Parkway carry US 41 through northern Fulton and Cobb counties. This thoroughfare is the home of Truist Park, the Big Chicken, Cumberland Mall, the Cobb Galleria, and the Six Flags White Water amusement park. US 41 also passes through Marietta, Kennesaw, Acworth, Cartersville, Adairsville, Calhoun, and Dalton en route to Tennessee.

===Tennessee===

US 41, joined by US 76, enters Tennessee east of I-75 on the outskirts of East Ridge. It is called Ringgold Road through East Ridge up to the Bachman Tunnel, where it enters Chattanooga and then around the base of Lookout Mountain. It then heads through the towns of Lookout Valley, Jasper, and other communities before ascending the Cumberland Plateau, running through Tracy City and Monteagle, where it descends toward Manchester.

After reaching Monteagle, US 41, included as part of the older Dixie Highway, continues northwest into Pelham, in Grundy County, then runs closely parallel with I-24 into Coffee County, going through Hillsboro, Manchester (where the road is also named Hillsboro Boulevard) and Beechgrove, before entering Rutherford County. From there, the highway continues diagonally through Murfreesboro (where the road is also named Broad Street), where the Dixie Highway joins up with US 70S. The Stones River National Battlefield is located very near US 41/US 70S on the northwest side, standing as a monument of the Battle of Stones River which took place during the American Civil War. US 41/US 70S continues northwest through Smyrna, and LaVergne before reaching Davidson County. The road passes through Antioch, before reaching Nashville, where US 41 separates from US 70S. US 41 goes through Nashville as Murfreesboro Road, then Dickerson Pike, and comes out on the northeast side of the city joined with US 31W. US 41 continues northeast through Goodlettsville before breaking away from US 31W. US 41 then goes northwest and continues on into Robertson County, going through Springfield before heading west/northwest to the Kentucky border. Just before reaching Kentucky, US 41 briefly runs through Montgomery County.

===Kentucky===
US 41 enters the state as a two-lane highway in Guthrie where it intersects US 79 and continues through Todd County through Trenton. After crossing into Christian County, US 41 goes through Pembroke before reaching Hopkinsville. In Hopkinsville, US 41 intersects the US 68 bypass and the Pennryrile Parkway which leads into downtown Hopkinsville. In downtown, US 41 has a short concurrency with US 68/KY 80 and has an intersection with the northern end of US 41A. Finally, after an intersection with the northern Hopkinsville bypass, US 41 turns to Crofton and northern Christian County.

After crossing into Hopkins County, US 41 has an incomplete intersection with the Pennyrile Parkway and goes through the small towns of Nortonville (and an intersection with US 62), Mortons Gap, Earlington. In Madisonville, US 41 is known as Main Street and has an intersection with the southern end of US 41 Alternate. After an incomplete interchange with I-69, US 41 continues onto Hanson. In eastern Webster, US 41 goes through the towns of Slaughters and Sebree. In Henderson County, US 41 enters Robards and remains a rural two-lane highway before reaching KY 425, just to the south of the Henderson city limits. At KY 425, US 41 turns to the east and intersects the current northern end of I-69 in Kentucky.

At this point, US 41 becomes a limited access four-lane highway with intersections with the Audubon Parkway, KY 2084, KY 351, and US 60. At US 60, US 41 becomes a four-lane surface road with stoplights as it crosses through the northern parts of Henderson and John James Audubon State Park. US 41 crosses the Ohio River on the Bi-State Vietnam Gold Star Bridges, known locally as the &quot;Twin Bridges.&quot; Due to natural fluctuations of the Ohio River&#x27;s path, US 41 remains in Kentucky for about one mile north of the Twin Bridges. In this section, US 41 passes by Ellis Park Race Course before crossing into Evansville, IN.

===Indiana===
In the state of Indiana, US 41 runs from the Ohio River south of Evansville to Chicago with US 12 and US 20 beneath the termini of the Chicago Skyway and the Indiana Toll Road. This is a distance of approximately 282 miles (615 km).

For its entire length north of Evansville, US 41 passes through largely rural portions of far western Indiana. It overlaps US 150 and US 52 through some of these areas. US 41 is also the main north–south road through Terre Haute. However north of Terre Haute, US 41 becomes a secondary road, passing through smaller towns such as Rockville and Attica on the east side of the Wabash River. State Road 63 is the main route north of Terre Haute in this area since it is a four-lane highway on the west side of the Wabash River. US 41 returns to a four-lane divided highway just south of Boswell where SR 63 ends, staying as such until reaching Cedar Lake. From Cedar Lake north to the Illinois state line, US 41 is a well-travelled road with numerous stoplights, with the exception of the mile-stretch where it overlaps Interstate 80/94. Before leaving Indiana, US 41 travels through the city of Hammond where it is also known as Indianapolis Boulevard and Calumet Avenue. Hammond is the largest city traversed by US 41 between Evansville and Chicago.

===Illinois===

US 41 enters Illinois cosigned with US 12 and US 20 on Indianapolis Boulevard beneath the Chicago Skyway. At the Illinois–Indiana state line, US 41 enters the Chicago city limits. The three US routes run together northwest along Indianapolis Boulevard then cut north on Ewing Avenue on the south side. At 95th Street, US 12 and 20 head west. US 41 then runs along the lake amongst the newly developed extension of Lake Shore Drive, which extends from the intersection of Ewing Avenue and Harbor Drive and continues northwest until it reaches 79th St and South Shore Dr. US 41 then continues down South Shore Drive through the South Shore neighborhood and then turns and moves in a northerly direction at the intersection of South Shore Drive and Marquette Drive (Lake Shore Drive continues north while Marquette continues south and eventually becomes Jeffery Blvd.)

US 41, as Lake Shore Drive, passes by the Museum of Science and Industry (at 57th Street) in the Hyde Park area. From here north, US 41 is a quasi-expressway with bridges too low to admit trucks, and a speed zone, and exits at 53rd Street/Hyde Park Boulevard, 50th Street, 47th Street, Oakwood Boulevard, 31st Street, Interstate 55, and 18th Street. After the I-55 bridges, US 41 passes McCormick Place, which is the largest convention center in North America. At this point, the roadway becomes a boulevard passing the Museum Campus (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium) and Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears; access to these attractions is provided at 18th Street.

The roadway continues north with a couple of signals as it passes through Grant Park and by Buckingham Fountain. After the signal at Monroe Street, the roadway becomes a quasi-expressway again with exits at Randolph Street/Wacker Drive, Illinois Street/Grand Avenue (Navy Pier exit), and a signal at Chicago Avenue. The roadway then has a sharp S-curve called the Oak Street Curve where the suggested speed limit is . After the curve, US 41 is a full expressway. US 41 exits at Foster Avenue but Lake Shore Drive continues north to Bryn Mawr Avenue and Hollywood Avenue before ending.

At Broadway, US 41 intersects the eastern terminus of US 14. US 41 continues along Lincoln Avenue in the north side of the city, eventually meeting Skokie Boulevard/Cicero Avenue, where US 41 turns north and is paralleled by Interstate 94. In the northern suburbs of Chicago, US 41 joins I-94 (Edens Expressway) just north of Lake Avenue for a short distance before splitting from the freeway just south of Lake–Cook Road and continuing north as the Skokie Highway for roughly to a point near the Wisconsin border. Just south of the border, US 41 rejoins I-94. The two co-signed routes continue northward into Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===
In Wisconsin, US 41 runs north and south along the eastern edge of the state. It enters from Illinois in Pleasant Prairie and is concurrent with Interstate 94 north to Milwaukee. In Milwaukee, US 41 follows Interstate 894 around the southern and western sides of the city. US 41 then heads north-northwest on a freeway to Fond du Lac and Oshkosh, then northeast to Appleton and Green Bay. The route is a major access point for the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show in Oshkosh, and for Lambeau Field, home of the Green Bay Packers. Beyond Green Bay, US 41 continues on to Oconto and Peshtigo before reaching the Michigan border at Marinette. US 41 is a freeway for nearly 70% of its length through Wisconsin, with the exceptions being an expressway section north of Green Bay and surface streets in Marinette.

US 41 was officially designated Interstate 41 between Green Bay and the Wisconsin–Illinois state line on April 9, 2015. I-41 has been cosigned with US 41 along the freeway sections between a point just south of the Illinois state line where US 41 and I-94 split, and the I-43 interchange northwest of Green Bay.

===Michigan===
US 41 is a state trunkline highway that enters Michigan via the Interstate Bridge between Marinette, Wisconsin, and Menominee, Michigan. Along its nearly route, US 41 serves as a major conduit for Michigan traffic, serving the Central Upper Peninsula and the Copper Country. From the Michigan–Wisconsin border to downtown Houghton, the highway is part of the National Highway System. The trunkline comprises mostly two lanes, undivided except for sections that run concurrently with US 2 near Escanaba or M-28 near Marquette. US 41/M-28 is a four-lane expressway along the Marquette Bypass, and segments of the highway in Delta and Marquette counties have four lanes. The route carries the designation of the Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway between Hancock and Copper Harbor. The trunkline ends at a cul-de-sac east of Fort Wilkins Historic State Park in Copper Harbor.

Along its route, US 41 passes through farm fields, forest lands, and along the Lake Superior shoreline. The highway is included in the Lake Superior Circle Tour and the Lake Michigan Circle Tour. It also passes through the Hiawatha National Forest and the Keweenaw National Historical Park. Historical landmarks along the trunkline include the Marquette Branch Prison, Peshekee River Bridge, and the Quincy Mine.

==History==
When their routes were originally laid out in 1926, US 41&#x27;s southern endpoint was in Naples, Florida, at the western endpoint of US 94, which ran east to Miami. In 1949, US 94 was decommissioned, and the entire route became part of US 41, giving it an east–west section that retained the hidden SR 90 designation. The former US 94 ended in Miami at the same intersection where US 41 (and SR 90) do now. In 1953, US 41 was extended along US 1 and State Road A1A (SR A1A) to terminate in Miami Beach, Florida, but it was truncated back to the earlier terminus in 2000. Prior to 1993, when the Florida Department of Transportation color-coded U.S. highways in Florida, the color used for US 41 was orange.

US 41 initially took a more westerly route between Nashville, Tennessee, and Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The current US 41 was US 241. In 1930, the two routes became US 41W and US 41E, but in 1943 the western route became US 41 Alternate, with the main US 41 moving to the east route.

In July 2005, efforts started in Congress to re-designate US 41 between Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin, as I-41. Those efforts came to fruition in April 2015, almost ten years later, with US 41 signage mostly replaced by I-41 starting at the Illinois state line, following I-894 around the west end of Milwaukee, and on to Green Bay.

<doc id="447881" wikidata="Q51522" url="?curid=447881" title="Sydney Pollack">
<text>Sydney Irwin Pollack (July 1, 1934 – May 26, 2008) was an American film director, producer, and actor. Pollack is known for directing commercially and critically acclaimed studio films. Over his forty year career he received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award as well as nominations for three Golden Globe Awards and six BAFTA Awards.

Pollack won the Academy Award for Best Director and Best Picture for &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985). He was also nominated for Best Director Oscars for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), and &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982). Pollack&#x27;s other notable films include &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; (1972), &quot;The Way We Were&quot; (1973), &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; (1981), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), and &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1995).

Pollack produced and acted in &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; (2007), and produced numerous films such as &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot; (1989), &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1995), &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; (1999), &quot;Iris&quot; (2001), &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008). Pollack acted in &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1993), and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999).

==Early life==
Pollack was born in Lafayette, Indiana, to a family of Jewish immigrants, the son of Rebecca (née Miller) and David Pollack, a semi-professional boxer and pharmacist. The family relocated to South Bend and his parents divorced when he was young. His mother, who suffered from alcoholism and emotional problems, died at the age of 37, when Pollack was 16.

Despite earlier plans to attend college and then medical school, Pollack left Indiana for New York City soon after finishing high school at age 17. Pollack studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre from 1952 to 1954, working on a lumber truck between terms.

He was drafted for two years of army service as a truck driver at Fort Carson, Colorado ending in 1958. He returned to the Playhouse at Meisner&#x27;s invitation to become his assistant. In 1960, John Frankenheimer, a friend of Pollack, asked him to come to Los Angeles to work as a dialogue coach for the child actors on Frankenheimer&#x27;s first big picture, &quot;The Young Savages&quot;. It was during this time that Pollack met Burt Lancaster, who encouraged the young actor to try directing.

==Career==
Pollack played a director in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Templeton&quot; in 1960. He made his feature film debut as an actor in Denis Sanders&#x27; &quot;War Hunt&quot; (1962) where he met Robert Redford, who would go on to be the male lead in seven of Pollack&#x27;s films as director.

He found his real success in television in the 1960s by directing episodes of series, such as &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. After doing TV he made the jump into film with a string of movies that drew public attention. His film-directing debut was &quot;The Slender Thread&quot; (1965). Over time, Pollack&#x27;s films received a total of 48 Academy Award nominations, winning 11 Oscars. His first Oscar nomination was for his 1969 film &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot;, and his second in 1982 for &quot;Tootsie&quot;. For his 1985 film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford, Pollack won Academy Awards for directing and producing.

During his career, he directed 12 actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Jane Fonda, Gig Young, Susannah York, Barbra Streisand, Paul Newman, Melinda Dillon, Jessica Lange, Dustin Hoffman, Teri Garr, Meryl Streep, Klaus Maria Brandauer and Holly Hunter. Young and Lange won Oscars for their performances in Pollack&#x27;s films.

In 1984, he helped found the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, becoming co-chairman.

One of a select group of non- and/or former actors awarded membership in the Actors Studio, Pollack resumed acting in the 1990s with appearances in such films as Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999), often playing corrupt or morally conflicted power figures. As a character actor, Pollack appeared in films such as &quot;A Civil Action&quot;, and &quot;Changing Lanes&quot;, as well as his own, including &quot;Random Hearts&quot; and &quot;The Interpreter&quot; (the latter also being his final non-documentary film as a director). He also appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; as a New York lawyer undergoing a midlife crisis, and in Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; as an emergency room doctor. His last role was as Patrick Dempsey&#x27;s father in the 2008 romantic comedy &quot;Made of Honor&quot;, which was playing in theaters at the time of his death. He was a recurring guest star on the NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, playing Will Truman&#x27;s (Eric McCormack) unfaithful but loving father, George. In addition to earlier appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot;, in 2007, Pollack made guest appearances on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot;.

Pollack received the first annual Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking award from the Austin Film Festival on October 21, 2006. As a producer he helped to guide many films that were successful with both critics and movie audiences, such as &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, and &quot;Michael Clayton&quot;, a film in which he also starred opposite George Clooney and for which he received his sixth Academy Award nomination, in the Best Picture category. He formed a production company called Mirage Enterprises with the English director Anthony Minghella. The last film they produced together, &quot;The Reader&quot;, earned them both posthumous Oscar nominations for Best Picture. Besides his many feature film laurels, Pollack was nominated for five Primetime Emmys, earning two: one for directing in 1966 and another for producing, which was given four months after his death in 2008.

The moving image collection of Sydney Pollack is housed at the Academy Film Archive.

==Influences==
In the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Directors&#x27; Poll, Pollack revealed his top ten films in alphabetical order:

*&quot;Casablanca&quot; (1943)
*&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941)
*&quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970)
*&quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Grand Illusion&quot; (1937)
*&quot;The Leopard&quot; (1963)
*&quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980)
*&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957)
*&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950)
==Personal life and death==
Pollack was married to Claire Bradley Griswold, a former student of his, from 1958 until his death in 2008. They had three children: Steven (1959–1993), Rebecca (b. 1963), and Rachel (b. 1969). In November 1993, Steven died at the age of 34 in the crash of a small, single-engine plane which clipped a power line and burst into flames in Santa Monica, California. Claire Griswold died on March 28, 2011, at 74 years of age, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Concerns about Pollack&#x27;s health surfaced in 2007, when he withdrew from directing HBO&#x27;s television film &quot;Recount&quot;, which aired on May 25, 2008. He died from cancer the following day at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, at the age of 73. He had been diagnosed about ten months prior to his death; the type of cancer has been variously cited as pancreatic, stomach, or of unknown primary origin.

<doc id="447892" wikidata="Q2747741" url="?curid=447892" title="Roy (Fire Emblem)">
<text>is a fictional character from Nintendo and Intelligent Systems&#x27; &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; video game series, who first appeared in the 2001 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; as a representative character from the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, along with Marth. He is the lead character of &quot;Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade&quot;; within the story, he is the son of Eliwood and heir presumptive of Pherae, who eventually becomes a major military leader.

The inclusion of Roy and Marth in &quot;Melee&quot; is cited as one of the reasons Nintendo started localizing the series for international distribution. Roy continues to make recurring appearances in subsequent &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; media, such as a manga series and spin-off video games. Roy received negative reception for his appearance in &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;, with critics noting his poor gameplay attributes. His inclusion in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; was also criticized due to his similarity to other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters also included, as well as his similarity to them in terms of gameplay.

== Appearances ==
Roy is the lead character of &quot;Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade&quot;. The story begins when King Zephiel, ruler of the kingdom of Bern, conquers Ilia and Sacae and sets his sights on Lycia. In a small region called Pherae, Roy, the son of Pherae&#x27;s ruling marquess Eliwood, is forced to return home when Bern begins its invasion. As Eliwood is unable to battle due to illness, Roy is assigned command of Lycia&#x27;s army and eventually assumes command of the army of Etruria. The next installment after &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;, &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot;, is a prequel featuring a younger Eliwood as one of its protagonists. Roy appears during the game&#x27;s epilogue, where Eliwood reunites with his comrade Hector and their respective children are introduced to each other. Roy is available as a playable character in &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot; as DLC. Roy also appears in &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;. In North American &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; character popularity polls running up to the release of &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;, Roy was ranked the second favorite male character behind Ike . He later appears as an Emblem character in &quot;Fire Emblem Engage&quot;.

Roy&#x27;s first video game appearance was in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, where his gameplay was based on Marth&#x27;s, another &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; character featured in the game. He is more powerful and slower than Marth. He was later reintroduced into the series as downloadable content (DLC) for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot; after being absent from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. His inclusion in the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS entries was reportedly leaked, alongside Ryu. He also appears as part of the base roster in the series&#x27; 2018 entry, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. To promote his appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, an amiibo figure of Roy was featured as an exclusive release at GameStop. In 2019, plushies depicting Roy and other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters were released.

Roy appears in the &quot;Fire Emblem: The Champion&#x27;s Blade&quot; manga, which was first published prior to the release of &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; and takes place concurrently with the events of the game.

== Concept and design ==
Roy was created for the cancelled Nintendo 64 entry in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, which had a long development cycle. He was originally named Ike, and was one of only two characters kept when what became &quot;Binding Blade&quot; restarted development in 2000. Roy&#x27;s character was designed to be free-spirited and emphatic to appeal to younger players and a wider audience, in contrast to earlier titles. The renamed Roy was first revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001, where a demo of &quot;Binding Blade&quot; was being shown. Both his design and personality went through multiple revisions through development. He was designed by Eiji Kaneda. At 15, Roy is the youngest &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonist.

Despite &quot;Binding Blade&quot; intending to be released first, delays caused his game to release after &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, which featured Roy as a playable character. When developing &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, Masahiro Sakurai wanted to include more characters who could cross blades with Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; due to his personal preference for sword-fighting characters and campaigned for Roy&#x27;s inclusion. He was added as a character based on fellow &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; protagonist Marth. Sakurai explained that he viewed Roy as an energetic and internally strong character compared to Marth, leading him to designing Roy&#x27;s sword to do more damage at the base as opposed to Marth&#x27;s, where more damage was done at the tip. He remarked that, despite his initial impression of Roy from a description of the character, he found that he was nothing like that after playing &quot;Binding Blade&quot;, exclaiming that his characterization of Roy was not due to a misunderstanding of his character.

Due to the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series being only available in Japan, whether they should be included in the English release of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; was called into question, with Sakurai noting how unusual it was to have characters speak Japanese in English releases at the time. Sakurai stated that there were difficulties getting Marth to remain in the English version, but he pushed hard for his inclusion due to believing he would be fun. He added that there was more dispute over Roy, with Sakurai discussing removal of him with Nintendo of America, though they stated that he would be fun, so he should remain. Their popularity in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; led to Nintendo releasing future &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games outside of Japan. The first of these was &quot;Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade&quot;, which has a younger Roy designed by Sachiko Wada.

Roy is voiced in Japanese by Jun Fukuyama, three years after Fukuyama&#x27;s voice acting debut. Sakurai noted that his vocal performance had changed slightly from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; to his recording session for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, with him having more difficulty doing higher-pitched sounds.

== Reception ==
Roy&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Melee&quot; alongside Marth brought further exposure to the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series outside of Japan, and was cited as a reason Nintendo began to localize and release &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games internationally, beginning with the seventh title in the series. Due to popular demand from Japanese fans, Roy was added in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; as a DLC character. Chris Carter from &quot;Destructoid&quot; welcomed Nintendo&#x27;s decision to reintroduce Roy and considered him his &quot;personal favorite&quot;, although he found that the character played quite differently in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; compared to his previous iteration in &quot;Melee&quot; or to other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters. Lucas M. Thomas from &quot;IGN&quot; felt his moveset in &quot;Melee&quot; was too similar to Marth&#x27;s, preferring Ike replacing him in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. Roy was criticized alongside other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series by &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Cecilia D&#x27;Anastasio along Lucina, Marth and Chrom, mainly due to D&#x27;Anastasio beleving they all fit the same sword fighter archetype. &quot;Die Hard Game Fan&quot; writer Aileen Coe stated that, with the release of &quot;Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword&quot;, fans of Marth and Roy in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; were confused by their absence, assuming that the character Eliwood was Roy.

Roy was the subject of criticism for his low strength in &quot;Binding Blade&quot;, with &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; writer Kurt Kalata feeling that all of his popularity was from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; due to his lack of appearances and his comparative weakness to characters like Ike, Hector, and Sigurd. &quot;Real Sound&quot; writer Kensuke Sakata noted that he had poor growth rates for his stats, including strength and speed, causing him to be used less, especially during the middle of the game where enemies and allies grow more powerful. Mike Moehnke of &quot;RPGamer&quot; criticized his weak in-game attributes for the majority of the game, feeling that this detracted from an otherwise satisfactory gameplay experience. Fellow &quot;RPGamer&quot; writer Sam Wachter felt that his late promotion in the game was a contributing factor to his issues. Other critics agreed, with Marianne Penn of &quot;TheGamer&quot; calling him among the series&#x27; weakest and felt that was a contrast to his role in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Despite these gameplay criticisms, Penn felt that Roy is a decent character in terms of personality, and that his popularity is &quot;rightfully warranted&quot; in spite of his glaring flaws.

<doc id="447904" wikidata="Q2912001" url="?curid=447904" title="Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)">
<text>Richard Lawrence ( – June 13, 1861) was an English-born American house painter who was the first known person to attempt the assassination of a sitting president of the United States. Lawrence attempted to shoot President Andrew Jackson outside the United States Capitol on January 30, 1835, however both of his pistols misfired and he was taken into custody. At trial, Lawrence was found not guilty by reason of insanity and spent the remainder of his life in insane asylums.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in England, most likely around 1800 or 1801. His family migrated to the United States when he was 12 years old and settled in Virginia, near Washington, D.C. Lawrence&#x27;s childhood and early adult years were apparently normal as was his behavior. At his trial, he was described by acquaintances and relatives as a &quot;relatively fine young boy&quot; who was &quot;reserved in his manner; but industrious and of good moral habits.&quot; Lawrence later found work as a house painter. Historians have speculated that Lawrence’s exposure to the toxic chemicals used in paint in the 1800s (including lead, antimony, chromates, sulfides and barium) contributed to his mental illness, which manifested itself when he was in his thirties. Lawrence began exhibiting dissociative behavior and violent tendencies, especially towards his siblings.

==Mental illness==
By November 1832, Lawrence&#x27;s behavior and mental stability had inexplicably changed. He abruptly announced to his family that he was returning to England, and he left Washington shortly thereafter. He returned a month later telling his family he had decided not to travel abroad as it was too cold. Shortly after returning, he again announced that he was returning to England to study landscape painting.

Lawrence left once again and briefly stayed in Philadelphia before returning home. He told his family that &quot;unnamed persons&quot; had prevented him from traveling abroad and that the U.S. government also disapproved of his plan to return to England. Lawrence also claimed that while he was in Philadelphia, he had read several stories about himself in the newspaper that were critical of his travel plans and his character. Lawrence told his family that he had no choice but to return to Washington until he could afford to buy a ship and hire a captain who would sail the ship to England for him.

Around this time, Lawrence abruptly quit his house painting job. When questioned by his sister and brother-in-law, with whom he was living, Lawrence claimed that, because the U.S. government owed him a large sum of money, he did not need to work. Lawrence had come to believe that he was owed money because he was Richard III of England and owned two English estates. Lawrence became convinced that President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s opposition to the Second Bank of the United States was preventing the distribution of the money he believed he was owed. He felt that if Jackson were no longer in office, Vice President Martin Van Buren would establish a national bank and allow Congress to pay him the money for his English estate claims.

Lawrence&#x27;s personality and outward appearance changed dramatically around this time. Once conservatively dressed, Lawrence grew a mustache and began buying expensive and flamboyant clothing, which he would change three or four times a day. He took to standing in the doorway of his home for hours and gazing out into the street. Neighborhood children would jokingly address him as &quot;King Richard&quot;, which typically pleased Lawrence, who failed to realize the children were teasing him. He also became paranoid and hostile towards others. On one occasion, he threatened to kill a maid who he thought was laughing at him. Lawrence also began verbally and physically abusing his family, mainly his sisters, over imagined slights. In one instance, he threatened to hit his sister with a paperweight because he believed that she had been talking about him. At Lawrence&#x27;s trial, witnesses described the bizarre behavior that he exhibited. Several people testified that Lawrence would engage in nonsensical conversations with himself, and others stated that he would have laughing and cursing fits.

==Assassination attempt==

In the weeks leading up to the assassination attempt, Lawrence began observing Jackson&#x27;s movements. Witnesses later testified that Lawrence was often seen sitting in his paint shop muttering to himself about Jackson. On Friday, January 30, 1835, the day of the assassination attempt, Lawrence was seen sitting in his paint shop with a book in his hand while laughing. Lawrence suddenly got up, left the shop and stated, &quot;I&#x27;ll be damned if I don&#x27;t do it.&quot;

Later on that same day, Jackson was attending the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis at the U.S. Capitol. Lawrence originally planned to shoot Jackson as he entered the service but was unable to get close enough to him. However, by the time Jackson left the funeral, Lawrence had found a space near a pillar on the East Portico, where Jackson would pass. As Jackson walked by, Lawrence stepped out and fired his first pistol at Jackson&#x27;s back; it misfired. Lawrence quickly made another attempt with his second pistol, but that also misfired. It was later determined that the weapons that he had chosen were noted for being vulnerable to moisture, and the weather on that date was humid and damp.

Lawrence&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts were noticed by Jackson, who proceeded to beat Lawrence with a cane. The crowd, which included U.S. Representative Davy Crockett, eventually intervened and wrestled Lawrence into submission. Lawrence was the first person to attempt to kill a sitting U.S. president.

==Trial and commitment==
Lawrence was brought to trial on April 11, 1835, at the District of Columbia City Hall. The prosecuting attorney was Francis Scott Key. At his trial, Lawrence was prone to wild rants and he refused to recognize the legitimacy of the proceedings. At one point he said to the courtroom, &quot;It is for me, gentlemen, to pass judgment on you, and not you upon me.&quot; After only five minutes of deliberation, the jury found Lawrence &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity&quot;.

In the years following his acquittal, Lawrence was held by several institutions and hospitals. In 1855, he was committed to the newly opened Government Hospital for the Insane (later renamed St. Elizabeths Hospital), in Washington, D.C., where he remained until his death on June 13, 1861.

==Aftermath==
As with later assassinations, there was speculation that Lawrence was part of a conspiracy. While nobody denied Lawrence&#x27;s involvement, many people, including Jackson, believed that he might have been supported in or put up to carrying out the assassination attempt by the President&#x27;s political enemies. U.S. Senator (and Jackson&#x27;s former vice president) John C. Calhoun made a statement on the Senate floor that he was not connected to the attack. Nevertheless, Jackson believed that Calhoun, an old enemy, was at the bottom of the attempt.

Jackson also suspected a former friend and supporter, Senator George Poindexter of Mississippi, who had used Lawrence to do some house painting a few months earlier. Because Poindexter was unable to convince his supporters in Mississippi that he was not involved in a plot against Jackson, he was defeated for re-election. However, no evidence was ever discovered that connected Lawrence with either Calhoun or Poindexter in a plot to kill Jackson.

Under various names it had branches in Afghanistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Comoros, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, Tanzania, and the United States, and &quot;at its height&quot; raised between $40 and $50 million a year in contributions worldwide. While most of the foundation&#x27;s funds went to feed poor Muslims around the world, a small percentage went to Al-Qaeda, and that money (and money from other charities) was &quot;a major source of funds&quot; for the terrorist group. In 2003, Saudi authorities ordered Al-Haramain to shut down all overseas branches, and by 2004 Saudi authorities had dissolved Al-Haramain. However, US intelligence officials believed it had reopened branches under new names.

On 7 June 2004, the founder and former leader of AHIF, Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqeel al-Aqeel, was listed on an INTERPOL-United Nations Security Council Special Notice for being associated with Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden or the Taliban for &quot;participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts of activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of&quot; Al-Qaeda.

In September 2004, the U.S. Department of the Treasury alleged that its investigation had found &quot;direct links&quot; between the foundation and Osama bin Laden. Between 2004 and 2010, fourteen branches of the charity were listed on the UN Security Council Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee list of &quot;individuals, groups, undertakings and other entities associated with Al-Qaeda&quot; and subject to &quot;sanctions measures (assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo) imposed by the Security Council&quot;.

==History==
The Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation was founded in the Pakistani city of Karachi in 1988 with the aim of religious propagation and charity, but moved its headquarters to Riyadh in 1992. It set up a branch in Somalia in 1992 also. In September 2001 AHIF was named a Specially Designated Terrorist Entity by the US government. 
In 2002 the US and Saudi Arabia &quot;jointly designated the Bosnian and Somalian branches of AHIF as financiers of terror, although as of 2008 critics have raised questions as to whether the Saudi government &quot;actually closed the offshore branches of AHIF&quot;. According to author Jimmy Gurul, the US government had evidence that &quot;AHIF offices and representatives operating throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe provided financial and logistical support&quot; to groups &quot;designated foreign terrorist organizations by the US State Department&quot;, including al-Qaeda, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Jemaah Islamiyah, Al-Ittihad Al-Islamiya, Lashkar e-Taibah, and HAMAS.

In 2004 the US &quot;designated&quot; 11 other branches including the US branch in Ashland, Oregon. Finally, later in 2004 the US designated the entire entity, including its headquarters in Saudi Arabia. At the time of its closing, AHIF had been operating in 50 countries and employed 5,000 workers.

==Humanitarian and proselyting activities==
The foundation undertook religious activities such as sponsorship of orphans, preachers, imams and teachers as well as publishing and distributing Islamic books, like translations of the Qur&#x27;an, Hadith and other religious writings in Muslim countries.
The foundation also undertook building and supervising mosques, schools, Islamic centers, scholarships for students in poor Muslim countries, organizing Shariah courses, distribution of Ramadan breakfasts and blankets in the winter. As part of its activities, the foundation also distributed food, clothes and medicine for victims of wars and natural calamities all over the world. The closure of the charity led directly to the closure of a number of orphanages supported or run by the foundation in Somalia.

==Financing terror attacks==
===East Africa===
According to the Associated Press, Al-Qaeda provided funds to a suspect in the November 2002 bombing of an Israeli hotel in Kenya, using sympathizers inside Al-Haramain and other Islamic charities. 
A wholesale fish business financed with Al-Haramain funds used some of its profits to help the al Qaeda cell behind the August 1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in East Africa.

===Indonesia===
According to the UN Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, the foundation funded the 2002 Bali bombings that killed over 200, mostly foreign tourists. 
Using a variety of means, Al-Haramain Foundation provided financial support to Al-Qaida operatives in Indonesia and to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). According to a senior Al-Qaida official apprehended in South-East Asia, Al-Haramain Foundation was one of the primary sources of funding for Al-Qaida network activities in the region. JI has committed a series of terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a nightclub in Bali on 12 October 2002 that killed 202 persons and wounded over 300 others.(QE.A.4.01). 

===United States===
The U.S. branch of AHF was established in 1997. As of 2004 it had headquarters in Ashland, Oregon and an office in Springfield, Missouri. (In a 2000 US taxation form the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation reported its &quot;prayer houses are located in Ashland, Oregon and Springfield, Mo.&quot;

The U.S. government accused Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation of Ashland, Oregon of sending $150,000 through Saudi Arabia to fund terrorist activities and support Chechen mujahideen under the guise of humanitarian aid. It also was accused of receiving money from Osama bin Laden in August 1998 and providing funding to an American imam who attended a training camp run by a terrorist organization in Pakistan.
On 19 February 2004, the assets of the U.S. branch were blocked by the US Treasury Department pending investigation, the results of which showed &quot;direct links between the U.S. branch and Usama bin Laden&quot;. On 9 September 2004 Treasury announced &quot;the designation&quot; of the U.S. branch of Al Haramain along with one of its directors, Suliman Al-Buthe. The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury had already banned various branches of this organization at various times.

On 19 June 2008, U.S. Department of the Treasury &quot;designated&quot; the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation (AHF) &quot;for having provided financial and material support to al Qaida, as well as a wide range of designated terrorists and terrorist organizations.&quot; As a consequence, an &quot;assets held by any office of the AHF organization under U.S. jurisdiction [were] frozen and U.S. persons [were] prohibited from engaging in any transactions with AHF.&quot;

====Al-Haramain suit====

On 28 February 2006 the American branch of the foundation filed a lawsuit against President George W. Bush, the NSA, FBI, and several other US officials. The suit asserted that the Bush administration had circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by authorizing warrantless wiretaps. They asserted that the President lacked the authority to authorize wiretaps that circumvented the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Three individuals whose conversations were intercepted, Suliman al-Buthe, Wendell Belew and Asim Ghafoor, learned of the eavesdropping when U.S. officials accidentally delivered logs of phone calls to them. Al-Buthe, who had traveled intermittently to the United States but who has always resided in Saudi Arabia, had been one of the directors of the Ashland chapter. Belew and Ghafoor were two of the Foundation&#x27;s U.S. lawyers.

The foundation filed another suit in August 2007, challenging the Department of Treasury&#x27;s 2004 designation of Al Haramain as a &quot;specially designated global terrorist&quot; and the seizure and freezing of all of its assets. In September 2011, an appeals court ruled that United States officials correctly designated the charity as supporting terrorism, but found the Treasury department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control improperly seized the charity&#x27;s assets using a &quot;blocking order&quot; to freeze them without a warrant supported by probable cause, violating the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures, and that they also violated the charity&#x27;s procedural due process rights by failing to give a post-seizure explanation of the basis for the seizure.

In 2010 one of the charity&#x27;s founders (Pete Seda) was convicted of tax-fraud but the conviction was overturned in 2013. In August 2013, the group filed a petition with a committee of the United Nations Security Council to remove the nonprofit from its list of entities associated with al-Qaida.

In 2013, Al-Buthe (who was one of the directors of the Ashland chapter and who had been wiretapped by the US government) was taken off a United Nations list of people subject to sanctions for ties to Al-Qaeda but remained on a similar US list. His attorney Tom Nelson said the UN action is some vindication for his client, but that Al-Buthe is a victim of the post-9/11 anti-terrorism paranoia.

Thomas H. Nelson of Welches, Oregon, another Foundation lawyer, filed the lawsuit. Court records show he filed a motion to place the relevant material under seal.

On 31 March 2010, US District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker ruled that the Bush administration should have gotten warrants for its wiretaps of Al Haramain.

In July 2014 the criminal indictment of Pete Seda was dismissed, and in June 2020 the court dismissed the indictment and arrest warrant of Al-Buthe on motion of the United States Department of Justice, which stated that such dismissal was &quot;in the interests of justice.&quot;

===Balkans===
Al-Haramain funded and supported a &quot;Bosnian mujahideen&quot; battalion in Zenica Bosnia. ImIn Albania, a member of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Ahmad Ibrahim al-Najjar, joined al-Haramain&#x27;s Tirana office in 1993. He was apprehended in Albania and extradited to Egypt in June 1998 for an attempted bombing of the Khan el-Khalili Souq (market) in Cairo in 1997.

===Russia===
Although not necessarily alleging attacks against civilians, the Russian FSB (Federal Security Service) accused Al-Haramain (among other charities) of operating for years in Chechnya (see Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya) and Dagestan, financing Wahhabi based training for emigrant would-be Jihadists. The FSB accused Al-Haramain of wiring $1 million to Chechen rebels in 1999 and of arranging to buy 500 heavy weapons for them from Taliban units. Russia designates Al-Haramain as a terrorist organization since 2003.

==Pressure to close==
On 22 January 2004, in a joint press conference, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow and Adel al-Jubeir, Foreign Affairs Advisor to then Crown Prince Abdullah, called upon the United Nations Sanctions Committee to designate four branch offices of the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation as financial supporters of terrorism. As a result, Al-Haramain was folded into the National Commission. Aqeel Al-Aqeel was then removed from his position of the chairmanship of the foundation. In 2014, Aqeel Al-Aqeel was acquitted of all charges brought personally against him by the Riyadh Appeal court, though the foundation is still banned.

<text>The London Dungeon is a tourist attraction/haunted attraction along London&#x27;s South Bank, England, which recreates various gory and macabre historical events in a gallows humour style. It uses a mixture of live actors, special effects and rides.

==History==

The London Dungeon was opened in 1974 by Annabel Geddes. The attraction was originally a wax exhibition of dark history, consisting of themed tableaux under the London Bridge station arches. Early characters included Boudica, Mary Tudor and Thomas Becket and had scenes from the Norman Conquest.

From the late 1980s to mid 90s, it evolved to feature walkthrough historical shows, such as the Great Fire of London and Jack the Ripper, during which time it was owned by the Kunick Leisure Group.

It was acquired by Vardon Attractions in 1992, which later became Merlin Entertainments through a management buyout, led by Nick Varney. Merlin rebranded the Dungeon more as an interactive horror attraction, less historically-accurate and based around bad taste humour.

In 2013, the London Dungeon moved from its premises of 39 years in Tooley Street, to County Hall, South Bank, to be grouped with other Merlin-owned attractions such as the London Eye. The new building was designed by architect Ralph Knott and was influenced by Baroque-style art. It is located directly opposite the Houses of Parliament – the same buildings Guy Fawkes tried to blow up with gunpowder in 1605. The move brought the opportunity to reinvigorate the Dungeon; the rebuild took an entire year and a budget of £20 million.

==Format==
The London Dungeon features 19 shows, 20 actors and 2 rides. Visitors are taken on a journey through 1000 years of London&#x27;s history where they meet actors performing as some of London&#x27;s most infamous characters, including Jack the Ripper and Sweeney Todd. The Dungeon&#x27;s shows are staged on theatrical sets with special effects. The show incorporates events such as the Black Death and the Gunpowder Plot, and includes characters such as &quot;The Torturer&quot;, &quot;The Plague Doctor&quot;, and &quot;The Judge&quot;. Guests are encouraged to participate in the shows. The experience also includes a &quot;drop ride to doom&quot;, a free-fall ride staged as a public hanging.

==Tooley Street tour==

The original London Dungeon opened in 1974 as an exhibition through dark British history, operating as a free-flow walkthrough attraction. It was expanded in the 1980s and 90s with several historical walkthrough attractions, such as the &quot;Great Fire of London&quot; and &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;. 

By 1997, now owned by Vardon Attractions, the majority of the attraction was redeveloped as a batched series of attractions rather than a free-flow exhibit. This saw the arrival of &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, a water dark ride that began with visitors entering a mock trial to be sentenced to death, then boarding a boat through Traitor&#x27;s Gate to their execution. The boat ride itself was a masterpiece in design in a crowded space. Many of the original horror tableaux were refurbished as part of a new ransacked village scene, at the start of the ride, and the finale included a lift into the unknown, followed by a turntable and a backwards drop. The original story at the top of the drop was of an executioner with an axe, but this was later changed to a firing squad, that shot, just as guests plunged backwards.

2000 saw the re-introduction of the &quot;Fire of London&quot; segment, which simulated the burning streets of 17th-century London and featured a spinning trommel with smoke effects.

Under Merlin Entertainments, increasingly actor-led segments were added during the 2000s, such as the &quot;Labyrinth of the Lost&quot; mirror maze and the &quot;Great Plague&quot;. In 2004, the &quot;Judgement Day&quot; boat ride was altered and renamed to &quot;Traitor - Boat Ride to Hell&quot;, removing the original effects and scenes to become a simple boat ride, largely through darkness.

2006 saw the arrival of a Sweeney Todd segment. The attraction used surround sound and sensory effects to simulate an encounter with the titular character, before visitors&#x27; chairs were suddenly tilted backwards as a shock effect. Another ride segment was added in 2007, &quot;Extremis - Drop Ride to Doom&quot;, based on the hangings at Newgate gallows. Guests were raised 20 feet to meet an animatronic judge, priest and hangman before a free-fall drop into darkness. The new ride replaced the &quot;Blood and Guts Café&quot;.

In 2008, there were changes to the Jack the Ripper segment, which included a new ending scene in the &quot;Ten Bells&quot; pub. In 2009 came &quot;Surgery - Blood and Guts&quot;, which focused on gore and anatomy and used audience interaction. &quot;Bloody Mary: Killer Queen&quot; opened in 2010 in place of the &quot;Fire of London&quot; segment, and selected a random audience member to be publicly burned as a &quot;heretic&quot; using smoke effects.

&quot;Vengeance 5D&quot; opened in 2011, an interactive seated shooter ride, themed to a séance. The ride was constructed in areas of the original Jack the Ripper attraction, which was significantly shortened to accommodate the new ride. Vengeance lasted only one season.

The last Tooley Street tour took place on 31 January 2013, and contained the following sections:
The Labyrinth of the Lost;
The Great Plague;
Surgery: Blood and Guts;
The Torture Chamber;
The Courtroom;
Bedlam;
Traitor: Boat Ride to Hell;
Sweeney Todd;
Vengeance 5D;
Jack the Ripper;
Bloody Mary: Killer Queen;
Extremis: Drop Ride to Doom. 

The new County Hall Dungeon features some of the attractions repurposed from the Tooley Street Dungeon, not including Bloody Mary and Vengeance 5D. When it departed its first home, many props were sold at a car boot sale in nearby Pimlico. The sale Items on offer included an “array of torture and surgical equipment, severed limbs, false eyeballs, plague doctor&#x27;s potions &amp; a severed head”.

The original venue was redeveloped by Network Rail.

==Critical response==
In its changing years, the London Dungeon has been the subject of mixed response by visitors and leisure critics. In 1988, the attraction received much publicised appraisal from the then Lord Mayor of London Sir Greville Spratt for its dramatic depiction of the Great Fire of London. The original Great Fire attraction doubled attendance to the Dungeon upon opening.

By contrast, in 2009, Rick Steves described the London Dungeon as &quot;just a highly advertised, overpriced haunted house&quot; and an &quot;amateurish attraction&quot; in his book on the city. The &quot;Rough Guide to Britain&quot; describes it as best enjoyed by &quot;young teenagers and the credulous&quot;.

<text>Kassite is a rare mineral whose chemical formula is CaTi2O4(OH)2. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system and forms radiating rosettes and pseudo-hexagonal tabular crystals which are commonly twinned. Kassite crystals are brownish pink to pale yellow in color, are translucent, and have an adamantine luster. Cleavage is distinctly visible, and the crystals are very brittle. 

It was first described in 1965 in the Afrikanda pyroxenite massif, a formation on Russia&#x27;s Kola Peninsula and was named for Nikolai Grigorievich Kassin (1885–1949), a prominent Russian geologist. It occurs as miarolytic cavity fillings of alkalic pegmatites in the Kola occurrence and in nepheline syenite in the Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, US. Its mineral association includes cafetite (which with it is also polymorphous), perovskite, titanite, rutile and ilmenite.

<doc id="447916" wikidata="Q465847" url="?curid=447916" title="Manicaland Province">
<text>Manicaland is a province in eastern Zimbabwe. After Harare Province, it is the country&#x27;s second-most populous province, with a population of 2.037 million, as of the 2022 census. Making it the third most densely populated province after Harare and Bulawayo provinces. Manicaland was one of five original provinces established in Southern Rhodesia in the early colonial period. The province endowed with country&#x27;s major tourist attractions, the likes of Mutarazi Falls, Nyanga National Park and Zimbabwe&#x27;s top three highest peaks. The province is divided into ten administrative subdivisions of seven rural districts and three towns/councils, including the provincial capital, Mutare. The name Manicaland is derived from one of the province&#x27;s largest ethnic groups, the Manyika, who originate from the area north of the Manicaland province and as well as western Mozambique, who speak a distinct language called ChiManyika in Shona (one of the dialect of the Shona language).

Manicaland is bordered by Mashonaland East Province to the northwest, Midlands Province to the west, Masvingo Province to the southwest, and Mozambique to the east. It has an area of , equal to 9.28% of the total area of Zimbabwe. It is the sixth-largest in area of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ten provinces. Its economy is largely centered around industry and agriculture, particularly manufacturing, diamond and gold mining, timber, tea and coffee plantations, and tourism. In recent years, Manicaland&#x27;s economy has declined as manufacturing firms and mines continue to fold, and the province now lags behind other Zimbabwean provinces economically and developmentally.

Recent developments in the province are noted mainly in Bocha area where several major infrastructural projects are underway. The province is one heavily underdeveloped areas in the country, on top of that, its economy is one the worst mainly due to Zezuru-Korekore supremacy agenda which was pushed by former president Robert Gabriel Mugabe It is noticeable like in this instance despite the fact it hubs largest rural population, second largest population by province and country third largest city, it is among last 5 developed provinces and does not have an international airport which in turn restricts its growth. It is the home of Zimbabwean tourism alongside Matebeleland North but international tourists does not have direct access, they have to come via Harare where there is an international airport. Diamonds were first discovered in country in Chiadzwa area in Bocha but several years down the line, the area have not benefited anything from the discovery. Penalonga is where illegal gold extraction is done, but instead of Manicaland benefiting, the resources are being looted by Scott Sakupwanya&#x27;s company and several top government officials.

== Etymology ==
The name Manicaland derives from the fact that part of the area has been occupied in history by the Manyika people. The Manyika are a tribal grouping classified as Shona, with their own language variant, the Manyika language.

==Geography==
The province is bordered by Mashonaland East Province to the north, Midlands Province to the west, Masvingo Province to the south and southwest, and the Republic of Mozambique to the east. The provincial capital, Mutare (pop:184,205), lies approximately , by road, southeast of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe and the largest city in that country.

The Eastern Highlands run along the eastern edge of Manicaland. The highlands are made up of several mountain ranges and include Mount Nyangani, Zimbabwe&#x27;s highest peak. Manicaland has a tropical forest climate.

The northern part of Manicaland is drained northwards by tributaries of the Zambezi River, including the Gairezi and the Nyangombe. The central and southern portions of the province are drained southwards by the Save River and its tributaries, including the Odzi River. Some areas along the province&#x27;s eastern edge, including Honde Valley, Burma Valley, and eastern Chimanimani and Chipinge districts, drain eastwards into the Pungwe and Buzi rivers.

==Districts==
The province is subdivided into seven rural districts and three town/councils:
* Buhera District
* Chimanimani District
* Chipinge District
* Makoni District
* Mutare District (in the center)
* Mutasa District
* Nyanga District (in the northeast of the province)
* Mutare City Council
* Chipinge Town Council
* Rusape Town Council

==Demographics and diversity==

Manicaland is the second most populated province in Zimbabwe. It has a population of about 1,755,000 which constitutes about 13.5% of the country&#x27;s total population.

The people of Manicaland speak Shona although the different districts have own languages and dialects. For example, Mutasa District use Manyika as a language. In Makoni District, the MaUngwe people use the chiUngwe. In Chimanimani District, Chipinge District the Ndau people use chiNdau and the Machangana/ Shangaani people use chiChangana/ Shangaan language. In Mutare District the people of Marange use chiBocha and the Jindwi people of Zimunya use chiJindwi.

These languages transcend the modern day boundaries set by the districts, being synonymous with the people in their Chiefdoms, who originally occupied these lands and beyond, prior to the displacement and resettlement caused by colonial occupation and repression in the early part of the 20th century. Boundaries between Kingdoms/ Chiefdoms were redrawn under the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and the Native Land Husbandry Act of 1951. Colonial authorities used a similar technique to divide up land and authority, which in colonial Rhodesia manifested itself, through a long series of legislative measures (most importantly the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and the Native Land Husbandry Act of 1951), in the sharp division between Native reserves (later known as the Tribal Trust Lands), and European farming areas, with the Native Purchase Areas forming a kind of middle stage between the two. After the country&#x27;s independence in 1980, district boundaries were redrawn based on political direction in the newer dispensation.

==Spirituality and religion==
A great number of the population practise their own traditional way of worshipping, but many also practice Christianity (about 65%). The majority falling under the traditional churches: Methodist Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The Pentecostal churches have large followings in the urban areas of Mutare and a few other growth points. Some gatherings fall under the Apostolic Churches, with a notably higher proportion of the Apostolic followers in Mutare and Buhera district. Polygamy is quite prevalent among church members. Other communities such as Muslim are represented, owing to the influence of migration.

==Schools==
Manicaland boasts of some of the best performing schools in the country. Schools such as St Augustines (Tsambe), St Faith&#x27;s School, Rusape (Fisco-&#x27;Madetere&#x27;) (Currently the best performing school 2012 at &#x27;O&#x27; level and &#x27;A&#x27; level in Zimbabwe), Nyanga High School, Marist Brothers, St Marys, Mt Selinda High, Bonda High, Emmanuel High, Kriste Mambo, Mutare Boys&#x27; High School, Mutare Girls High (The Shumbas), St Dominics Mutare, Marange High, Hartzell High, Lydia Chimonyo, Sakubva High, Dangamvura High. These have produced exceptional results over the years and a great number of academics renowned internationally.

The privately run Africa University provides some relief (albeit to a lesser extent), but it simply cannot absorb the huge numbers of school leavers with high grades.

In general, there is a school within a radius across Manicaland. There are numerous primary and secondary schools scattered across the province. The distribution of schools by district is shown in the table below.

<doc id="447921" wikidata="Q261618" url="?curid=447921" title="Six Flags St. Louis">
<text>Six Flags St. Louis, originally known as Six Flags Over Mid-America, is an amusement park in Eureka, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Owned and operated by Six Flags, it has eight themed areas with attractions, dining, and live entertainment, many themed with characters from Looney Tunes and other Warner Bros. films and TV shows, DC Comics, and, formerly, Scooby-Doo. 

The park was conceived in the 1960s by Six Flags founder Angus G. Wynne as the last of the company&#x27;s original three parks. It was the first one designed by the Six Flags company; the designer of the first two, architect Randall Duell, was busy designing AstroWorld at the time. The park opened on June 5, 1971. One of the original three Six Flags parks.

The park has undergone many changes, including the 1990s replacement or renaming of all six of the park&#x27;s original areas and the addition of two new ones.

The park, which operates from March to November, hosts various celebrations and events. Some of the most popular are Fright Fest runs during the Halloween season (usually late September to late October/early November) and features many Halloween decorations and haunted houses. Coca-Cola&#x27;s Fest takes place July 3–5 and features fireworks displays. The park no longer operates Holiday in the Park, which ran from November to early January and featured Christmas decorations and music, New Year&#x27;s fireworks, and more.

==History==
===Opening and operation===

Plans for a Six Flags park in the St. Louis area—dubbed Six Flags Over Mid-America—were announced on July 16, 1969. The park opened on June 5, 1971, the third and last of the three &quot;true&quot; Six Flags parks as envisioned by Angus G. Wynne. The park was divided into six themed sections: the namesake &quot;Six Flags&quot; over Mid-America:

* Missouri (now 1904 World&#x27;s Fair), the main entry of the park, themed after the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904. 
* U.S.A. (replaced by Time Warner Studios in 1995), located in the southeast of the park, with a patriotic theme, after the United States. 
*France (now Chouteau&#x27;s Market), located to the east, adjacent to U.S.A., themed after a colonial French trading post.
*Spain (replaced by DC Comics Plaza in 1997), located in the southwest of the park, with Spanish-themed architecture and restaurants. 
*England (now Britannia), located in the northwest of the park, themed after a village in medieval England. 
*Old Chicago (currently known as Illinois), located in the northeast section of the park, themed after the city of Chicago in the early 1900s.

On June 5, 1999, the 12-acre Six Flags Hurricane Harbor water park opened, adjacent to the main park. At a cost of $17 million, it was the largest single investment in Six Flags St. Louis&#x27; history.

In 2014, Six Flags sold 180 acres of unused land to the east of the park to developer McBride &amp; Sons, effectively reducing the total property area of the park from 503 acres to 323 acres. According to the Six Flags 2015 Annual Report, the park now owns 323 acres of land (with 283 acres of land used for the park, plus an additional 40 acres of undeveloped land).

In January 2020, construction began on a renovated entry plaza, removing the original ticket booths that had been at the park since its opening in 1971. Subsequently, in March of the same year, Six Flags St. Louis announced that the opening of their 2020 season would be delayed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yearly attendance figures have not been released.

== Areas and attractions ==
Six Flags St. Louis is divided into eight themed sections, all of which were added after the park&#x27;s opening or renamed. The park is laid out in a &quot;Duell loop&quot;, a design concept that was often used by park designer Randall Duell.

=== 1904 World&#x27;s Fair ===
1904 World&#x27;s Fair is the main area of the park, named after the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, which ran from April 30 to December 1, 1904. The area features the &quot;Mall of the Mid-Americas&quot;, a shopping mall that features foods introduced or served at the fair, as well as early-1900s-themed buildings. The area was named &quot;Missouri&quot; until 1994.

=== Gateway to the West ===
Gateway to the West is themed after the old colonial times of the state of Missouri, and features many references to locales and people that have lived in the state. The area opened in 1993, taking over a part of what was formerly the Missouri section of the park.

=== Chouteau&#x27;s Market ===
Chouteau&#x27;s Market is themed after a French market along the Mississippi River. It is named after Auguste Chouteau, the founder of the city of St. Louis. The area opened in 1993, replacing France. In 2014, the area was expanded to take over a piece of what had formerly been the back of Studio Backlot.

=== Studio Backlot ===
Studio Backlot is themed to the backlot of a movie studio in Hollywood. The area originally opened in 1995 as &quot;Time Warner Studios&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Warner Bros. Backlot&quot; the following year.

In the first couple years, the area featured five interactive movie set experiences based on various Warner Bros. films, including &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; and &quot;Maverick&quot;, all of which were retired after the 1997 season. The area&#x27;s name was changed again to its current name in 2002, though it mostly retains its previous theme.

=== DC Comics Plaza ===
DC Comics Plaza celebrates the worlds of DC Entertainment, with several attractions based on various DC characters and properties. The area opened in 1997, replacing the former Spain section of the park. One of DC Comics Plaza&#x27;s most iconic features is DC Circle, a section of the ground that is designed after DC&#x27;s longtime &quot;DC Bullet&quot; logo. The visual centerpiece of the Plaza is the Hall of Justice, which serves as the facade and entrance for Justice League: Battle for Metropolis. Directly to the opposite side is the large, snowman-themed facade of the &quot;Snowy&#x27;s Ice Cream Factory Tours&quot;, which is the entrance to Mr. Freeze: Reverse Blast.
=== Britannia ===
Britannia is based on the country of Great Britain as it was in its medieval period, including elements from Arthurian legend. The area was named &quot;England&quot; from 1971 to 1992, then &quot;Great Britain&quot; in 1993, and it was given its current name in 1994.

=== Illinois ===
Illinois is loosely themed to the city of Chicago. The area was formerly known as &quot;Old Chicago&quot; from 1971 to 1993.

=== Bugs Bunny National Park ===
Bugs Bunny National Park is a kiddie area based on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; franchise. It opened in 2006 as the successor to Looney Tunes Town. It replaced some former land that Britannia used to occupy.

===Roller Coasters===

==Six Flags Hurricane Harbor==
Hurricane Harbor is a water park that is connected to the southeast portion of Six Flags St. Louis and is adjacent to Studio Backlot, but is not part of the main park.


== Entertainment Venues ==
Six Flags St. Louis has several theaters that host daily shows during its operating season. With the exception of the summer concert series, all shows are free to attend.
==Annual events==
A number of annual seasonal events are held at the park:

===July 4th Fest===
 Fest was introduced in the 2000s and features multiple nights of fireworks for the Fourth of July. It is typically sponsored by Coca-Cola.

===Fright Fest===

Fright Fest was introduced in 1988 as &quot;Fright Nights&quot;, which ran until Fright Nights V in 1992. In 1993, the event became Fright Fest under the ownership of Time Warner, who wanted each Six Flags park&#x27;s Halloween event to use the same name for branding purposes. The event runs from mid to late September through Halloween and typically features several haunted attractions and scare zones, as well as live entertainment. Fright Fest celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2018.

Fright Fest was replaced with HALLOWFEST in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Park capacity was reduced to 25% of its normal capacity and all haunted houses, scare zones, and shows were replaced with outdoor, socially distanced alternatives.

===Holiday in the Park===

A holiday event was introduced in 2016 which features several themed areas as well as live entertainment. The event extended the park&#x27;s operating season by two months for the first time in its history. It did not return in 2022.

===Holiday Square and Cosmic Sleigh Ride===
For the 2022 season, Holiday in the Park was replaced by Cosmic Sleigh Ride &amp; Holiday Square. After 2021 season, Holiday in the Park was reimagined and rebranded as &quot;Holiday Square&quot; heavily toning down the operation, but still including the core elements of lights, entertainment, characters and treats. It was paired alongside a drive through lights show, run by World of Illumination.

===Cinco de Mayo Celebration===
A new Event, Cinco de Mayo Celebration, began for the 2023 season. According to Six flags, &quot;Tacos, margaritas, music, and coasters all in one place for Cinco de Mayo weekend!&quot;

===Kids Weekend===
Throughout weekends in June, Kids Weekends, happens. Kids Weekend features decorations, entertainment, and food offerings. According to Six Flags, &quot;This event is all about the kids. Foam cannons, dance parties, and snow cones will be at Six Flags every weekend in June.&quot; Kids Weekend inaugural season is 2023.

===Summer Vibes===
Presented by M&amp;Ms, Summers Vibes features food offerings, entertainment, and decorations. Summer Vibes is throughout July, after July 4 Fest. According to Six Flags, &quot;This spectacular event features mouth-watering treats, beat-the-heat beverages, and photo moments in both the theme park and the water park.&quot; Summer Vibes&#x27; inaugural season is 2023.

<text>Masvingo, previously named Victoria, is a province in southeastern Zimbabwe. It has a population of 1.638 million as of the 2022 census, ranking fifth out of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ten provinces. Established by the British South Africa Company, it was one of the five original provinces of Southern Rhodesia. In 1982, two years after Zimbabwean independence, it was renamed Masvingo Province. The province is divided into seven districts, including Masvingo District, which contains the provincial capital Masvingo City.

Masvingo Province is bordered by Matabeleland South Province to the southwest, Midlands Province to the northwest, Manicaland Province to the northeast, and Mozambique to the southeast. It has an area of , equal to 14.48% of the total area of Zimbabwe. It is the third-largest in area of Zimbabwe&#x27;s provinces, after Matabeleland North and Mashonaland West. A diverse province, the Karanga, a Shona subgroup, form the majority, with minorities of Shangani in the southeast and Ndebele in the west. Its economy is largely centred around agriculture and tourism. Masvingo Province is home to the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a World Heritage Site and major tourist attraction.

==History==
The town of Fort Victoria was founded in 1890 and was the first large settlement to be established by the Pioneer Column of the British South Africa Company which makes it the oldest town in Zimbabwe. It was named in honour of Queen Victoria.

The province is largely populated by members of the Karanga tribe, who are a sub-group of the Shona speaking tribes that also include the Zezuru, Manyika, and Ndau. The province is in the drier lowveldt area in the south of Zimbabwe but however, the boundaries have undergone some changes in the 1980s. From white settlement until 2000 most of the area was devoted to cattle ranching, with mining and sugar cane growing (irrigated from Lake Mutirikwi), and communal areas where subsistence farming is carried out. With the land reforms of the early 21st century large scale cattle and mixed farms are being redistributed to small farmers.

==Geography==
Masvingo (formerly Fort Victoria) is the capital of the province. Chiredzi and Triangle are other major towns in the province. Other towns include Mashava and the newly upgraded Mpandawana which used to be a growth point. The province is dominated by the Save, Runde, Mwenezi and Limpopo river systems which all either join or drain directly into the Indian Ocean. Kopjes, grey and bald in the hot sun, dot the countryside with mopane trees,which are drought tolerant and sturdy, found throughout the province.

===Climate===
Masvingo province has a tropical savannah climate and is located in the low veld of the country where rainfall is minimal and uncertain. A large part of the southern area of the province is drought prone, set as region 5 in the country&#x27;s climatic regions. Most parts of the province, therefore, are generally unfit for agriculture, apart from cattle ranching Hippo Valley estates in Chiredzi and Triangle use the water from Lake Kyle for irrigation.

==Demographics==
Despite the aridness, the residents of the province are proud tillers of the earth and like most Bantu tribes in Southern Africa they practise animal husbandry to supplement their diets.

Masvingo has an area of 56,566 km2 and a population of approximately 1.3 million (2002). The Karanga form a majority of the province&#x27;s population and Shona is the primary language. In Chiredzi District, there are communities of Shangani people while those of the Ndebele are found on the western edge of the province. To the north-east, are found the Ndau. The white population has declined since independence, especially during the invasions of commercial farms in 2000. In fact, the first farm invasion occurred in Masvingo Province and the rest of the country followed suit.
==Government==
The province&#x27;s leader is a Minister for Provincial Affairs appointed by the country&#x27;s president for a five-year term of office. The current Minister is Ezra Chadzamira appointed in 2018. The province also sends six elected members to the Senate plus a number of chiefs. In addition, twenty six members of parliament, selected from the province&#x27;s seven districts, are sent to the House of Assembly.

===Districts===
The districts are run by the rural district councils, which are composed of members elected from the wards in the district.
Masvingo is divided into seven administrative districts, although these can be further divided by the delimitation committee during elections depending on population figures. The districts are Bikita, Chivi, Zaka and Masvingo in the center of the province, Gutu in the north, and Mwenezi, and Chiredzi in the south and east respectively. All these seven districts have business centres known as growth points except for Mpandawana (recently granted town status), and they are as follows with estimation of distance from Masvingo city centre: Masvingo- Nemanwa (30 km), Bikita- Nyika (82 km), Zaka- Jerera (96 km), Gutu- Mupandawana (94 km).

===Elections===
Masvingo was generally regarded as a stronghold of ZANU-PF, the ruling party. In the parliamentary elections of 2005, ZANU-PF won all but one district of the fourteen seats up for grabs. For the election of March, 2008 the seven districts were redistributed into twenty-six constituencies.

== Economy ==
Tourism is a major contributor to the province&#x27;s GDP, as is agriculture.

=== Mining ===
*Bikita mine

== Transportation ==
The busy A1 highway connects the major centers of Masvingo and Beitbridge.

== Sports ==

== Education ==
Masvingo has 2 Universities namely Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and Reformed Church University. The Province also has Masvingo Politechnical College.

Masvingo Province also has Margaretha Hugo School for the Blind (Copota) which is the first school for the visually impaired to be established in Zimbabwe.

==Tourism==
The province has a number of attractions. In the east of the province along the Mozambique border is Gonarezhou National Park, part of the Gaza, Kruger and Gonarezhou Transfrontier National Park concept. Less than an hour away to the east lies the world-famous stone ruins of Great Zimbabwe National Monument, from which Zimbabwe draws its name. A little closer to the stone ruins is Lake Kyle, a huge body of water where people spend time engaged in recreational actives in Mutirikwi Recreational Park. Tourism is a major contributor to the province&#x27;s GDP, as is agriculture.

<text>Matabeleland North is a province in western Zimbabwe. With a population of 827,645 as of the 2022 census, it is the country&#x27;s second-least populous province, after Matabeleland South, and the least densely Zimbabwean populated province. Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South were established in 1974, when the original Matabeleland Province was bifurcated, eventually losing territory in 1997 when the city of Bulawayo became a province in its own right. Matabeleland North is divided into seven districts, has its capital in Lupane, and Victoria Falls and Hwange its largest towns. The name &quot;Matabeleland&quot; is derived from the Matabele or Ndebele people, the province&#x27;s largest ethnic group.

Matabeleland North is bordered by Matabeleland South and Bulawayo to the south, Midlands to the east, Mashonaland West to the northeast, Botswana to the west, and Zambia to the north, which is separated from Zimbabwe by the Zambezi river. Matabeleland North has an area of , amounting to 19.2% of the total area of Zimbabwe. In terms of area, it is the largest of the country&#x27;s ten provinces. Matabeleland North is located on the edge of the Kalahari Basin, giving it an arid climate. Its economy is dominated by agriculture, with 83% of employed people in the province working as farmers. Cattle ranching and tourism also contribute to the economy. The Zimbabwean side of Victoria Falls, a World Heritage Site and major tourist attraction, is located in Matabeleland North.

== Demographics ==
== Geography ==

The region of Matabeleland, of which Matabeleland North is a part of, is characterized by generally inhospitable land when compared to other parts of Zimbabwe. It has lower rainfall than provinces such as Mashonaland, and is plagued by water scarcity in general. The land is also less fertile than other provinces, as commercial crops cannot be grown and rural farmers usually cannot produce enough maize to feed their families. However, during the colonial era, large numbers of cattle ranches were formed and cattle ranching has proved to be more successful than growing crops in the province. The upper reaches of the Nata River flow through Matabeleland North before entering Botswana to discharge to the Makgadikgadi Pans.

The region does have a significant amount of other resources like gold, limestone, methane gas, coal, and timber. As seen in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe&#x27;s largest game reserve, the area is also known for its substantial wildlife population. However, the most famous geographic feature of Matebeleland North is Victoria Falls, the world&#x27;s largest waterfalls that are located on the Zambezi river on the northern border of the province.

== Government ==
=== Districts ===
Matabeleland North is divided into 7 districts:

* Binga
* Bubi
* Hwange
* Lupane
* Nkayi
* Tsholotsho
* Umguza

=== Elections ===
The region is regarded as a very independent region when it comes to politics. In the most recent parliamentary election held in March 2008, both factions of the MDC won a total of eight seats from the Matabeleland North delegation to the House of Assembly, while ZANU-PF won four seats and one other seat was won by an independent. In the Senate, the MDC won a combined five seats and ZANU-PF won one seat.

<doc id="447929" wikidata="Q498355" url="?curid=447929" title="Matabeleland South Province">
<text>Matabeleland South is a province in southwestern Zimbabwe. With a population of 683,893 as of the 2012 Zimbabwean census. It is the country&#x27;s least populated province after Matabeleland North.Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North were established in 1974, when the original Matabeleland Province was bifurcated. The province is divided into six districts. Gwanda is the capital, and Beitbridge is the province&#x27;s largest town. The name &quot;Matabeleland&quot; is derived from Ndebele, the province&#x27;s largest ethnic group.

Matabeleland South is bordered by Bulawayo and Matabeleland North to the north, Midlands to the northeast, Masvingo to the southeast, South Africa to the south, and Botswana to the west. It has an area of , equal to 13.86% of the total area of Zimbabwe. It is the fourth-largest of the country&#x27;s ten provinces in area. Matabeleland South sits on the edge of the Kalahari Desert, giving it an arid climate not hospitable to agriculture.

==Geography==
The province sits on the edge of the Kalahari desert, hence it is arid and very dry. The province shares borders with South Africa and Botswana. As a result, there are Tswana, Sotho/Pedi, Venda, Shangani (Tsonga) and the Khoisan speaking people in the province. The other languages that are native in the province are Ndebele and Kalanga.

=== Towns and villages ===
Towns and villages in Matabeleland South include Antelope Mine, Beitbridge, Brunapeg, Colleen Bawn, Esigodini, Filabusi,Fort Rixon, Gwai, Gwanda, Kafusi, Kezi, Madlambudzi, Makhado, Maphisa, Masendu, Ndolwane, Plumtree, Shangani, Stanmore, Tshitshi, Bulu, West Nicholson, and Zezani.

==Demographics==
== Government and politics ==

=== Provincial government ===
Matabeleland South is overseen by the Minister of State for Matabeleland South Province, a de facto governor who oversees provincial affairs and sits in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Zimbabwe. The governor is appointed by the President of Zimbabwe and is not appointed to a set term. Historically, the governor held the title Governor of Matabeleland South, but the office has since been renamed to align with the 2013 Constitution of Zimbabwe, which does not allow for provincial governors.

The current Minister of State for Matabeleland South Province is Abednico Ncube, a ZANU–PF member who was appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in December 2017.

===Districts===
Matabeleland South Province is divided into seven districts: Beitbridge, Bulilima, Gwanda, Insiza, Mangwe, Matobo, and Umzingwane.

=== National politics ===

Like each of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ten provinces, Matabeleland South Province is represented in the Senate by six senators, three of whom must be women. Senators are not directly elected by voters, but are instead selected by party lists via a proportional representation system. The province&#x27;s current senators since the 2018 elections are Themba Mathuthu (ZANU–PF), Alma Mkwebu (ZANU–PF), Tambudzani Mohadi (ZANU–PF), Simon Khaya-Moyo (ZANU–PF), Bekithemba Mpofu (MDC Alliance), and Meliwe Phuthi (MDC Alliance).

Matabeleland South is represented by 13 Members of Parliament in the House of Assembly, Zimbabwe&#x27;s lower house of Parliament. The province&#x27;s current MPs since the 2018 elections are Patrick Dube, CCC Mp, Levi Mayihlome, CCC MP, Edgar Moyo, Abednico Ncube, Soul Ncube, Nqobizitha Ndlovu, Albert Nguluvhe, Dingumuzi CCC MP, Spare Sithole, and Farai Taruvinga. All are members of ZANU–PF except for Dube, who represents the MDC Alliance. Fast forward in 2023 now CCC and still under Nelson Chamisa the opposition made serious in roads and managed to wrestle 4 seats that is Mangwe- Matobo, Gwanda North ,Mangwe and Beitbridge west. What surprised the whole province is that opposition won Beitbridge West for the first time dating back from 2000. Also for the first time opposition shared with ZANU PF the senate seats and women quota, but still ZANUPF managed to win the youth quota rep .

== Economy ==
Its economy is largely centered around subsistence farming and livestock farming. Droughts and a lack of economic opportunities have resulted in widespread poverty and migration out of the province.

Transport

The province has an important geographical location which can link Botswana to Malawi or South Africa to south Zambia through Bulawayo, but due to lack of investment, the old transport hub of the late 20th century lost its familiarity and use with these two countries.

<doc id="447930" wikidata="Q601142" url="?curid=447930" title="Masvingo">
<text>Masvingo, known as Fort Victoria during the colonial period, is a city in southeastern Zimbabwe and the capital of Masvingo Province. The city lies close to Great Zimbabwe, the national monument from which the country takes its name and close to Lake Mutirikwi, its recreational park, the Kyle dam and the Kyle National Reserve that is home to a range of animal species. It is mostly populated by the Karanga people who form the biggest branch of the various Shona tribes in Zimbabwe.

== History ==
The city was known as Fort Victoria until 1982, when its name was briefly changed to Nyanda, after a mountain about 10 kilometres south of the town, on the Masvingo to Beitbridge Road. That led to protests, because &quot;nyanda&quot; means &quot;one who has lice&quot;, and public sentiment was that Masvingo would be more reflective of the history of the city. Within a few months, the name was changed to Masvingo, which means &quot;fort&quot; in Shona, and the Great Zimbabwe, which is essentially a walled fort, is often referred to as &quot;Masvingo eZimbabwe&quot; or sometimes &quot;Masvingo eVitori&quot;, a translation of the original name.

Masvingo is the oldest colonial settlement in Zimbabwe which developed around an encampment established in 1890, when the British South Africa Company &quot;Pioneer Column&quot; of the first European colonists passed through on their way to what became Salisbury, now Harare. The Old Fort national monument is located in the center of town, and was erected in 1891 as one of a series of fortifications to guard the route from Salisbury to the south. The very first cricket match in Zimbabwe is said to have taken place close by, in 1890.

== Demographics ==
The population was approximately 15,000 in 1970; 30,523 in 1982 and rose to 51,743 in 1992. It had a population of approximately 58,000 in 2002. Masvingo is located south of Harare. Most of the local population belongs to the Karanga and Manyika, Shona sub-tribes. The city is divided into suburbs including Mucheke, Rujeko, Rhodene, Target Kopje and Eastvale. The suburbs are divided into high-density, middle-density and low-density suburbs. Mucheke, the oldest township and Rujeko are the most populous high-density suburbs. Mucheke is also the site of the city&#x27;s main bus rank as well as the stadium which is named after the ghetto. KMP and Runyararo suburbs are relatively new high and medium density suburbs beyond Mucheke. The middle-density suburbs are Eastvale located close to Zimuto Police Camp and Target Kopje located on the southern part of town on a small hill close to Flamboyant Hotel. Rhodene, a low-density suburb on the northern part of the city centre, is the most affluent suburb in Masvingo. A new suburban development, Zimre Park, is also taking shape to the north east of the town along Bulawayo Road. Another suburban development is taking place close to the affluent Clipsham Park and is aptly named Clipsham Heights as it straddles the hills running parallel to the Beitbridge-Masvingo road. Masvingo also has peri-urban plots such as Morningside, Glenlivet, and Bushmead. 
== Education ==
Masvingo Polytechnic, Great Zimbabwe University, Bondolfi Teachers College, Morgenster Teachers College and Masvingo Teachers College are the main centres of higher education in the city. The three institutes are run by the government, while Bondolfi and Morgenster are privately owned. Great Zimbabwe University grew out of what was once Masvingo State University. Reformed Church University (RCU) is another university south of Masvingo run by the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe. It was formerly the Great Zimbabwe University. Masvingo Teachers&#x27; College is one of the government run colleges from which Great Zimbabwe devolved. The college has still remained at the campus and the university has a new site. Other teachers&#x27; colleges around Masvingo include the Reformed Church of Zimbabwe run Morgenster Teachers&#x27; College and the Catholic run Bondolfi Teachers&#x27; College. High schools in the city include Victoria High School, located just north of the city centre. Kyle College, Masvingo Christian High School, Ndarama High School and Mucheke High School. There are also privately run high schools commonly referred to as colleges around the city. Pamushana High School, Zimuto High school, Gokomere High School are some of the highly esteemed mission boarding schools in Masvingo Province and are all located few kilometres outside town.

== Geography ==
The landscape in southern Zimbabwe is relatively flat, interspersed with rounded granite mountains. Known as kopjes (Dutch: little heads), they are often quite smooth. Msasa trees dominate the savannah landscape, with the occasional baobab tree. The weather is hot and dry throughout the year, except during the summer when the rains come. There is a range of small hills to the south of the city centre. Mucheke and Shagashe rivers run close to the centre and both of them act as de facto boundaries of the central business district. Robert Mugabe way, one of the city&#x27;s main streets, is lined with pine trees adjacent to some of the oldest buildings in Zimbabwe such as The victoria hotel and the building opposite to it that now houses The High Court of Zimbabwe. The tallest building is the 9-storey Zimre center located in the CBD. The Bell Tower is a historical building and formed part of the fort erected by the British South African Company in 1892 to protect settlers around Fort Victoria.

The town lies near Lake Mutirikwi and is home to a nine-hole golf course and a freight railway line. It lies on the Mucheke River, with a civic centre at the town centre. Shagashe Game Park and an Italian memorial church built during World War II are nearby. Masvingo also has an airstrip. The national airline, Air Zimbabwe, has reintroduced a domestic flight connecting Masvingo to Harare in the north and Buffalo Range in the south starting on 5 December 2014.

Masvingo is situated in a drought-prone area, with average rainfall of 600 mm/a. The raw water source for the city is Lake Mutirikwi. Apart from providing water for the city, Lake Mutirikwi supports water supply schemes for several riparian farmers and large sugar cane irrigation schemes in the Triangle, Zimbabwe and Hippo Valley areas. The storage capacity of the lake, which was completed in 1960, is .

== Industry and transport ==

The town used to have large cattle ranches, but the country&#x27;s Land Reform Programme is sometimes blamed for decimating that industry. Small scale farmers now make up the majority of suppliers of agricultural produce. Masvingo is mainly a residential city. The informal sector also dominates industry in town.

=== Tourism ===

There are a variety of tourist attractions within a radius of the town. Within of Masvingo are the Great Zimbabwe National Monument, old ruins where the country derives its name and the Lake Mutirikwi Recreational Park and Kyle game resort with 12 different species, including the white rhino.

== Film and theatre ==

Masvingo is known in the country for producing film and theatre productions that compete with those from Harare and Bulawayo. The city&#x27;s film and theatre hub is located at the Charles Austin Theatre found at the city&#x27;s Civic Centre gardens. It was run by the Masvingo Drama Circle from 1971 until its decline in 2015. Young artists took over the running of the facility under the name Masvingo Theatre and Arts Clubs and that resulted in film and theatre productions that have put Masvingo on the map in the arts industry. One notable play that came from Masvingo was a stage play by playwright Charles Munganasa titled Operation Restore Regasi which made international headlines and told the story of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s fall from power. In 2017, a short film titled Seiko directed by Sydney Taivavashe won the outstanding short film production at the National Arts Merit Awards, Zimbabwe&#x27;s top entertainment award ceremony making it the first film award to be won by a Masvingo artist. Sabhuku Vharazipi is a comedian from Masvingo who rose to fame in 2013 with his famous drama comedy titled Sabhuku Vharazipi which won the hearts of many locals. He is known for his signature rural folk dressing, a shiny bald head as well as an unmistakable Karanga tone which distinguishes his productions from the others.

== Culture and recreation ==
The major soccer club in the town is Masvingo United, whose home ground is Mucheke Stadium in the suburb of Mucheke. There are many amateur social football clubs in the city and they usually play their games at the various grounds around the city. Annually, a Miss Masvingo Province pageant is held. The city is host to the Charles Austin Theatre located at the civic center, a venue synonymous to many theatre enthusiasts in the country. The film and television industry is growing in the city with the up-and-coming generation at the forefront of the development.

The Southern Rocks, one of the five first-class cricket teams in Zimbabwe until its disbandment after the 2013–14 season, played its home games at the Masvingo Sports Club.

Africa Talent Publishers is a publishing company based in Masvingo. The company was started in 2018 by two Great Zimbabwe University lecturers, Munyaradzi Mawere and Tapuwa Rubaya, to promote indigenous stories and encourage the growth of a reading culture. It is the first such establishment to be founded in Masvingo.

==International relations==


===Twin towns – Sister cities===

Masvingo is twinned with:

* Kernen, Germany.
The twinning was signed by the town mayors in 1990. This led to the forming of the Kernen-Masvingo association by Kernens Mayor Mr. Haussmann, the school headmaster Franz Miller and its board manager D. Kaiser for 7 years. This organisation has led many projects in Masvingo, including school partnerships, such as that between Karl-Mauch-Schule in Kernen and Bondolfi primary school (25 km), building of a dining room at the old peoples&#x27; home in Mucheke, the Runyararo-Frieden day clinic and the construction of 4 buildings at Alpha cottages orphanage. Many other projects have been realised: cholera medicine, water treatment chemicals, many containers with helping goods, introduction of the medicine Viramune/Nevirapin in 2001 to all hospitals in Zimbabwe by D. Kaiser, given free of charge by the German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim.

<doc id="447942" wikidata="Q3695891" url="?curid=447942" title="Cotes, Leicestershire">
<text>Cotes is a hamlet and very small civil parish near the town of Loughborough in Leicestershire, England. Cotes has a population of about 50. At the 2011 census the population remained less than 100 and was included in the civil parish of Burton on the Wolds.

The name &#x27;Cotes&#x27; derives from the Old English &quot;cot&quot; meaning &#x27;cottages&#x27;.

It lies on the River Soar, and Cotes Bridge provides the main bridging point in that area. The A60 Trunk Road goes over Cotes Bridge on its way out of Loughborough towards Nottingham. The B676, the only other significant nearby road, begins at the A60 just to the east of Cotes Bridge and goes off towards the village of Burton on the Wolds.

There was a minor battle at Cotes Bridge on 18 March 1644 during the First English Civil War, when Royalist forces captured the bridge on their way to relieve Newark. The medieval village of Cotes itself was abandoned around 1690, possibly because of plague, although most commentators suggest the impact of the inclosure acts is a more likely explanation. 

The former Member of Parliament for the local Loughborough constituency from 2010 to 2019, Nicky Morgan, chose to include the name of the area as part of her title upon elevation to the House of Lords as Baroness Morgan of Cotes.

<text>Primo Water Corporation (formerly Cott Corporation) is an American-Canadian water company offering multi-gallon bottled water, water dispensers, self-service refill water machines, and water filtration appliances. The company is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, and services residential and commercial customers across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Israel.

==Founding==
Cott Beverage Corporation was founded in 1923 by Solomon Cott, a Polish immigrant, with his sons Harry, Barney, Jack and Albert in Port Chester, New York. Harry Pencer, a clothier from Montreal, Quebec, began to import Cott sodas into Quebec in 1952. In 1955, Pencer acquired the Canadian rights to the Cott label and established Cott Beverages (Canada) Ltd., to bottle the Cott line of sodas. From 1976 to 1991, Cott expanded its distribution throughout Canada and back into the U.S. and into Europe. In 1969, the name was changed to Cott Beverages Ltd., and in 1991 to Cott Corporation.

== Acquisitions ==
In October 2000, Concord Beverages, with its Vintage brand seltzer water, was acquired from Honickman Group. In July 2010, Cott announced its acquisition of Cliffstar Corporation, a US supplier of store-supplied and made juice beverages.

Beginning in 2014, Cott expanded via acquisitions predominantly in the bottled water industry and exited the carbonated beverages business. In May 2014, Cott completed the acquisition of Aimia Foods (Holdings) Limited, a privately held producer and distributor of hot chocolate, coffee and powdered beverages, hot and cold cereal products located in Merseyside, United Kingdom. In December 2014, Cott completed the acquisition of DSS Group, Inc. a bottled water and coffee direct-to-consumer home and office delivery services provider in the United States. The aggregate consideration was approximately $1.25 billion.

In January 2016, Cott completed the acquisition of Aquaterra, a Canadian bottled water and coffee delivery services provider, for approximately C$62 million. Eight months later, Cott acquired Eden Springs, a European water and coffee deliverer, for approximately €470 million, and premium coffee roaster S&amp;D Coffee and Tea, for approximately $355 million.

<text>Warren Ransom Davis (May 8, 1793 – January 29, 1835) was an American attorney and Representative from South Carolina&#x27;s 6th congressional district from 1827 to 1835.

Davis was born in Columbia, South Carolina, pursued preparatory studies and graduated from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina Columbia) in 1810, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814, practicing in Pendleton. He later served as state solicitor of the western circuit from 1818 to 1824.

Davis was elected as a Jacksonian to the 20th United States Congress and 21st Congresses, reelected as a Nullifier to the 
22nd through 24th Congresses and served from March 4, 1827, until his death in Washington, D.C., on January 29, 1835, before the opening of the 24th Congress. During the 22nd Congress he was chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.

On the day after his death, his funeral was disrupted by an assassination attempt on President Andrew Jackson by a deranged house painter, Richard Lawrence. Davis is interred in the Congressional Cemetery.

<text>Taco Ockerse (born 21 July 1955), known mononymously as Taco, is an Indonesian-born Dutch musician and entertainer who started his career in Germany. He scored a global hit song in 1982 with a version of &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;.

==Early life ==
Taco Ockerse was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 21 July 1955. He spent many of his childhood years moving around the world, residing in the Netherlands, the United States, Singapore, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Germany. 

He attended the International School of Brussels, Belgium, and graduated in 1973. Afterwards, he studied interior decoration and finished acting school in Hamburg. He held lead roles in numerous school productions, including &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;; &quot;Carousel&quot;; &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;; and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

==Career==
In 1975, he began his first professional theatrical engagements in Hamburg. This included roles in &quot;Children&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, and roles as an ensemble member of the Thalia Theatre in a number of plays, including &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. He also directed and choreographed for the musical &quot;Nightchild&quot;. In 1979, he played &quot;Chino&quot; in John Neumeier&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; at Hamburg Opera House. He founded his first band, Taco&#x27;s Bizz, in 1979.

In 1981, Taco signed his first record contract with Polydor in West Germany for two record releases, whereon he released his first single, &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;, which in 1982 was issued by RCA Records for US release. The single was widely played throughout the US by late summer of 1983, eventually peaking at No. 4 in September 1983 on the Hot 100 as well as No. 1 on &quot;Cashbox&quot;. Although the single eventually earned him a Gold-certification for selling over one million copies, it was Taco&#x27;s only Top 40 hit in the US. In 1983 and 1984, he toured extensively throughout Europe. While the single &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot; topped the charts in Sweden and New Zealand, it entered the Top 5 in numerous countries including Norway, Austria, and Canada. His subsequent album, &quot;After Eight&quot;, was released in over 40 countries and managed to reach No. 4 in Norway, No. 5 in Canada, No. 11 in Austria, No. 17 in New Zealand, No. 23 in the United States, and No. 59 in Germany. The album earned Taco a number of Gold certifications including one in Finland for selling over 25,000 copies.

Taco&#x27;s second single &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; was a moderate success peaking at No. 49 in Germany, No. 46 in Canada, and No. 98 in the UK.

He appeared as a guest on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;Alan Thicke&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, a Bob Hope TV special, and many other TV shows while touring.

Taco&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face the Music&quot;, was recorded in 1984 for Polydor, which peaked at No. 58 in his home of West Germany and managed to enter the Top 100 in Canada peaking at No. 92. Taco continued to record, focusing mostly on the German market with albums &quot;Swing Classics/In the Mood of Glenn Miller&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Tell Me That You Like It&quot; in 1986 for Polydor. In 1987 he recorded the self-titled album &quot;Taco&quot;.

In 1989, he briefly flirted with contemporary dance music by releasing a pair of singles, &quot;Love Touch&quot; and &quot;Got to Be Your Lover&quot;, that were styled after the high energy disco sound popularised by Stock Aitken Waterman. Afterwards, he repositioned himself as a swing/soul singer. He has collaborated with Geff Harrison of Kin Ping Meh fame.

Between 1989 and 1996, Taco worked as an actor. He had television acting roles in &quot;Friedrichstadt Palast&quot; and &quot;Das Erbe der Guldenburgs&quot;, and an appearance in the film &quot;&quot;. He also appeared as &quot;Chico&quot; in the theatre production of &quot;Marx Brothers Radio Show&quot;, and played lead roles in &quot;Shakespeare Rock n Roll&quot; in Berlin and &quot;Shakespeare as We Like It&quot; in Austria.

On 11 October 2009, the first channel of Russian TV, 1TV, filmed the program &quot;Songs of the 20th Century&quot;. Taco appears with &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; in the sequence about the 1930s. The show was broadcast in January 2010. On 27 November 2009 he performed &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow, Russia. Furthermore, he was the star guest in the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Show 2009&quot; of Russian TV, which had about 84 million viewers in more than 20 countries.

In July 2010, Cleopatra Records Los Angeles released an entirely new re-recording of &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;. Taco&#x27;s vocals were recorded in Germany and the backing tracks with top studio musicians in their studio in L.A. On 1 March 2011, DingDing Music released the original song &quot;Timeless Love&quot; that was written and produced by Edgar Rothermich and Matthias Muentefering in the late 1980s. The studio recording that Taco performed as a duet with the singer Rozaa Wortham in Berlin was remixed in late 2010 in the U.S. and is now available for download.

On 11 March 2011, RTL Germany broadcast &quot;The Ultimate Chartshow - the most successful Evergreens of all time&quot;, where he appeared with &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Ritz&quot;.

<doc id="447959" wikidata="Q1350145" url="?curid=447959" title="Verbal noun">
<text>Historically, grammarians have described a verbal noun or gerundial noun as a verb form that functions as a noun. An example of a verbal noun in English is &#x27;sacking&#x27; as in the sentence &quot;The &quot;sacking&quot; of the city was an epochal event&quot; (wherein &quot;sacking&quot; is a gerund form of the verb &quot;sack&quot;). 

A verbal noun, as a type of nonfinite verb form, is a term that some grammarians still use when referring to gerunds, gerundives, supines, and nominal forms of infinitives. In English however, &quot;verbal noun&quot; has most frequently been treated as a synonym for &quot;gerund&quot;.

Aside from English, the term &quot;verbal noun&quot; may apply to:
* the citation form of verbs such as the masdar in Arabic and the verbal noun (&quot;berfenw&quot;) in Welsh 
* declinable verb forms in Mongolian that can serve as predicates, comparable to participles but with a larger area of syntactic use 

==Types==
Verbal nouns, whether derived from verbs or constituting an infinitive, behave syntactically as grammatical objects or grammatical subject. They may also be used as count nouns and pluralized but cannot be inflected vis-a-vis a given grammatical person. 

In English, gerunds used as verbal nouns comprise the suffix &quot;-ing&quot;. Examples of such uses are given below:
:: Killing the president was an atrocious crime.
:: He was chastised for not leaving a tip for the server.
:: Creating a backup file might be a good idea.
:: Thanks for giving us a heads-up.

Infinitives used as verbal nouns generally occur as prefaced by the particle &quot;to&quot;:
:: To be or not to be is the question.
:: To become a U.S. president, one must be a natural born U.S. citizen.
:: Try to stay calm.
:: Finding time to exercise requires proper planning.

Infinitives used as verbal nouns may not be prefaced by the particle &quot;to&quot;, however, when elided via ellipsis:
:: Having proper contacts might help you (to) get the job.
:: They couldn&#x27;t help but (to) notice and (to) snicker at the wardrobe malfunction. 

Verbs also may be nominalized through derivational processes, such as suffixes (as in &quot;discovery&quot; from the verb &quot;discover&quot;) or by simple conversion (as with the noun &quot;love&quot; from the verb &quot;love&quot;). The formation of such deverbal nouns is not generally a productive process, that is, it cannot be indiscriminately applied to form nouns from any verb (for example, there is no noun *&quot;uncovery&quot; for the verb &quot;uncover&quot;). When they exist, such deverbal nouns often tend to replace the regularly formed verbal noun (as &quot;discovery&quot; is usually used rather than &quot;discovering&quot;, although the latter is still common as a gerund), or else a differentiation in meaning becomes established.

<text>Dorilus Morrison (December 27, 1814 – June 26, 1897) was an American banker, businessman, and Republican politician. He was the first and third Mayor of Minneapolis and was a member of the Minnesota Senate.

==Life and career==
Morrison was born in Livermore, Maine. His first business was as a merchant supporting the lumber industry near Bangor, Maine. In 1854, Morrison visited Minnesota to investigate potential lumber interests. He was sufficiently impressed that he sold his businesses in Maine and moved to St. Anthony, Minnesota within a year. He became involved in the local lumber and milling industries (along with his fellow Mainer William D. Washburn) and became an early investor in the Minneapolis Milling Company (forerunner of today&#x27;s General Mills).

In 1863, Morrison was elected to represent the 5th district in the Minnesota State Senate and served from 1864 to 1865. When the city of Minneapolis was formally incorporated in 1867, Morrison was elected as its first mayor. He was re-elected to a second term in 1869 and ran unsuccessfully for a third in 1872.

Morrison supported the initial construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad along with William Washburn, George A. Brackett, William S. King and others. When the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis was chartered in 1872, Morrison was its first president. Around that same time, he began building a streetcar line in the city. He joined with other businessmen, and eventually hired Thomas Lowry, who got the line up and running in 1875. The line eventually merged with a line in neighboring St. Paul to become Twin City Rapid Transit.

Morrison died in 1897.

<text>twm (Tab Window Manager) is a window manager for the X Window System. Started in 1987 by Tom LaStrange, it has been the standard window manager for the X Window System since version X11R4. The name originally stood for Tom&#x27;s Window Manager, but the software was renamed Tab Window Manager by the X Consortium when they adopted it in 1989. twm is a stacking window manager that provides title bars, shaped windows and icon management. It is highly configurable and extensible.

twm was a breakthrough achievement in the early years, but has been superseded by other window managers, which unlike twm, use a widget toolkit rather than a combination of the X Toolkit Intrinsics and XRandR.

Various other window managers—such as vtwm, tvtwm, CTWM, and FVWM—were built on twm&#x27;s source code.

twm is still standard with X.Org Server, and is available as part of many X Window System implementations.

==Usage==


twm&#x27;s interface is different from modern common X window managers and desktop environments many of which tend to work similarly to the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. New users often find twm difficult without reading the manual page.

In the default configuration of twm, the title bar has two buttons:
*&quot;Resize button&quot; (nested squares): the user clicks here, drags the mouse pointer to the edge to be moved, then releases when the window is the desired size.
*&quot;Iconify button&quot; (circle): reduces the window to an icon.

There is no title bar button to close a window. A left click on the desktop brings up a menu, which includes an option to delete (close) a window. Window close functionality for the titlebar can be configured in the codice_1 file:
:See .

A &quot;left click&quot; on the title bar brings the window to the top of the window stack; a &quot;middle click&quot; moves the window; a &quot;right click&quot; sends the window to the bottom of the window stack.

Window focus follows the mouse pointer (point-to-focus), rather than being on whichever window was clicked last (click-to-focus).

When a new window is created, a 3×3 grid is displayed following the mouse pointer, waiting for the user to click where the window should appear — left-click to appear in that position with that size, middle-click to resize the window before its creation, right-click to appear at that position but long enough vertically to reach the bottom of the screen.

Note that any of the above may be changed with appropriate changes to the configuration file. (The system file is typically and the user file is typically .)

==History==
twm was written as a replacement for the uwm window manager by Tom LaStrange while he was working at Evans &amp; Sutherland, which was part of the X Consortium: &quot;I sat down at my monochrome Sun 3/50 and typed codice_2 and then opened the X11 documentation. twm was my first X program. About six months later, I convinced my manager to let me send a copy to the comp.windows.x newsgroup for testing.&quot; A version for X11R1 was published on the Usenet newsgroup on June 13, 1988.

Months later, Jim Fulton of the X Consortium (which was at the time part of MIT) approached Evans and Sutherland and asked them to turn over the code maintenance to the X Consortium and Fulton then made it compliant with the nascent Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual. Subsequently, twm was released as the standard sample window manager for X11R4, replacing uwm.

According to Fulton, the word &quot;tab&quot; was picked because it conveniently started with &#x27;T&#x27; and it put the emphasis on the squeezing feature window title bars, which made them look like folders with tabs.

==Authors==

twm was originally written by Tom LaStrange. Later contributors include Jim Fulton, Keith Packard and Dave Sternlicht, all of whom were employees of the X Consortium.

<doc id="447966" wikidata="Q5398539" url="?curid=447966" title="Esmeralda Santiago">
<text>Esmeralda Santiago (born May 17, 1948) is a Puerto Rican author known for her narrative memoirs and trans-cultural writing. Her impact extends beyond cultivating narratives as she paves the way for more coming-of-age stories about being a Latina in the United States, alongside navigating cultural dissonance through acculturation.

==Personal life==
Santiago was born on May 17, 1948, in the Macún neighborhood of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. She was the eldest of eleven children while raised mostly by her mother and partly by her father, though they were never married. Her family lived in the countryside and was descended from poor, peasant farmers. In 1961, at age 13, she moved to the United States. Santiago attended junior high school in Brooklyn and learned English in two years, then attended New York City&#x27;s prestigious Performing Arts High School. Upon graduating, Santiago attended community college and worked various jobs for eight years. After, she earned a full scholarship from Harvard, where she transferred and received her undergraduate degree and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1976. She continued her graduate education at Sarah Lawrence College where she received a Masters in Fine Arts degree in 1992. Santiago met and married Frank Cantor prior to graduating. The couple founded Cantomedia, a film and media production company, which has won numerous awards for excellence in documentaries. Santiago currently lives in Westchester County, New York with her husband.

=== Health ===
In 2008, Santiago noticed her manuscript, which she wrote the day before, was unintelligible and appeared like a foreign language. Her symptoms led her to believe she possibly suffered from a stroke, and after a doctor&#x27;s visit and tests, her suspicions became confirmed. The stroke affected the Wernicke&#x27;s area of the brain and made her unable to read and write in both Spanish, her native language, and English. Santiago relearned how to read and write English, as she did when she learned at age 13. Children&#x27;s books with illustrations helped Santiago connect words to the images, teaching her brain to read again.

Today, her reading and writing ability remains partially unrecovered. When she suffered her stroke, her novel, &quot;Conquistadora,&quot; was unfinished and her main goal in relearning written English was to finish it. She improved enough to complete her novel, but remained unable to do the Spanish translation of her piece herself. Santiago continues to write today and can produce about 300 words per day post-stroke, whereas she completed 1000 words a day prior. Her stroke, its effects and her ability to relearn language are chronicled in neurology magazines and other medical pieces, making her a case study for strokes and stroke recovery.

==Literature==

=== &quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot; ===
&quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot; was published in 1993 and takes an autobiographical approach to Santiago&#x27;s childhood. It details her life from early childhood and stops at her departure from Puerto Rico at age 13. She narrates growing up under imperialistic American ideologies that often conflict with her Puerto Rican culture. Aspects like familial relationships, food and coming-of-age are highlighted throughout the piece.

After receiving her degree from Harvard, Santiago returned to Puerto Rico to work. She experienced cultural dissonance as many Puerto Ricans considered her overly Americanized while Americans racially ostracized her for being Puerto Rican. Additionally, it became difficult for her to find employment, like other highly educated women in Puerto Rico. Santiago chose to return to the United States and began publishing short essays and stories in local press. She wrote &quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot; after gaining attention and encouragement from an editor in the United States. Santiago&#x27;s writing illustrates the important perspective of someone who experiences both Puerto Rican and American culture from an outside lens.

Santiago states that she chooses to &quot;write for women. I don&#x27;t care if men read my work... It&#x27;s women&#x27;s lives I&#x27;m interested in.&quot; Her intention in writing is to bring light to the patriarchal tendencies of Puerto Rican culture, both in the United States and on the island of Puerto Rico. In &quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot;, Santiago illustrates sexist experiences from her own life, extending recognition to other women who experienced similar treatment.

=== &quot;Almost a Woman&quot; ===
In &quot;Almost a Woman&quot;, published in 1998, Santiago extends upon her memoir &quot;When I was Puerto Rican&quot; and continues from her late childhood through adolescence in the United States. The main character, Negi, experiences identity crises at the hands of adolescence while simultaneously navigating acculturation after her move from Puerto Rico to Brooklyn, New York. Negi becomes faced with deciding how she would like society and her family to perceive her, forcing her to define how Puerto Rican and American she would like to be. Acquisition of English is Negi&#x27;s first stride towards bridging the gap between her Puerto Rican upbringing and her American school, as once she can speak English, her cultural identity becomes more fluid.

Santiago demonstrates the plight of Puerto Rican women living in the United States as they battle cultural identities. Her piece includes a scene in which Negi performs a play and celebrates with her American cast-mates at the end. She sees her parents far away and notices their cultural differences, and she also recognizes the dissonance between her cast-mates and herself. Like many other daughters of immigrants, Negi plays the role of the in-between: not Puerto Rican to her family, yet not American to her classmates. The in-between space marks her acculturation as she embodies both, yet neither, of the cultures. While Negi&#x27;s cultural position is common to immigrants, there is a paucity of literature regarding that subject, and Santiago creates a new path for daughters of Puerto Rican immigrants by recognizing and popularizing the difficulty of acculturation.pp

=== &quot;The Turkish Lover&quot; ===
&quot;The Turkish Lover&quot;, published in 2004, illustrates Santiago&#x27;s love affair with a Turkish film-maker, Ulvi, and documents its abusive aspects. The memoir picks up where &quot;Almost a Woman&quot; leaves off, and Negi escapes from her mother&#x27;s home to run away with Ulvi. Through Ulvi&#x27;s control, Negi, now nicknamed &quot;Chiquita&quot; by Ulvi, slowly loses aspects of her Puerto Rican identity, and by the end of their eight-year relationship, Chiquita no longer recognizes modern Puerto Rican pop culture. She matriculates into Harvard and begins to argue and defend political topics surrounding popular issues- including Puerto Rico. Chiquita then travels back to Puerto Rico and is struck by the mass destruction of natural beauty and the food-chains and big-box stores that replace it. The separation she feels from Puerto Rico is solidified and the narration shifts from third-person to first, as Santiago claims the main character for the first time in any of her memoirs and describes the sensation of coming into one&#x27;s self and feeling solidified in one&#x27;s identity. In claiming herself, she also breaks free from Ulvi, and graduates Magna Cum Laude from Harvard with no one in the audience.

Unique to &quot;The Turkish Lover&quot; is Santiago&#x27;s claim to the main character, alongside the different names the main character goes through throughout the piece. Her final memoir serves as a reclamation of her identity documenting the turbulence throughout her journey of acculturation and her abusive relationship. In the end, the protagonist &#x27;Santiago&#x27; is the same one that is writing, demonstrating personal growth and the achievement of defining oneself.

=== &quot;Conquistadora&quot; ===
&quot;Conquistadora&quot; is a novel published in 2011. It follows Ana&#x27;s characterization as she battles oppressive societal expectations of gender, class and race in 19th century Puerto Rico. Ana arrives in Puerto Rico at the age of 18 in search of power and money but instead faces the harsh realities of slavery on her sugar plantation. She becomes forced to navigate a society in which morality and immorality exist cohesively.

In writing &quot;Conquistadora&quot;, Santiago researched and explored Puerto Rican history extensively. Puerto Rican records and literature did not include narratives of women, the economically disadvantaged or enslaved peoples. Coming from a poor, rural family, Santiago did not have records of her family&#x27;s history, and &quot;Conquistadora&quot; is an imagined example of what her history could have been. Like other Latino writers of this time, Santiago&#x27;s writing serves as both a tool to discover and uncover her cultural identity, seen heavily in her exploration of her family&#x27;s history. Santiago also touches on the devastating impact of slavery on the people of Puerto Rico; something often glanced over by popular literature as some considered slavery in Puerto Rico to be less severe than in other nations.

=== Other works ===

* &quot;A Doll for Navidades&quot;, a children&#x27;s book written by Santiago, outlines her childhood Christmas traditions and includes her writing to the Three Magi to receive a doll for Christmas. Unlike many of her other pieces, the book is catered towards children but like her other pieces, it brings greater societal awareness to Puerto Rican culture and experiences.
* &quot;America&#x27;s Dream&quot;, published in 1997, depicts a Puerto Rican woman&#x27;s first encounters with the United States in suburban New York while also navigating a strained relationship with her daughter.
* &quot;Las Christmas&quot;, a collection of stories about the holidays by twenty-five Latino authors, was edited by Santiago.
* &quot;Las Mamis: Favorite Latino Authors Remember Their Mothers&quot; is a collection of stories about author&#x27;s mothers and was edited by Santiago.
* The screenplays &quot;Beverly Hills Supper Club&quot; and &quot;Button, Button&quot;.
* Santiago is a contributor to the anthologies &quot;Home: American Writers Remember Rooms of Their Own and Perspectivas Sobre Puerto Rico en Homenaje a Muñoz Rivera y Muñoz Marín, Fundacíón Luis Muñoz Marín.&quot;
* &quot;Las Madres&quot; is a powerful and heartbreakingly accurate portrait of those unimaginable hours and seemingly interminable days after the storm, and its plots and characters’ stories center around one important theme: the battle against forgetting.

==Impact==
Santiago creates feminist literature that is catered towards women, promote &quot;CP&quot; in High Schools paving the way for more women-centered narratives of the Latino experience. Autobiographies done by women were ignored until the late 1980&#x27;s, meaning that not many pieces existed to inspire Santiago&#x27;s work. Her use of the autobiographical, memoir-like, format allows for discussions of women&#x27;s societal gender role, biculturalism and bilingualism from a place of personal experience, making her work even more impactful on the reader. Additionally, as one of the first to write in this format, Santiago paved the way for exploring Puerto Rican and Latino identities in popular literature. Her writing allows more young, Latine, women and youth to feel justified in their journeys for cultural self-identification and fulfillment.

<text>U.S. Route 82 (US 82) is an east–west United States highway in the Southern United States. Created on July 1, 1931 across central Mississippi and southern Arkansas, US 82 eventually became a route extending from the White Sands of New Mexico to Georgia&#x27;s Atlantic coast.

The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Brunswick, Georgia, at an interchange with Interstate 95. It is co-signed for its last with U.S. Route 17. Its western terminus is in Alamogordo, New Mexico at an intersection with U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 70.

==Route description==

===New Mexico===
US 82 begins at an intersection with US highways 54 and 70 north of Alamogordo, and south of La Luz, New Mexico. Heading east out of Alamogordo the road ascends into the Sacramento Mountains, traveling through the Lincoln National Forest. While climbing steep Mexican Canyon, the highway passes the abandoned railroad trestles of the El Paso and Northeastern Railway, and passes through the only road tunnel in New Mexico. The road then traverses the New Mexico villages of High Rolls, Cloudcroft, and Mayhill After descending the mountains into the rugged, flat plains of eastern New Mexico, it generally follows a north-northeasterly bearing until Artesia, where it takes a more due-easterly bearing on through to Lovington, veering back slightly to the north before crossing into Texas.

===Texas===

US 82 crosses into Texas from New Mexico at Texas Farm to Market Road 769, turning northeastward toward Plains, where it merges with US 380. US 82 is co-signed with US 380 from Plains to Brownfield, where it joins US 62, and US 380 leaves the route. US 82/62 continues northeastward toward Lubbock.

In Lubbock, US 82 and US 62 split, where US 82 is a limited access freeway west of US Route 87. From Wolfforth to downtown Lubbock, US 82 is named Marsha Sharp Freeway after Marsha Sharp, former head basketball coach of the Texas Tech Lady Raiders and Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. It once again merges with US 62 (along with State Highway 114) east of the campus of Texas Tech University, where it continues eastward through Ralls, where US 62 makes a sharp turn to the north and leaves the route. US 82 continues eastward across the level plains of the Llano Estacado to Crosbyton and then dips downward as it crosses the White River of Blanco Canyon, where the Texas Department of Transportation maintains the Silver Falls Rest Area with facilities and hiking trails. After climbing out of Blanco Canyon, US 82 eventually exits the Llano Estacado and enters the rolling plains near Dickens, Texas.

US 82/SH 114 continues eastward as a co-signed route until Seymour, where it merges with U.S. Highways 183, 277 and 283, with US 183 and 283 leaving the route at Mabelle. US 82/277 continues eastward to Wichita Falls, merging with US 287 just south of downtown. US 82 leaves US 287 at Henrietta and continues east, signed independently (apart from various state highway routes) across the remainder of Texas, crossing into Arkansas in downtown Texarkana.

===Arkansas===
US 82 enters Arkansas in downtown Texarkana, then proceeds almost due east across the flat plains of the Red River. It crosses the Red River at Garland City on a new bridge, then passes through the towns of Lewisville and Magnolia. At Magnolia the route joins US 79 for approximately two miles before continuing eastward. U.S. Route 82 is proposed to cross Interstate 69 in the future. Next, US 82 passes through the cities of El Dorado and Strong before crossing the Ouachita River just north of Lake Jack Lee, then continues through Crossett and Hamburg to Lake Village. The route continues from there across the Mississippi River to Greenville, MS. US 82 closely follows the historical alignment of Arkansas Highway 2.

===Mississippi===

Through the entire state, the highway is four-laned with interchanges at major junctions. After crossing the Mississippi River from Arkansas via a four-laned, cable-stayed Mississippi River bridge, the road briefly travels northeast toward central Greenville, then turns east to Columbus, passing through Indianola, Greenwood, Winona, and Starkville, while bypassing Itta Bena.

According to the Mississippi Department of Transportation, construction is now underway on a U.S. 82 bypass around Greenville. The new road will commence at the recently opened Mississippi River Bridge and terminate at the current U.S. 82 near Leland, creating a half-loop freeway around South Greenville. Cloverleaf interchanges are presently being built at the freeway&#x27;s junctions with MS 454 and MS 1.

From Starkville east through Columbus and on to the Alabama state line, US 82 is built to freeway standards.

===Alabama===
Throughout Alabama, US 82 is paired with unsigned State Route 6 (SR 6). The highway enters the state east of Columbus, Mississippi, and bears southeast towards Northport and Tuscaloosa, where it crosses over I-20 and I-59 south of town. It is known in West Alabama as McFarland Boulevard, in memory of Ward Wharton McFarland, a political, business, and civic leader who died in 1979. After leaving Tuscaloosa, the route continues southeast, passing through the cities of Brent, Centreville, and Maplesville en route to Prattville, on the northern edge of the Montgomery metropolitan area. This approximately drive goes through some of the most rural areas of the state, much of it two lanes with the exception of the section from Tuscaloosa to Centreville. Upon arriving in Prattville, it runs concurrently with I-65, with which it goes through downtown Montgomery with (also junctioning with the current southern terminus of I-85), and splits off to the east south of downtown. After leaving Montgomery, the route continues southeast through Union Springs and Midway en route to Eufaula, on the Alabama–Georgia state line, where it junctions with US 431. The route then crosses over the Chattahoochee River into Georgetown, Georgia, over Lake Eufaula.

Currently in Pickens County, Alabama, a widening project of US 82 is underway to make the highway four lanes. New bridges are being constructed using Federal Highway Administration monies, as well as matching Alabama Department of Transportation funds. Four-laning the highway in Tuscaloosa County, west of Northport to the Pickens County line, was completed in the fall of 2010. The highway is now four lanes from the Mississippi state line to just southeast of Centreville at mile marker 88, with the exception of a short two lane stretch from Gordo to the Tuscaloosa County line.

===Georgia===

US 82 is a U.S. Highway in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Throughout much of southern Georgia, US 82 is paired with State Route 520 and designated as &quot;Corridor Z&quot; and &quot;South Georgia Parkway.&quot; West of Dawson, US 82 is paired with State Route 50, the historic State Route number for US 82 in Georgia. From Dawson onwards, US 82 becomes a four-lane highway as it moves through Albany and then onto Tifton where US 82 intersects with I-75. After this the highway moves east through southern plains and Waycross, near the Okefenokee Swamp. US 82 then proceeds to Brunswick, where it terminates at the intersection with I-95.

==History==
During the initial creation of the US Highway System, the US 82 designation was unassigned. The Mississippi Highway Department requested the creation of a route between Greenville and Columbus, additionally proposing that it should be extended eastward to Birmingham, Alabama, and into Arkansas. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) initially balked at the request because it was not accompanied by concurrent requests from Arkansas or Alabama, and because the proposed route utilized several private toll bridges. Following concurrence from Arkansas, the route was approved on July 1, 1931. In Arkansas, US 82 completely replaced State Road 2, running from the Mississippi River to US 71 in Texarkana. US 82 was extended east into Alabama and west into Texas in 1934; making US 82 a route from US 385 in Lubbock to US 11 in Tuscaloosa. Over the next eight years, construction and other routing improvements reduced the total length to . In 1948, the route was extended east to Waycross, Georgia, with an extension east to US 17 in Midway, Georgia eight years later.

On November 26, 1960, an extension to Las Cruces, New Mexico was denied due to substandard roadway conditions in New Mexico, but was later approved on June 18, 1963. The route was extended east to I-95 in Chester, Georgia on June 25, 1979. The east ends of US 82 and U.S. Route 84 were swapped in 1989 after the roads around Waycross, Georgia, were reconfigured. This change made US 82&#x27;s eastern terminus I-95 in Brunswick, Georgia, which is the current terminus today. New Mexico decided to delete an overlap with US 70 between Alamogordo and Las Cruces, resulting in the current western terminus at US 54/US 70.

<text>Jenny Julia Eleanor Marx (16 January 1855 – 31 March 1898), sometimes called Eleanor Aveling and known to her family as Tussy, was the English-born youngest daughter of Karl Marx. She was herself a socialist activist who sometimes worked as a literary translator. In March 1898, after discovering that her partner Edward Aveling had secretly married the previous year, she poisoned herself at the age of 43.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Eleanor Marx was born in London on 16 January 1855, the sixth child and fourth daughter of Karl Marx and his wife Jenny von Westphalen. She was called &quot;Tussy&quot; by her family from a young age. She showed an early interest in politics, even writing to political figures during her childhood. The hanging of the &quot;Manchester Martyrs&quot; when she was twelve, for example, horrified her and shaped her lifelong sympathy for the Fenians. Her father&#x27;s story-telling also inspired an interest in literature, and she could recite passages by William Shakespeare at the age of three. By her teenage years, that love of Shakespeare led to the formation of the &quot;Dogberry Club&quot; at which she, her family, and the family of Clara Collet, all recited Shakespeare whilst her father watched.

While Karl Marx was writing his major work, &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, in the family home, his youngest daughter Eleanor played in his study. Marx invented and narrated a story for Eleanor based on an anti-hero called Hans Röckle. Eleanor reported that it was one of her favourite childhood stories. The story is significant because it offered Eleanor lessons, by allegory, of the critique of political economy which Marx was writing in &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. As an adult, Eleanor was involved in translating and editing volumes of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. She also edited Marx&#x27;s lectures, &quot;Value, Price and Profit&quot; and &quot;Wage Labour and Capital&quot;, which were based on the same material, into books. Eleanor Marx&#x27;s biographer, Rachel Holmes, writes: &quot;Tussy&#x27;s childhood intimacy with [Marx] whilst he wrote the first volume of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; provided her with a thorough grounding in British economic, political and social history. Tussy and &quot;Capital&quot; grew up together&quot;.

At the age of sixteen, Eleanor became her father&#x27;s secretary and accompanied him around the world to socialist conferences. A year later, she fell in love with Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, a journalist and participant in the Paris Commune, who had fled to London after the Commune&#x27;s suppression. Although he agreed with the man politically, Karl Marx disapproved of the relationship because of the age gap between the two, Lissagaray being 34 years old. In May 1873, Eleanor moved away from home to Brighton working as a schoolteacher. She lived at 6 Vernon Terrace in the suburb of Montpelier, returning to London in September 1873.

In 1876, Eleanor helped Lissagaray write &quot;History of the Commune of 1871&quot;, and translated it into English. Her father liked the book but was still disapproving of his daughter&#x27;s relationship with its author. By 1880, Karl changed his view of the situation, and allowed her to marry him. By then, however, Eleanor herself was having second thoughts, and she terminated the relationship in 1882.

In the early 1880s, she had to nurse her ageing parents. Her mother died in December 1881 but, from August 1882, she also cared for her young nephew Jean Longuet for several months, easing the burden on her elder sister, Jenny Longuet, who died in January 1883 of bladder cancer. Her father died two months later, in March 1883. After that, Eleanor and Edward Aveling, overseen by Friedrich Engels, prepared the first English language edition of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; volume I, published in 1887. On Engels&#x27; death in 1895, she and Aveling sorted and stored her father&#x27;s extensive papers.

Marx identified strongly with her Jewish heritage. In a reversal of her paternal grandparents&#x27; abandonment of Judaism and conversion to Christianity, she proudly declared: &quot;I am a Jewess&quot;. Her interest in her Jewish heritage was sparked by her interactions with working-class Jewish sweatshop workers involved in social justice struggles in the East End of London, and also by the Dreyfus affair in France. Her earliest Jewish engagement was in October 1890, when she attended a meeting of a group of Jewish socialist workers in London in order to protest against antisemitic persecution in Czarist Russia. She learned Yiddish and sometimes delivered lectures in the language.

===Career===
In 1884, Eleanor joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), led by Henry Hyndman, and was elected to its executive. During her work in the SDF, she met Edward Aveling, with whom she would spend the rest of her life, despite his faithlessness, alleged thievery from the movement, and mental cruelty.

====Socialist League====
In 1885, after some bitter polemics, there was a split in the SDF. Eleanor Marx and some others left it and founded the rival Socialist League.

The split had two root causes: personality problems, as Hyndman was accused of leading the SDF in a dictatorial fashion, and disagreements on the issue of internationalism. At that point, Marx, among others, accused Hyndman of nationalist tendencies. He was, for example, opposed to Marx&#x27;s idea of sending delegates to the French Workers&#x27; Party, calling the proposal a &quot;family manoeuvre&quot;, given that Eleanor Marx&#x27;s sister Laura and her husband Paul Lafargue were members of that party. Therefore, both Marx and Aveling became founding members of the Socialist League, the most prominent member of which was William Morris.

Other leaders of the Socialist League were Ernest Belfort Bax, Sam Mainwaring, and Tom Mann, the latter two being representatives of the working class. Annie Besant was also an active member.

Marx wrote a regular column, called &quot;Record of the Revolutionary International Movement&quot;, for the Socialist League&#x27;s monthly newspaper, &quot;Commonweal.&quot;

In 1884, Marx met Clementina Black, a painter and trade unionist, and became involved in the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. She would go on to support numerous strikes, including the Bryant &amp; May strike of 1888 and the London Dock Strike of 1889. She spoke to the Silvertown strikers at an open meeting in November 1889, alongside her friends Edith Ellis and Honor Brooke. She helped organise the Gasworkers&#x27; Union and wrote numerous books and articles.

In 1885, she helped organise the International Socialist Congress in Paris. The following year, she toured the United States, along with Aveling and the German socialist Wilhelm Liebknecht, raising money for the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

By the late 1880s, the Socialist League was deeply divided between those advocating political action and its opponents, who were themselves split between those, such as William Morris, who felt that parliamentary campaigns represented inevitable compromises and corruptions, and an anarchist wing which opposed all electoral politics as a matter of principle. Marx and Aveling, as firm advocates of the principle of participation in political campaigns, found themselves in an uncomfortable minority in the party. At the 4th Annual Conference of the Socialist League, the Bloomsbury branch, to which Marx and Aveling belonged, moved that a meeting of all socialist bodies should be called to discuss the formation of a united organisation. That resolution was voted down by a substantial margin, as was another put forward by the same branch in support of contesting seats in both local and parliamentary elections. Moreover, at that meeting, the Socialist League suspended the 80 members of the Bloomsbury branch on the grounds that the group had put up candidates jointly with the SDF, against the policy of the party. The Bloomsbury branch thus exited the Socialist League for a new, albeit brief, independent existence as the Bloomsbury Socialist Society.

====Bloody Sunday====
Along with many other leading Socialists, Eleanor Marx took an active role in organizing the London demonstration of 13 November 1887, which was violently suppressed in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Several other demonstrations followed in the aftermath, with Eleanor urging the radical line. In the aftermath of Bloody Sunday, Marx wrote a report on the brutal treatment of women activists and protesters at the hands of police, decrying their actions in targeting women.

In 1893, Keir Hardie founded the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Marx attended the founding conference as an observer, while Aveling was a delegate. Their goal of shifting the ILP&#x27;s positions towards Marxism failed, however, and the party remained under a strong Christian socialist influence. In 1897, Marx and Aveling re-joined the Social Democratic Federation, like most former members of the Socialist League.

==== Translation work ====
After acquiring admission to the Reading Room of the British Museum, Eleanor first began work as a paid translator during the late 1870s. She spent many days there, researching information and working on her translations. In the late 1880s, she accomplished the first English translation of Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. Additionally, Eleanor translated &quot;Reuben Sachs&quot;, by Amy Levy, into German. Eleanor was involved as a translator or editor in 14 known works.

===Involvement in theatre===
In the 1880s, Eleanor Marx became more interested in theatre and took up acting, believing in its potential for promulgating socialism. In 1886, she performed a groundbreaking, if critically unsuccessful, reading of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; in London, with herself as Nora Helmer, Aveling as Torvald Helmer, and George Bernard Shaw as Krogstad.

She learned Norwegian in order to translate Ibsen&#x27;s plays into English and, in 1888, was the first to translate &quot;An Enemy of Society&quot;. Two years later, the translation was revised by William Archer and renamed &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;. Marx also translated Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; in 1890.

===Death and legacy===
In 1898, Eleanor discovered that the ailing Edward Aveling had secretly married a young actress, to whom he remained committed. His illness seemed to her to be terminal, and Eleanor was deeply depressed by the faithlessness of the man she loved.

On 31 March 1898, Eleanor sent her maid to the local chemist with a note on which she signed the initials of the man the chemist knew as &quot;Dr. Aveling&quot;, asking for chloroform (some sources say &quot;padiorium&quot;) and a small quantity of hydrogen cyanide (then called &quot;prussic acid&quot;) for her dog. On receiving the package, Eleanor signed a receipt for the poisons and sent the maid back to the chemist to return the receipt book. Eleanor then retired to her room, wrote two brief suicide notes, undressed, got into bed, and swallowed the poison.

When the maid returned, she discovered Eleanor in bed, scarcely breathing. A doctor was called for, but Eleanor had died by the time he arrived. She was aged 43. A post mortem examination determined the cause of death to have been poison, and a subsequent coroner&#x27;s inquest delivered a verdict of &quot;suicide while in a state of temporary insanity&quot;, clearing Aveling of criminal wrongdoing. However, he was widely reviled throughout the socialist community as having caused Eleanor to take her life.

A funeral service was held in a room at the London Necropolis railway station at Waterloo on 5 April 1898, attended by a large throng of mourners. Speeches were made by Aveling, Robert Banner, Eduard Bernstein, Pete Curran, Henry Hyndman and Will Thorne. Following the memorial, Eleanor Marx&#x27;s body was taken by rail to Woking and cremated. An urn containing her ashes was subsequently kept safe by a succession of left-wing organisations, including the Social Democratic Federation, the British Socialist Party, and the Communist Party of Great Britain, before finally being buried alongside the remains of Karl Marx and other family members in the tomb of Karl Marx at Highgate Cemetery in London in 1956.


On 9 September 2008, an English Heritage blue plaque was placed on the house at 7 Jews Walk, Sydenham, south-east London, where Eleanor spent the last few years of her life.

<doc id="447974" wikidata="Q348926" url="?curid=447974" title="Quintus Petillius Cerialis">
<text>Quintus Petillius Cerialis Caesius Rufus ( AD 30 — after AD 83), otherwise known as Quintus Petillius Cerialis, was a Roman general and administrator who served in Britain during Boudica&#x27;s rebellion and went on to participate in the civil wars after the death of Nero. He later crushed the rebellion of Julius Civilis and returned to Britain as its governor.

Because he probably succeeded Caesius Nasica as commander of Legio IX Hispana, and since brothers are often attested as serving in succession in the same post, Anthony Birley suggests that Cerialis was the younger brother of Nasica, and had been adopted by Petillius Rufus, who was known as praetor in AD 28. However, in his monograph of naming practices in the first centuries of the Roman Empire, Olli Salomies argues that Cerialis was actually the biological son of Petillius Rufus by a woman named Caesia, who may have been the daughter of a Caesius Cerialis, therefore Caesius Nasica would not have been his brother &quot;but a close relative.&quot;

==Boudican rebellion==
His first important assignment was as legate of Legio IX Hispana (Ninth Iberian Legion) in the Roman province of Britannia, under governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. In the defeat of the 60/61 rebellion led by Queen Boudica of the Iceni, Cerialis suffered a serious defeat when attempting to relieve the city of Camulodunum (Colchester), which was taken by the Britons before he arrived. &quot;The victorious enemy met Petilius Cerialis, commander of the ninth legion, as he was coming to the rescue, routed his troops, and destroyed all his infantry. Cerialis escaped with some cavalry into the camp, and was saved by its fortifications.&quot;

==Civil war==
As the son in law of Vespasian, being the husband of Domitilla the Younger, Cerialis was made a hostage by Vitellius in 69, during the civil wars of the Year of Four Emperors. Cerialis managed to escape disguised as a peasant and joined the Flavian army. He was one of the cavalry leaders that conquered Rome for the approaching Vespasian. His role was to enter Rome via Sabine territory along the Via Salaria.

This success and his brother-in-law&#x27;s trust gave him the command of XIV &quot;Gemina&quot;, then stationed in the difficult province of Germania Inferior. Again, Cerialis had to deal with a local revolt, the Batavian rebellion, in which the local tribes, led by Julius Civilis, a romanized prince, besieged two Roman legions at Xanten. Cerialis was again successful and received honours from Vespasian, which included his first consulate.

==Later career==
In 71, Cerialis was appointed governor of Roman Britain, bringing the II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; with him to the province. He was supported by Gnaeus Julius Agricola, commander of XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot;.

As governor, Cerialis campaigned against the Brigantes of northern England. In 74, Cerialis left Britain; a military diploma dated 21 May 74 attests he was consul a second time, with Titus Clodius Eprius Marcellus as his colleague.

According to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Tacitus says that he was a bold soldier rather than a careful general, and preferred to stake everything on the issue of a single engagement. He possessed natural eloquence of a kind that readily appealed to his soldiers. His loyalty to his superiors was unshakable&quot;.

<text>Submarines of the United States Navy are built in classes, using a single design for a number of boats. Minor variations occur as improvements are incorporated into the design, so later boats of a class may be more capable than earlier. Also, boats are modified, sometimes extensively, while in service, creating departures from the class standard. However, in general, all boats of a class are noticeably similar.

Experimental use: an example is , which used an unprecedented hull design. In this list such single boat &quot;classes&quot; are marked with &quot;(unique)&quot;.

<text>The Franklin stove is a metal-lined fireplace named after Benjamin Franklin, who invented it in 1742. It had a hollow baffle near the rear (to transfer more heat from the fire to a room&#x27;s air) and relied on an &quot;inverted siphon&quot; to draw the fire&#x27;s hot fumes around the baffle. It was intended to produce more heat and less smoke than an ordinary open fireplace, but it achieved few sales until it was improved by David Rittenhouse. It is also known as a &quot;circulating stove&quot; or the &quot;Pennsylvania fireplace&quot;. 

==History==
The two distinguishing features of Franklin&#x27;s stove were a hollow baffle (a metal panel that directed the flow of the fire&#x27;s fumes) and a flue that acted as an upside-down siphon.
===Baffles in fireplaces===

Baffles were used to lengthen the path that either a room&#x27;s air or a fire&#x27;s fumes had to flow through ductwork, thereby allowing more heat to be transferred to the room&#x27;s air temperatures or from the fire&#x27;s fumes. Specifically, ducts could be installed within the brickwork around a hearth; cool room air would then enter the lower end of a duct, be heated by the hot walls of the duct, rise, and finally exit from the duct&#x27;s upper end, and return to the room. The longer the path through which the air flowed, the more heat would be transferred from the fire to the air. Similarly, the longer the duct through which a fire&#x27;s fumes had to flow before reaching the chimney, the more heat would be transferred from the fumes to the room&#x27;s air.

The use of baffles to extract more heat from a fire and its fumes was not new. In 1618, Franz Kessler (c. 1580–1650) of Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany published &quot;Holzsparkunst&quot; (&quot;The Art of Saving Wood&quot;), featuring a stove in which the fumes from a fire were forced to snake through five chambers, one above the other, before entering the chimney. Kessler also documented an enclosed heating stove that, like Franklin&#x27;s stove, had a baffle directly behind the fire, thereby lengthening the path that the fire&#x27;s fumes had to travel before reaching the chimney.

In 1624, a French physician, Louis Savot (1579–1640), described a fireplace that he had built in the Louvre. Ducts passed under, behind, and above the fire in the hearth. Cool air in the room entered the lower opening of a duct, was warmed, rose, and returned to the room through the duct&#x27;s upper opening. In 1713, Frenchman Nicolas Gauger (c. 1680–1730) published a book, &quot;La Mécanique du Feu&quot; (The Mechanics of Fire), in which he presented novel designs for fireplaces. Gauger surrounded the hearth with hollow spaces. Inside these spaces were baffles. Cool room air entered the spaces through lower openings, was warmed as it snaked around the baffles in the spaces, and returned to the room through upper openings.

In Franklin&#x27;s stove, a hollow baffle was positioned inside and near the rear of the stove. The baffle was a wide but thin cast-iron box, which was open to the room&#x27;s air at its bottom and two holes on its sides, near its top. Air entered the bottom of the box and was heated both by the fire and by the fumes flowing over the front and back of the box. The warmed air then rose inside the baffle and exited through the holes in the baffle&#x27;s sides. Franklin&#x27;s baffle thus performed at least two functions: like Kessler&#x27;s heating stove, it lengthened the path that the fire&#x27;s fumes had to follow before reaching the chimney, allowing more heat to be extracted from the fumes; and like Gauger&#x27;s fireplace, it placed a duct near the fire, which heated the room&#x27;s air via convection.

===Inverted siphons in fireplaces===

Some early experimenters reasoned that if a fire in a fireplace were connected by a U-shaped duct to the chimney, the hot gases ascending through the chimney would draw the fire&#x27;s smoke and fumes first downwards through one leg of the U and then upwards through the other leg and the chimney. This was what Franklin called an &quot;aerial syphon&quot; or &quot;syphon revers&#x27;d&quot;. This inverted siphon was used to draw the fire&#x27;s hot fumes up the front and down the back of the Franklin stove&#x27;s hollow baffle, in order to extract as much heat as possible from the fumes.

The earliest known example of such an inverted siphon was the 1618 fireplace of Franz Kessler. The fire burned in a ceramic box. Inside the box and behind the fire was a baffle. The baffle forced the fire&#x27;s fumes to descend behind the baffle before exiting to the chimney. The intention was to extract as much heat as possible from the fumes by extending the path that the fumes had to follow before they reached the chimney.

The 1678 fireplace of Prince Rupert (1619–1682) also included an inverted siphon. Rupert placed a hanging iron door between the fire grate and the chimney. In order to exit through the chimney, the fire&#x27;s fumes and smoke first had to descend below the edge of the door before rising through the chimney.

Another early example of an inverted siphon was a stove that was exhibited in 1686 at the annual Foire Saint-Germain, Paris. Its inventor, André Dalesme (1643–1727), called it a smokeless stove (&quot;furnus acapnos&quot;). The stove consisted of an iron bowl in which the fuel was burned. A pipe extended from the bowl&#x27;s bottom and then upwards into a chimney. Shortly after starting a fire in the bowl, hot air would begin to rise through the pipe and then up the chimney; this created a downward draft through the bowl, which drew the fire and its fumes down into the bowl. Once the draft was initiated, it was self-sustaining as long as the fire burned. Dalesme&#x27;s stove could burn wood, incense, and even &quot;coal steept in cats-piss&quot; yet produce very little smoke or smell. These results showed that fires could be used inside a room, without filling the house with smoke.

Franklin&#x27;s stove contained a baffle directly behind the fire, which forced the fire&#x27;s fumes to flow downward before they reached the chimney. This required a U-shaped duct in the floor behind the stove, so that the fumes could flow from the stove into the chimney. Thus Franklin&#x27;s stove incorporated an inverted siphon.

===Franklin&#x27;s research and development===

Gauger&#x27;s book on his innovative fireplace designs was translated into English – &quot;Fires Improv&#x27;d: Being a New Method of Building Chimneys, So as to Prevent their Smoaking&quot; (1715) – by a French immigrant to England, Jean Théophile Desaguliers (1683–1744). In a postscript to Desaguliers&#x27; book &quot;A Course in Experimental Philosophy&quot; (1744), Desaguliers again briefly described Gauger&#x27;s fireplaces and mentioned his own work on the subject. Franklin read both of Desaguliers&#x27; books and developed his own designs for a stove that could provide more heat with less smoke.

In 1742, Franklin finished his first design which implemented new scientific concepts about heat which had been developed by the Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738), a proponent of Isaac Newton&#x27;s ideas. He supplied his equipment from a local iron pioneer William Branson from Reading, PA. Franklin wanted his stoves to be available to everyone, relishing popular appreciation of his handiwork and eschewing patents. This combination of events led to the first Franklin stoves being manufactured by Reading furnaces, which was owned by the local Van Leer family. Two years later, Franklin wrote a pamphlet describing his design and how it operated in order to sell his product. Around this time, the deputy governor of Pennsylvania, George Thomas, made an offer to Franklin to patent his design, but Franklin never patented any of his designs and inventions. He believed &quot;that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously&quot;. As a result, many others were able to use Franklin&#x27;s design and improve it. Although his stove was intended to have the double purpose of cooking and heating a room, as time progressed and new stove designs became available, the Franklin stove&#x27;s main use became to heat a room. Many others improved on the Franklin stove design, but to this day, most American fireplaces are box-shaped, similar to the Franklin stove. The exception is the Rumford fireplace, developed by Benjamin Thompson.

==Stove design==
The stove was about 30 inches (76 cm) tall, with a box shape. The front was open, except for a decorative panel in the upper part of the box. The back of the box was to be placed a few inches away from the flue (chimney). On the bottom panel there were several holes to allow the smoke to escape; these were connected to the chimney. The panels were bolted together with iron screws through pre-cast ears. Inside there was a small, thin rectangular prism that would force the smoke into the holes. The plates were all made from iron.

Franklin&#x27;s stove sold poorly. The problem lay with the inverted siphon: the smoke had to pass through a cold flue (which was set in the floor) before the smoke could enter the chimney; consequently, the smoke cooled too much and the stove did not have a good draft. The inverted siphon would operate properly only if the fire burned constantly, so that the temperature in the flue was high enough to produce a draft.

A later version, designed by David Rittenhouse, solved many of the problems Franklin&#x27;s original stove had, and became popular. Franklin&#x27;s fame outweighed Rittenhouse&#x27;s, though, so history remembers the Franklin Stove rather than the Rittenhouse Stove. The smaller Latrobe stove, often referred to as a Baltimore Heater, was patented in 1846 and became popular. The Franklin stove was named after Benjimen Franklin.

<text>Stellarton is a town located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. It is adjacent and to the south of the larger town of New Glasgow. In pioneer times the area was called Coal Mines Station, and from 1833 until 1889, it was known as Albion Mines. The town was incorporated as Stellarton in 1889 and owes its name to a specific type of torbanite which came to be known as &quot;stellarite&quot; because of the &quot;stars of fire&quot; given off by its sparky flame.

==History==
In the 1790s, coal quickly became a key focus of the local economy. The Foord coal seam (from which the main street of Stellarton derives its name) runs through most of the town and is part of the greater Stellarton Basin/Pictou Coalfield. As part of an area recognized by geologists for its unique oil shales and thick coal seams, the Foord seam is said to be the thickest in the world with estimate of coal seams being as thick as 48 feet.

In the 1820s, the mines were taken over by the General Mining Association which intensified production with new technology including the first steam engine in Nova Scotia for pumping and in 1839 Samson, the oldest railway locomotive in Canada which carried coal to waiting ships.

Samson is now preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry in Stellarton.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Stellarton had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Major businesses ==
The town is still home to coal mining operations, the Stellarton Surface Coal Mine has been operated by Pioneer Coal since 1980.

The Canadian grocery chain Sobeys is based out of Stellarton, and its corporate offices and grocery subsidiaries provides a fair percentage of the town&#x27;s employment. Sobeys subsidiaries based in Stellarton include Big 8 Beverages, TRA Cash and Carry, Eastern Sign-Print and Regional Distribution Centre.

One business that did not work out was the Clairtone factory, the brainchild of entrepreneurs Peter Munk and David Gilmour, encouraged by local businessman and politician Frank H. Sobey.

==Attractions==
Stellarton is home to the Nova Scotia Museum of Industry, part of the Nova Scotia Museum system. Stellarton is noted for its painted fire hydrants, each adorned with a costumed representative of a town inhabitant or profession.

=== Stellarton Memorial Ice Rink ===
The Stellarton Memorial Rink is a Rink in Stellarton that was made in 1945 to remember the soldiers that died in World War I and World War II. The rink is still standing today but has not been used for several years.

==Notable people==
* James Peter Robertson - recipient of the Victoria Cross
* Leo McKay Jr. - novelist

<doc id="447986" wikidata="Q2916569" url="?curid=447986" title="Foraging">
<text>Foraging is searching for wild food resources. It affects an animal&#x27;s fitness because it plays an important role in an animal&#x27;s ability to survive and reproduce. Foraging theory is a branch of behavioral ecology that studies the foraging behavior of animals in response to the environment where the animal lives.

Behavioral ecologists use economic models and categories to understand foraging; many of these models are a type of optimal model. Thus foraging theory is discussed in terms of optimizing a payoff from a foraging decision. The payoff for many of these models is the amount of energy an animal receives per unit time, more specifically, the highest ratio of energetic gain to cost while foraging. Foraging theory predicts that the decisions that maximize energy per unit time and thus deliver the highest payoff will be selected for and persist. Key words used to describe foraging behavior include &quot;resources&quot;, the elements necessary for survival and reproduction which have a limited supply, &quot;predator&quot;, any organism that consumes others, &quot;prey&quot;, an organism that is eaten in part or whole by another, and &quot;patches&quot;, concentrations of resources.

Behavioral ecologists first tackled this topic in the 1960s and 1970s. Their goal was to quantify and formalize a set of models to test their null hypothesis that animals forage randomly. Important contributions to foraging theory have been made by:
*Eric Charnov, who developed the marginal value theorem to predict the behavior of foragers using patches;
*Sir John Krebs, with work on the optimal diet model in relation to tits and chickadees;
*John Goss-Custard, who first tested the optimal diet model against behavior in the field, using redshank, and then proceeded to an extensive study of foraging in the common pied oystercatcher.

==Factors influencing foraging behavior==
Several factors affect an animal&#x27;s ability to forage and acquire profitable resources.

=== Learning ===
Learning is defined as an adaptive change or modification of a behavior based on a previous experience. Since an animal&#x27;s environment is constantly changing, the ability to adjust foraging behavior is essential for maximization of fitness. Studies in social insects have shown that there is a significant correlation between learning and foraging performance.

In nonhuman primates, young individuals learn foraging behavior from their peers and elders by watching other group members forage and by copying their behavior. Observing and learning from other members of the group ensure that the younger members of the group learn what is safe to eat and become proficient foragers.

One measure of learning is &#x27;foraging innovation&#x27;—an animal consuming new food, or using a new foraging technique in response to their dynamic living environment. Foraging innovation is considered learning because it involves behavioral plasticity on the animal&#x27;s part. The animal recognizes the need to come up with a new foraging strategy and introduce something it has never used before to maximize his or her fitness (survival). Forebrain size has been associated with learning behavior. Animals with larger brain sizes are expected to learn better. A higher ability to innovate has been linked to larger forebrain sizes in North American and British Isle birds according to Lefebvre et al. (1997). In this study, bird orders that contained individuals with larger forebrain sizes displayed a higher amount of foraging innovation. Examples of innovations recorded in birds include following tractors and eating frogs or other insects killed by it and using swaying trees to catch their prey.

Another measure of learning is spatio-temporal learning (also called time-place learning), which refers to an individual&#x27;s ability to associate the time of an event with the place of that event. This type of learning has been documented in the foraging behaviors of individuals of the stingless bee species &quot;Trigona fulviventris.&quot; Studies showed that &quot;T. fulviventris&quot; individuals learned the locations and times of feeding events, and arrived to those locations up to thirty minutes before the feeding event in anticipation of the food reward.

===Genetics===

Foraging behavior can also be influenced by genetics. The genes associated with foraging behavior have been widely studied in honeybees with reference to the following; onset of foraging behavior, task division between foragers and workers, and bias in foraging for either pollen or nectar. Honey bee foraging activity occurs both inside and outside the hive for either pollen or nectar. Similar behavior is seen in many social wasps, such as the species &quot;Apoica flavissima&quot;. Studies using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping have associated the following loci with the matched functions; Pln-1 and Pln-4 with onset of foraging age, Pln-1 and 2 with the size of the pollen loads collected by workers, and Pln-2 and pln-3 were shown to influence the sugar concentration of the nectar collected.

Some behaviors are more dominant than others. In a study using fruit fly larvae (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;), there were two types of foraging strategies: rovers and sitters. Rovers used the strategy of moving across multiple patches in search for food, while sitters remained in one patch with no inclination to go searching. Both of these strategies are polymorphic traits that naturally occur within the larval stages of fruit flies. The gene responsible for major effects on foraging behavior in Drosophila melanogaster larvae is the chaser (&quot;Csr&quot;) gene. During the study, homozygous strains were produced by crossing the rovers with rovers and sitters with sitters. Using the method of hybridization - crossing rovers with sitters - all of the offspring displayed the rover foraging behavior, thus demonstrating that it is an allele of complete dominance.

===Presence of predators===

The presence of predators while a (prey) animal is foraging affects its behaviour. In general, foragers balance the risk of predation with their needs, thus deviating from the foraging behaviour that would be expected in the absence of predators. An example of this balanced risk can be observed in the foraging behavior of &quot;A. longimana&quot;.

===Parasitism===
Parasitism can affect the way in which animals forage. For an organism to counteract the procurement of a parasite, they may display avoidance towards certain areas where parasites have previously been discovered. This avoidance behavior is a trade-off mechanism where the loss of time and energy in avoiding food patches is traded with the decrease in risk of contracting a parasite. Adaptations in diet also help in the prevention of parasitic infection. By avoiding foods that have high potential for parasitic contamination, as well as including food items that contain anti-parasitic properties in the diet. These anti-parasitic properties can be used in a self-medicating way, either prophylactically or therapeutically.
===Interactions with environment===
Interactions with the environment significantly influence foraging behavior by dictating the availability of resources, the competition among others, the presence of predators, and the complexity of the landscape. These factors can affect the strategies animals use to find food, the risks they&#x27;re willing to take, and the efficiency of their foraging patterns. For example, in environments with abundant resources, foragers may adopt less risky and energy-efficient strategies. Conversely, in resource-scarce or high-risk environments, more complex and risky foraging behaviors may evolve. For instance, &quot;Blepharida rhois&quot; differ in their behavior based on the food resources available in their environment. They will take on a more solitary or active role depending on their environment. 

==Types of foraging==
Foraging can be categorized into two main types. The first is solitary foraging, when animals forage by themselves. The second is group foraging. Group foraging includes when animals can be seen foraging together when it is beneficial for them to do so (called an aggregation economy) and when it is detrimental for them to do so (called a dispersion economy).

=== Solitary foraging ===
Solitary foraging includes the variety of foraging in which animals find, capture and consume their prey alone. Individuals can manually exploit patches or they can use tools to exploit their prey. For example, Bolas spiders attack their prey by luring them with a scent identical to the female moth&#x27;s sex pheromones. Animals may choose to forage on their own when the resources are abundant, which can occur when the habitat is rich or when the number of conspecifics foraging are few. In these cases there may be no need for group foraging. In addition, foraging alone can result in less interaction with other foragers, which can decrease the amount of competition and dominance interactions an animal deals with. It will also ensure that a solitary forager is less conspicuous to predators. Solitary foraging strategies characterize many of the phocids (the true seals) such as the elephant and harbor seals. An example of an exclusive solitary forager is the South American species of the harvester ant, &quot;Pogonomyrmex vermiculatus&quot;.

==== Search Behavior ====
Animals can typically be classified into two categories by their pattern of movement exhibited through foraging behaviors. These categories are &quot;cruise&quot; searchers and &quot;ambush&quot; searchers. Cruise searchers forage by continuously hunting for prey at the outer borders of the area being searched, while ambush searchers forage by sitting and waiting. They remain motionless for long durations as they wait on the prey to pass by, therefore initiating the ambusher to attack.

====Tool use in solitary foraging====

Some examples of tool use include dolphins using sponges to feed on fish that bury themselves in the sediment, New Caledonian crows that use sticks to get larvae out of trees, and chimpanzees that similarly use sticks to capture and consume termites.

==== Solitary foraging and optimal foraging theory====

The theory scientists use to understand solitary foraging is called optimal foraging theory. Optimal foraging theory (OFT) was first proposed in 1966, in two papers published independently, by Robert MacArthur and Eric Pianka, and by J. Merritt Emlen. This theory argues that because of the key importance of successful foraging to an individual&#x27;s survival, it should be possible to predict foraging behavior by using decision theory to determine the behavior that an &quot;optimal forager&quot; would exhibit. Such a forager has perfect knowledge of what to do to maximize usable food intake. While the behavior of real animals inevitably departs from that of the optimal forager, optimal foraging theory has proved very useful in developing hypotheses for describing real foraging behavior. Departures from optimality often help to identify constraints either in the animal&#x27;s behavioral or cognitive repertoire, or in the environment, that had not previously been suspected. With those constraints identified, foraging behavior often does approach the optimal pattern even if it is not identical to it. In other words, we know from optimal foraging theory that animals are not foraging randomly even if their behavior doesn&#x27;t perfectly match what is predicted by OFT.

=====Versions of OFT=====
There are many versions of optimal foraging theory that are relevant to different foraging situations. These models generally possess the following components according to Stephens et al. 2007;
*&quot;Currency&quot;: an objective function, what we want to maximize, in this case energy over time as a currency of fitness
*&quot;Decision&quot;: set of choices under the organism&#x27;s control, or the decisions that the organism exhibits
*&quot;Constraints&quot;: &quot;an organism&#x27;s choices are constrained by genetics, physiology, neurology, morphology and the laws of chemistry and physics&quot;
Some of these versions include:

The optimal diet model, which analyzes the behavior of a forager that encounters different types of prey and must choose which to attack. This model is also known as the prey model or the attack model. In this model the predator encounters different prey items and decides whether to spend time handling or eating the prey. It predicts that foragers should ignore low profitability prey items when more profitable items are present and abundant. The objective of this model is to identify the choice that will maximize fitness. How profitable a prey item is depends on ecological variables such as the time required to find, capture, and consume the prey in addition to the energy it provides. It is likely that an individual will settle for a trade off between maximizing the intake rate while eating and minimising the search interval between prey.

&quot;Patch selection theory&quot;, which describes the behavior of a forager whose prey is concentrated in small areas known as patches with a significant travel time between them. The model seeks to find out how much time an individual will spend on one patch before deciding to move to the next patch. To understand whether an animal should stay at a patch or move to a new one, think of a bear in a patch of berry bushes. The longer a bear stays at the patch of berry bushes the less berries there are for that bear to eat. The bear must decide how long to stay and thus when to leave that patch and move to a new patch. Movement depends on the travel time between patches and the energy gained from one patch versus another. This is based on the marginal value theorem.

Central place foraging theory is a version of the patch model. This model describes the behavior of a forager that must return to a particular place to consume food, or perhaps to hoard food or feed it to a mate or offspring. Chipmunks are a good example of this model. As travel time between the patch and their hiding place increased, the chipmunks stayed longer at the patch.

In recent decades, optimal foraging theory has often been applied to the foraging behavior of human hunter-gatherers. Although this is controversial, coming under some of the same kinds of attack as the application of sociobiological theory to human behavior, it does represent a convergence of ideas from human ecology and economic anthropology that has proved fruitful and interesting.

=== Group foraging ===
Group foraging is when animals find, capture and consume prey in the presence of other individuals. In other words, it is foraging when success depends not only on your own foraging behaviors but the behaviors of others as well. The biological behavior also inspired the development of Artificial Intelligence algorithms that try to follow the main concepts of group foraging by autonomous agents. An important note here is that group foraging can emerge in two types of situations. The first situation is frequently thought of and occurs when foraging in a group is beneficial and brings greater rewards known as an aggregation economy. The second situation occurs when a group of animals forage together but it may not be in an animal&#x27;s best interest to do so known as a dispersion economy. Think of a cardinal at a bird feeder for the dispersion economy. We might see a group of birds foraging at that bird feeder but it is not in the best interest of the cardinal for any of the other birds to be there too. The amount of food the cardinal can get from that bird feeder depends on how much it can take from the bird feeder but also depends on how much the other birds take as well. In red harvester ants, the foraging process is divided between three different types of workers: nest patrollers, trail patrollers, and foragers. These workers can utilize many different methods of communicating while foraging in a group, such as guiding flights, scent paths, and &quot;jostling runs&quot;, as seen in the eusocial bee &quot;Melipona scutellaris&quot;.

Chimpanzees in the Taï Forest in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire also engage in foraging for meats when they can, which is achieved through group foraging. Positive correlation has been observed between the success of the hunt and the size of the foraging group. The chimps have also been observed implying rules with their foraging, where there is a benefit to becoming involved through allowing successful hunters first access to their kills.

==== Cost and benefits of group foraging ====
As already mentioned, group foraging brings both costs and benefits to the members of that group. Some of the benefits of group foraging include being able to capture larger prey, being able to create aggregations of prey, being able to capture prey that are difficult or dangerous and most importantly reduction of predation threat. With regard to costs, however, group foraging results in competition for available resources by other group members. Competition for resources can be characterized by either scramble competition whereby each individual strives to get a portion of the shared resource, or by interference competition whereby the presence of competitors prevents a forager&#x27;s accessibility to resources. Group foraging can thus reduce an animal&#x27;s foraging payoff.

Group foraging may be influenced by the size of a group. In some species like lions and wild dogs, foraging success increases with an increase in group size then declines once the optimal size is exceeded. A myriad number of factors affect the group sizes in different species. For example, lionesses (female lions) do not make decisions about foraging in a vacuum. They make decisions that reflect a balance between obtaining food, defending their territory and protecting their young. In fact, we see that lion foraging behavior does not maximize their energy gain. They are not behaving optimally with respect to foraging because they have to defend their territory and protect young so they hunt in small groups to reduce the risk of being caught alone. Another factor that may influence group size is the cost of hunting. To understand the behavior of wild dogs and the average group size we must incorporate the distance the dogs run.

Theorizing on hominid foraging during the Aurignacian Blades &quot;et al&quot; (2001) defined the forager performing the activity to the optimal efficiency when the individual is having considered the balance of costs for search and pursuit of prey in considerations of prey selection. Also in selecting an area to work within the individual would have had to decide the correct time to move to another location corresponding to perception of yield remaining and potential yields of any given area available.

==== Foraging Arena Theory ====
A quantitative model that allows for the evaluation of trade-off decisions that occur in aquatic ecosystems. &#x27;Foraging arenas&#x27; are the areas in which a juvenile fish can forage closer to their home while also providing an easier escape from potential predators. This theory predicts that feeding activity should be dependent upon the density of juvenile fishes, and the risk of predation within the area. A balance between the growth and mortality of these juvenile fishes is reliant consequent to the duration of foraging performed by said juvenile fish. These components vary with regards to the habitat.

==== Group foraging and the ideal free distribution ====

The theory scientists use to understand group foraging is called the Ideal free distribution. This is the null model for thinking about what would draw animals into groups to forage and how they would behave in the process. This model predicts that animals will make an instantaneous decision about where to forage based on the quality (prey availability) of the patches available at that time and will choose the most profitable patch, the one that maximizes their energy intake. This quality depends on the starting quality of the patch and the number of predators already there consuming the prey.

<doc id="447990" wikidata="Q2018923" url="?curid=447990" title="Upstate New York">
<text>Upstate New York is a geographic region of New York that lies north and northwest of the New York City metropolitan area of downstate New York. Upstate includes the middle and upper Hudson Valley, the Capital District, the Mohawk Valley region, Central New York, the Southern Tier, the Finger Lakes region, Western New York, and the North Country. Major cities across upstate New York from east to west include the state capital of Albany, Utica, Binghamton, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo.

Before the European colonization of the United States, upstate New York was populated by several Native American tribes. It was home to the Iroquois Confederacy, an indigenous confederation of six tribes, known as the Six Nations. Henry Hudson made the first recorded European exploration of the region in 1609, and the Dutch erected Fort Orange (present-day Albany) in 1624, which was the first permanent European settlement in New York. The region saw many battles during the American Revolutionary War, with the Iroquois split between supporters of the loyalists and supporters of the revolutionaries. After the war ended, the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix kicked off a series of treaties and purchases that saw the Iroquois cede the vast majority of their land in upstate New York to the newly formed United States.

The 1825 opening of the Erie Canal across upstate New York transformed the economy of the region and the state. The canal greatly eased the movement of goods from across the upper Midwest and the cities along the Great Lakes through upstate New York and to the port of New York City. As a result, upstate New York became a hotbed for manufacturing during the Second Industrial Revolution, giving birth to such firms as General Electric, IBM, Kodak, and Xerox. The rapid industrialization led to a large influx of immigrants seeking jobs at factories across the region. Since the mid-20th century, American deindustrialization has contributed to economic and population decline, and the region is largely considered part of the Rust Belt.

There are a wide variety of land uses in the region, including urban, suburban, forested preserve, and rural landscapes. Due to its vast areas of rural land, upstate also supports a strong agricultural industry, and is notable for its dairy, maple syrup, and fruit production (especially apples), as well as winemaking. Upstate New York includes a number of notable waterways, with the Susquehanna, Delaware, and Hudson Rivers all originating in the region, and is bordered on its northern and western edges by the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. As a result, the region is a significant source of hydroelectric power (going back to the creation of the world&#x27;s first hydroelectric dam by Nikola Tesla at Niagara Falls) and drinking water (with multiple reservoirs serving New York City). Upstate New York is home to numerous popular tourist and recreational destinations, including Niagara Falls, the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains, the Thousand Islands, the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and the Finger Lakes.

==Definition==

There is no clear official boundary between upstate New York and downstate New York. The most expansive definition of the upstate New York region excludes only New York City and Long Island, which are always considered to be part of downstate New York; this usage is common among New York City residents and significantly less farther north. This definition is used by the Department of Environmental Conservation. A cheeky joke among Manhattanites is that anything north of 14th Street is &quot;upstate&quot;.

Another usage locates the upstate/downstate boundary farther north, at the point where New York City&#x27;s suburbs segue into its exurbs, as the exurbs do not generally fall within the Census Bureau-defined New York–Newark Urban Area. This latter boundary places most of the Lower Hudson Valley, or Westchester and Rockland counties and about one-third of Putnam County, downstate, while putting the northwestern edge of Rockland County as well as the northernmost quarter of Westchester County (including Peekskill) upstate. Conversely, area residents often use Interstate 84 to delineate a boundary between upstate and downstate New York.

Yet another usage follows the U.S. Census definition of the New York metropolitan area prior to 2010, which includes all of included Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam counties. This definition was used by the plaintiffs in the federal redistricting case &quot;Rodriguez v. Pataki&quot;.

In New York state law, the definition of the upstate boundary also varies: while Westchester is seemingly always considered downstate under state law, some definitions include Rockland and Putnam counties in the downstate region, and others also include Orange and Dutchess counties; all of these counties are served by Metro-North Railroad lines. Ulster County, and, in the largest state-defined extent of downstate, Columbia County, are also sometimes included. The division line between the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York places Sullivan County and Dutchess County in the Southern District, and Ulster and Columbia counties in the Northern District.

Residents of upstate New York typically prefer to identify with subregions, such as the Hudson Valley (Middle and Upper), the Capital District, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country, Western New York or Central New York.

Within New York, surveys have had difficulty determining a consensus. In a 2016 poll of New York voters in which respondents were asked to choose among four definitions of where upstate begins, three were about equally common, selected by between 25% and 30% of respondents each: north of New York City, north of Westchester County, and north of Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County. (The fourth, which also started north of Poughkeepsie but excluded Buffalo as a unique region neither upstate nor downstate, drew only 7%.) An informal 2018 poll found the Hudson Valley region is the most heavily disputed area regarding whether it is upstate or downstate.

A number of businesses and institutions in the area have &quot;upstate&quot; as part of their name. Examples of this include the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, the Upstate New York Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation serving 31 of New York&#x27;s 62 counties, and the VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York, which includes all of New York State northward and westward from Kingston in Ulster County. Other organizations in New York with &quot;upstate&quot; in their name include the Upstate Collegiate Athletic Association (now known as the Liberty League), the Upstate Correctional Facility, the Upstate New York Club Hockey League, the Upstate New York Synod, and the Upstate Citizens for Equality.

==History==
===Early history===

Before the arrival of Europeans, the area was long inhabited by Iroquoian-speaking people, mainly west of the Hudson River and around the Great Lakes and Algonquian-speaking people, mainly east of the Hudson River. The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization, and the French, Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples. The Haudenosaunee or Iroquois confederacy of the Five (later Six) Nations was a powerful force in its home territory.

The Five Nations&#x27; territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania. From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States. The Guswhenta (Two Row Wampum Treaty), made with the Dutch government in 1613, codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers, and formed the basis of subsequent treaties.

In the mid-17th century, during the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of Neutral Indians, Wenrohronon and the Erie Indians in western New York. Survivors were mostly assimilated into the Seneca people of the Iroquois; some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina, where they merged with other Indian tribes.

The region was important from the first days of both French and Dutch colonization in the seventeenth century. The New Netherland colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where Fort Orange (later Albany) was established in 1624. The fort at Schenectady was built in 1661. The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony&#x27;s fur trade, which was highly lucrative, serving a demand for furs in Europe.

North and west of New Netherland, the French established trading posts along the St. Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of Onondaga Lake. They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee, as Samuel de Champlain had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from New France. In the 1640s, three French Jesuit missionaries to New France—St. René Goupil, St. Isaac Jogues, and St. Jean de Lalande—were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers, where the modern hamlet of Auriesville was later developed. They are considered to be the first three U.S. saints.

England seized New Netherland by force in 1664, renaming it New York. The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later, but ceded it to England under the Treaty of Westminster of 1674.

In the eighteenth century, the British consolidated their hold on the region. William Johnson, a Scottish trader, established an estate in the Mohawk Valley, living among the Mohawk, learning their language, and forging an alliance with them. He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois. The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans, including German Palatines beginning in the 1720s.

In what became known as the Albany Congress in 1754, delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk. Benjamin Franklin, a Pennsylvania delegate, proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress. The delegates spent most of their time debating this Albany Plan of union, one of the first attempts to form a union of the colonies &quot;under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes&quot;. The delegates approved an amended version, but the colonies rejected it.

To counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the French and Indian War, such as the Battle of Fort Oswego (1756) and the Siege of Fort William Henry (which was later depicted in the work of James Fenimore Cooper), during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

The British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec. France formally ceded New France to the British in the Treaty of Paris of 1763. The same year, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds. The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, including west of the Appalachian Mountains, was to be the &quot;Indian Reserve.&quot;

===American Revolution===
Between 1774 and 1783, deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy, through attacks such as the Seneca-led Cherry Valley and the Mohawk-led Cobleskill massacre. In 1779, the Sullivan Expedition, a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General George Washington, drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages, farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks.

The region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces. British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the Battle of Valcour Island and the Battle of Saratoga, a significant turning point in the war. While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war, the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces. At the end of the war, the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh. Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages, some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the Newburgh Conspiracy.

===Post-revolutionary period===
After the American Revolution, the Treaty of Paris established the border between New York and British North America. The 45th Parallel became the border with Quebec or Lower Canada. The St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with Upper Canada. Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until 1794, including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River.

The government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown. Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule, such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada (now Ontario). Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled. The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies, who established the Grand River settlement.

In the federal Treaty of Canandaigua, the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Nevertheless, New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early 19th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non-Federally-sanctioned treaties, such as the Treaty of Big Tree. The Treaties of Buffalo Creek were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal Indian Removal program, but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time, and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion. Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day; one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of Salamanca, and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the 1990s.

Both before and after the Revolution, boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement. In conflict with the New York Colony&#x27;s claims west of the Hudson Valley, which placed the entire region in the sprawling Albany County, the Pennsylvania Colony claimed much of the Southern Tier until 1774, while the Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes.

The Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River. To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands. When Vermont declared independence in 1777, the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York. New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the &quot;Vermont Sufferers&quot; and were granted new lands in 1788 in the town of Bainbridge, New York.

The dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the 1786 Treaty of Hartford by dividing the rights to the land. The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York, but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the &quot;pre-emptive&quot; right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee. The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the Preemption Line. This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario, passing through Seneca Lake. The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts, including the Phelps and Gorham Purchase and the Holland Purchase.

Many of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The Central New York Military Tract, where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by Robert Harpur, was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the First and Second Canadian Regiments of the Continental Army, who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.

===19th century===
Battles of the War of 1812 (1812–1815) were fought on the Niagara Frontier; in the Champlain Valley, including the Battle of Plattsburgh; in the St. Lawrence Valley; and on Lake Ontario, including the Battle of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor. British forces also burnt Buffalo in retaliation for the American destruction of Newark in Canada. After the war, the US government began to construct Fort Montgomery just south of the border at Rouses Point on Lake Champlain. Subsequently, it was discovered that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line, putting the fort, which became known as &quot;Fort Blunder&quot;, in Canada. This was not resolved until 1842 with the Webster–Ashburton Treaty, in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed.

Slavery existed in New Netherland and the Province of New York. New York was in the 1690s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies. Slavery did not end with the American Revolution, although John Jay introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as 1777. Sojourner Truth was held as a slave in the Hudson Valley from the time she was born in 1797 until she escaped in 1826. Through efforts of the New York Manumission Society and others, New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in 1799. The law passed in 1817 that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years, giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states. When the law finally took effect, the last 2,800 slaves in New York State were emancipated on July 4, 1827.

Although routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years, transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow. Influenced by the canals being built in Britain, leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state. Governor DeWitt Clinton prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo. Construction of the Erie Canal began in 1817 and was completed in 1825. The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the 19th century industrial expansion in the United States. The canal also promoted trade with British North America and settlement of newer states in western territories. Later in the century the New York Central Railroad followed the &quot;water-level route&quot; from New York City to the Great Lakes, contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route.

Several times in the nineteenth century, upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain, as well as Irish-American invaders of Canada, straining British–American relations. In 1837 and 1838, in the aftermath of the Lower Canada Rebellion, some Québécois rebels escaped south to the North Country, while on the Niagara Frontier, events of the Upper Canada Rebellion, also known as the Patriot War, took place. In the late 1860s, some of the Fenian raids were launched across the Niagara Frontier; Fenians also assembled in Malone.

Although now largely discredited, the report of the 1905–1907 Mills Commission, charged with investigating the origins of baseball, named Cooperstown as the place where baseball was invented in the 1830s or 1840s by Abner Doubleday. Cooperstown is the home of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. (Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City.)

In the pre–Civil War era, upstate New York became a major center of radical abolitionist activity and was an important nexus of the Underground Railroad. Resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act was particularly heated in the region, as evidenced by such events as the Jerry Rescue. The American women&#x27;s rights movement was also born in upstate New York at this time. The Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, was held at Seneca Falls in 1848. The Rochester Convention, the second such convention, was held two weeks later in Rochester.

Through the nineteenth century, upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism. A number of sects, such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community, established themselves in upstate New York during that time. This led evangelist Charles Grandison Finney to coin the term the &quot;Burned-Over District&quot; for the region. Because of the comparative isolation of the region, many of the sects were Nonconformist, and because of their non-traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people. The region is considered to be the cradle of Mormonism. The Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and Spiritualists are the only 21st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time; some more mainstream churches, such as the Wesleyan Church and Free Methodist Church (both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline Methodist church), also survive.

In the 19th century, extractive industries changed the landscape. Potash was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming. Logging was rampant in the Adirondacks. Iron was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country. By the 1870s, business leaders, concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal, advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills. The Adirondack Park and Catskill Park were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between 1885 and 1894, when the &quot;forever wild&quot; provision of the New York State Constitution was added.

===20th century===

During the era immediately following World War II, upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy. Major local corporations such as IBM, General Electric, Kodak, Xerox and Carrier had national success, producing cutting-edge products for business, government and consumers, and leadership in corporate culture. The opening of the New York State Thruway in the mid-1950s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets. This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states, or downsized in the face of foreign competition, similar to events in other areas in the American Rust Belt. There have, however, been recent efforts at economic revitalization. In April 2021, GlobalFoundries, a company specializing in the semiconductor industry, moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley, California to its semiconductor chip manufacturing facility in Malta, New York.

Since the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs, the area has generally suffered a net population loss, most heavily in Western New York. By contrast, many Amish and Mennonite families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy. Beginning in 1974, many Mennonite families moved to the Penn Yan area of Yates County from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, seeking cheaper farmland. Amish communities have also been established in St. Lawrence, Montgomery, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties, and are making farming profitable.

Artisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses and developing growing markets for their products, including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market. A Greek-style yogurt, Chobani, is being produced upstate by a recent immigrant, who has expanded his operation nationally.

Additionally, upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates, high educational prospects, and readily affordable daily essentials, earning Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, Schenectady, and Buffalo spots in the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States.

Five of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State (or have sought settlement of pending claims), based on late 18th-century treaties following the American Revolutionary War with the State of New York (which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations) and the United States.

==Geography==
The headwaters of the Delaware, Susquehanna, Mohawk, Hudson, and Allegheny rivers are located in the region. Several regions upstate are characterized by major mountain ranges, large lakes, and extensive forests.

The Allegheny Plateau extends into west and central New York from the south. The Catskill Mountains lie within Lower New York in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City. The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are part of the Appalachian chain. By contrast, Northern New York contains the Adirondack Mountains, which are sometimes mistaken as part of the Appalachians but are in fact a southern extension of the Canadian Shield.

In the more mountainous eastern parts of upstate New York, along the valleys of the Hudson River and the Mohawk River, have been historically important travel corridors and remain so today. Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat, as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake. The only &quot;hills&quot; in Niagara County are the Niagara Escarpment, which formed the Falls.

Upstate New York has a long shared border with the Canadian province of Ontario stretching from Western New York across Northern New York. It is primarily divided by water boundaries along Lake Erie, the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. At the conflux of New York, Québec and Ontario lies the Mohawk Nation of Iroquois. To the east, across the remainder of the North Country region, New York shares a land border with the province of Québec.

Upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population, compared with those downstate, although there are exceptions. The state&#x27;s smallest county in population (Hamilton County) and largest county in area (St. Lawrence County on the state&#x27;s northern border) are both in upstate New York, within the North Country and Thousand Islands regions of northern New York. The counties with the largest in population (Kings County) and smallest in area (New York County) are both parts of New York City.

===Climate===
Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters, particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York. The snowy reputation is especially true for the cities of Buffalo, Rochester, Oswego and Syracuse, and is largely due to lake-effect snow from Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. The villages of Old Forge and Saranac Lake, both in the Adirondacks, often vie on winter nights with places like International Falls, Minnesota, and Fargo, North Dakota, for the coldest spot in the nation.

Many of the features of upstate New York landscapes, such as the Finger Lakes and the drumlins that dot the region, are the result of glaciers during the Ice Age.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the population of New York State was 20,201,249, with 14,045,410 living in the New York metropolitan area, leaving 6,155,839 for the entire rest of the state. This would mean if upstate New York was a state it would the 20th most populated state in the U.S., while the New York metropolitan area would be the 4th most populated state in the U.S. Upstate New York with its larger area has a population density much lower than downstate. By area, upstate is typified by farmland and forest, many large lakes, and two (major) mountain ranges, with metro areas dotting the map. Residents of English colonial ancestry are common, as well as German, Irish, and Italian, with most metropolitan counties having a similar number of residents from each group.

The North Country is heavily French Canadian. Italian Americans are the largest ethnic group in Oneida County and Schenectady County, as well as in some counties in the Hudson Valley that are closest to New York City. Irish Americans represent the largest ethnic group from the Capital District, Syracuse, Binghamton, and the rest of the Hudson Valley, though the regions also have large Italian American populations. Irish population is consistently above 15% in most of upstate New York (reaching over 20% in the upper Hudson Valley), compared to less than 8% in most of New York City.

Buffalo and Utica also contain notably large contingent of residents with Polish and other Slavic ancestries. African Americans, and Americans of African descent, while not as numerous as in New York City, make up at least 25% of the residents in cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.

There is also a significant presence of the indigenous Haudenosaunee or Six Nations in the region, who retain enclaves of tribal land: the Seneca Nation and Tonawanda Seneca Nation in Western New York, the Onondaga nation south of Syracuse and the Oneida nation of Oneida County in Central New York, and in the North Country, the Mohawk Nation caught between Franklin County, Ontario, and Québec. Members of the Six Nations also live across upstate New York outside of tribal lands.

==Economy==

The median household income across New York State was $75,157 in 2021, however most upstate counties fall short of the statewide average. As of January 2023, the minimum wage in New York State, excluding New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County is $14.20 per hour, with a plan to increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour. There are two Fortune 500 companies located in upstate New York: Constellation Brands, in Victor, in Ontario County, and Corning Inc. Depending on the definition of upstate, there are nine or ten foreign trade zones in upstate New York (nine are located in counties almost always considered upstate, and one is located in Orange County). The upstate economy remains behind the economy of the New York Metropolitan Area, and downstate represented 88 percent of the job growth for the entire state. Between 2010 and 2018, job growth in Brooklyn alone exceeded that of upstate New York.

Upstate New York boasts a sizeable mining sector. New York State is among the top third of states in the United States by value of minerals produced, much of which is from upstate regions. Central New York is a major salt producing area, contributing to the state&#x27;s position as the third largest producer of salt in the U.S. Additionally, New York State ranks first in the production of garnet, the state gemstone, and is the only state that produces wollastonite. Mining of these two minerals within New York takes place entirely within upstate counties. Logging is also an important sector in the region. In 2019, New York State produced 124 million cubic feet of timber, 50.4% of which was sugar maple wood. Sawmills producing wood in New York are almost all within the upstate region.

Upstate New York also has a substantive outdoor recreation industry. The Adirondack Park, by far the largest in the state, is annually visited by between 7 and 12 million people, a greater number than annually visit the Grand Canyon. In 2020, over 241,000 jobs in New York State were supported by the outdoor recreation industry, and the sector plays an especially important role in rural parts of the state. New York State has the largest number of ski resorts in the United States at 52. The majority of these are located in upstate New York, and by most definitions of the region, it contains more than ski resorts than Michigan, the state with the next highest total.

=== Agriculture ===

A number of agricultural products are grown in upstate New York, including dairy, corn, hay, fruits, cabbage, and potatoes. The region has a significant dairy industry, and New York State is the largest producer of yogurt, cottage cheese, and sour cream and third-largest producer of dairy overall in the United States. Chobani, the largest producer of yogurt in the United States, is located in upstate New York. The region is also a significant producer of wine. New York State produces the second most wine of any state, the majority of wine produced being from upstate regions (85% of which was produced in the area surrounding the Finger Lakes). New York State is also the second-largest producer of apples, snap peas, maple syrup, and cabbage in the United States, with agricultural output of these goods being highest in upstate counties.

=== Manufacturing ===

Upstate New York also has a significant manufacturing sector. A number of semiconductor manufacturers are located in the region, including the headquarters and a manufacturing facility of GlobalFoundries, the world&#x27;s fourth largest semiconductor manufacturer, in Malta, in Saratoga County. Other facilities entering the region include a Micron location in Clay, in Onondaga County, and a Wolfspeed facility in Marcy, in Oneida County. In addition to semiconductor manufacturing, upstate New York has notable glass production. Corning Inc., one of the largest glassmakers in the world and the developer of Gorilla Glass, is located in Corning, New York. In the late nineteenth century, the region was considered one of the centers of glassmaking in the country, earning Corning the name &quot;The Crystal City&quot;. Other manufacturing includes Tesla&#x27;s Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo.

=== Energy ===

Upstate New York has a significant energy sector, and the region accounts for over half of the energy production in the state.&quot;&quot; The majority of upstate electricity produced comes from nuclear and renewable sources. In 2017, these sources accounted for 91% of energy produced in the upstate region, as defined by the New York State Independent Systems Operator. New York State as a whole is the third highest producer of hydroelectric power in the United States, the majority of which is produced in upstate. The third-largest conventional hydroelectric power plant in the United States, Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Plant, is located in the region. Upstate New York also produces all of the state&#x27;s nuclear energy, and all three of New York State&#x27;s Nuclear Power Plants are located upstate after the closure of the Indian Point Energy Center in 2021. Nuclear Power, the second largest in-state mode of electricity generation, is produced at the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant and the Nine Mile Nuclear Power Plant, both in Scriba, and the R.E. Ginna Plant, in Ontario, NY. Other major modes of energy production in the region include wind, and natural gas.

==Culture==
The other regions of New York are culturally and economically distinct from the New York City area and in many ways from each other. By area, most of New York is characterized by agricultural and forested rural communities, and by small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors. The state&#x27;s major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany-Schenectady-Troy, each of whose population exceeds 500,000.

The different regions of New York are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions. Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other Great Lakes states as well as Southern Ontario and is effectively, along with Northwestern Pennsylvania, an eastward extension of Midwestern United States culture. The Capital District, the Hudson Valley, the Mohawk Valley and the Plattsburgh area have ties to New England. The North Country, the extreme northern portion of the state, also has strong cultural, economic, linguistic and familial ties to Quebec and Eastern Ontario. Thus, Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont. Much of New York receives television and radio broadcasts from Canada, and there are often other cross-border ties, both historical and familial. A similar relationship can be seen in northern New England.

Upstate New York from Western New York east to Utica is linguistically part of the Inland North region of American English dialectology, a region which includes Midwestern cities as far west as Chicago and Milwaukee. The Hudson and lower Mohawk Valley regions have more in common dialectologically with western New England and New York City. The boundary between the use of the words &quot;pop&quot; and &quot;soda&quot; to refer to soft drinks falls farther west than the edge of the Inland North, running just to around the city of Rochester. Buffalo and areas west of Rochester use &quot;pop&quot;, like the rest of the Inland North to the west, whereas areas east of Rochester, like Syracuse and Binghamton, use &quot;soda&quot;, like New England and New York City. In Ithaca and Elmira, the border is less clear, with some people having grown up with &quot;pop&quot; and some with &quot;soda&quot;; however, current trends see Ithaca, at least, turning to mostly &quot;soda&quot;.

Foodways indigenous to regions of upstate New York include:
* Buffalo wings and beef on weck sandwich (Buffalo)
* Cornell chicken barbecue (Ithaca)
* Garbage Plate (Rochester)
* white hot dogs, known as a white hot or Coney (Rochester, Central and Western New York)
* salt potatoes (Syracuse)
* spiedies (Binghamton)
* chicken riggies, tomato pies, Utica greens, and halfmoon cookies (Utica)
* Michigan hot dogs, a variety of the Coney Island hot dog (Plattsburgh)
Although legends lay claim that the potato chip was invented in Saratoga Springs, it has achieved such universal popularity that it is no longer identified with the region. Winemaking is a growing industry in the Finger Lakes as well as in Chautauqua County, where Welch&#x27;s operates one of the oldest extant grape juice factories in the United States. In the center of the Finger Lakes region, Ithaca is known for the Bo Burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg on top.

Two of the most important rock festivals of the 20th century were held in upstate New York. In 1969 the Woodstock Festival was held in Bethel, New York, while in 1973 another multiday festival was held at the Watkins Glen International Raceway.

Some literary, documentary and cinematic depictions of upstate present a sense of small town, simple lifestyles, such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, set in a small upstate town (probably based on Seneca Falls) in the 1940s.
==Politics==

Often attributed to the region&#x27;s semi-rural to rural character, there is more conservatism in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area, and the region is the power base of the state&#x27;s Republican Party. Upstate New York does, however, have several Democratic-dominated counties, including Erie County (Buffalo), Monroe County (Rochester), Onondaga County (Syracuse), Tompkins County (Ithaca), and Albany County (Albany).

As a whole, upstate New York is roughly equally divided in federal elections between Democrats and Republicans. In 2004, John Kerry defeated George W. Bush by fewer than 1,500 votes (1,553,246 votes to 1,551,971) in the upstate region.
=== Relationship with New York City ===

New York City is dependent on upstate New York for a variety of services: the latter is the source of the city&#x27;s water supply via the Delaware Aqueduct and the Catskill Aqueduct; much of the city&#x27;s electric power supply comes from state-owned hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls and the St. Lawrence River; and most of the state&#x27;s prisons are upstate; hence the popular term &quot;being sent up the river&quot; (however, the term originally referred to Sing Sing, which is &quot;up the Hudson River&quot; from New York City, but being in Ossining in Westchester County is still in the &quot;downstate&quot; region). Conversely, the operation of state facilities providing these services is an important part of the upstate economy.

<doc id="447991" wikidata="Q794564" url="?curid=447991" title="Biathlon World Cup">
<text>The Biathlon World Cup is a top-level biathlon season-long competition series. It has been held since the winter seasons of 1977–78 for men and 1982–83 for women. The women&#x27;s seasons until 1986–87 season were called the European Cup, although participation was not restricted to Europeans.

==Competition and format==

The World Cup season lasts from November or December to late March, with meetings in a different venue every week excluding some holidays and a couple of weeks before the season&#x27;s major championships (World Championships or Winter Olympics). All in all, the season comprises nine to ten meetings, with events taking place from Wednesday–Thursday through Sunday. Relay competitions are held four to six times per season. Formerly it was counted as World Cup events are World Championships(the last Championship to count towards the World Cup were held in Pokljuka, Slovenia 2021) and Winter Olympics events (the last Olympics to count towards the World Cup were the 2010 Winter Olympics: from the 2014 Winter Olympics competitors are no longer awarded World Cup points for their Olympic performances).

The athlete with the highest overall total score (i.e. total score for all disciplines) of the World Cup season is awarded the Big Crystal Globe trophy. A Small Crystal Globe trophy is awarded for the first place in the season total for each discipline. Hence, it is possible for an athlete to win both the Big Crystal Globe and Small Crystal Globes for the same World Cup season.

The tables given below provide an overview of the highest-ranking biathletes and nations of each WC season. 
For sprint/individual/pursuit/mass start first place gives 90 points, 2nd place – 75 pts, 3rd place – 60 pts, 4th place – 50 pts, 5th place – 45 pts, 6th place – 40 pts, 7th – 36 pts, 8th – 34 points, 9th – 32 points, 10th – 31 points, then linearly decreasing by one point down to the 40th place. In Equal placings (ties) give an equal number of points. The sum of all WC points of the season, less the points from an IBU-predetermined number of events (e.g. 2), gives the biathlete&#x27;s total WC score.

From 1985 to 2000, WC points were awarded so that the first four places gave 30, 26, 24, and 22 points, respectively, and then the 5th to 25th place gave 21, 20, ..., down to 1 point. Before this, points were simply awarded linearly from 25 to 1.

As of February 2024, meetings have primarily been held in Europe and North America; the only other places to have hosted meetings that weren&#x27;t the World Championships or the Winter Olympics, are Nagano, Japan in 1996–97, and Pyeongchang, South Korea in 2007–08 and 2016–17.

====Women&#x27;s overall====
The women&#x27;s World Cup seasons until 1986–87 were actually called the European Cup, although participation was open to biathletes of all nationalities. Until 1987–88, women raced on shorter tracks than they do today. The 1988–89 season was the first in which women raced on tracks of the same length that they do nowadays.
;Notes
*1 Petra Schaaf married XC skier and later German national XC ski team coach Jochen Behle.
*2 Helena Jonsson married fellow biathlete David Ekholm in 2010.
*3 Kaisa Mäkäräinen was the winner at the conclusion of the season with Tora Berger 2nd. However, the results of Olga Zaitseva were later annulled due to doping offences. The recalculation would have given overall world cup win to Berger, but the IBU made the decision based on the principle that clean athletes cannot be punished for the doping offenses of others.
*4 Gabriela Soukalová took the name Koukalová when she married professional badminton player Petr Koukal in 2016. They divorced in 2020.

<doc id="447995" wikidata="Q712734" url="?curid=447995" title="Yasushi Inoue">
<text>was a Japanese writer of novels, short stories, poetry and essays, noted for his historical and autobiographical fiction. His most acclaimed works include &quot;The Bullfight&quot; (&quot;Tōgyū&quot;, 1949), &quot;The Roof Tile of Tempyō&quot; (&quot;Tenpyō no iraka&quot;, 1957) and &quot;Tun-huang&quot; (&quot;Tonkō&quot;, 1959).

==Biography==
Inoue was born into a family of physicians in Asahikawa, Hokkaido in 1907, and later raised in Yugashima, Izu, Shizuoka Prefecture. He was born in Hokkaido but is from Shizuoka Prefecture. In his essay &quot;Hometown Izu&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I was born in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, but in the yearbooks and directories, most of my birthplace is Shizuoka Prefecture. When I write it myself, I write it separately from Asahikawa as my place of birth and Shizuoka Prefecture as my birthplace...&quot;. In My History of Self-Formation, he wrote, &quot;It seems safe to assume that Izu, where I spent my childhood, was my true hometown, and that everything that would form the basis of my person was created here.&quot;

During his high school years, he was an active practitioner of judo. He first studied law and literature at Kyushu University and later changed to philosophy at Kyoto University, where he graduated in 1936 with a degree in aesthetics and a thesis on Paul Valéry. After winning the Chiba Kameo Prize for his early work &quot;Ryūten&quot;, Inoue started working for the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. In 1937, he was drafted into the Sino-Japanese War, but soon returned due to illness and resumed his occupation at the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. His military service in northern China brought forth his interest in Chinese history.

After the end of the Pacific War, Inoue won critical acclaim with his 1949 novellas &quot;The Hunting Gun&quot; (&quot;Ryōjū&quot;) and &quot;The Bullfight&quot;, the latter earning him the Akutagawa Prize. In the following years, he published several novels and short stories in a variety of genres: contemporary love stories, stories addressing social and political aspects of post-war Japan like &quot;Kuroi Ushio&quot;, historical novels set in accurately depicted settings like the 1957 &quot;The Roof Tile of Tempyō&quot; and the 1959 &quot;Tun-huang&quot; (&quot;Tonkō&quot;), and works with an autobiographical background like the 1975 &quot;Chronicle of My Mother&quot; (&quot;Waga haha no ki&quot;), which documented his mother&#x27;s deterioration into senility.

Inoue was elected a member of the Japan Art Academy in 1964 and received the Order of Culture in 1976. He died in Tokyo in 1991 at the age of 83.
He had a deep knowledge of shrines, temples, and Japanese history, and served as a supervisor and editorial committee member at several publishing companies.

<text>The Pittock Mansion is a French Renaissance-style château in the West Hills of Portland, Oregon, United States. It was built in 1914 as a private home for London-born &quot;Oregonian&quot; publisher Henry Pittock and his wife, Georgiana Burton Pittock. It is a 46-room estate built of Tenino sandstone situated on that is now owned by the city&#x27;s Bureau of Parks and Recreation and open for touring.

Modeled after Beaux Arts and French Renaissance architecture, the mansion is situated on an expanse in the West Hills that provides panoramic views of Downtown Portland. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==History==

===Construction and architecture===

Pittock Mansion was constructed in 1909 by London-born publisher and business tycoon Henry Pittock as a private residence for himself and his wife, Georgiana. The house was designed by San Francisco architect Edward T. Foulkes. Construction began in 1909, though the house was not completed until 1914. Upon completion, the home featured such luxuries as a central vacuum system, intercoms, indirect lighting, an elevator, and a walk-in refrigerator. The interiors of the mansion were modeled on an eclectic collection of styles, including Jacobean, (the library) craftsman, (the dining room) Turkish, (the smoking room) and French Renaissance (the music room).

Georgiana Pittock was an avid gardener who was a founding member of the Portland Rose Society, hosted the first Portland Rose Show in 1889, and helped launch the Portland Rose Festival. Pittock Mansion is surrounded by formal gardens that reflect her passion for gardening. The lawn is hedged by heritage roses as a tribute to Georgiana&#x27;s work.

==== Floor directory ====

* The lower level includes the boiler room &amp; laundry room and is now a museum. As of October 2023, it houses a temporary special exhibition on Eliza Barchus.

* The first &amp; second floors were the former living quarters of the Pittock family members, and are now part of the museum exhibits. They have been redecorated to resemble either the Pittocks&#x27; original living spaces, or those of similar 19th-century Oregon families.

* The third &amp; fourth floors were the servants&#x27; former living quarters, and currently house the offices of the Pittock Mansion Society that oversees the museum’s operations. The upper floors are only accessible via a back room staircase and are closed to the public except during “Behind the Scenes” tours for an additional cost.

===Political scandal; death of the Pittocks===

The home was at the center of a political scandal in 1911 when a Portland City Council member, Will H. Daly, brought public attention to Pittock having arranged for a water line to the construction project entirely at city expense, despite it being located a half mile outside of the city limits at the time. The incident contributed to a longstanding feud between Pittock&#x27;s paper and Daly which ultimately led to the end of the councilman&#x27;s political career.

Georgiana died in 1918 at the age of 72, and Henry in 1919 at 84. The Pittock family remained in residence at the mansion until 1958 when Eric Ladd, who had stayed in the mansion for four years, and Peter Gantenbein, a Pittock grandson who had been born in the house, put the estate on the market and were unsuccessful in selling it. Extensive damage caused by the Columbus Day Storm in 1962 caused the owners to consider demolishing the building. The community raised $75,000 in three months in order to help the city purchase the property. Seeing this popular support, and agreeing that the house had tremendous value as a unique historic resource, the City of Portland purchased the estate in 1964 for $225,000.

===Restoration projects===

Fifteen months were spent restoring the building. It opened to the public in 1965 and has been a community landmark ever since. Roughly 80,000 people visit the Pittock Mansion each year. Due to the location of the site above sea level, the mansion is one of the best places for birdwatching in Portland. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

In 2006, the City of Portland estimated that $6–8 million worth of restorations were needed for the mansion.

==Access==

Visitors can drive up to the mansion, located at 3229 NW Pittock Drive. The Wildwood Trail through Forest Park also crosses the mansion&#x27;s parking area, allowing hikers to arrive at Pittock Mansion on foot.

==In popular media==
The mansion made its first known appearance in the 1977 romance film &quot;First Love&quot;, starring Susan Dey and William Katt. The house was the main character&#x27;s family home and had an important scene in this film.

The second appearance was in the 1982 slasher film &quot;Unhinged&quot;. The film has become infamous since its release due to being banned in various countries as a video nasty. The house is used as the main location in the film and is used prominently throughout. The people of the city of Portland are thanked gratefully during the end credits for their participation during the films&#x27;s production.

This location was used in the 1989 movie, &quot;The Haunting of Sarah Hardy&quot; starring Sela Ward and Morgan Fairchild. This mansion was also used prominently in the 1993 film &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; starring Madonna and Willem Dafoe. This location was used as the finishing point for the finale of the 13th season of the 6-time Emmy-winning reality game show, &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The mansion was visited during the premiere of the seventeenth season of the Dutch reality show &quot;Wie is de Mol?&quot; as the site of the season&#x27;s first test and elimination.

The mansion plays a role in Colin Meloy’s Wildwood Chronicles. In the series, Forest Park is imagined as a magical realm, with Pittock Mansion serving as its seat of government.

<doc id="448000" wikidata="Q5226794" url="?curid=448000" title="USS Hawkbill (SSN-666)">
<text>USS &quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SSN-666), a attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hawksbill, a large sea turtle. The name perpetuated the inadvertent misspelling of &quot;hawksbill&quot; in the naming of the first ship of that name, , a submarine launched in 1944. USS &quot;Hawkbill&quot; (SSN-666) was the eighteenth of 39 &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class nuclear-powered submarines that were built.

&quot;Hawkbill&quot; was sometimes called &quot;The Devil Boat&quot; or the &quot;Devilfish&quot; because of her hull number (666), from chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation, in the Bible″s New Testament, which begins &quot;And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea...&quot; and ends &quot;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six;&quot; and the resulting association in Christianity of the number 666 with the Devil and the Antichrist.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Hawkbill&quot; was awarded to the Mare Island Division of San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, on 18 December 1964 and her keel was laid down there on 12 September 1966. She was launched on 12 April 1969, sponsored by Mrs. Bernard F. Roeder, the wife of Vice Admiral Bernard F. Roeder, Commander United States First Fleet, and commissioned on 4 February 1971.

==Service history==
In 1982, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; completed a scheduled overhaul of her reactor core at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, with her crew berthed at Naval Submarine Base Bangor at Bangor, Washington. After sea trials and sound trials and port visits to Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada; Alameda, California; and San Diego, California, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, commanded by Fred Crawford, where she joined Submarine Squadron ONE.

In 1983, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; made a Western Pacific cruise, under the command of George Roletter, with stops at Yokosuka, Japan; Subic Bay, the Philippines; and Hong Kong.

&quot;Hawkbill&quot; made a dependent cruise from Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii to home port in Pearl Harbor. In early 1984, &quot;Hawkbill&quot; deployed to the Arctic, undertaking an 87-day excursion under the polar ice cap which included visits to Chinhae, South Korea; and Guam. &quot;Hawkbill&quot; earned two Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; awards from Submarine Squadron ONE during this period.

&quot;Hawkbill&quot; was decommissioned on 15 March 2000, the last of the &quot;short-hull&quot; &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarines to be decommissioned, and that same day both was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and entered the Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for scrapping. Her scrapping was completed on 1 December 2000.

==Commemoration==

&quot;Hawkbill&quot;″s sail was preserved and is exhibited in the Idaho Science Center in Arco, Idaho.

<text>Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (&gt;18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria, but also may be by fungi, viruses or parasites. It may be located in any part of the body, but most commonly in the lungs, brain, urinary tract, skin or abdominal organs. It can cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (formerly known as multiple organ failure) and death.
Frequently, people with septic shock are cared for in intensive care units. It most commonly affects children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly, as their immune systems cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. The mortality rate from septic shock is approximately 25–50%.

==Causes==
Septic shock is a result of a systemic response to infection or multiple infectious causes. The precipitating infections that may lead to septic shock if severe enough include but are not limited to appendicitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, diverticulitis, pyelonephritis, meningitis, pancreatitis, necrotizing fasciitis, MRSA and mesenteric ischemia.

According to the earlier definitions of sepsis updated in 2001, sepsis is a constellation of symptoms secondary to an infection that manifests as disruptions in heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and white blood cell count. If sepsis worsens to the point of end-organ dysfunction (kidney failure, liver dysfunction, altered mental status, or heart damage), then the condition is called severe sepsis. In septic shock, events within tissue capillaries induce distributive shock in which the recovery of blood pressure is not achieved upon the administration of additional intravenous fluids, and requires a vasoconstrictive agent such as noradrenaline and/or vasopressin.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of septic shock is not entirely understood, but it is known that a key role in the development of severe sepsis is played by an immune and coagulation response to an infection. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses play a role in septic shock. Septic shock involves a widespread inflammatory response that produces a hypermetabolic effect. This is manifested by increased cellular respiration, protein catabolism, and metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

Most cases of septic shock are caused by gram-positive bacteria, followed by endotoxin-producing gram-negative bacteria, although fungal infections are an increasingly prevalent cause of septic shock. Toxins produced by pathogens cause an immune response; in gram-negative bacteria these are endotoxins, which are bacterial membrane lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

===Gram-positive===
In gram-positive bacteria, these are exotoxins or enterotoxins, which may vary depending on the species of bacteria. These are divided into three types. Type I, cell surface-active toxins, disrupt cells without entering, and include superantigens and heat-stable enterotoxins. Type II, membrane-damaging toxins, destroy cell membranes in order to enter and include hemolysins and phospholipases. Type III, intracellular toxins or A/B toxins interfere with internal cell function and include shiga toxin, cholera toxin, and anthrax lethal toxin. (note that &quot;Shigella&quot; and &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; are Gram negative organisms).

===Gram-negative===
In gram-negative sepsis, free LPS attaches to a circulating LPS-binding protein, and the complex then binds to the CD14 receptor on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling via an associated &quot;Toll-like receptor&quot; protein 4 (TLR-4). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the innate immune system to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin. The effects of the cytokines may be amplified by TLR-4 engagement on endothelial cells.

In response to inflammation, a compensatory reaction of production of anti-inflammatory substances such as IL-4, IL-10 antagonists, IL-1 receptor, and cortisol occurs. This is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS).
Both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions are responsible for the course of sepsis and are described as MARS (Mixed Antagonist Response Syndrome). The aim of these processes is to keep inflammation at an appropriate level. CARS often leads to suppression of the immune system, which leaves patients vulnerable to secondary infection. It was once thought that SIRS or CARS could predominate in a septic individual, and it was proposed that CARS follows SIRS in a two-wave process. It is now believed that the systemic inflammatory response and the compensatory anti-inflammatory response occur simultaneously.

At high levels of LPS, the syndrome of septic shock supervenes; the same cytokine and secondary mediators, now at high levels, result in systemic vasodilation (hypotension), diminished myocardial contractility, widespread endothelial injury, activation causing systemic leukocyte adhesion and diffuse alveolar capillary damage in the lung, and activation of the coagulation system culminating in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The hypoperfusion from the combined effects of widespread vasodilation, myocardial pump failure, and DIC causes multiorgan system failure that affects the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system, among other organ systems. Recently, severe damage to liver ultrastructure has been noticed from treatment with cell-free toxins of Salmonella. Unless the underlying infection (and LPS overload) is rapidly brought under control, the patient usually dies.

The ability of TLR4 to respond to a distinct LPS species are clinically important. Pathogenic bacteria may employ LPS with low biological activity to evade proper recognition by the TLR4/MD-2 system, dampening the host immune response and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination. On the other hand, such LPS would not be able to induce septic shock in susceptible patients, rendering septic complications more manageable. Yet, defining and understanding how even the smallest structural differences between the very similar LPS species may affect the activation of the immune response may provide the mechanism for the fine tuning of the latter and new insights to immunomodulatory processes.

==Diagnosis==

According to current guidelines, requirements for diagnosis with sepsis are &quot;the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection&quot;. These manifestations may include:
* Tachypnea (fast rate of breathing), which is defined as more than 20 breaths per minute, or when testing blood gas, a  less than 32 mm Hg, which signifies hyperventilation
* White blood cell count either significantly low (&lt; 4000 cells/mm3), or elevated (&gt; 12000 cells/mm3)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate), which in sepsis is defined as a rate greater than 90 beats per minute
* Altered body temperature: Fever &gt; or hypothermia &lt; 

Documented evidence of infection may include positive blood culture, signs of pneumonia on chest x-ray, or other radiologic or laboratory evidence of infection. Signs of end-organ dysfunction are present in septic shock, including kidney failure, liver dysfunction, changes in mental status, or elevated serum lactate.

Septic shock is diagnosed if there is low blood pressure (BP) that does not respond to treatment. This means that intravenous fluid administration alone is not enough to maintain a patient&#x27;s BP. Diagnosis of septic shock is made when systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) is less than 70 mm Hg, or a systolic BP decrease of 40 mm Hg or more without other causes for low BP.

===Definition===
Septic shock is a subclass of distributive shock, a condition in which abnormal distribution of blood flow in the smallest blood vessels results in inadequate blood supply to the body tissues, resulting in ischemia and organ dysfunction. Septic shock refers specifically to distributive shock due to sepsis as a result of infection.

Septic shock may be defined as sepsis-induced low blood pressure that persists despite treatment with intravenous fluids. Low blood pressure reduces tissue perfusion pressure, causing the tissue hypoxia that is characteristic of shock. Cytokines released in a large scale inflammatory response result in massive vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and low blood pressure. Finally, in an attempt to offset decreased blood pressure, ventricular dilatation and myocardial dysfunction occur.

Septic shock may be regarded as a stage of SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), in which sepsis, severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) represent different stages of a pathophysiological process. If an organism cannot cope with an infection, it may lead to a systemic response - sepsis, which may further progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, organ failure, and eventually, result in death.

==Treatment==
Treatment primarily consists of the following:
# Giving intravenous fluids
# Early antibiotic administration 
# Early goal directed therapy
# Rapid source identification and control
# Support of major organ dysfunction

===Fluids===
Because lowered blood pressure in septic shock contributes to poor perfusion, fluid resuscitation is an initial treatment to increase blood volume. Patients demonstrating sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should be initially resuscitated with at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid within the first three hours. Crystalloids such as normal saline and lactated Ringer&#x27;s solution are recommended as the initial fluid of choice, while the use of colloid solutions such as hydroxyethyl starch have not shown any advantage or decrease in mortality. When large quantities of fluids are given, administering albumin has shown some benefit. However, too high of a rate of fluid infusion can be more risky; the particular type of fluid&#x27;s flow rate must be closely monitored, along with the patient&#x27;s condition and vital signs.

===Antibiotics===
Treatment guidelines call for the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics within the first hour following recognition of septic shock. Prompt antimicrobial therapy is important, as risk of dying increases by approximately 10% for every hour of delay in receiving antibiotics. Time constraints do not allow the culture, identification, and testing for antibiotic sensitivity of the specific microorganism responsible for the infection. Therefore, combination antimicrobial therapy, which covers a wide range of potential causative organisms, is tied to better outcomes. Antibiotics should be continued for 7–10 days in most patients, though treatment duration may be shorter or longer depending on clinical response.

===Vasopressors===
Among the choices for vasopressors, norepinephrine is superior to dopamine in septic shock. Norepinephrine is the preferred vasopressor, while epinephrine may be added to norepinephrine when needed. Low-dose vasopressin also may be used as an addition to norepinephrine, but is not recommended as a first-line treatment. Dopamine may cause rapid heart rate and arrhythmias, and is only recommended in combination with norepinephrine in those with slow heart rate and low risk of arrhythmia. In the initial treatment of low blood pressure in septic shock, the goal of vasopressor treatment is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg. In 2017, the FDA approved angiotensin II injection for intravenous infusion to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock.

===Methylene blue===

Methylene blue has been found to be useful for this condition. Although use of methylene blue has mostly been in adults it has also been shown to work in children. Its mechanism of action is thought to be via the inhibition of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway. This pathway is excessively activated in septic shock. Methylene blue has been found to work in cases resistant to the usual agents. This effect was first reported in the early 1990s.

===Other===

While there is tentative evidence for β-Blocker therapy to help control heart rate, evidence is not significant enough for its routine use. There is tentative evidence that steroids may be useful in improving outcomes.

Tentative evidence exists that Polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column hemoperfusion may be beneficial in treatment of septic shock. Trials are ongoing and it is currently being used in Japan and Western Europe.

Recombinant activated protein C (drotrecogin alpha) in a 2011 Cochrane review was found not to decrease mortality and to increase bleeding, and thus, was not recommended for use. Drotrecogin alfa (Xigris), was withdrawn from the market in October 2011.

==Epidemiology==
Sepsis has a worldwide incidence of more than 20 million cases a year, with mortality due to septic shock reaching up to 50 percent even in industrialized countries.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, septic shock is the thirteenth leading cause of death in the United States and the most frequent cause of death in intensive care units. There has been an increase in the rate of septic shock deaths in recent decades, which is attributed to an increase in invasive medical devices and procedures, increases in immunocompromised patients, and an overall increase in elderly patients.

Tertiary care centers (such as hospice care facilities) have 2-4 times the rate of bacteremia than primary care centers, 75% of which are hospital-acquired infections.

The process of infection by bacteria or fungi may result in systemic signs and symptoms that are variously described. Approximately 70% of septic shock cases were once traceable to gram-negative bacteria that produce endotoxins, however, with the emergence of MRSA and the increased use of arterial and venous catheters, gram-positive bacteria are implicated approximately as commonly as bacilli. In rough order of increasing severity these are, bacteremia or fungemia; sepsis, severe sepsis or sepsis syndrome; septic shock, refractory septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death.

35% of septic shock cases derive from urinary tract infections, 15% from the respiratory tract, 15% from skin catheters (such as IVs), and more than 30% of all cases are idiopathic in origin.

The mortality rate from sepsis, especially if it is not treated rapidly with the needed medications in a hospital, is approximately 40% in adults and 25% in children. It is significantly greater when sepsis is left untreated for more than seven days.

<doc id="448015" wikidata="Q77297" url="?curid=448015" title="Ernst Schröder (mathematician)">
<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Ernst Schröder (25 November 1841 – 16 June 1902) was a German mathematician mainly known for his work on algebraic logic. He is a major figure in the history of mathematical logic, by virtue of summarizing and extending the work of George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, Hugh MacColl, and especially Charles Peirce. He is best known for his monumental &quot;Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik&quot; (&quot;Lectures on the Algebra of Logic&quot;, 1890–1905), in three volumes, which prepared the way for the emergence of mathematical logic as a separate discipline in the twentieth century by systematizing the various systems of formal logic of the day.

==Life==
Schröder learned mathematics at Heidelberg, Königsberg, and Zürich, under Otto Hesse, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Franz Neumann. After teaching school for a few years, he moved to the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in 1874. Two years later, he took up a chair in mathematics at the Karlsruhe Polytechnische Schule, where he spent the remainder of his life. He never married.

== Work ==
Schröder&#x27;s early work on formal algebra and logic was written in ignorance of the British logicians George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. Instead, his sources were texts by Ohm, Hankel, Hermann Grassmann, and Robert Grassmann (Peckhaus 1997: 233–296). In 1873, Schröder learned of Boole&#x27;s and De Morgan&#x27;s work on logic. To their work he subsequently added several important concepts due to Charles Sanders Peirce, including subsumption and quantification.

Schröder also made original contributions to algebra, set theory, lattice theory, ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Along with Georg Cantor, he codiscovered the Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem, although Schröder&#x27;s proof (1898) is flawed. Felix Bernstein (1878–1956) subsequently corrected the proof as part of his Ph.D. dissertation.

Schröder (1877) was a concise exposition of Boole&#x27;s ideas on algebra and logic, which did much to introduce Boole&#x27;s work to continental readers. The influence of the Grassmanns, especially Robert&#x27;s little-known &quot;Formenlehre&quot;, is clear. Unlike Boole, Schröder fully appreciated duality. John Venn and Christine Ladd-Franklin both warmly cited this short book of Schröder&#x27;s, and Charles Sanders Peirce used it as a text while teaching at Johns Hopkins University.

Schröder&#x27;s masterwork, his &quot;Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik&quot;, was published in three volumes between 1890 and 1905, at the author&#x27;s expense. Vol. 2 is in two parts, the second published posthumously, edited by Eugen Müller. The &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; was a comprehensive and scholarly survey of algebraic logic up to the end of the 19th century, one that had a considerable influence on the emergence of mathematical logic in the 20th century. He developed Boole&#x27;s algebra into a calculus of relations, based on composition of relations as a multiplication. The Schröder rules relate alternative interpretations of a product of relations.

The &quot;Vorlesungen&quot; is a prolix affair, only a small part of which has been translated into English. That part, along with an extended discussion of the entire &quot;Vorlesungen&quot;, is in Brady (2000). Also see Grattan-Guinness (2000: 159–76).

Schröder said his aim was:

==Influence==

Schröder&#x27;s influence on the early development of the predicate calculus, mainly by popularising C. S. Peirce&#x27;s work on quantification, is at least as great as that of Frege or Peano. For an example of the influence of Schröder&#x27;s work on English-speaking logicians of the early 20th century, see Clarence Irving Lewis (1918). The relational concepts that pervade &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; are very much owed to the &quot;Vorlesungen&quot;, cited in &quot;Principia&quot;&#x27;s Preface and in Bertrand Russell&#x27;s Principles of Mathematics.

Frege (1960) dismissed Schröder&#x27;s work, and admiration for Frege&#x27;s pioneering role has dominated subsequent historical discussion. Contrasting Frege with Schröder and C. S. Peirce, however, Hilary Putnam (1982) writes:

<text>The Territory of Washington was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1853, until November 11, 1889, when the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Washington. It was created from the portion of the Oregon Territory north of the lower Columbia River and north of the 46th parallel east of the Columbia. At its largest extent, it also included the entirety of modern Idaho and parts of Montana and Wyoming, before attaining its final boundaries in 1863.

==History==

Agitation in favor of self-government developed in the regions of the Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River in 1851–1852. A group of prominent settlers from the Cowlitz and Puget Sound regions met on November 25, 1852, at the &quot;Monticello Convention&quot; in present-day Longview, to draft a petition to the United States Congress calling for a separate territory north of the Columbia River. After gaining approval from the Oregon territorial government, the proposal was sent to the federal government.
The bill to establish the territory, H.R. 348, was reported in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representative Charles E. Stuart on January 25, 1853. Representative Richard H. Stanton argued that the proposed name—the Territory of Columbia—might be confused for the country&#x27;s capital&#x27;s Territory of Columbia (now District of Columbia), and suggested a name honoring George Washington instead. The bill was thus amended with the name &quot;Washington&quot;, though not without some debate, and passed in the House on February 10, passed in the Senate on March 2, and signed by President Millard Fillmore on the same day. The argument against naming the territory Washington came from Representative Alexander Evans of Maryland, who countered that there were no states named Washington, but multiple counties, cities, and towns were named such and so could be the source of confusion itself. Evans felt that the proposed new territory&#x27;s name should reflect local native terminology. He stated it would be more appropriate to give the territory &quot;some beautiful Indian name.&quot; The decision was contrary to the wishes of residents, and local papers reported mixed feeling from citizens, though the general reception of the renaming was positive.

Isaac Stevens, who was appointed the territory&#x27;s first governor, declared Olympia to be the territorial capital. Stevens was also integral in the drafting and negotiation of treaties with native bands in the Washington Territory. A territorial legislature was elected and first met in February 1854, and the territorial supreme court issued its first decision later in the year. Columbia Lancaster was elected as the first delegate to U.S. Congress.

The original boundaries of the territory included all of the present day State of Washington, as well as northern Idaho and Montana west of the continental divide. On the admission of the State of Oregon to the union in 1859, the eastern portions of the Oregon Territory, including southern Idaho, portions of Wyoming west of the continental divide, and a small portion of present-day Ravalli County, Montana were annexed to the Washington Territory. The southeastern tip of the territory (in present-day Wyoming) was sent to Nebraska Territory on March 2, 1861.

In 1863, the area of Washington Territory east of the Snake River and the 117th meridian was reorganized as part of the newly created Idaho Territory, leaving the territory within the current boundaries of Washington State, which was admitted to the Union on November 11, 1889, as the 42nd U.S. state.

Prior to statehood, multiple settlements in the territory were contending for the title of capital. Among the top contenders for the title, besides Olympia, were Steilacoom, Vancouver, Port Townsend, and Ellensburg, which was devastated in a major fire shortly before statehood. Even after Olympia had been chosen as the capital, contention truly ended only after the completion of the capitol.

<text>Hockey Canada (which merged with the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association in 1994) is the national governing body of ice hockey and ice sledge hockey in Canada. It is a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation and controls the majority of organized ice hockey in Canada. There are some notable exceptions, such as the Canadian Hockey League, U Sports (formerly known as Canadian Interuniversity Sport), and Canada&#x27;s professional hockey clubs; the former two are partnered with Hockey Canada but are not member organizations. Hockey Canada is based in Calgary, with a secondary office in Ottawa and regional centres in Toronto, Winnipeg and Montreal.

==History==
The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association was founded on December 4, 1914, when 21 delegates from across Canada met at the Chateau Laurier in Ottawa. The organization was made to oversee the amateur level of the sport at the national level. The Allan Cup, originally donated in 1908 by Sir H. Montagu Allan, was selected as the championship of amateur hockey in Canada. William Northey, the trustee of the Allan Cup, was named the first ever chairman, while Dr. W. F. Taylor was named the inaugural president. The Memorial Cup was the junior amateur championship of Canada.

In 1920, after the Winnipeg Falcons won the Allan Cup over the University of Toronto, they represented Canada at the 1920 Summer Olympic Games. Canada would go 3-0-0 to win the sport&#x27;s first ever Olympic gold medal.

The Ottawa and District Amateur Hockey Association joined in 1920, followed by the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association in 1928.

On June 30, 1947, the CAHA, the National Hockey League and the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States made an agreement that no player under the age of 18 could be signed as a professional player without the permission of their amateur club. That same year, the International Ice Hockey Federation changed the rules on amateur status. The rule change means the 1948 Allan Cup champion Royal Montreal Hockey Club were not eligible for the 1948 Winter Olympics, so the CAHA sent the RCAF Flyers instead and were victorious.

At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the Edmonton Mercuries won their nation&#x27;s last Olympic gold until 2002.

In 1961, the Trail Smoke Eaters won Canada&#x27;s 19th and last world championship for 33 years at the 1961 World Ice Hockey Championships. In 1964, Father David Bauer formed Canada&#x27;s national team in response to the success of the programs set up by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. Three years later, the CAHA opened its first ever national office, located in Winnipeg.

The Newfoundland Amateur Hockey Association, led by association president Don Johnson, entered the CAHA in 1966. Johnson became CAHA president in 1975. The New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association left the Maritime AHA brand in 1968 and entered the CAHA as a member.

===1968 to 1994===
In 1968, the Hockey Canada organization was founded to oversee Canada&#x27;s national teams.

In 1970, the CAHA&#x27;s 13 Junior A league were divided into two tiers. Tier I, the Western Canada Junior Hockey League, the Ontario Hockey Association, and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, were eligible to compete for the Memorial Cup. The ten leagues of Tier II, would compete for the Manitoba Centennial Cup, donated by the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (See: Canadian Junior Hockey League).

Also in 1970, Canada pulled out of IIHF competition and would not return to the fold until 1977 in protest of the IIHF&#x27;s soft stance on Soviet and Czechoslovakian teams using &quot;professional amateurs&quot; in international competition but not allowing professional players to compete for Canada.

In 1972, Canada and the Soviet Union competed in the 1972 Summit Series. Canada&#x27;s team was composed of NHL stars, while the Soviet players were from the Red Army. The NHLers won the series 4-3-1. Two years later, the World Hockey Association represented Canada and lost the series 1-4-3. In 1976, the Canada Cup was formed as a best-on-best championship.

In 1974, the Nova Scotia Amateur Hockey Association and Prince Edward Island Amateur Hockey Association are formed out of the dissolution of the Maritime AHA.

The World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was held for the first time. Canada, who sent Memorial Cup champion teams in early years, eventually set up a national team and won their first gold medal at the 1982 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

In 1975, the QMJHL, WCJHL, and the renamed Ontario Major Junior Hockey League form an umbrella organization known as the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League. With the creation of the CMJHL, the three league began initiating compensation talks with the NHL and WHA without CAHA input. In 1980, the CMJHL separated from the CAHA, only staying loosely affiliated with the national body. With the separation of the CMJHL, Tier II was promoted to simply Junior A, although the Tier II title still persists in hockey vernacular. To this day, the CMJHL (now Canadian Hockey League) releases its players to Hockey Canada to play at the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

In 1983, the first Abby Hoffman Cup was awarded to the Burlington Ladies as the Canadian national senior champions of women&#x27;s hockey.

In 1990, the forerunner to the Canadian Junior Hockey League was created as an umbrella organization, within the CAHA, to oversee Junior A hockey.

The Canada women&#x27;s national ice hockey team was formed in 1987 and won the first (unofficial) world championship that year. The 1990 IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship was the first official event, also won by Canada.

In 1994, Team Canada ended a 33-year drought by winning the 1994 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships.

===1994 to 2022===
In 1994, Hockey Canada and the CAHA merged into one organization. Also, the International Olympic Committee elected to allow professional players to compete at the Olympics and created a women&#x27;s event at the games. That same year, Hockey North became the 13th branch of Hockey Canada.

The Canadian men and women won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The Canadian men win their first gold medal in fifty years, while the women win their first in two tries.

In 2004, the Canada men&#x27;s national ice sledge hockey team was welcomed into the Hockey Canada fold, and Mark Aubry was named the Chief Medical Officer of Hockey Canada.

In 2006, the Canadian women won gold at the 2006 Olympics and the sledge team conquered gold at the 2006 Winter Paralympics.

The Clarkson Cup, donated by the Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson, was created in 2006, and was first awarded in 2009 to the Canadian national senior champions of women&#x27;s hockey. The Clarkson Cup replaced the Abby Hoffman Cup.

Team Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams won gold in both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, hosted by Vancouver and Sochi respectively.

Tom Renney retired as chief executive officer of Hockey Canada on July 1, 2022, and was succeeded by Scott Smith who also served as president.

====Sexual assault incidents====

In June 2022, a scandal emerged over Hockey Canada&#x27;s handling of sexual assault allegations surrounding the organization, stemming from its May 2022 settlement of alleged abuses by members of Canada&#x27;s junior team in 2018. Minister for Sport Pascale St-Onge suspended federal funding of Hockey Canada via Sport Canada, and called for an audit over whether taxpayer money was used to pay out these settlements. Later that month, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage opened an inquiry into the settlement. which revealed a history of sexual misconduct cases raised against Hockey Canada, and that the organization had spent C$7.6 million out of a &quot;National Equity Fund&quot;—funded with player registration fees—to help pay out settlements in 21 sexual misconduct cases since 1989.

Amid calls for leadership changes at Hockey Canada, Smith and the entire board of directors resigned on October 11, 2022.

====Exceptional player status====
Hockey Canada determines if an underage player is eligible for &quot;exceptional status&quot;. Exceptional player status allows skilled, underage hockey players to enter the major junior circuit early. As of 2024, nine players have been granted exceptional status: John Tavares, Aaron Ekblad, Sean Day, Connor McDavid, Joseph Veleno, Shane Wright, Connor Bedard, Michael Misa and Landon DuPont. As of 2023, seven have gone number one in their respective major junior drafts while four players have been selected first overall in their respective NHL drafts.

===2023 to present===

Katherine Henderson was appointed as chief executive officer and president in 2023.

In 2023, the British Columbia Hockey League decided not to renew its agreement with Hockey Canada and became an independent league. The league cited improved recruitment opportunities for 16 and 17 year old players in Canada as well as anticipated improved interest from Americans and players outside of North America as important reasons for the decision. In April 2024, the Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League followed suit and announced it would also withdraw and become an independent farm league for the BCHL beginning in the 2024-25 season.

In the 2024–25 season, Hockey Canada and its four western affiliates – BC Hockey, Hockey Alberta, Hockey Saskatchewan and Hockey Manitoba – will pilot the Western Canadian Development Model (WCDM). Under the WCDM, junior leagues will adopt most of the Western Hockey League rulebook, excluding some sections, and restrictions on 15-year-old affiliate players in the Western Hockey League will be loosened. Players that will be 18-years of age or older in the calendar year will be allowed to choose whether to use full-face protection or half-face protection, whilst younger players will be required to use full-face protection.

<text>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati (; ; ; 6 February 1874 – 1 January 1937), born Bimala Prasad Datt (, ), was an Indian Gaudīya Vaisnava Hindu guru (spiritual master), ācārya (philosophy instructor), and revivalist in early twentieth-century India. To his followers, he was known as &quot;Srila Prabhupāda&quot; (an honorific also later extended to his disciple A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada).

Bimala Prasad was born in 1874 in Puri (then Bengal Presidency, now Orissa) in a Bengali Hindu Kayastha family as a son of Kedarnath Datta Bhaktivinoda Thakur, a recognised Bengali Gaudiya Vaishnava philosopher and teacher. Bimala Prasad received both Western and traditional Indian education and gradually established himself as a leading intellectual among the &quot;bhadralok &quot;(Western-educated and often Hindu Bengali residents of colonial Calcutta), earning the title Siddhānta Sarasvatī (&quot;the pinnacle of wisdom&quot;). In 1900, Bimala Prasad took initiation into Gaudiya Vaishnavism from the Vaishnava ascetic Gaurakishora Dāsa Bābājī.

In 1918, following the 1914 death of his father and the 1915 death of his guru Gaurakishora Dāsa Bābājī, Bimala Prasad accepted the Hindu formal order of asceticism (&quot;sannyasa&quot;) from a photograph of his guru and took the name Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami. Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati inaugurated in Calcutta the first center of his institution, later known as the Gaudiya Math. It soon developed into a dynamic missionary and educational institution with sixty-four branches across India and three centres abroad (in Burma, Germany, and England). The Math propagated the teachings of Gaudiya Vaishnavism by means of daily, weekly, and monthly periodicals, books of the Vaishnava canon, and public programs as well as through such innovations as &quot;theistic exhibitions&quot; with dioramas. Bhaktisiddhanta is known for his intense and outspoken oratory and writing style as the &quot;acharya-keshari&quot; (&quot;lion guru&quot;). Bhaktisiddhanta opposed the nondualistic interpretation of Hinduism, or &quot;advaita&quot;, that had emerged as the prevalent strand of Hindu thought in India, seeking to establish traditional personalist &quot;krishna-bhakti&quot; as its fulfillment and higher synthesis. At the same time, through lecturing and writing, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Prabhupāda targeted both the casteism of smarta brahmins, hereditary priests and sensualised practices of numerous Gaudiya Vaishnavism spin-offs, branding them as &quot;apasampradayas&quot; – deviations from the original Gaudiya Vaishnavism taught in the 16th century by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his close successors. 

The mission initiated by Bhaktivinoda Thakur and developed by Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupāda emerged as &quot;the most powerful reformist movement&quot; of Vaishnavism in Bengal of the 19th and early 20th century. However, after the demise of Srila Prabhupāda in 1937, the Gaudiya Math became tangled by internal dissent, and the united mission in India was effectively fragmented. Over decades, the movement regained its momentum. In 1966 its offshoot, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), was founded by Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s disciple A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in New York City and spearheaded the spread of Gaudiya Vaisnava teachings and practice globally. Prabhupāda&#x27;s branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism presently counts over 500,000 adherents worldwide, with its public profile far exceeding the size of its constituency.

==Early period (1874–1900): Student==
===Birth and childhood===

Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupāda was born Bimala Prasad at on 6 February 1874 in Puri – a town in the Indian state of Orissa famous for its ancient temple of Jagannath. The place of his birth was a house his parents rented from a Calcutta businessman, Ramacandra Arhya, situated a few hundred meters away from the Jagannath temple on Puri&#x27;s Grand Road, the traditional venue for the Hindu Ratha-yatra festival.

Bimala Prasad was the seventh of fourteen children of his father Kedarnath Datta and mother Bhagavati Devi, devout Vaishnavas of the Bengali kayastha community. At that time Kedarnath Datta worked as a deputy magistrate and deputy collector, and spent most of his off-hours studying Sanskrit and the theistic &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; text (also known as the &quot;Shrimad Bhagavatam&quot;) under the guidance of local &quot;pandits&quot;. He researched, translated, and published Gaudiya Vaishnava literature as well as wrote his own works on Vaishnava theology and practice in Bengali, Sanskrit, and English.

The birth of Bimala Prasad concurred with the rising influence of the &quot;bhadralok&quot; community, literally &quot;gentle or respectable people&quot;, a privileged class of Bengalis, largely Hindus, who served the British administration in occupations requiring Western education, and proficiency in English and other languages. Exposed to and influenced by the Western values of the British, including their condescending attitude towards cultural and religious traditions of India, the &quot;bhadralok &quot;themselves started questioning and reassessing the tenets of their own religion and customs. Their attempts to rationalise and modernise Hinduism to reconcile it with the Western outlook eventually gave rise to a historical period called the Bengali Renaissance, championed by such prominent reformists as Rammohan Roy and Swami Vivekananda. This trend gradually led to a widespread perception, both in India and in the West, of modern Hinduism as being equivalent to Advaita Vedanta, a conception of the divine as devoid of form and individuality that was hailed by its proponents as the &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; and &quot;the mother of religions&quot;. As a result, the other schools of Hinduism, including &quot;bhakti, &quot;were gradually relegated in the minds of the Bengali Hindu middle-class to obscurity, and were often seen as a &quot;reactionary and fossilized jumble of empty rituals and idolatrous practices.&quot;

At the same time, nationalistic ferments in Calcutta, the then capital of the British Empire in South Asia, social instability in Bengal, coupled with British influence through Christian and Victorian sensibilities, contributed to a portrayal of the hitherto popular worship of Radha-Krishna and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as irrelevant and deeply immoral. The growing public disapproval of Gaudiya Vaishnavism was aggravated by the prevalently lower social status of local Gaudiya Vaishnavas, as well as by erotic practices of &quot;tantrics&quot; such as the &quot;sahajiyas, &quot;who claimed close affiliation with the mainstream Gaudiya school. These negative perceptions led to the slow decline of Vaishnava culture and pilgrimage sites in Bengal such as Nabadwip, the birthplace of Chaitanya.

To avert the decay of Vaishnavism in Bengal and the spread of nondualism among the &quot;bhadralok&quot;, Vaishnava intellectuals of the time formed a new religious current, led by Sisir Kumar Ghosh (1840–1911) and his brothers. In 1868 the Ghosh brothers launched the pro-Vaishnava &quot;Amrita Bazar Patrika&quot;, which pioneered as one of the most popular patriotic English-medium newspapers in India and &quot;kept Vaishnavism alive among the middle class&quot;.

The father of Bimala Prasad, Kedarnath Datta, was also a prominent member of this circle among Gaudiya Vaishnava intelligentsia and played a significant role in their attempts to revive Vaishnavism. (His literary and spiritual achievements later earned him the honorific title Bhaktivinoda).

After being posted in 1869 to Puri as a deputy magistrate, Kedarnatha Datta felt he needed assistance in his attempts to promote the cause Gaudiya Vaisnavism in India and abroad. A hagiographic account has it that one night the Deity of Jagannath personally spoke to Kedarnath in a dream: &quot;I didn&#x27;t bring you to Puri to execute legal matters, but to establish Vaishnava &quot;siddhanta.&quot;&quot; Kedarnath replied, &quot;Your teachings have been significantly [sic] depreciated, and I lack the power to restore them. Much of my life has passed and I am otherwise engaged, so please send somebody from Your personal staff so that I can start this movement&quot;. Jagannath then requested Kedarnath to pray for an assistant to the image of the Goddess Bimala Devi worshiped in the Jagannath temple. When his wife gave birth to a new child, Kedarnath linked the event to the divinatory dream and named his son Bimala Prasad (&#x27;&quot;the mercy of Bimala Devi&quot;). The same account mentions that at his birth, the child&#x27;s umbilical cord was looped around his body like a sacred brahmana thread (&quot;upavita&quot;) that left a permanent mark on the skin, as if foretelling his future role as religious leader.

=== Education ===
Young Bimala Prasad, often affectionately called Bimala, Bimu or Binu, started his formal education at an English school at [Srirampur[Ranaghat]]. In 1881, he was transferred to the Oriental Seminary of Calcutta, and in 1883, after Kedarnath was posted as senior deputy magistrate in Serampore of Hooghly, Bimala was enrolled in the local school there. At the age of nine, he memorised the seven hundred verses of the&quot; Bhagavad Gita&quot; in Sanskrit. From his early childhood, Bimala demonstrated a sense of strict moral behaviour, a sharp intelligence, and an eidetic memory. He gained a reputation for remembering passages from a book on a single reading and soon learned enough to compose his own poetry in Sanskrit. His biographers stated that even up to his last days Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati could verbatim recall passages from books that he had read in his childhood, earning the epithet &quot;living encyclopedia&quot;.

In the early 1880s, Kedarnath Datta, out of desire to foster the child&#x27;s budding interest in spirituality, initiated him into &quot;harinama-japa&quot;, a traditional Gaudiya Vaishnava practice of meditation based on the soft recitation of the Hare Krishna mantra on tulasi beads.

In 1885, Kedarnath Datta established the Vishva Vaishnava Raj Sabha (Royal World Vaiṣṇava Association); the association, composed of leading Bengali Vaishnavas, stimulated Bimala&#x27;s intellectual and spiritual growth and inspired him to undertake an in-depth study of Vaishnava texts, both classical and contemporary. Bimala&#x27;s interest in the Vaishnava philosophy was further fuelled by the Vaishnava Depository, a library and a printing press established by Kedarnath (by that time respectfully addressed as Bhaktivinoda Thakur) at his own house for systematically presenting Gaudiya Vaishnavism. In 1886, Bhaktivinoda began publishing a monthly magazine in Bengali, &quot;Sajjana-toshani&quot; (&quot;The source of pleasure for devotees&quot;), where he published his own writings of the history and philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, along with book reviews, poetry, and novels. Twelve-year-old Bimala assisted his father as a proofreader, thus closely acquainting himself with the art of printing and publishing as well as with the intellectual discourses of the &quot;bhadralok.&quot;

In 1887 Bimala Prasad joined the Calcutta Metropolitan Institution (from 1917 – Vidyasagar College), which provided substantial modern education to the &quot;bhadralok&quot; youth; there, while studying the compulsory subjects, he pursued extracurricular studies of Sanskrit, mathematics, and &quot;jyotisha &quot;(traditional Indian astronomy). His proficiency in the latter was soon recognised by his tutors with an honorary title &quot;Siddhanta Sarasvati&quot;, which he adopted as his pen name from then on. Sarasvati then entered Sanskrit College, one of Calcutta&#x27;s finest schools for classical Hindu learning, where he added Indian philosophy and ancient history to his study list.

=== Teaching ===
In 1895, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Prabhupāda decided to discontinue his studies at Sanskrit College due to a dispute about the astronomical calculations of the principal, Mahesh Chandra Nyayratna. A good friend of his father, the King of Tripura Bir Chandra Manikya, offered Sarasvati a position as secretary and historian at the royal court, which afforded him enough financial independence for pursuing his studies independently. Taking advantage of his access to the royal library, he pored over both Indian and Western works of history, philosophy, and religion and started his own astronomy school in Calcutta. After the king died in 1896, his heir Radha Kishore Manikya requested Sarasvati to tutor the princes at the palace and offered him full pension, which Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Prabhupada accepted till 1908.

Although equipped with an excellent modern and traditional education, and with an enviable social status among the intellectual and political elite of Calcutta and Tripura, along with the resources that it had brought, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Prabhupada nonetheless began to question his choices at a stage that many would regard as the epitome of success. His soul-searching led him to quit the comforts of his &quot;bhadralok&quot; lifestyle and search for an ascetic spiritual teacher. On Bhaktivinoda&#x27;s direction, he approached Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji, a Gaudiya Vaishnava who regularly visited Bhaktivinoda&#x27;s house and was renowned for his asceticism and bhakti. In January 1901, according to his own testimony, Siddhanta Sarasvati accepted the Babaji as his &quot;guru.&quot; According to the Gaudiya mutt follower&#x27;s, along with his initiation (&quot;diksha&quot;) he received a new name, Shri Varshabhanavi-devi-dayita Dasa (, &quot;servant of Krishna, the beloved of Radha&quot;), which he adopted until new titles were conferred upon him.

== Middle period (1901–1918): Ascetic ==

=== Religious practice ===

The initiation from Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji, an illiterate yet highly respected personality, had a transformational effect on Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Prabhupada. Later, reflecting on his first meeting with the guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati recalled:

After receiving the bhagarati initiation, Siddhanta Sarasvati went on a pilgrimage of India&#x27;s holy places. He first stayed for a year in Jagannath Puri, and in 1904 travelled to South India, where he explored various branches of Hinduism, in particular the ancient and vibrant Vaishnava Shri and Madhva &quot;sampradayas&quot;&quot;,&quot; collecting materials for a new Vaishnava encyclopaedia. He finally settled in Mayapur, north of Calcutta, where Bhaktivinoda had acquired a plot of land at the place at which, according to Bhaktivinoda&#x27;s research, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born in 1486. At that time, Bhaktivinoda added the prefix &quot;bhakti&quot; (meaning &quot;devotion&quot;) to Siddhanta Sarasvati, acknowledging his proficiency in Vaishnava studies.
Starting from 1905, Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Prabhupāda began to deliver public discourses on the philosophy and practice of Chaitanya Vaishnavism, gathering a following of educated young Bengalis, some of whom became his students. While assisting Bhaktivinoda in his developing project in Mayapur, Bhaktisiddhanta vowed to recite one billion names of Radha (Hara) and Krishna – which took nearly ten years to complete – thus committing himself to the lifelong practice of meditation on the&quot; Hare Krishna mantra&quot; taught to him first by his father and then by his guru. The aural meditation on Krishna&#x27;s names done either individually (&quot;japa&quot;) or collectively (&quot;kirtana&quot;) became a pivotal theme in Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s teachings and personal practice.

=== Brahmanas vs. Vaishnavas ===
While not feeling in any way &quot;inferior&quot; due to his birth in a comparatively lower kayastha family, Bhaktisiddhanta Prabhupāda soon faced opposition from the orthodox brahmanas of Nabadwip, who maintained that birth in a brahminical family was a necessary criterion for worshiping the images and deities of Vishnu. Refusing to submit to caste hierarchies and hereditary rights, instead Bhaktisiddhanta tried to align religious competence with personal character and religious merits.

A defining moment of this brewing confrontation came on 8 September 1911, when Bhaktisiddhanta Prabhupāda was invited to a conference in Balighai, Midnapore, that gathered Vaishnavas from Bengal and beyond to debate the eligibility of the brahmanas and that of the Vaishnavas. The debate was centred on two issues: whether those born as non-&quot;brahmanas&quot; but initiated into Vaishnavism were eligible to worship a &quot;shalagram shila&quot; (a sacred stone representing Vishnu, Krishna or other deities), and whether they could give initiation in the sacred mantras of the Vaisnava tradition.

Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Prabhupāda accepted the invitation and presented a paper, &quot;Brāhmaṇa o Vaiṣṇava&quot; (Brahmana and Vaishnava), later published in an extended form. This was the first detailed exposition of Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s thought in this matter that would lay the foundation of his forthcoming Gaudiya Math mission. After praising the important position that &quot;brahmanas&quot; hold as repositories of spiritual and ritual knowledge, Prabhupāda used textual references to assert that Vaishnavas should be respected even more due to their devotional practice, thus contradicting the claims of the hereditary &quot;brahmanas&quot; present at the conference. He described the &quot;varnashrama&quot; and its concomitant rituals of purity (&quot;samskara&quot;) as beneficial for the individual, but also as currently plagued by misguided practices.

Although the debate at Balighai apparently turned into Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s triumph, it sowed the seed of a bitter rivalry between the &quot;brahmana&quot; community of Nabadwip and the Gaudiya Math that lasted throughout Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s life and even threatened it on a few occasions.

=== Publishing ===

As per popular stories, Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji on several occasions dissuaded Bhaktisiddhanta from visiting Calcutta, referring to the large imperial city as &quot;the universe of Kali&quot; () – a standard understanding among Vaishnava ascetics. However, in 1913 Bhaktisiddhanta established a printing press in Calcutta, and called it &quot;bhagavat-yantra&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s machine&quot;) and began to publish medieval Vaishnava texts in Bengali, such as the &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; by Krishnadasa Kaviraja, supplemented with his own commentary. This marked Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s commitment to leave no modern facilities unused in the propagation of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, and his new focus on printing and distributing religious literature. Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s new determination stemmed from an instruction that he received in 1910 from Bhaktivinoda in a personal letter:

After the death of his father Bhaktivinoda on 23 June 1914, Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupad relocated his Calcutta press to Mayapur and then to nearby Krishnanagar in the Nadia district. From there he continued publishing Bhaktivinoda&#x27;s &quot;Sajjana-toshani&quot;, and completed the publication of &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot;. Soon after, his guru Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji also died. Without these two key sources of inspiration, and with the majority of Bhaktivinoda&#x27;s followers being married and thus unable to pursue a strong missionary commitment, Bhaktisiddhanta found himself nearly alone with a mission that seemed far beyond his means. When a disciple suggested that Bhaktisiddhanta relocate to Calcutta to establish a center there, he was inspired by the suggestion and began preparing for its implementation.

== Later period (1918–1937): Missionary ==

The disappearance of Bhaktivinoda and Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji left Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati with the burden of responsibility for their mission of reviving and safeguarding the Chaitanya tradition as they envisioned it. An uncompromising and even belligerent advocate of his spiritual predecessors&#x27; teachings, Bhaktisiddhanta saw battles to be fought on many fronts: the &quot;smarta-brahmanas&quot; with their claims of exclusive hereditary eligibility as priests and gurus; the dismissing the form and personhood of God as material and external to the essence of the divine; professional &quot;Bhagavatam&quot; reciters exploiting the text sacred to Gaudiya Vaishnavas as a family business; the pseudo-Vaishnava &quot;sahajiyas&quot; and other Gaudiya spin-offs with their sensualised, profaned imitations of &quot;bhakti&quot;. Relentless and uncompromising oratory and written critique of what, in Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s words, was a contemporary religious &quot;society of cheaters and the cheated&quot; became the underlying tone of his missionary efforts, not only earning him the title &quot;acharya-keshari&quot; (&quot;lion guru&quot;) but also awakening suspicion, fear, and at times hate among his opponents.

=== Sannyasa and Gaudiya Math ===

Deliberating on how to best conduct the mission in the future, he felt that the example of the South Indian orders of &quot;sannyasa&quot; (monasticism), the most prestigious spiritual order in Hinduism, would be needed in the Chaitanya tradition as well to increase its respectability and to openly institutionalise asceticism as compatible with &quot;bhakti&quot;. On 27 March 1918, before leaving for Calcutta, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati resolved to become the first &quot;sannyasi&quot; of Gaudiya Vaishnavism post Chaitanya Mahaprabhu period, starting a new Gaudiya Vaishnava monastic order. Since there was no other Gaudiya Vaishnava &quot;sannyasi&quot; to initiate him into the renounced order, he controversially sat down before a picture of Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji and conferred the sannyasa upon himself. From that day on, he adopted both the dress and the life of a Vaishnava renunciant, with the name Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami.

In December 1918 Bhaktisiddhanta inaugurated his first center, called &quot;Calcutta Bhaktivinoda Asana,&quot; at 1, Ultadinghee Junction Road in North Calcutta, renamed in 1920 as &quot;Shri Gaudiya Math&quot;. &quot;Amrita Bazar Patrika&quot;&#x27;s coverage of the opening states that &quot;[h]ere ardent seekers after truth are received and listened to and solutions to their questions are advanced from a most reasonable and liberal standpoint of view.&quot; Bhaktivinoda Asana provided its students with accommodation, training in self-discipling and intense spiritual practice, as well as systematic long-term education in various Vaishnava texts such as the &quot;Shrimad Bhagavatam&quot; and Vaishnava&quot; Vedanta&quot;. It would become a template for sixty-four Gaudiya Math centres in India and three abroad, in London (England), Berlin (Germany), and Rangoon (Burma), which Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati established during his lifetime.

Registered on 5 February 1919, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati&#x27;s missionary movement was initially called &quot;Vishva Vaishnava Raj Sabha&quot;, in the name of the society founded by Bhaktivinoda. However, it soon became eponymously known as the Gaudiya Math after the Calcutta branch and his weekly Bengali magazine &quot;Gaudiya&quot;. The Gaudiya Math rapidly gained a reputation as an outspoken voice on religious, philosophical and social issues via its wide range of periodical publications, targeting educated audiences in English, Bengali, Assamese, Odia, and Hindi. These publications included a daily Bengali newspaper &quot;Nadiya Prakash&quot;, a weekly magazine &quot;Gaudiya&quot;, and a monthly magazine in English and Sanskrit &quot;The Harmonist&quot; (&quot;Shri Sajjana-toshani&quot;). The intellectual and philosophical appeal of the Gaudiya Math outreach programs garnered particularly eager response in urban areas, where wealthy supporters started contributing generously towards the construction of new temples and large &quot;theistic exhibitions&quot; – public expositions on the Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy by means of displays and dioramas.

=== Caste and untouchability ===

The Gaudiya Math core leadership consisted mainly of educated Bengalis and eighteen &quot;sannyasis&quot; who were sent off to pioneer the movement in new places in India, and later, in Europe. Its growing &quot;ashrama&quot; residents hub, however, represented a wide cross-section of the Indian society, with disciples from both educated urban and simple rural milieus. Householder disciples and sympathizers supported the temples with funds, food, and volunteer labour. The Gaudiya Math centres paid serious attention to the individual discipline of their residents, including mandatory ascetic vows and daily practice of devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) centred on individual recitation (&quot;japa&quot;) and public singing (&quot;kirtan&quot;) of Krishna&#x27;s names, regular study of philosophical and devotional texts (&quot;svadhyaya&quot;), traditional worship of temple images of Krishna and Chaitanya (&quot;archana&quot;) as well as attendance at lectures and seminars (&quot;shravanam&quot;).

A deliberate disregard of social background as a criterion for religious eligibility marked a sharp departure in Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s movement from customary Hindu caste restrictions. Bhaktisiddhanta spelled out his views, which appeared to be modern yet were firmly rooted in the early &quot;bhakti &quot;literature of the Chaitanya school, in an essay called &quot;Gandhiji&#x27;s Ten Questions&quot; published in &quot;The Harmonist &quot;in January 1933. In the essay he replied to questions posed by Mahatma Gandhi, who in December 1932 challenged India&#x27;s leading orthodox Hindu organisations on the practice of untouchability. In his reply, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati defined untouchables as those inimical to the concept of serving God, rather than those hailing from the lowest social or hereditary background. He argued that Vishnu temples should be open to everyone, but particularly to those who possessed a favourable attitude toward the divine and were willing to undergo a process of spiritual training. He further stated that untouchability had a cultural and historical underpinning rather than a religious one, and as such, Gandhi&#x27;s questions referred to a secular issue, not a religious one. As an alternative to the secular concept of &quot;Hindu&quot; and its social implications, Bhaktisiddhanta suggested an ethic of &quot;unconditional reverence for all entities by the realization and exclusive practice of the whole-time service of the Absolute&quot;. By this he stressed that the practice of &quot;bhakti&quot;, or divine love, and service to God as the supreme person demanded moral responsibility towards all other beings who, according to Chaitanya school, are eternal metaphysical entities – minute in relation to God but qualitatively equal to one another.

=== True love and renunciation ===

While emphasising the innate spirituality of all beings, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati strongly objected to representations of the sacred love between Radha and Krishna, described in the &quot;Bhagavatam &quot;and other Vaishnava texts, as erotic, which permeated the popular culture of Bengal in art, theatre, and folk songs. He stated that the sacred concept of love cherished by Gaudiya Vaishnavas was being profaned due to a lacking in philosophical understanding and proper guidance. He repeatedly critiqued such popular communities in Bengal as the &quot;sahajiyas, &quot;who presented their sexual practices as a path of Krishna &quot;bhakti, &quot;denouncing them as pseudo-Vaishnavas. Bhaktisiddhanta argued instead that the path to spiritual growth was not through what he described as sensual gratification, but through the practice of chastity, humility, and service.

At the same time, Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s approach to the material world was far from being escapist. Rather than shunning all connections with it, he adopted the principle of &quot;yukta-vairagya &quot;– a term coined by Chaitanya&#x27;s associate Rupa Gosvami meaning &quot;renunciation by engagement&quot;. This implied using any required object in the service of the divine by renouncing the propensity to enjoy it. On the basis of this principle, Bhaktisiddhanta used the latest advancements in technology, institutional building, communication, printing, and transportation, while striving to carefully keep intact the theological core of his personalist tradition. This hermeneutical dynamism and spirit of adaptation employed by Bhaktisiddhanta became an important element in the growth of the Gaudiya Math and facilitated its future global expansion.

=== The Gaudiya Math in Europe ===
Back in 1882, Bhaktivinoda stated in his &quot;Sajjana-toshani&quot; magazine a coveted vision of universalism and brotherhood across borders and races:

Bhaktivinoda did not stop short of making practical efforts to implement his vision. In 1896 he published and sent to several addressees in the West a book entitled that portrayed Chaitanya Mahaprabhu as a champion of &quot;universal brotherhood and intellectual freedom&quot;:

Bhaktivinoda adapted his message to the Western mind by borrowing popular Christian expressions such as &quot;universal fraternity&quot;, &quot;cultivation of the spirit&quot;, &quot;preach&quot;, and &quot;church&quot; and deliberately using them in a Hindu context. Copies of &quot;Shri Chaitanya, His Life and Precepts&quot; were sent to Western scholars across the British Empire, and landed, among others, in academic libraries at McGill University in Montreal, at the University of Sydney in Australia and at the Royal Asiatic Society of London. The book also made its way to prominent scholars such as Oxford Sanskritist Monier Monier-Williams and earned a favourable review in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot;.

Bhaktisiddhanta inherited the vision of spreading the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the West from his father Bhaktivinoda. The same inspiration was also bequeathed to Bhaktisiddhanta as the last will of his mother Bhagavati Devi prior to her death in 1920. Thus, from the early 1920s, Bhaktisiddhanta began to plan his mission to Europe.

In 1927, he launched a periodical in English and requested British officers to patronise his movement, which they gradually did, culminating in an official visit by the Governor of Bengal John Anderson to Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s headquarters in Mayapur on 15 January 1935. Bhaktisiddhanta is reported to have kept a map of London, pondering on ways of expanding his mission to new frontiers in the West. After a long and careful preparation, on 20 July 1933 three of Bhaktisiddhanta&#x27;s senior disciples including Swami Bhakti Hridaya Bon arrived in London. As a result of their mission abroad, on 24 April 1934, Lord Zetland, the British secretary of state for India, inaugurated the Gaudiya Mission Society in London and became its president. This was followed a few months later by a center established by Swami Bon in Berlin, Germany, from where he journeyed to lecture and meet the German academic and political elite. On 18 September 1935, the Gaudiya Math and Calcutta dignitaries offered a reception to two German converts, Ernst Georg Schulze and Baron H.E. von Queth, who arrived along with Swami Bon.
Bhaktisiddhanta maintained that, if explained properly, the philosophy and practice of Vaishnavism would speak for itself, gradually attracting intelligent and sensible people. However, despite considerable financial investments and efforts, the success of the Gaudiya Mission in the West remained limited to just a few people interested to seriously practice Vaishnavism. The importance of the Western venture prompted Bhaktisiddhanta to make the Western mission the main theme of his final address at a gathering of thousands of his disciples and followers at Champahati, Bengal, in 1936. In his address Bhaktisiddhanta restated the urgency and importance of presenting Chaitanya&#x27;s teachings in the Western countries, despite all social, cultural, and financial challenges, and told, &quot;I have a prediction. However long in the future it may be, one of my disciples will cross the ocean and bring back the entire world&quot;.

The deep international tensions globally building up in the late 1930s made Bhaktisiddhanta more certain that solutions to the incumbent problems of humanity were to be found primarily in the realm of religion and spirituality, and not solely in the fields of science, economy, and politics. On 3 December 1936, Bhaktisiddhanta answered a letter from his disciple Bhaktivedanta, who had asked how he could best serve his guru&#x27;s mission:

Shortly thereafter, on 1 January 1937, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati passed away at the age of 63.

== Crises of succession ==
The Gaudiya Math mission, inspired by Bhaktivinoda and developed by Bhaktisiddhanta, emerged as one of &quot;the most powerful reformist movements&quot; of colonial Bengal in the 19th and early 20th century. In mission and scope it parallelled the efforts of Swami Vivekananda and the Ramakrishna Mission, and challenged modern &quot;advaita&quot; Vedanta spirituality that had come to dominate the religious sensibilities of the Hindu middle class in India and the way Hinduism was understood in the West. Rather than appointing a successor, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati instead instructed his leading disciples to jointly run the mission in his absence, and expected that qualified leaders would emerge naturally &quot;on the strength of their personal merit&quot;. However, weeks after his departure a crisis of succession broke out, resulting in factions and legal infighting. The united mission was first split into two separate institutions and later on was fragmented into several smaller groups that began functioning and furthering the movement independently.

The Gaudiya Math movement, however, slowly regained its strength. In 1966 Abhay Caranararavinda De, now A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, founded in New York City the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). Modeled after the original Gaudiya Math and emulating its emphasis on dynamic mission and spiritual practice, ISKCON soon popularised Chaitanya Vaishnavism on a global scale, becoming the world&#x27;s leading proponent of Hindu &quot;bhakti&quot; personalism.

Today Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati&#x27;s Gaudiya Math movement includes more than forty independent institutions, hundreds of centres and more than 500,000 practitioners globally, with scholars acknowledging its public profile as far exceeding the size of its constituency.

== Recognition ==

In November 2023, UNESCO included the 150th birth anniversary of &quot;Srimad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Goswami Prabhupada, philosopher, social reformer and eminent spiritual leader (1874-1937)&quot; in its list of celebration of anniversaries with which UNESCO could be associated in 2024-2025. The inclusion was proposed by India with the support of Cuba, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Thailand and Vietnam.

On February 8, 2024, a commemorative stamp and coin in his honor by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a commemorative event for the 150th birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati at the Bharat Mandapam.

On March 29th, 2024, the Bhaktivedanta Research Center organized an exhibition at the ISKCON TOVP Temple in Mayapur in honor of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupada&#x27;s sesquicentennial celebration. This exhibition commemorates his life, spanning from his birth to his passing, and emphasizes his role as a prominent figure in Gaudiya Vaishnavism and preaching globally. It presents his significant contributions to modern Gaudiya Vaishnavism, his extensive travels, the installation of Mahaprabhu&#x27;s footprints, spiritual exhibitions across India, and his prolific writing and publishing endeavors. The exhibition includes original publications, rare photos, newspaper articles, handwritten manuscripts, and other historical documents.

<text>Ardabil province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Ardabil. The province is in the northwest of the country, in Region 3, bordering the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian provinces of East Azerbaijan, Zanjan, and Gilan. Spanning an area of 18,011 km2, and established in 1993, Ardabil was carved out of the eastern part of East Azerbaijan Province.

==History==

The natural features of the province of Ardabil are mentioned in the Avesta, according to which Zoroaster was born by the river Aras and wrote his book in the Sabalan Mountains. During the Muslim conquest of Iran, Ardabil was the largest city in Azarbaijan, and remained so until the Mongol invasion period.

Shah Ismail I started his campaign to nationalize Iran&#x27;s government and land from here, but consequently announced Tabriz as his capital in 1500 CE. Yet Ardabil remained an important city both politically and economically until modern times.

<text>Bushehr province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the south of the country, with a long coastline on the Persian Gulf. Its capital is the city of Bushehr.

The province was made a part of Region 2 upon the division of the provinces into five regions, solely for coordination and development purposes, on 22 June 2014.

==History==

The Greeks knew of Bushehr by Mezambria during the battles of Nearchus. A French excavating team however in 1913 determined the origin of Bushehr to date back to the Elamite Empire. A city there, known as Lyan, contained a temple that was designed to protect the compound from naval attacks. Its remains can still be seen today 10 kilometers south of the present city of Bushehr.

Marco Polo describes this region as part of the Persian province of Shabankareh. It contains the village of Saba, Iran where are buried (he was told) the three Magi which visited the Christ Child.

A key turning point in the history of Bor event of significance is known to have taken place in this region until the arrival of the European colonialists in the 16th century.

The Portuguese, invaded the city of Bushehr in 1506 and remained there until Shah Abbas Safavi defeated and liberated the Persian Gulf region of their presence. By 1734, Bushehr had once again risen to prominence due to Nader Shah of the Afsharid dynasty, and his military policies in The Persian Gulf.

Bushehr was selected by Nader to be the central base of Nader&#x27;s Naval fleet in the Persian Gulf. He thus changed the name of the city to &quot;Bandar e Naderiyeh&quot; (Nader&#x27;s Port). He hired an Englishman by the name of John Elton to help build his fleet. Dutch accounts report his naval fleet to have amounted to 8000-10000 personnel as well as several ship construction installations.

After Nader&#x27;s death, the Dutch continued to have good commercial relations in Bushehr, until the British made their debut in Bushehr in 1763 by a contract they signed with Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty. By then, the city of Bushehr had become Iran&#x27;s major port city in the Persian Gulf. By the Qajar era, Britain, Norway, Russia, Italy, France, Germany, and the Ottomans had diplomatic and commercial offices there, with Britain steadily gaining a foothold in the area. Close to 100 British ships are reported to have docked at the port city every year during the Qajar era.

===2013 Bushehr earthquake===
A strong earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale struck the town of Shonbeh and villages of Shonbeh and Tasuj District in Dashti County of Bushehr province on 9 April 2013, killing at least 37 people.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
A vast majority of the population speak Persian (mostly the Fars dialect) as first language with a minority of Arabic speakers. 

During the Safavid period, some people from the Kurdish Zanganeh tribe moved from Kermanshah to the villages between Ahram and Borazjan and formed a local government in this area, and from that time until the beginning of Qajar, this part of Bushehr province was called Zanganeh bloc. The Zangeneh tribe have largely been assimilated and have adopted the local Persian and Turkic languages and are city-dwellers.

=== Religion ===
The vast majority of Bushehr&#x27;s population are Shia Muslims, with a minority of Sunnis comprising 8.5% of the province&#x27;s population.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 886,490 in 188,762 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,032,949 people in 246,742 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,163,400 inhabitants in 321,826 households.

==Bushehr today==
Aside from the revived port city of Bushehr, which is the second main naval port of Iran after Bandar Abbas, Bushehr also has come back recently in the spotlight for three main reasons:

===Kharg Island (Khark Island)===
During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran&#x27;s major petroleum exporting ports in Khuzestan sustained damages so severe that a second port in Kharg Island was selected to carry on the major responsibility of Iran&#x27;s petroleum exports, though even Kharg was not immune from Iraqi air raids.

===Bushehr Nuclear Reactor===

The Bushehr Light water PWR Nuclear Reactor, designed by Siemens AG, built by the Russians, is Iran&#x27;s first Nuclear Power Plant reactor.

===The industrial corridor of Asaluyeh===
As many as 70,000 foreign engineers and technicians are currently working in this industrial zone 270 kilometers south of the provincial capital. This zone is where the nearby famous &quot;South Pars Gas field&quot; is located, where Iran has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure. The South Pars Gas field is the world&#x27;s largest natural gas field.

The Asaluyeh industrial zone is deemed so lucrative that even American companies such as American Allied International Corp and Halliburton have bypassed American sanctions to become somehow involved in the zone.American Allied International Corporation – Assalouyeh

<text>The Eyak are an Alaska Native people historically located on the Copper River Delta and near the town of Cordova, Alaska. They are Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast. Today, Eyak people live in Cordova, Yakutat, across Alaska, and the U.S. 

Many Eyak descendants do not qualify to be tribal members in the Native Village of Eyak, a federally recognized Alaska Native tribe which was established through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971. This is due to the enrollment qualifications that extend tribal citizenship only to those who reside in the town of Cordova for the majority of the year.

== Name ==
Their Eyak name is ʔi·ya·ɢdəlahɢəyu·, which translates literally to &quot;inhabitants of Eyak Village at Mile 6&quot;)

The now-common name &quot;Eyak&quot; for both the ethnic group and its language is an exonym and comes from the Sugt&#x27;stun (Alutiit&#x27;stun) dialect of Chugach Sugpiaq, a group of Sugpiaq (&quot;real people,&quot; better known as Alutiiq) for an Eyak village as Igya&#x27;aq&#x27; at the mouth of the Eyak River.

The Eyak refer to themselves as DAXunhyuu (&quot;the people&quot;) and the present-day Eyak Native Village as IiyaaGdaad&#x27; (&quot;at Eyak Native Village&quot;) – but the now officially recognized tribe as IiyaaGdAlahGAyuu (&quot;People from Eyak Native Village&quot;), as the tribe consists of descendants of Chugach Sugpiaq, Eyak, and Tlingit.

==Territory==
Historical Eyak territory reached from present-day Cordova east to the Martin River and north to Miles Glacier.

There were four main villages:
*Alaganik, near Mile 21 of the present-day Copper River Highway
*Eyak, located near Mile 5.5
*unnamed, 800 yards south of Eyak
*Orca, located within present-day Cordova
In addition to these villages the Eyak would seasonally occupy fish camps at Point Whitshed and Mountain Slough.

==History==
The Eyak initially moved out of the interior down the Copper River to the coast. There they harvested the rich salmon fishing grounds. When the Russians arrived they recognized the Eyak as a distinct culture and described their territory on their maps. They also traded with the Eyak and sent them missionaries. Because of their small population, they were often raided and their territory boundaries were under pressure from the Chugach to the west. The Tlingit on the east side, had better relations with the Eyak leading to intermarriage and the assimilation of most Eyak. The Eyak&#x27;s territorial boundary was pushed further contributing to the Eyak&#x27;s decline. When the Americans arrived they opened canneries and competed with the Eyak for salmon. The integration and novel diseases which were introduced by non-Native settlers led to the further decline of the Eyak.

As populations decreased the remaining Eyak began to congregate near the village of Orca. In 1880 the population of the village of Alaganik was recorded at 117 and by 1890 it had declined to 48. In 1900 total population was estimated at 60. As more settlers arrived the last village became the town of Cordova. As of 1996, there were 120 partial Eyak descendants in the town. The last full-blood Eyak, Marie Smith Jones, died on January 21, 2008.

==Language==

The Eyak spoke a distinct language closely related to the Athabaskan languages. Pressure from neighboring ethnic groups and the spread of English resulted in a decline of the Eyak language. Marie Smith Jones (1918–2008) was the last native speaker. Michael Krauss was known first and foremost as an Eyak language specialist.

<doc id="448046" wikidata="Q156696" url="?curid=448046" title="Genista">
<text>Genista is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae, native to open habitats such as moorland and pasture in Europe and western Asia. They include species commonly called [[broom (shrub)|broom]], though the term may also refer to other genera, including &quot;Cytisus&quot; and &quot;Chamaecytisus&quot;. Brooms in other genera are sometimes considered synonymous with &quot;Genista&quot;: &quot;Echinospartum&quot;, &quot;Retama&quot;, &quot;Spartium&quot;, &quot;Stauracanthus&quot;, and &quot;Ulex&quot;.

==Description==
They are mainly deciduous shrubs and trees, often with brush-like foliage, often spiny to deter browsing, and masses of small, pea-like yellow blooms which are sometimes fragrant. Many of the species have flowers that open explosively when alighted on by an insect, the style flying through the upper seam of the keel and striking the underside of the insect, followed by a shower of pollen that coats the insect.

The name of the Plantagenet royal line, which reigned in England from 1154 to 1485, is derived from this genus, being a dialectal variation of &quot;planta genista&quot;.

Several species are widely cultivated for their often sweet-smelling, abundant blooms early in the season, though many are not fully hardy. The cultivar &#x27;Porlock&#x27; has received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Fars province (; ) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Shiraz.

Fars province has an area of 122,400 km2 and is located in Iran&#x27;s southwest, in Region 2. It neighbours the provinces of Bushehr to the west, Hormozgan to the south, Kerman and Yazd to the east, Isfahan to the north, and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad to the northwest.

==Etymology==
The Persian word &quot;Fârs&quot; (), derived from the earlier form &quot;Pârs&quot; (), which is in turn derived from &quot;&quot; (), the Old Persian name for the Persis region. The names &quot;Parsa&quot; and &quot;Persia&quot; originate from this region.

Fars is the historical homeland of the Persian people. It was the homeland of the Achaemenid and Sasanian Persian dynasties of Iran, who reigned on the throne by the time of the ancient Persian Empires. The ruins of the Achaemenid capitals Pasargadae and Persepolis, among others, demonstrate the ancient history of the region. Due to the historical importance of this region, the entire country has historically been also referred to as &quot;Persia&quot; in the West. Prior to caliphate rule, this region was known as &quot;Pars&quot;.

==History==
===Persis===

The ancient Persians were present in the region from about the 10th century BC, and became the rulers of the largest empire the world had yet seen under the Achaemenid dynasty which was established in the mid 6th century BC, at its peak stretching from Thrace-Macedonia, Bulgaria-Paeonia and Eastern Europe proper in the west, to the Indus Valley in its far east. The ruins of Persepolis and Pasargadae, two of the four capitals of the Achaemenid Empire, are located in Fars.

The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, incorporating most of their vast empire. Shortly after this the Seleucid Empire was established. However, it never extended its power in Fars beyond the main trade routes, and by the reign of Antiochus I or possibly later Persis emerged as an independent state that minted its own coins.

The Seleucid Empire was subsequently defeated by the Parthians in 238 BC, but by 205 BC, the Seleucid king Antiochus III had extended his authority into Persis and it ceased to be an independent state.

Babak was the ruler of a small town called Kheir. Babak&#x27;s efforts in gaining local power at the time escaped the attention of Artabanus IV, the Parthian Arsacid Emperor of the time. Babak and his eldest son Shapur I managed to expand their power over all of Persis.

The subsequent events are unclear. Following the death of Babak around 220, Ardashir who at the time was the governor of Darabgird, got involved in a power struggle of his own with his elder brother Shapur. The sources tell us that in 222, Shapur was killed when the roof of a building collapsed on him.

At this point, Ardashir moved his capital further to the south of Persis and founded a capital at Ardashir-Khwarrah (formerly Gur, modern day Firouzabad). After establishing his rule over Persis, Ardashir I rapidly extended the territory of his Sassanid Persian Empire, demanding fealty from the local princes of Fars, and gaining control over the neighboring provinces of Kerman, Isfahan, Susiana, and Mesene.

Artabanus marched a second time against Ardashir I in 224. Their armies clashed at Hormizdegan, where Artabanus IV was killed. Ardashir was crowned in 226 at Ctesiphon as the sole ruler of Persia, bringing the 400-year-old Parthian Empire to an end, and starting the virtually equally long rule of the Sassanian Empire, over an even larger territory, once again making Persia a leading power in the known world, only this time along with its arch-rival and successor to Persia&#x27;s earlier opponents (the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire); the Byzantine Empire.

The Sassanids ruled for 425 years, until the Muslim armies conquered the empire. Afterwards, the Persians started to convert to Islam, this making it much easier for the new Muslim empire to continue the expansion of Islam.

Persis then passed hand to hand through numerous dynasties, leaving behind numerous historical and ancient monuments; each of which has its own values as a world heritage, reflecting the history of the province, Iran, and West Asia. The ruins of Bishapur, Persepolis, and Firouzabad are all reminders of this. The Arab invaders brought about an end to centuries Zoroastrian political and cultural dominance over the region; supplanted as the faith of the ruling class in the 7th century by Islam, which and over the next 200 years gradually expanded to include a majority of the population.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
The main ethnic group in the province consists of Persians (including Larestani people and the Basseri), while Qashqai, Lurs, Arabs, Kurds, Georgians, and Circassians constitute minorities.

Due to the geographical characteristics of Fars and its proximity to the Persian Gulf, Fars has long been a residing area for various peoples and rulers of Iran. However, the tribes of Fars including, Mamasani Lurs, Khamseh and Kohkiluyeh have kept their native and unique cultures and lifestyles which constitute part of the cultural heritage of Iran attracting many tourists. Kurdish tribes include Uriad, Zangana, Chegini, Kordshuli and Kuruni.

Among the hundreds of thousands of Georgians and Circassians that were transplanted to Persia under Shah Abbas I, his predecessors, and successors, a certain amount of them were to guard the main caravan routes; many were settled around Āspās and other villages along the old Isfahan-Shiraz road. By now the vast majority Caucasians that were settled in Fars have lost their cultural, linguistic, and religious identity, having mostly been assimilated into the population.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 4,220,721 people in 1,014,690 households. The following census in 2011 counted 4,596,658 people in 1,250,135 households, of whom 67.6% were registered as urban dwellers (urban/suburbs), 32.1% villagers (small town/rural), and 0.3% nomad tribes. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 4,851,274 people in 1,443,027 households.

The average temperature of Shiraz is 16.8 °C, ranging between 4.7 °C and 29.2 °C.

The geographical and climatic variation of the province causes varieties of plants; consequently, variation of wildlife has been formed in the province. Additional to the native animals of the province, many kinds of birds migrate to the province every year. Many kinds of ducks, storks and swallows migrate to this province in an annual parade. The main native animals of the province are gazelle, deer, mountain wild goat, ram, ewe and many kinds of birds. In the past, like in Khuzestan Plain, the Persian lion had occurred here.

<doc id="448051" wikidata="Q2699268" url="?curid=448051" title="Retama">
<text>Retama (also known as rotem, ) is a genus of flowering bushes in the legume family, Fabaceae. It belongs to the broom tribe, Genisteae. &quot;Retama&quot; broom bushes are found natively in North Africa, the Levant and some parts of southern Europe. &quot;Retama raetam&quot; and &quot;Retama monosperma&quot; have white flowers, while &quot;Retama sphaerocarpa&quot; has yellow flowers. It remains an open question in taxonomy whether the members of the genus &quot;Retama&quot; should be incorporated into the genus &quot;Genista&quot; (see Genisteae).

The species contain cytisine, a toxic alkaloid.

In the Spanish language the name &quot;retama&quot; is commonly used for broom bushes in general, including the genus &quot;Retama&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Retama&quot; was erected in 1838 by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, the genus name being derived from Hebrew, from the Jewish Bible. Rafinesque noted that the genus had been included in other genera, including &quot;Spartium&quot;, &quot;Cytisus&quot; and &quot;Genista&quot;, but he regarded it as distinct.

The name &quot;Lygos&quot; was once used for &quot;Retama&quot;; it is now a rejected name (&quot;nomen rejiciendum&quot;) in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. Michel Adanson described and classified the genus referencing to the Greek plant &quot;lygos&quot; and to Pedanius Dioscorides. In the ancient Greek language, &quot;lygos&quot; (λύγος) was the name of the plant &quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot; (chaste tree) or willow or other plants with pliant twigs. The same word (in some cases Latinized as &quot;Lygus&quot;) was used in botany and zoology for various taxonomic groups as a component of names, e.g. &quot;Lygodysodea, Lygisyum, Lygistum, Lygodesmia&quot; etc.

&quot;Retama&quot; is traditionally placed in the tribe Genisteae, and in the subfamily Papilionoideae in the 2017 classification of the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae).

== Species ==
The number of species in the genus and their circumscription varies. , Plants of the World Online, based on the African Plant Database, accepted the following species:
*&quot;Retama dasycarpa&quot; 
*&quot;Retama monosperma&quot; 
*&quot;Retama raetam&quot; 
*&quot;Retama rhodorhizoides&quot; 
*&quot;Retama sphaerocarpa&quot; 

&quot;R. rhodorhizoides&quot; is included in &quot;R. monosperma&quot; by some sources, and has been identified as &quot;R. raetam&quot; by others. When recognized as a separate species, it is restricted to the Canary Islands.

== Cultural significance ==
&quot;Retama&quot; may be mentioned in the Bible, in I Kings 19:4, Psalms 120:4, and Job 30:4, under the name &quot;rotem&quot; (Heb. רוֹתֶם/רֹתֶם). According to multiple Jewish biblical commentators, &quot;Retama&quot; is used in the Bible as a symbol of slander, as, when burnt, its embers will remain hot long after they turn black. However, this translation is contested, with other commentators translating the word as &quot;juniper&quot;.

<text>Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Shahr-e Kord. The province lies in the southwest of the country, with an area of 16,332 square kilometers.

=== Languages ===
Bakhtiāri, which belongs to the Luri language of the Iranian language family, is the province&#x27;s main language. Bakhtiāri is primarily spoken in the valleys of the higher areas in the western half of the province. It is also spoken in the lower areas around Lordegān in the south, and by speakers who have moved into the cities in the north-east.
In the north-east quarter of the province, people in most cities and villages speak either Chārmahāli (also in the Southwestern branch of Iranian) or Chaharmahali Turkic. Chārmahāli is transitional between Bakhtiari and Persian varieties of Isfahan province, but more similar to the latter. Chārmahāli varieties spoken in cities include Dehkordi (in Shahr-e Kord), Ghafarrokhi (in Farrokh Shahr), Heysheguni (in Hafshejān), and Borujeni (in Borujen). There are also many other varieties of Chārmahāli spoken in rural areas. Most types of Turkic spoken in this province are similar to Qashqa’i of Fars province, but they are transitional to the Āzarbāyjāni (Azerbaijani) language of north-west Iran. The Chārmahāli and Turkic language areas overlap with one another, and in the foothills of the Zagros and in the larger cities, they intermingle with Bakhtiāri as well.

Tehrani-type Persian is now being taught by parents to children as a first language in some parts of the province, with the highest concentrations in the cities.This statistic is based on the population statistics of 2013

<text>The Mexican Cession () is the region in the modern-day Western United States that Mexico previously controlled, then ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. This region had not been part of the areas east of the Rio Grande that had been claimed by the Republic of Texas, which had been claiming independence since its Texas Revolution of 1836 and subsequent brief war for independence, followed afterwards a decade later by the American annexation and admitted statehood in 1845. It had not specified the southern and western boundary of the new state of Texas with New Mexico. Consisting of roughly , not including any Texas lands, the Mexican Cession was the third-largest acquisition of territory in US history, surpassed only by the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the later Alaska Purchase from Russia in 1867.

Most of the area had been considered the Mexican territory and province of Alta California (Upper California), while a southeastern strip on the river Rio Grande had been part of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, most of whose area and population were east of the Rio Grande on land that had been claimed by the new Republic of Texas since 1836, but never actually controlled or even approached (aside from the tragic Texan Santa Fe Expedition). Mexico controlled the territory later known as the Mexican Cession, with considerable local autonomy punctuated by several revolts and few troops sent from central Mexico and the capital of Mexico City in the period from 1821–1822 after the Mexican War of Independence from the Kingdom of Spain up through to 1846. Then, U.S. military forces sent by 11th President James K. Polk (served 1845–1849) in a boundary dispute invaded the northeastern corner of Mexico between the Rio Bravo and the Rio Grande by land, plus another American naval landing on the nearby Gulf of Mexico western coast, plus seized control further to the far west of California on the Pacific Ocean coast with the landing of a US naval squadron and two land expeditions across the continent from the east in Missouri and into the Mexican province of New Mexico at the outbreak of the Mexican–American War in 1846. 

The northern boundary of the territories ceded by Mexican to the US was at the 42nd parallel north of latitude was originally set by the Adams–Onís Treaty of arbitration and border settlement signed two decades before by the United States and the Kingdom of Spain in 1821 after a long dispute and was further ratified by the successor state of an independent republic in Mexico in 1831 in the Treaty of Limits between them then. The eastern boundary of the Mexican Cession was the former old Texas Republic claim of additional western lands from the time of their Revolution of 1836 set at the Rio Grande and extending north to the headwaters of the Rio Grande, not corresponding to Mexican territorial boundaries. The southern boundary was set by the war-ending peace Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which used and followed the original Mexican boundaries between Alta California (to the north) and Baja California (Lower California) and the Mexican state of Sonora (to the south).

Until the American Civil War (1861–1865), the question of whether future Western states formed out of the 1848 Mexican Cession lands would or would not permit the institution of slavery in the newly acquired territories was a major American political issue in the following decade of the 1850s leading up as one of the causes of the eventual conflict.

==Mexican–American War==

Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México were captured soon after the start of the war and the last resistance there was subdued in January 1847, but Mexico would not accept the loss of territory. Therefore, during 1847, troops from the United States invaded central Mexico and occupied the Mexican capital of Mexico City, but still no Mexican government was willing to ratify the transfer of the northern territories to the US. It was uncertain whether any treaty could be reached. There was even an All of Mexico Movement proposing complete annexation of Mexico among Eastern Democrats but opposed by Southerners like John C. Calhoun who wanted the additional territory for their crops but not the large population of central Mexico.

Eventually Nicholas Trist forged the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, explicitly redefining the border between Mexico and the United States in early 1848 after President Polk had already attempted to recall him from Mexico as a failure. Although Mexico did not overtly cede any land under the treaty, the redefined border had the effect of transferring Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the control of the United States. Equally important, the new border also acknowledged Mexico&#x27;s loss of Texas, both the core eastern portion and the western claims, neither of which had been formally recognized by Mexico until that time.

The US Senate approved the treaty, rejecting amendments from Jefferson Davis to also annex most of northeastern Mexico and from Daniel Webster to decline to take Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México. The United States paid $15 million ($482 million in 2016 dollars) for the damage caused by the war in Mexico&#x27;s territory and agreed to assume $3.25 million in debts to US citizens. 

The Mexican Cession as ordinarily understood (i.e. excluding lands claimed by Texas) amounted to , or 14.9% of the total area of the current United States. If the disputed western Texas claims are also included, that amounts to a total of . If all of Texas is included, since Mexico had not previously acknowledged the loss of any part of Texas, the total area ceded under this treaty comes to .

Considering the seizures, including all of Texas, Mexico lost 55% of its pre-1836 territory in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. For only 15 years, from 1821 (when Mexican independence was secured) to the Texan Revolt in 1836, the Mexican Cession (excluding Texas) formed approximately 42% of the country of Mexico. Prior to that, it had been a part of the Spanish colony of New Spain for three centuries.

==Subsequent organization and the North–South conflict==

Soon after the war started and long before negotiation of the new Mexico–United States border, the question of slavery in the territories to be acquired polarized the Northern and Southern United States in the bitterest sectional conflict up to this time, which lasted for a deadlock of four years during which the Second Party System broke up, Mormon pioneers settled Utah, the California Gold Rush settled California, and New Mexico under a federal military US government turned back Texas&#x27;s attempt to assert control over territory Texas claimed as far west as the Rio Grande. Eventually the Compromise of 1850 preserved the Union, but only for another decade. Proposals included:

* The Wilmot Proviso, which was created by Congressman David Wilmot, banning slavery in any new territory to be acquired from Mexico, not including Texas which had been annexed the previous year. Passed by the United States House of Representatives in August 1846 and February 1847 but not the Senate. Later an effort to attach the proviso to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo also failed.
* Failed amendments to the Wilmot Proviso by William W. Wick and then Stephen Douglas extending the Missouri Compromise line (36°30&#x27; parallel north) west to the Pacific, allowing slavery in most of present-day New Mexico and Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Southern California, as well as any other territories that might be acquired from Mexico. The line was again proposed by the Nashville Convention of June 1850.
* Popular sovereignty, developed by Lewis Cass and Douglas as the eventual Democratic Party position, letting each territory decide whether to allow slavery.
* William L. Yancey&#x27;s &quot;Alabama Platform,&quot; endorsed by the Alabama and Georgia legislatures and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia, called for no restrictions on slavery in the territories either by the federal government or by territorial governments before statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty, and federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws.
* General Zachary Taylor, who became the Whig candidate in 1848 and then President from March 1849 to July 1850, proposed after becoming President that the entire area become two free states, called California and New Mexico but much larger than the eventual ones. None of the area would be left as an unorganized or organized territory, avoiding the question of slavery in the territories.
* The Mormons&#x27; proposal for a State of Deseret seizing areas from portions of the Mexican Cession but excluding the largest populations in Northern California and central New Mexico was considered unlikely to succeed in Congress, but in 1849 President Taylor sent his agent John Wilson westward with a proposal to combine California and Deseret as a single state, decreasing the number of new free states and the erosion of Southern parity in the Senate, while legitimizing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
* Senator Thomas Hart Benton in December 1849 or January 1850: Texas&#x27;s western and northern boundaries would be the 102nd meridian west and 34th parallel north.
* Senator John Bell (with the assent of Texas) in February 1850: New Mexico would get all Texas land north of the 34th parallel north (including today&#x27;s Texas Panhandle), and the area to the south (including the southeastern part of today&#x27;s New Mexico) would be divided at the Colorado River (Texas) into two slave states, balancing the admission of California and New Mexico as free states.
* First draft of the compromise of 1850: Texas&#x27;s northwestern boundary would be a straight diagonal line from the Rio Grande north of El Paso to the Red River of the South at the 100th meridian west (the southwestern corner of today&#x27;s Oklahoma).

* The Compromise of 1850, proposed by Henry Clay in January 1850, guided to passage by Douglas over Northern Whig and Southern Democrat opposition, and enacted September 1850, admitted California as a free state including Southern California and organized Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory with slavery to be decided by popular sovereignty. Texas dropped its claim to the disputed northwestern areas in return for debt relief, and the areas were divided between the two new territories and unorganized territory. El Paso where Texas had successfully established county government was left in Texas. No southern territory dominated by Southerners (like the later short-lived Confederate Territory of Arizona) was created. Also, the slave trade was abolished in Washington, D.C. (but not slavery itself), and the Fugitive Slave Act was strengthened.

==Gadsden Purchase==
It quickly became apparent that the Mexican Cession did not include a feasible route for a transcontinental railroad connecting to a southern port. The topography of the New Mexico Territory included mountains that naturally directed any railroad extending from the southern Pacific coast northward, to Kansas City, St. Louis, or Chicago. Southerners, anxious for the business such a railroad would bring (and hoping to establish a slave state beachhead on the Pacific coast), agitated for the acquisition of railroad-friendly land at the expense of Mexico, thus bringing about the Gadsden Purchase of 1853.

<text>Hormozgan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Bandar Abbas.

The province is in the south of the country, in Iran&#x27;s Region 2. facing Oman, the United Arab Emirates and the Hormuz Straits. Its area is , The province has 14 islands in the Persian Gulf and of coastline.

== History ==

Although Hormozgan is known to have been settled during the Achaemenid era when Nearchus passed through the region, recorded history of the main port of Hormozgan (Bandar‑e Hormoz) begins with Ardashir I of Persia of the Sassanid empire.

The province is said to have been particularly prosperous between 241 BC and 211 BC, but grew even further in trade and commercial significance with the beginning of the Islamic era.

Marco Polo visited the port of Bandar Abbas in 1272 and 1293. He reported widespread trading in Persian jewelry, ivory and silk of Indochina, and pearls from Bahrain in the bazaars of the port of Hormuz.

In 1497 Europeans landed in the region for the first time, headed by Vasco da Gama. In 1508 the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque invaded the area with seven warships, under the pretext of protecting their interests from Egypt and Venice. The port of Hormuz at the time was considered strategically positioned for commercial interests in the Persian Gulf.

Ismail I who was trying to counter the Ottoman Empire to the west, was unable to save the port from the Portuguese, until Shah Abbas I was finally able to drive them out of the Persian Gulf with the aid of the British. The name of Bandar Abbas comes directly from the name of Shah Abbas I.

The British, meanwhile, were competing for influence in the region with Dutch colonialists, who invaded Qeshm Island and dispatched warships to Bandar Abbas during the final years of Shah Abbas&#x27; reign. The Persian government was unable to defend itself against this attack. However, with the souring of British and Dutch relations, military tensions grew in the region. The Dutch finally resorted to moving their base up to Kharg Island.
The Amir of Kharg, Mir Mahna Baloch and Mir Hammal Kalmati with Baloch army defeated the Europeans from Bander Abbas till Karachi, so with the Dutch and other forces at Kharg, the British were firmly in charge of the entire region. Soon Britain took control over the entire Persian Gulf via the British East India Company. The British adopted policy encouraging local autonomy throughout the Persian Gulf to in order to prevent a formidable unified force from threatening their establishments in the gulf.

The strategic importance of the Persian Gulf further increased after World War I with the discovery of oil in the region.

== Geography and climate ==
The province is primarily mountainous, consisting of the southern tip of the Zagros Range. The province experiences a very hot and humid climate, with temperatures sometimes exceeding 120 °F (49 °C) in summers. There is very little precipitation year-round.

== Hormozgan today ==

Hormozgan today has 11 ports, five national airports, and three international airports. The province has an active agriculture sector, ranking first in Iran in lime production and second in date production. 30% of Iran&#x27;s fishery produce comes from this province. Three major hydro dams serve the water needs of the province – Esteghlal Dam (i.e., Minab Dam, which supplies major part of consuming water of the Bandar Abbas), Jegin Dam, and Shemil Dam.

Germany has recently offered to build a bridge that would connect Qeshm island to the mainland, a formidable project.

Hormozgan has two free trade zones, one in Kish, the other on Qeshm island. Kish Island, situated in a free-trade zone, is home of the Iranian oil bourse (one of five exchanges of its kind in the world, and the only one explicitly not trading oil and derivatives in U.S. dollars).

<doc id="448067" wikidata="Q170041" url="?curid=448067" title="Golestan province">
<text>Golestan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran, located in the northeast of the country and southeast of the Caspian Sea. Its capital is the city of Gorgan, formerly called Esterabad until 1937. Golestan was split off from Mazandaran Province in 1997.

Golestan Province is bordering Turkmenistan to the north. One of the key border points between the two countries is Incheh Borun, which serves as a vital crossing point.

The province was made a part of Region 1 upon the division of the provinces into 5 regions, solely for coordination and development purposes, on 22 June 2014. Majority of its population are Sunni Muslims.

==Etymology==
Gulistan, Golestan, or Golastan translates to &quot;gul-&quot; meaning &quot;flower&quot; and &quot;-stan&quot; meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;region.&quot; Golestan, therefore, literally means &quot;land of flowers&quot; in Iranian languages (e.g., Persian, Kurdish, and Mazandarani). This is a common toponym in countries with Persian linguistic roots (see Gulistan).

The capital of Gorgan derives its name from a wider region known historically as &quot;Gorgân&quot; (), Middle Persian &quot;Gurgān&quot;, and Old Persian &quot;Varkāna&quot; (in the Behistun Inscription) meaning &quot;land of wolves&quot;. This is also the root of the Ancient Greek Ὑρκανία (&quot;Hyrkanía&quot;) and Latin &quot;Hyrcania&quot;. Wild wolves are still found in Golestan.

==History==

Human settlements in this area date back to 10,000 BC. Evidence of the ancient city of &quot;Jorjan&quot; can still be seen near the current city of Gonbad-e Kavus. It was an important city of Persia located on the Silk Road.

Under the Achaemenid Iran, it seems to have been administered as a sub-province of Parthia and is not named separately in the provincial lists of Darius and Xerxes. The Hyrcanians, however, under the leadership of Megapanus, are mentioned by Herodotus in his list of Xerxes&#x27; army during the invasion of Greece.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
In 2006, the Ministry of Education of Iran estimated the ethnic breakdown of the province to be:

* Turkmens: 34.20%
* Mazandaranis: 30.40%
* Sistanis &amp; Persians: 14.90%
* Baluchis: 10.90%
* Qizilbash: 7.30%
* Others (including Azeris, Kazakhs, Kurds, Armenians and Georgians): 2.3%

The Mazandaranis who inhabit the foothills to Shah Pasand were subsumed under the rubric &quot;Persian&quot; by these official statistics.

The Persians/Mazandaranis are considered by nearly all inhabitants of the province to be &quot;the old natives&quot; while all others are considered ethnic immigrants in the past.

Most Mazandaranis live in Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kordkuy, Bandar-e Gaz and Gonbad-e Kavus. They speak Mazanderani language.

The Turkmens reside in the north of the province, a plain called Turkmen Sahra. Since the 15th century, these formerly nomadic people have lived in this area, the main cities of which are Gonbad-e Kavus and Bandar Torkaman. Turkmens are Sunni Muslim. They form a sizable minority in cities such as Gorgan, Ali Abad, Kalaleh, and many eastern townships.

Azeris and the Qizilbash predate the Turkmen by centuries and have in time become completely Shia, and therefore, culturally associated with the Persians and other Shias.

The Sistani Persians and the Baluch are relatively recent arrivals and date back to the early 20th century. They are still arriving in the area in some numbers due to the lasting drought in their home areas of Sistan.

The people of Kordkuy are originally from the Kurdish areas of west Iran, Kermanshah and Kurdistan provinces. They belong to the Kord-rostami tribe and are also found in significant numbers in other cities like Gorgan and Bandare Gaz. Subtribes of the Kord-Rostami tribe are the Aghili and Sepanlou tribes. Moreover, the city of Maraveh Tappeh has a mixed population of Sunni Turkmens and Shia Kurds.

Other ethnic groups such as Kazakhs, Khorasani Kurds, Georgians, and Armenians also reside in this area, and have preserved their traditions and rituals.

A small minority of followers of the Baháʼí faith also live in Golestan (in Shahpasand).

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 1,593,055 in 379,354 households. The following census in 2011 showed an increase in population to 1,777,014 in 482,842 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,868,819 in 550,249 households.

===Administrative divisions===
The population history and structural changes of Golestan province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
According to the 2016 census, 1,015,774 people (over 54% of the population of Golestan province) live in the following cities:

==Culture==

The world&#x27;s tallest brick structure of its kind, the Gonbad-e Qabus tower, stands in this province.

==Climate and geography==

Golestan enjoys mild weather and a temperate climate most of the year. Geographically, it is divided into two sections: The plains, and the mountains of the Alborz range. In the eastern Alborz section, the direction of the mountains faces northeast and gradually decreases in height. The highest point of the province is &quot;Shavar&quot;, with a height of 3,945 meters. Two of the main rivers are the Gharasu and Gorganrud.

===Golestan National Park===
Golestan National Park in northern Iran is faced with the construction of a road through the forest, allegedly for the ease of traffic for the villagers and woodmen but at the expense of losing the only national park in Iran throughout which a range of different climates (humidity near the Caspian Sea and desert farther south) is spread.

Golestan National Park is Iran&#x27;s biggest national park which spans three provinces, Golestan, Mazandaran, and North Khorasan. Surprisingly, the authorities ignore repeated calls by experts to construct such roads around, instead of through, the forests, which in this way would no longer threaten animal and plant life.
==Colleges and universities==
* Golestan University
* Golestan University of Medical Sciences
* Gonbad Kavous University
* Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources
* Islamic Azad University of Azadshahr
* Islamic Azad University of Gorgan
* Islamic Azad University of Ali Abad katool
